"1",3,"AFG",28,1973,"﻿1.	It is a great pleasure for me to congratulate you. Sir  in the name of the delegation of Afghanistan  on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are extremely happy to see that this year the work of the General Assembly will be directed by an eminent son of Latin America  a continent whose people have always stood steadfastly at the forefront of the struggle for freedom and emancipation. Their long history has always demonstrated their determination to associate themselves with all progressive forces for building a world free of discrimination and injustice. Added to these qualities of Latin America  your personal qualifications and your vast experience and knowledge confirm us in our belief that under your guidance this session of the General Assembly will fulfil its great responsibilities.2.	I should like also to extend the sincere felicitations of the delegation of Afghanistan to Mr. Trepczynski of Poland  who skilfully guided the work of the General Assembly during its past session.3.	It is with great pleasure that we welcome the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic and greet them in the family of nations. We have traditional friendly ties and relations with the great German people. The history of our relationship is one of close co-operation in the economic and cultural spheres. We are confident that their joining the United Nations contributes to the strengthening of this Organization and peace and security in the world. They have already set an example in the field of international relations by their policy of peace and conciliation. In fact their admission will enhance this spirit in the world Organization.4.	I wish also to extend the congratulations of the Afghan delegation to the delegation of the Bahamas on its admission to membership in the United Nations. The admission of the Bahamas exemplifies a triumph of the will of people in the process of self-determination  a cause which Afghanistan has consistently supported in all parts of the world.5.	My Government welcomes the independence of Guinea- Bissau and declares that it has been recognized by Afghanistan. The sacrifices endured by the people of Guinea-Bissau in their protracted fight against colonialism have not been in vain. It is a source of gratification for us to witness today the great victory achieved by the liberation movements in Guinea-Bissau in establishing their independence and in freeing their country from alien domination. We wish the people of Guinea-Bissau success and prosperity.6.	On 17 July 1973  a great fundamental  institutional change took place in Afghanistan. The monarchy was abolished and a republic was proclaimed. The objectives of the newly created republic  supported by the genuine aspirations and democratic traditions of the Afghan people  are to promote the material and spiritual development of its people and to create a new society founded on justice and equality for all citizens without any discrimination  to allow all Afghans to participate fully and responsibly in the affairs of their country  and to curb the forces that have hitherto hampered the realization of these aspirations. The Republic aims at establishing a trustworthy security within the country that would permit sound and positive economic  social and cultural reforms  and pave the way for political  economic and cultural advancement. This requires the mobilization of all available resources and energy in all fields in the interest of the people.7.	Therefore  the new order has the full and sincere support of the majority of the people. As soon as a new constitution is promulgated  one that will reflect the true aspirations of the people and will extend democratic rights and liberties for the progress and evolution of society  elections will be held in accordance with its provisions  based on the principles of democracy.8.	To overcome economic backwardness  the Government is determined to take new measures as rapidly as possible to bring about basic changes  to create a national economy through effective planning based on modern science and technology and founded on the principle of full sovereignty over its natural resources. Great importance is attached to the encouragement of national industries  handicrafts and arts and to their protection against competitive foreign products.9.	Since ours is mainly an agricultural country  the new regime  as a major step in its programme to bring about fundamental progress  will institute land reforms in the interests of the majority of the people.10.	In the social field  the situation is in no way compatible with contemporary conditions in the world. Therefore  new programmes for social reform are contemplated  particularly for improving working conditions and the standard of living. A progressive and democratic labour law will be sought to secure the protection of the individual and social rights of industrial and agricultural workers. New and effective steps will be taken for creating equal opportunities for Afghan women in all spheres of life: economic  social  political and cultural.11.	The founder of the Republic  Mohammad Daoud  in his statement of 23 August 1973  said:""It is evident that economic and social progress are closely linked with fundamental reforms and the establishment of a true democracy. . . . Therefore  Afghanistan  keeping in view the changes in the world  should have a progressive domestic policy.""12.	In the international sphere  Afghanistan will remain a peaceful country and will consistently follow the policy of peaceful coexistence with countries pursuing different social systems  and will firmly continue its policy of non-alignment and non-participation in any blocs or military pacts. It will maintain its adherence to and respect for the Charter of the United Nations. It will seek the strengthening of amicable relations with all peace-loving countries in the economic  technical and cultural fields.13.	The new Government attaches the utmost importance to maintaining and creating relations based on the principles of justice  mutual respect and neighbourliness with countries with which we share the same region. The good neighbourly ties of friendship with our neighbour to the north  the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  are unfaltering. We have friendly and sincere relations with our other neighbour; the People's Republic of China. We have always had neighbourly relations with Iran. I sincerely reciprocate the friendly remarks of the Foreign Minister of Iran in his statement in connexion with the relations between our two countries. With regard to our relations with Pakistan  I must say that  regrettably  our political differences regarding the issue of Pakhtunistan and the restoration and respect of the inalienable rights of our Pakhtun and Baluchi brothers  remain unsolved.14.	The question of Pakhtunistan  which has emanated from a refusal of Pakistan to recognize the legitimate demands of over 7 million people separated by the military force of a colonial Power from their fatherland. Afghanistan  is a national issue. We shall seriously endeavour to find a peaceful and just solution of this problem. A just solution is one that would conform to the best interests of Afghanistan and Pakistan in bringing peace and progress to the entire region. We believe that any solution should be sought on the basis of the will of the people and on international justice.15.	We have strong traditional .bonds of friendship with India and Bangladesh. We are desirous of strengthening further these bonds in the interest of mutual co-operation and permanent peace in the region.16.	In the wider sphere of international relations  the Republic of Afghanistan will adhere to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and will continue its unfailing support of its aims and objectives.17.	We shall pursue our policy of political  economic and cultural co-operation with the third world. We are most desirous of following our policy of mutual respect and friendliness with all nations of the world  big or small  near or far  east or west  without discrimination against anyone.18.	The situation in the Middle East is a great source of concern to Afghanistan. The most strategic region of the world is still in a state of war. The resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly remain unheeded. All peace efforts to head off a conflict have virtually come to a standstill. The creeping paralysis of the mandatory resolutions of the Security Council — and not only with respect to the Middle East  but also concerning vital decisions taken on Rhodesia  the Portuguese colonies and the situation in South Africa — is eating away at the very foundations of the United Nations as the custodian of both the rule of law and the goal of peace. Peace efforts  particularly those made by the non-aligned nations  have been vetoed and the prestige of the United Nations is threatened even as a symbol of international morality.19.	The occupation of the Arab territories by Israel and the toleration of the acquisition of land by force does not imply the toleration of injustice to the Arabs alone  but threatens the very security of all small countries in all regions of the world. It is inconceivable to expect any peace in' the Middle East unless the Israeli forces are withdrawn from the occupied Arab territories.20.	It is true that nothing really effective in peace-keeping can be achieved without  the unanimity of the big Powers. But it is most difficult to understand the position of some big Powers that demur from implementing and enforcing the very decisions for which they have voted. The resolution on the Middle East unanimously adopted on 22 November 1967 [Security Council resolution 242 (1967)] is a classic case of this ambivalence.21.	Our position on the question of the Middle East and our full support of the Arab cause and the aspirations of the people of Palestine for the restoration of their undeniable rights has been made clear on all occasions and in all international gatherings.22.	At the last summit conference of non-aligned nations   we called for the strongest measures to be taken in connexion with the implementation of the Security Council resolution  including the restoration of the national rights of the Palestinian people as a basic prerequisite for the establishment of a lasting peace in the area. We emphasized the necessity of the individual and collective measures to be taken against Israel  not only by the non-aligned nations but by all Member States of the United Nations  in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Here  in this Assembly  we emphasize once again that the unanimous recommendations of the non-aligned nations should be endorsed by all Member States.23.	There is no need for us to explain at length the policy pursued by my Government with regard to the elimination of colonialism and the securing of the right of peoples everywhere to self-determination and independence. This policy is well known. We shall always remain at the vanguard of the struggle against alien domination and colonialism.24.	Colonialism comprises all forms of alien domination  and not only that which is referred to as Western colonialism. The classical form of Western colonialism is perhaps gradually drawing to an end  but  regrettably  the domination of certain peoples and territories  quite often by countries which themselves have suffered from colonial occupation  continues. This state of affairs creates tensions and causes concern and anxiety. The imperialistic designs of Western Powers during the heyday of their colonial advance created artificial frontiers without regard to the rights of the peoples.25.	These legacies of the colonial era persist in some regions  impeding the development of a better understanding among nations. Vestiges of Western colonialism should be terminated without the tensions that would hamper friendly relations among countries and peoples.26.	The apparent failure of the United Nations to implement its own resolutions concerning the elimination of the colonial administration of Portugal and to put an end to the inhuman and repressive policies of apartheid in South Africa  as well as to the illegal racist minority regime of Southern Rhodesia  can be construed only as a disturbing example of non-co-operation by certain countries with the United Nations  countries that are Members of this Organization.27.	My delegation reiterates its support for the right of the people of Angola and Mozambique  as we did in the case of Guinea-Bissau  to sell-determination and independence  and shares the view that the continuation of the policies of apartheid by the Government of South Africa and its extension to Namibia has now reached a point which can no longer be tolerated by the international community. We fully support the aspirations of the liberation movements in the defence and restoration of their undeniable rights.28.	A basic characteristic of the present international situation is a relaxation of power politics in some areas and persisting crises and manifestations of power politics in others. While we welcome the positive tendencies manifested in relations between certain big Powers  we cannot at all dismiss lightly the concern of the small countries of the world. Evidently there seems to be an inclination towards bypassing the United Nations  in which the small nations form the majority of the membership and represent the interests of the majority of the people of the world. From our point of view  detente  like peace  is indivisible.29.	We were very impressed by the statement of Mr. Walter Scheel  the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany  in which he said that ""universality also means universality of obligations"" [2119th meeting  para. 154] and that ""detente  is not meant to be exclusive..."" [ibid.  para. 157]. It is evident that peace will remain precarious without the full participation of all countries in all matters of world peace and security.30.	We have arrived at the right time to expect and urge the international community to direct its efforts towards complete disarmament. We welcome the success of the various stages of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. We wish to see the machinery of the United Nations' fully used in all matters of disarmament and to see this session of the General Assembly make a decision as to the date and venue of the World Disarmament Conference. We hope that the present session of the General Assembly will prohibit nuclear tests in all environments and pay special attention to the question of nuclear disarmament.31.	But we are no less concerned about the stockpiling of conventional arms and the flow of such arms to other regions. There is no doubt that the security of smaller —  particularly non-aligned — countries is threatened by conventional armaments. In our region the balance of power is already seriously threatened by important stockpiles of conventional weapons that can be acquired only by countries with privileged geographical or political positions  by countries which belong to a military alliance  or by countries which have acquired financial strength.32.	I had that situation in mind when I stated at the summit Conference of non-aligned countries in Algiers that the recent acquisition of enormous quantities of sophisticated conventional armaments is a matter of grave concern to us. The political declaration of the summit Conference of non-aligned nations noted this with concern. It noted: ""that the flow of conventional arms to non-nuclear States  which is a threat to the security of non-aligned countries and which gives rise to tension in some regions  is continuing"" [A/9330  p. 17]. And then the summit Conference demanded that an end be put to the flow of such armaments.33.	Referring to one of the items that has been proposed for discussion at this session  I should like to say that the delegation of the Republic of Afghanistan welcomes the item proposed by the Foreign Minister of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics during his statement in the general debate [2126th meeting  para. 131]. The item I am referring to is entitled: ""Reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries"" [item 102]. We note with satisfaction the timeliness of the Soviet Union's initiative and hope that it will be supported by all peace- loving and progressive countries and that meaningful measures will be taken in this regard by the General Assembly.34.	Regarding the economic situation  we shall take the opportunity to deal with most of the questions related to it when they come before the Second Committee. Here I shall mention only that the failure of the first United Nations Development Decade and the unsatisfactory application of the recommendations adopted at the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]  together with the disappointing results of the years that have elapsed since the coming into force of the Second United Nations Development Decade  means that the International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)] cannot be viewed without profound anxiety. We note with regret that the attitude of some of the developed countries has not in any way been conducive to an international economic order in compliance with the target set for the International Development Strategy. The burden of heavy external debts on the economies of developing countries is increasing while the flow of external assistance is decreasing in proportion to the growing needs of the developing countries. Meanwhile  the arms race  as I mentioned before  continues to absorb large sums of capital.35.	We support the very important decisions unanimously made in Algiers  with special emphasis on the essentiality of giving more consideration to the group of countries referred to as the least developed. The Conference of non-aligned nations adopted a resolution with respect to special measures in favour of these countries [see A/9330  p. 81]. In that resolution the Conference recommended that international economic action should be given top priority and that top priority should be given also to the urgent implementation of the programmes adopted by UNCTAD at its third session and by other international organizations  especially in the area of trade  and that efforts should be exerted towards formulating and implementing new measures in all fields. It also requested the speedy implementation of the various resolutions and decisions adopted by the United Nations and its related agencies  as well as the continued review of the implementation of the measures.36.	Another resolution was adopted which I would like particularly to mention  with respect to the special-measures related to the particular needs of land-locked developing countries [see A/9330  p. 77]. In that resolution it was recommended that a set of special provisions should be urgently considered and implemented in order to ensure the right of land-locked developing countries to free access to and from the sea  and to provide the international assistance necessary to remedy their special situations.37.	It is our hope that the subject of these resolutions will be given urgent attention and consideration at this session.38.	In conclusion  Mr. President  the Afghan delegation places itself at your disposal and at the disposal of all members of the Assembly for co-operation in the work ahead. We look forward to the realization of our wish for a successful twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly under your guidance."
"2",89,"ALB",28,1973,"﻿86.	Mr. President  on behalf of the People's Republic of Albania I should like first of all to express my warmest congratulations to Mr. Leopoldo Benites on his election to preside over this session of the General Assembly.87.	The events that have taken place in the course of the year that has just elapsed show that  basically  the positive changes that we witness today in the world are the result of the just struggle of peoples  which  despite the complexity of the problems created by imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism and other reactionary forces  is progressing irresistibly forward. The efforts of sovereign States to counter the policy of aggression and hegemony and the threats  pressures and blackmail practised against them have led to a continuing growth of their role in international relations in favour of the cause of freedom and independence  peace and social progress. The peoples of Indo-China have won important victories over the American aggressors and their lackeys. The Arab peoples are pursuing with determination their struggle against imperialist-Zionist aggression and the plots hatched against them. The liberation movements in Asia  Africa and Latin America are strengthening and are spreading to new areas. An ever- increasing number of countries on these continents are taking measures and co-ordinating their actions in the struggle for the defence of their independence  their sovereignty and their national interests against the rapacious designs of the imperialist Powers; and  in the first instance  I refer to the two super-Powers  which are seeking to place them under their trusteeship. The wave of anger and resistance against American imperialism and Soviet imperialism has mounted even higher. This development in the international situation is encouraging to peace-loving peoples and States and is increasing their confidence in the triumph of their just cause.88.	However  we feel that it would be rather unrealistic to overlook the obvious and not-so-obvious dangers which continue to threaten the freedom and independence of sovereign peoples and States and true peace and security. Here  in this very Assembly  efforts have been made to induce us to believe that at the present time the world is relieved of the threat of war  that relations among States are governed by a spirit of understanding  and that the prospects for peace are very encouraging. But the reality does not justify such an evaluation. In the world there still exist a good number of serious problems which are awaiting solution. In Viet-Nam  acts of war have not come to an end and there is no true peace. In Cambodia  aggression by American imperialism and its lackeys is continuing. In the Middle East  one finds a tense  explosive situation which is fraught with dangerous consequences. The Portuguese colonialists and the racist regimes of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia are unceasingly perpetrating barbarous crimes against many African territories. National and social oppression is being practised in grand style by the imperialist Powers and their instruments in many countries of the world. And  above all  nothing has changed in the essence and content of the aggressive policy and aims of the United States and the Soviet Union to bring about world hegemony. The two super-Powers are spreading their political  economic  cultural and military expansion to every corner of the globe.89.	For a long time there have been spreading certain concepts to the effect that peace and stability in the world depend in the first instance on relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and that it is on the American-Soviet balance that any world balance will rest. It is alleged that the two super-Powers  as the great and powerful States which they are  should assume a particular responsibility and role in international life and that  under this responsibility  they also have the right to act in full freedom wherever and with whomever they please. Such ideas are inadmissible. The time is long past when the great imperialist Powers decided the fate of the world and of peoples. Very often attempts have been made to frighten peoples by the force of the two super-Powers  by their atomic teeth  but these attempts have remained fruitless. Many facts testify to the fact that the super-Powers are only powerful in appearance  that they carry within them real weaknesses. They are in a decline and in a continuing state of disintegration. However  at the same time  the peace-loving peoples and countries are unceasingly and steadily growing and becoming stronger.90.	The policy of violence and aggression  oppression and exploitation which is practised by the United States and the Soviet Union  the armaments race and the continuing increase in their war budgets have created great difficulties both internally and externally for these Powers. In the United States the dollar crisis  inflation and unemployment  and  in the Soviet Union  continuing economic setbacks  the phenomena of disintegration and confusion in the political and social system  as well as the worsening of conflicts between nationalities  have now become chronic ills. The Watergate affair and other political scandals and the hardening of the methods of oppression and violence that have been displayed are just so many phenomena which testify to the basically reactionary nature and the continuing weakening of the system of the two superpowers.91.	At the present time both of them are trying to overcome their difficulties by casting part of the burden on others; in the first instance  on the countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America. The United States and the Soviet Union  through the credits they have granted and their alleged aid  the unequal trade deals and discrimination in respect of trade  investments  pillage of natural wealth  and by other neo-colonialist methods  are engaged in a frenetic course of economic aggression  seeking to ensure to themselves privileged positions and to enrich themselves at the expense of the developing countries  to sabotage their efforts at progress  to keep them in a state of dependence and thus to counteract the struggles which these countries are conducting in order to liquidate the after-effects of colonial domination  to put an end to the division of the world into rich countries and poor countries  into exploiter countries and exploited countries.92.	In recent times the two super-Powers have been intensifying their measures of constraint in order - to preserve their positions of hegemony and have been seeking to relieve themselves of some of these difficulties by shifting them to the backs of their partners and allies. The United States has submitted the draft of a new Atlantic charter or a declaration on the principles of the Atlantic Treaty as an effort to offset the attempts of the countries of Western Europe to strengthen themselves as a separate force  freed of American dependence. The Soviet Union  for its part  with the intention of halting the efforts of the countries of Eastern Europe to escape its control  has intensified its efforts in order to bring about as quickly as possible the complete political  economic and military integration of those countries within the framework of the Warsaw Pact and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and to monopolize in its own hands the direction of all foreign relations of those countries  in accordance with the imperialist theory of ""limited sovereignty"".93.	At the same time  the United States and the Soviet Union  in order to cope with the problems confronting them in their own zones of influence and to put into application their global strategy  have come to an understanding and are assisting each other. They are intensifying their collaboration in all areas and in all parts of the world.94.	None the less  deep-rooted contradictions divide those two imperialist Powers that aspire to world hegemony. In the efforts of those Powers to establish their domination throughout the world  those contradictions  sooner or later  will end by breaking out into bloody conflicts  and those conflicts will lead the world to destruction  suffering and privation even greater than those which it has known heretofore. It is because they think and are prepared for such confrontations that the two super-Powers do not want to disarm. Collaboration is not and never can be absolute in relations between imperialist Powers. Their agreements are temporary and their rivalries eternal.95.	The United States and the Soviet Union try to convince us that the world is embarked upon an ""era of peace"" and that we are witnessing the introduction of a new system of international relations and that the ""balance of terror"" has given way to the ""balance of security"". According to them  that has been made possible owing to the extension of relations  the atmosphere of understanding and the agreements concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union  which will prove to be the guarantors of peace and security in the world. In fostering such a spirit of demobilization and compromise  the two super-Powers are seeking to create in peoples a pacifist psychosis and dangerous illusions to compel them  allegedly in the name of ""peaceful coexistence"" and the ""settlement of disputes by means of negotiations""  to make concessions and renounce the struggle to defend their national interests.96.	But no one allows himself to be taken in by this Soviet-American demagogy. The peace which the United States and the Soviet Union are extolling is illusory; behind their verbiage about peace are concealed their dangerous plans directed against sovereign peoples and countries  and their plans to repress and stifle any revolt or any resistance against them and any progressive and national liberation movement.97.	One is then entitled to ask oneself  How can one believe that peace and security are being strengthened when the two super-Powers are pursuing their relentless arms race  when they are unceasingly and steadily swelling their military budgets and are manufacturing new  more perfect weapons of mass destruction? Since people claim that war is remote  then why does anyone wish to organize those threatening military manoeuvres  and why do the United States and Soviet navies roam the seas in every direction? And why do they brandish all those weapons  and why are those war preparations being made?98.	Considering things as they are  we cannot fail to bring out the fact that the freedom and independence of sovereign countries  general peace and security  are increasingly threatened by the hegemonistic expansionist policy of the two imperialisms which are the most dangerous of our era  American imperialism and Soviet social-imperialism  and that there is actually no real international detente in the world. As has been said by the well-loved leader of the Albanian people  Enver Hoxha  arid I quote:""Even if actually there is a certain degree of detente  that is true only as it applies between the imperialist super-Powers. But there is not and there will be no detente between them and us  between the peoples on the one hand and the imperialists and the social-imperialists on the other. For us it is abundantly clear that the imperialist-revisionist strategy  designed to stifle struggles and revolutionary movements as well as any resistance to their hegemony  to destroy and repress any force  any State or party which opposes the domination of the super-Powers  has remained unchanged. Only the tactics have changed and the means used  which have been multiplied in number and have been perfected"".The detente that we are witnessing between the United States and the Soviet Union  which is accompanied by an accentuation of co-operation  compromise and bargaining between them  far from diminishing the danger of war and armed conflict  on the contrary enables the two superpowers to increase their pressures vis-à-vis the small independent countries  to intensify their efforts to intervene in the domestic affairs of peoples and sovereign countries  and creates dangerous situations and new hotbeds of tension on all continents.99.	Fresh proof of this is to be found in the recent summit meeting of the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union. The agreements reached in the course of that meeting  as well as all the ultra-chauvinistic Nixonian or Brezhnevian concepts and doctrines which the two superpowers seek to propagate  are designed to legitimize their arbitrary acts  their arrogance and their diktats in international relations. They want to arrogate to themselves the attributes of a world super-Government and to become the arbiters and the masters of all international life  whereas sovereign peoples and countries would see themselves denied the right to participate on a footing of equality in the solution of problems of the hour and questions which  directly or indirectly  affect their vital interests.100.	In particular such an attitude finds its expression in summary form in the Soviet-American agreement on what is called the prevention of nuclear warfare.  Under the fallacious pretext that it is appropriate to take measures to ward off the threat of a nuclear war and prevent all forms of military confrontation  the two super-Powers are actually trying  through this agreement  to make sacrosanct at the present time in legal terms their right to intervene jointly at a time and a place they consider appropriate and to define the terms of this intervention. They are thus envisaging playing together the role of international gendarme.101.	The Soviet-American agreements which have already been concluded  like those which will be concluded in the framework of the so-called SALT negotiations-the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks-do not in any way set aside the danger of nuclear conflict and guarantee in no way that the considerable stockpiles of nuclear and strategic weapons will not be used against other countries. Through those agreements the United States and the Soviet Union do not intend to touch their nuclear strike-force  or to contribute to complete and general disarmament. They propose only to set up a balance which is acceptable to them  to preserve their nuclear monopoly and  above all  to impose on other States a whole series of restrictions in order to prevent any strengthening of their national defence potential and to compel them to place themselves under the American or Soviet atomic umbrella.102.	If the United States and the Soviet Union were sincerely interested in warding off the danger of a nuclear war  in dispelling the danger and threat of the use of atomic weapons  they should have accepted the clear and constructive proposals put forward for many long years now by the People's Republic of China. The commitment never to be the first to use nuclear weapons against other countries and the permanent prohibition of the manufacture and use of these weapons  together with the destruction of existing stockpiles thereof  would constitute the only specific steps towards disarmament and would create real guarantees for the elimination of the threat of a nuclear war. We believe that  so long as the two super-Powers continue to amass and steadily improve their nuclear armaments  together with those of other types  and so long as they use them as a means of exerting pressure and practising blackmail  countries have the unquestionable and legitimate right to take all the measures they deem appropriate and necessary for their defence.103.	The People's Republic of Albania  as a peace-loving European country  is interested in the just solution of the problems that concern the peoples of Europe and of the world. Albania has on numerous occasions clearly set forth its point of view on these problems  in particular with respect to European security.104.	Guaranteeing the peace and security of Europe is an ardent and legitimate wish of the peoples of Europe. After two world wars that were particularly devastating to Europe  that continent should have been able to achieve its own stability and equilibrium. The great and historic victory over fascism aroused great hopes and created good reason to assume that a lasting peace would be brought to Europe and that true security would be achieved. But although 28 years have gone by since the day of victory  the peoples of Europe have not seen their aspirations realized.105.	The first to sabotage the establishment of true European security was the United States  which  taking advantage of the difficult time through which the countries of Western Europe were going  weakened as they were and seriously devastated by the war  succeeded in securing for itself privileged political  economic and military positions in those countries. In order to safeguard its imperialist interests and transform Western Europe into a base for attacking the socialist countries  the United States set up the aggressive North Atlantic Alliance and armed the Federal Republic of Germany and turned it into a great revanchist Power. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] became an organ for the domination of Western Europe by the United States. Thus for Europe there emerged the danger of new wars  and for the countries members of NATO the danger of losing their independence. One of the eminent statesmen of modern France  Charles de Gaulle  was well aware of the danger for the countries of Western Europe  particularly France  inherent in their integration into NATO and in due course he took steps to get the American troops out of France and to withdraw his own country from the military organization of that bloc.106.	The aggressive aims and activities of NATO  the rebirth of West German revanchism and the accession of the Federal Republic of Germany to the North Atlantic Treaty compelled the Soviet Union and the socialist countries to envisage the measures necessary for guaranteeing their security and to create the Warsaw Pact as a defensive alliance. For a certain time  that Pact served to contain within bounds the aims of the United States and NATO; but when the leaders of the Soviet Union abandoned the just anti-imperialist policy that had been followed in the post-war years under the leadership of Stalin  the Warsaw Pact  too  was transformed into an aggressive alliance  and the countries and peoples of Europe found themselves confronted with a fresh danger.107.	Moreover  by not concluding a peace treaty with Germany  a treaty that should have been completed with the participation of all the countries that had contributed to the defeat of nazism  one of the fundamental reasons for the lack of balance in Europe was allowed to remain. The conclusion of that treaty was sabotaged first by the United States and later by the two super-Powers working together. The American imperialists did everything possible to bring West Germany out of the state of isolation in which it found itself as a conquered -nation  and they busied themselves in compelling it to follow a line that served the purposes of German revanchism within the framework of American strategy. At the present time  with the establishment of Soviet-West German co-operation  new conditions have been created enabling the Federal Republic of Germany to emerge as the greatest political  economic and military force in Western Europe and to affirm itself as the principal partner of the two super-Powers. Thus there have been created new ties  new imperialist alliances and a new threat to peace and security in Europe.108.	Such a state of affairs could not but appal the peoples of Europe  could not fail to awaken concern and arouse opposition among them. The fact is that a great many of the allies of the two super-Powers  especially those of Western Europe  no longer wish to see imposed upon them attitudes and objectives contrary to their interests. However  we do find in Western Europe one State which has traditionally followed a ""balancing"" policy. Although that policy has notoriously not brought any benefit to that State or to its partners  it continues to pursue that policy at the present juncture  thus helping the super-Powers and creating a favourable ground for them to manoeuvre in such fashion as to enable them to dictate their will with regard to European questions.109.	The achievement of European security certainly is a lofty objective  one for which all European countries should strive; but the road for reaching that objective cannot be that recommended by the two super-Powers. The events that have taken place in Europe  and particularly the preparatory consultations at Helsinki  together with the first phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe itself  have fully confirmed the view that the conditions necessary for convening an intra-European conference and for the establishment of genuine peace and security have not been created. These facts have served to dash the hope that such meetings might compel the two super-Powers to respect the rights of the sovereign countries of Europe. What took place at those meetings and the results achieved have confirmed the view of the Government of the People's Republic of Albania as expressed particularly in its memorandum of 29 June 1973  where it was emphasized that""... the Soviet Union and the United States are attempting to channel the question of European security along lines that are dangerous for the interests of peace and of peoples  and that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  as a product of Soviet-American collusion  will serve the two super-Powers  and that it will not be able to escape from their control and their manipulations or go beyond the framework of the discussions between the aggressive blocs over which they preside"".110.	The United States and the Soviet Union have used the Helsinki negotiations to conceal from the peoples of Europe where the danger to them really lies and who is threatening them  and to set themselves up as defenders and guarantors of the peace and security of Europe. They have missed no opportunity to exert pressure and engage in demagogic manoeuvres to force that Conference to turn its back on the present-day reality of Europe and set out on the path which they themselves have laid down in advance. And beyond all question  it is thus that they will continue to act in the future as well.111.	The Government of the People's Republic of Albania adheres to its viewpoint that an intra-European conference which does not deal with fundamental problems that concern the peoples and the States of Europe is not in a position to create the conditions which would make it possible to prevent or repel armed aggression. It cannot serve to bring about true peace and security on the continent. On the contrary  it serves only to increase insecurity in Europe and to create new dangers for European States  and enables the two super-Powers to draw political consequences from the situation. How can anyone talk about the establishment of lasting peace and the creation of an atmosphere of understanding and collaboration on the continent when the United States and the Soviet Union are intensifying their policy of hegemony  and are maintaining and strengthening aggressive blocs of NATO and the Warsaw Pact  and when they maintain their bases and their troops on the territory of several European countries? The United States and the Soviet Union are organizing the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe not by any means to contribute to the realization of the lofty aspirations of the peoples and countries of Europe who love freedom  but rather to preserve their zones of influence and to create in Europe a situation of relative tranquillity in order to enable them to spread their activities to other zones where their interests require their presence.112.	This conviction is even strengthened by the fact that  concomitantly with the Conference on ""European security""  there was convened another conference on the alleged reciprocal reduction of military forces in Europe. The purpose of the two super-Powers in this matter is to establish  within the framework of close negotiations between one bloc and another  a balance of their troops and their respective weapons in Europe and to weaken the defensive capacity of the European countries. At the same time we must see in this manoeuvre a farce staged by the United States and the Soviet Union to allay the anger which the European peoples feel at the presence of their troops  to perpetuate the stationing of these troops and to sanction the permanent violation of the sovereignty of European States. Any symbolic reduction of these troops in Europe will not diminish or set aside the threat and the danger which the policy of the two super-Powers represents for European peace and security.113.	This reduction in no way reduces their military power in Europe and does not affect their superiority over other countries in view of the. continuing perfecting of their means of combat. The interests of peace and security for the countries and peoples of Europe in general  and in particular those who  so many years after the end of the Second World War  still see foreign troops on their own home soil  call not for the reduction but for the complete evacuation and withdrawal of these troops  and a withdrawal from Europe of all military installations by the United States and the Soviet Union and the wiping out of all unequal agreements which enable these troops to enter and leave when and how they wish.114.	The European peoples and countries cannot in any way feel themselves in a state of assurance just so long as tensions subsist in other parts of the world and just so long as the aggressive navies of the United States and the Soviet Union are cruising in the Mediterranean basin  with their action being openly directed against the freedom and independence of the peoples and countries of this region of the world  and just so long as the super-Powers try to convert the Mediterranean into a base for aggression against the countries of Europe and other continents.115.	The Mediterranean peoples and countries that aspire to see the Mediterranean free of foreign navies and bases are opposed to this policy of aggressive hegemony by the two super-Powers and call for a removal of the United States and the Soviet navies from this sea. We have never ceased to feel that this legitimate aspiration could be achieved if such concrete and effective measures were taken as would make impossible the subsequent presence of the aggressive navies of the United States and the Soviet Union in those waters; in other words  if all foreign military bases were dismantled and if we prevented the creation of new bases  if no facilitywas provided and no aid lent to the United States and the Soviet navies  and if those navies were refused the right to dock and to make visits to the ports of Mediterranean countries.116.	The situation created in Europe and in the Mediterranean cannot fail to command the attention of the peoples and countries of the Balkans  above all at a time when the great imperialist Powers are engaged in penetrating and spreading their influence in the Balkans. The Albanian Government has been and is still interested in seeing true peace and stability established in the Balkan peninsula  and it is convinced that this can be brought about  thanks to the efforts of the peoples of this region themselves  without entrusting to anyone else the defence and the guarantee of their interests. The ties of friendship and understanding between the peoples and countries of the Balkans  based on known principles which govern the relations between sovereign States and the policy of good-neighbourliness  should serve as a solid basis to achieve this end. It is necessary to oppose any effort by the superpowers or by anyone  whoever he may be  to speculate on the problems of this region of the world and to intervene in its domestic affairs  directly or through other means  as they are endeavouring to do now through the Conference on European Security and the Vienna negotiations  or as they would seek to do by taking advantage of another similar occasion if this possibility were opened to them.117.	The maintenance of a situation of ""no war  no peace"" in the Middle East testifies to the false nature of the allegations to the effect that throughout the world now we have witnessed a great positive change which will enable us to make progress towards solving the most burning problems of the hour  and that  as a result of the goodwill and concern of the two super-Powers  all of this will be brought about. It is with good reason that the peoples and States of the Arab world  victims of imperialist-Zionist aggression  while pursuing their struggle  demand that an end should be put to such a situation  that the vestiges of aggression should be wiped out as soon as possible and that all their rights that have been trampled' under foot should be fully restored. But these legitimate demands encounter the criminal opposition of Israel and the deeply hostile anti-Arab attitude of the two super-Powers. While the Israeli Zionists obstinately and arrogantly press their annexationist claims and while they intensify their acts of war and armed provocation against Egypt  Syria and other Arab States  the United States and the Soviet Union  in various forms  are supporting and encouraging Israel and exerting pressure on the Arab countries to bring them to make concessions and sacrifice their sovereign rights. They are hatching intrigues against Arab unity  creating internal and foreign difficulties for the Arab States and engaging in plots against them. The Soviet-American summit meeting this year and other events have shown more clearly than ever before that the two super-Powers are opposed to a just solution of the Middle East question and are seeking to preserve at any cost the status quo and their neo-colonialist interests in that part of the world. The Israeli plots and the plots of the two super-Powers  as well as their efforts to destroy the Palestine movement and to eradicate the Palestine problem completely  at the same time are directed against all the Arab nations because the Palestine people is fighting also for the common cause of the Arabs.118.	The Albanian Government and people have supported and will continue to support firmly our brother Arab peoples. They will vigorously support the Palestine people  which has made and is continuing to accept vast sacrifices to preserve its national existence and to reconquer its homeland  which has been seized from it. The Palestine people is carrying out a just and heroic struggle and nothing will cause it to bend  neither violence and plots  nor the diabolical slanders and outrageous labels which the Israeli- Zionists and their supporters try to apply to them. We firmly believe that it will continue the struggle until final victory and that it will never accept the fate that its enemies are seeking to prepare for it  to condemn it to live forever as a people of refugees  or to pile it up in a desert corner of a so-called Palestine State  or to place it under the power of any traitorous Arab sovereign.119.	The People's Republic of Albania demands that an end should be put as quickly as possible to the serious and ominous situation existing in the Middle East as the result of the pursuit of imperialist-Zionist aggression. The Israeli aggressors should unconditionally withdraw from all occupied Arab territories and cease all forms of provocations  acts of war and terrorism against the Arab countries. We should bar the way to any imperialist intervention in this part of the world and restore all the sovereign rights of the Palestine people.120.	In Indo-China  as a result of the fortunate development of the legendary struggle for their national independence which the heroic peoples of Viet-Nam  Laos and Cambodia have been carrying on for many years against the armed aggression of the United States  a new situation has been created. In January of this year the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam  was concluded. The withdrawal of the United States troops  which the United States had been compelled to agree to  constitutes a great victory for the people of Viet-Nam and a heavy political and military defeat for the American imperialists. This victory of the people of Viet-Nam has been hailed by all the peoples of the world  which are inspired and will always be inspired by its heroic struggle and its lofty spirit of sacrifice. Viet-Nam will go down in history as a great example of what can be accomplished by a people  no matter how small it might be  when it is determined to fight to the very end for its just cause.121.	At the present time the United States of America  without renouncing its aggressive aims in Viet-Nam and throughout Indo-China  is manoeuvring in every possible I way to maintain for ever its presence in South Viet-Nam and to prevent the people of Viet-Nam from achieving its supreme aspirations. It is systematically violating the Paris agreements on Viet-Nam; it is supporting and steadily arming the puppet regime of Saigon and it is inciting people to engage in new acts of war and provocations against the liberated zone of the Republic of South Viet-Nam. In fact it is pursuing its military commitment and its intervention in the domestic affairs of the people of Viet-Nam and the other peoples of Indo-China  and placing serious obstacles in the path of the establishment of true peace in Viet-Nam.122.	The interests of peace and stability in Viet-Nam and throughout Indo-China require that the United States andthe Saigon regime  which is under its orders  put an end once and for all  and without delay  to all the violations of the agreements on Viet-Nam  and that they strictly respect the commitments they have undertaken in accordance with these agreements  as is being done by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam  which is the only legal Government of South Viet-Nam. If the United States and the puppet regime of Saigon stubbornly persist in their designs of aggression  they will certainly experience new defeats which will be even more overwhelming. The people of Viet-Nam  which is continually standing vigil over the. defence of the victories that it has won  is determined to wage its just struggle to the very end  until it has won a complete triumph.123.	For more than three years the valiant Cambodian people has been involved in a heroic armed struggle for its national independence against the American imperialist aggressors and the traitorous clique of Lon Nol. Under the leadership of the United National Front of Cambodia  it has won overwhelming victories on the battlefield and it has become invincible. Neither the unprecedented intensification of the United States armed aggression and the barbarous air bombardments nor the efforts of the United States to ""Khmerize"" the war in Cambodia  nor the plots and political combinations which are worked out against it have succeeded in causing it to yield. The new victory which it has won by compelling the United States to cease its air bombardment over Cambodia is one more evidence of its determination and its invincibility. At present the initiative lies entirely in the hands of the Cambodian people and the armed liberation forces. The United States plans to transform Cambodia into a colony and to maintain in being the puppet regime of Phnom Penh are doomed to imminent and complete failure.124.	Despite all this  the United States has not given up its efforts to impose on the people of Cambodia the tricky solution of a ""cessation of fighting"" and ""peaceful settlement"" American-style. What it wants is to compel that people to renounce the complete liberation of the country and thus save the bankrupt clique of Phnom Penh  to compel the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia to share power with the traitors and  finally  to create in Cambodia a de facto division into two zones or two States  two Governments or two administrations. In this connexion  the United States enjoys the support of the Soviet Government  which  from the very outset  has maintained a hostile attitude towards the just struggle of the people of Cambodia. Refusing to recognize the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia  the Soviet Government has maintained and still maintains diplomatic relations with the puppets of Phnom Penh  thus taking a position against the just struggle of the people of Cambodia. The Soviet leaders  completely discredited by their attitude vis-à-vis the Cambodian problem  now claim with shameless cynicism to support the struggle of the liberation forces of Cambodia  and are seeking directly to intervene in the domestic affairs of the Cambodian people.125.	But the freedom-loving Cambodian people is determined  courageously and without falling back  to pursue its armed struggle until the complete liberation of its country and until the just demands formulated in the historic five-point declaration of the legal Head of State  Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  on 23 March 1970 have been satisfied; that declaration is the only basis of a just settlement of the Cambodian problem.126.	The delegation of the People's Republic of Albania considers it necessary to emphasize that it is completely illegal and manifestly contrary to the Charter to deny to the Cambodian people its legitimate rights to be represented in the United Nations and to maintain in its stead the puppet clique of Phnom Penh  which represents nothing  neither a people nor a State. The only legitimate representatives of the people of Cambodia are the United National Front and the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia. Only that Government  which exercises complete and unquestioned power over more than 90 per cent of the territory and 80 per cent of the population of Cambodia  which has set up its agencies everywhere  which directs and organizes the life of almost the whole of the country and which enjoys the support and help of the entire Cambodian people  has the capacity and the attributes necessary to represent the latter in international relations and in the United Nations.127.	The trip which Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  the legal Head of State and President of the United National Front of Cambodia  made last spring to Cambodia and the National Congress held recently clearly confirm the effective power of the United National Front and of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia throughout the country and have increased their prestige and their authority in the international arena. Clear evidence of this 's to be found  inter alia  in the fact that 48 countries have established and maintained diplomatic relations with the Royal Government of National Union and that the participants in the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Algiers in September  recognized that Government as the only legal Government of Cambodia.128.	In order to put an end as soon as possible to the great injustice done to the people of Cambodia  it is necessary that the General Assembly  without delay  take the decision immediately to expel the representatives of the puppet Lon Nol clique and to invite the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia to take its rightful seat.129.	Although 20 years have elapsed since it was compelled to put an end to its aggressive war in Korea and to sign an armistice agreement  the United States none the less continues to maintain its occupation troops in South Korea and to incite the Seoul regime to engage in excessive acts of armed provocation against the peoples of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. For 20 years the United Nations has been intervening in this matter without taking any concrete measure to put an end to such a situation. The maintenance of such a state of affairs constitutes a flagrant violation of the sovereign rights of the Korean people; it hampers its efforts for the reunification of the country  increases tension in Korea  seriously endangers peace and stability in the surrounding zone and seriously undermines the prestige of the United Nations.130.	The achievement of the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people and the interests of peace and stability in the Far East demand that as soon as possible a remedy should be found for this intolerable situation  and that the United States should withdraw its troops and its bases from South Korea and cease all military engagements in that country  that the illegal United Nations Commission for the Reunification and Rehabilitation of Korea should be dissolved immediately  and that any intervention by the United Nations in the domestic affairs of the Korean people should cease.131.	Peace-loving Members of the Organization  acting in the spirit of the Charter  should try to ensure that the General Assembly takes the proper decision along these lines in order that these important and urgent steps can be taken  as called for in the draft resolution submitted by Algeria and a certain number of other Member countries [A/C.1/L.644 and Corr.l]. The delegation of the People's Republic of Albania fully supports the draft resolution.132.	In recent times the United States and the Seoul administration  without heeding these demands and the need to provide a just solution to the question  worked out the plot of the ""two Koreas"" and they are attempting to impose that settlement on the Korean people and also on Member States through the discussion of the question concerning the so-called ""dual representation of Korea"". By this manoeuvre they are attempting to legalize and perpetuate the division of Korea into two States  to perpetuate the United States colonial domination in South Korea  and to divert the attention of the General Assembly from the substance of the Korean problem in order to get the discussion bogged down in an impasse.133.	There is only one Korea that exists in the world. Its division into two parts is a result of the hostile and aggressive policy that the United States has been pursuing for many years against the Korean people and an end should be put to this situation as soon as possible. The Korean people has constituted and continues to constitute one single nation. It must live again united. The Korean people has the supreme and sovereign right to decide for itself all the questions that concern it without intervention from outside  and that is something that no one has the right to deny to that people.134.	The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  the only legal representative of the Korean people  has steadily attempted efforts and has taken a series of important and reasonable initiatives in order to bring about the realization of this right and of this ardent aspiration of the people of Korea. The Government of the People's Republic of Albania supports the constructive proposals contained in the five-point programme presented by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on 23 June last [see A[9027  para. 19]  proposals which testify once again to its desire to see created an atmosphere of understanding  collaboration and national unity in Korea with a view to a just solution of the Korean problem and which tear the mask from those who press for division and prepare for war in this country. We vehemently condemn the plot of the ""two Koreas"" and any steps which the United States  alone or with the aid of its accomplices  may undertake to legalize this state of affairs through the United Nations. The question of the representation of Korea in the United Nations is a domestic matter for the Korean people and it is only for that people to decide this question and for no one else. The most recent five-point proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea sketches the proper course for the solution of this problem in accordance with the aspirations of the entire Korean people and in the light of the conditions obtaining in that country.135.	Not only in Indo-China and in the Far East but also in other parts of the Asian continent — in the Arabian Gulf and in the Indo-Pakistani peninsula  in the Indian and in the Pacific Oceans-the two imperialist super-Powers are collaborating and rivalling each other in their expansionist aggressive activities  increasing tension and threatening the interests of sovereign peoples and countries. A succession of events has not ceased to provide us with evidence of this fact. And clear evidence is also to be found at present in the intensification of the efforts of the Soviet Union to impose on Asian peoples and countries its plan for ""collective security in Asia""  which is just as dangerous as their so-called scheme for European security or international security.136.	How can anyone talk about ""collective security in Asia"" when the authors of that plan  the Soviet social imperialists  have encouraged and are supporting Indian aggression against Pakistan  when they have engaged in armed provocation against the People's Republic of China  when  preparing war  they have at present massed numerous troops on the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Mongolian frontiers  when they are constantly whipping up anti-Chinese hysteria and strengthening their naval forces in the Indian Ocean  and when they are engaging in subversive activities and stirring up quarrels and conflicts among the Asian countries?137.	The so-called collective security in Asia is directed against the freedom and independence of the sovereign peoples and countries of that continent  and against the national and revolutionary liberation movement in that part of the world. It is directed first of all against the People's Republic of China  which is the stalwart bulwark of socialism  the most powerful defender of the struggle of peoples for freedom and national independence  the country which most sincerely supports the effort of sovereign States for their independent development and progress  and which fights with determination against the policy of hegemony of the two super-Powers.138.	None the less  the imperialists and social imperialists and other reactionaries of all kinds and colours have failed and will continue to fail in their anti-Chinese activity. That great country  the People's Republic of China  a powerful socialist State which enjoys great prestige and plays a tremendous role in the international arena  is pursuing a revolutionary policy both at home and abroad and  in accordance with the principles of that policy  is developing and strengthening continuously  thus advancing firmly along the path of socialism and revolution. That is a source . of pleasure and encouragement to all peace-loving and freedom-loving peoples.139.	The People's Republic of Albania will always stand side by side with peoples and countries fighting for freedom  independence and national sovereignty against imperialism  both old and new  colonialism and neocolonialism. My delegation wishes to express the feelings of friendship and solidarity of the Albanian people towards peoples who are suffering from colonial oppression and the policy of genocide and racial discrimination; it denounces the bloody crimes of the Portuguese colonizers and the racist regimes of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia  it demands that resolutions and decisions which for many long years have been adopted by the United Nations along these lines should not be trampled underfoot but should be put into effect. It hails the just struggle of these peoples and is firmly convinced that they will triumph.140.	The Albanian people  like all progressive peoples and progressive public opinion throughout the world  condemns the coup d'etat organized in Chile by the rightist forces incited and supported by American imperialism. We express our support and solidarity with the Chilean people  which at the present time is going through a difficult moment of its history because of the campaign of violence and terror which has been raging throughout the country.141.	We vigorously support the efforts of a great many independent developing countries in Asia  Africa and Latin America that are making efforts to strengthen their political and economic independence  to defend their national rights and national resources  to consolidate their sovereignty and to preserve their territorial integrity.142.	The People's Republic of Albania is a peace-loving State. It has fought and will continue to fight with determination to defend its freedom  its independence and its sovereignty and it is determined to stand up against  and to bring to nought  all plans and all the aggressive aims and threats of the United States imperialists and the social imperialists in the Soviet Union which are directed against it. Albania will continue always to act as a factor of peace and stability in the Balkans and in Europe and it will pursue  as always  and in consistent fashion  its foreign policy  which is unchanging and one of principle in the service of the cause of socialism  freedom  the independence of sovereign peoples and countries  and general peace and security throughout the world.143.	At the outset of the work of this session the General Assembly decided to admit to membership the two German States  the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany as Members of the United Nations. In voting in favour of that decision the Albanian delegation explained [2119th meeting] the attitude of the Government of the People's Republic of Albania in connexion with certain aspects of the German problem which heretofore have not met with a just and final solution because of the failure to conclude a peace treaty between vanquished Germany and the victors of the anti-Fascist coalition  a treaty which should include the necessary clauses and obligations so that we can prevent a renaissance of militarism and German revanchism and in order to ensure that indemnities are paid for all of the damage experienced by those countries because of the occupation or aggression to which they were subjected by Hitlerite Germany.144.	The Albanian delegation affirms once again in this Assembly the views it expressed a few days ago  and it wishes to emphasize that the People's Republic of Albania does not give up its demand that Germany satisfy all the rights which Albania acquired as a country which participated in the anti-Fascist coalition.145.	The Albanian people was one of the first victims of Fascist aggression  and the occupation of our country by Germany during the Second World War brought it immense suffering and privation  damage and vast destruction. Because of this fact  28 000 Albanians were killed  —  3 per cent of the population of the country at that time - 12 600 were wounded  and 12 150 deported. Tens of thousands of other persons were used as forced labour by the German occupying forces. The economy and all sectors of the life of the country suffered vast losses. Suffice it to recall that 100 000 homes or buildings were set fire to or reduced to ashes  1 850 towns and villages out of the 2 500 which Albania had at that time were destroyed. The losses in livestock  large and small  which were killed or carried off amounted to 800 000 head. Agriculture  forests  mines  ports  roads  bridges and means of transport and communication were destroyed. Monetary treasure and great quantities of objects of art and archaeological treasures were pillaged. Estimates made by the competent State commissions after the war show that the monetary value of the loss suffered by our country because of German occupation amounts to approximately $2 000 million  calculated at the value of the dollar in 1938.146.	Because of its heroic struggle side by side with other peoples and countries of the anti-Fascist coalition  the Albanian people made a valuable contribution to the historic victory won over fascism. In proportion to the area of its territory  which is 28 000 square kilometres  and its population at the-time  1 million inhabitants  Albania  in terms of losses in manpower and cultural and material property  is in the forefront of the countries which fought fascism.147.	The Albanian people  by its struggle and by the blood which was shed by thousands of its sons and daughters  won the undeniable and imprescriptible right to payment of the damages inflicted upon it by Germany. As was stipulated in particular in Potsdam:""In accordance with the Crimea decision that Germany be compelled to compensate to the greatest possible extent for the loss and suffering that she has caused to the United Nations and for which the German people cannot escape responsibility . . ."" the People's Republic of Albania declares before this Assembly that it demands that it should be paid as soon as possible the full measure of reparations for the damage which the troops and occupation authorities of Hitlerite Germany inflicted upon Albania during the Second World War  as well as for the losses suffered because of the postponement of the payment of these reparations.148.	In conclusion  I should like to express my delegation's conviction that Member States which have at heart the interests of national independence and freedom and general peace and security will firmly oppose the pressures and intrigues of the two super-Powers  that they will reject their secret diplomacy carried out through this Organization and outside it  and that they will not allow them to prevent the present session of the General Assembly from looking objectively and seriously at the important problems confronting it. With that goal in mind  the delegation of the People's Republic of Albania will spare no effort  in the course of this session also  to make its modest contribution towards that end."
"3",157,"ARE",28,1973,"﻿76.	Mr. President  I am happy to extend to you the congratulations of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates on your election to the presidency. Your illustrious career in the United Nations and your notable services in the cause"" of peace will assure the success of this session  which you are already guiding with such ability and distinction.77.	May I also pay a tribute to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski for the distinguished manner in which he presided over the previous session?78.	We welcome the admission of the two German States to membership in the United Nations. It is a historical development of great significance which has brought us closer to the attainment of one of the most cherished goals of this Organization: universality. We also congratulate the people of the Bahamas on the attainment of their independence and the admission of their country to membership in the United Nations.79.	In reviewing the world situation may I be permitted to start with the area in which my country is situated  the Arabian Gulf. My country is vitally interested in the maintenance of peace and stability in that important economic and strategic area of the world. We have endeavoured to establish the closest relations with our neighbours. It is our firm belief that the peace and stability of the Arabian Gulf region can be maintained only through the co-operation of its States and their respect for each other's independence and territorial integrity.80.	Whatever disputes or differences exist at present or may arise in the future  they can and must be resolved by peaceful means and in a manner that will recognize and preserve the legitimate rights of all parties concerned without prejudice to their basic national interests.81.	We are ready now  as we have always been  to co-operate with our neighbours to create a climate of understanding and harmony  which is essential for the peace and progress of the region and the welfare of all its people.82.	The Arab States in the Gulf are sparing no efforts to expand their co-operation and to strengthen their fraternal ties with a view to establishing on firm foundations their future unity in response to the wishes and aspirations of the Arab people in the Gulf.83.	We have pledged ourselves to act together to defend our independence and resist any foreign intervention in our affairs from whatever source. That policy springs from our supreme national interest  and I am sure our endeavours in this respect will receive the understanding and support they deserve. Our success in preserving our independence and consolidating the security and stability of the area will render a great service to peace and the principles and purposes of the Charter.84.	In pursuance of those aims we have supported and will continue to support all efforts to make the Indian Ocean a zone of peace free from great-Power rivalries. That is why we were most heartened by the agreement reached last August between our two neighbours India and Pakistan to settle some of the questions arising out of the armed conflict in 1971.85.	The situation in the Middle East  which vitally affects us  remains as dangerous and explosive as ever. Many lamented the fact that  while many of the world's longstanding disputes have been resolved  the Middle East problem remains as difficult and intractable as ever. Why is that so? Israel's spokesmen will tell you it is because the Arabs are bent upon the destruction of the State of Israel and the annihilation of its people. That kind of obvious and shop-worn propaganda can be ignored and dismissed out of hand. Only those who are anxious to find some excuse or justification for Israel's continued occupation of Arab lands and for its persistent flouting and violation of United Nations resolutions will subscribe to such preposterous views. Those who are sincerely and genuinely interested in a peaceful settlement must seek a far more objective and rational analysis of the situation. The question is not and never has been Israel's survival. On the contrary  the question is and has always been the survival of the Arab people of Palestine as a distinct and homogeneous community and their right to live free and secure in their ancestral homeland. That is the crux of the problem. So long as the people of Palestine are denied their basic rights  there can be no peace in the Middle East.86.	At the recent historic Fourth Conference of Heads of State and Government of Non-Aligned Countries held in Algiers  the voice of the third world was heard clearly and decisively in condemning Israel's continued aggression and in upholding the rights of the people of Palestine  whose struggle to recover their usurped homeland was hailed by the Conference as an integral part of the struggle of all peoples against colonialism.87.	Many speakers have referred to recent encouraging developments in the relations of the great Powers. We welcome the further steps taken to relax tensions and to end once and for all the dangerous confrontation that has divided Europe and threatened world peace and security for over a quarter-century. It is our hope that the rapprochement among the great Powers which began last year and which has gained considerable momentum during the current year will continue. There can be no greater danger to world peace than continued mistrust and antagonism between those who possess weapons of mass destruction.88.	It is undeniable  however  that the detente has given rise to some misgivings and even suspicions. There is an uneasy feeling  which persists despite repeated denials  that the removal of the immediate danger of military confrontation may lead the major Powers to falter in the discharge of their primary responsibility under the Charter to deal effectively with situations which are a threat to peace. That may be due to the fact that some of those problems do not directly affect the immediate vital interests of the major Powers. We have heard in this hall the representatives of the major Powers who have so far spoken reaffirming their allegiance to the principles of the United Nations and their intention fully to discharge their responsibilities under the Charter. But it is not enough  as some have done  to preach to us the virtues of a world where the rule of law governs  and where justice shall reign supreme and unchallenged. It is not enough to talk in resounding terms of a rosy and Utopian future while the contemporary world abounds in examples of naked aggression  brutal exploitation and injustice and oppression. If we want the rule of law to govern international relations and justice to be our guiding principle  then let us begin by dealing effectively and courageously with the problems which confront us today. Talk unmatched by action can only distort reality and make a mockery of the exhortations about a brave new world. Would those who spoke to us about the rule of law give us answers to the following questions?89.	Does the rule of law apply to the Middle East situation? What rule of law is it which permits a Member State of this Organization to continue its occupation of the territories of three other Member States? What rule of law is it which allows the occupying Power to annex formally some of those territories and change their demographic character? What rule of law is it which denies thefundamental rights of the Arab people of Palestine to be free and secure in their ancestral homeland and prevents them from freely exercising their rights of self- determination?90.	If we want justice to be the supreme arbiter in the affairs of men  should we not start to deal effectively with some of the most glaring examples of injustice and brutal oppression in our contemporary world  such as colonialism  racial discrimination and the continued denial for millions of Africans of their fundamental human rights and freedoms?91.	Even before our independence we followed with keen interest the successful struggle other peoples waged against colonialism. The Arab nation  of which we are an integral part  has suffered greatly from foreign domination  and that is why we give our unstinted support to the struggle still going on in Africa and elsewhere  to eradicate the last vestiges of colonialism.92.	At the recent Conference of non-aligned countries in Algiers  we pledged to make a modest contribution to the liberation movements in Africa  as a token of our solidarity with our African brothers. We are ready to continue our moral and material support to those movements until they achieve the freedom and independence of their peoples in Zimbabwe  Mozambique  Angola  Guinea-Bissau and Namibia.93.	We condemn racial discrimination in all forms and manifestations. We are ready to support all measures within and outside the United Nations  to put an end to the policies of apartheid practised by the South African Government. It is intolerable that the international community is incapable yet of dealing effectively with a situation which clearly violates the basic principles of the Charter. In two months' time we will celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  which is undoubtedly one of the most important achievements of this Organization. The Declaration has inspired many of the countries which   attained independence in the last two decades. My own country has included in its provisional Constitution a bill of rights modelled on the Declaration and containing all its basic concepts.94.	The Paris agreements of last January to end the war in Viet-Nam were universally welcomed  yet we cannot but express our disappointment at the slow progress and the difficulties encountered in bringing peace to Indo-China  whose people have suffered so much. No solution will endure unless it is based on the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned without foreign interference or intimidation.95.	In the recent months there has been a great deal of publicity about the so-called energy crisis  and there have been some attempts to portray the oil-producing countries  especially the Arab States  as being the cause of this crisis because it is alleged they are arbitrarily raising the price of crude oil and using it as a weapon for political blackmail and extortion.a96.	What is the truth? The central fact is that the major industrial countries which are the main consumers of our oil have built their economic prosperity and industrial expansion on a policy of cheap energy. An inevitable result of this policy was to slow down the economic growth and development of the producing countries.97.	Now at long last  we want to change all this. Is it not time for our people to reap the benefits of their resources  which for decades have contributed to the enrichment of other countries? Increased production was clearly not enough  since the dollar devaluation and the rampant inflation in the major industrial nations from which we import all the goods we need for our economic development has all but wiped out any benefits which we may have derived from such an increase. In any case  the rise in prices for the individual consumer is not due so much to the increase in the price of crude oil as it is to the rise in shipping costs and excise taxes  levied in the consumer countries. The consumer in Western Europe  for example  pays on the average 55 per cent of the cost of the oil he buys in excise taxes to his own Government  whereas the producing countries get only 12 per cent of what he pays for his oil.98.	In short  our policy is to get a greater share of the profits derived from the sale of our oil. I believe this is a legitimate and reasonable aim. There is a lop-sided logic in some of the opinions which we hear from time to time about oil policies of the producing countries. We are told  for example  that producing countries are under a moral obligation to cater to the growing energy needs of the major industrial countries  that in return for our irreplaceable oil we should accept depreciated and devalued currencies and that  in case of monetary surpluses  our investment policies should be bound by restrictions which are designed to serve the interests of the consumer nations to the detriment of those of the producers. If we ask  in return for such favours  some consideration for our vital national interests  such as  in the case of the question of Palestine  the faithful implementation of United Nations resolutions  and the strict application of the Charter principles  concerning the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and the respect for the rights of the people of Palestine  we are accused of using oil as a weapon for political blackmail and extortion.99.	The Secretary-General  in his thought-provoking introduction to the report on the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add 1]  has drawn our attention to the problems and difficulties facing the United Nations in a rapidly' changing world and the possibilities open to us  if we wish to make an effort  to make our Organization an effective instrument for peace and human welfare. I believe the time has come for us to translate into living reality the principles and ideals of the Charter. In an effort to match our words with deeds  we have already paid to the United Nations $1 million  as a token of our faith in this Organization.100.	Effective international action in the field of development has so far been woefully insufficient to meet the increasing needs and expectations of the majority of the human race  who still live in conditions of dire poverty and misery.101.	The developed countries have not shown sufficient interest or concern in the difficulties which the developingcountries still face. Self-interest seems still to be the dominant feature of their policies to the exclusion of all other considerations. Further efforts are required  and the developing countries  conscious of their common needs and aims  must take the initiative in any new international effort. For this reason we have been greatly attracted by the concept of collective economic security  and we are ready to play our part in such an endeavour.102.	We attach particular importance to item 101 of the agenda  relating to the situation in the drought-stricken areas in Africa. We have already contributed $3 million for the relief of the region and we will be ready to co-operate and take part in any international endeavour in that respect.103.	In conclusion  I should like to reaffirm our unbounded faith in the United Nations and its principles  and our determination to fulfil faithfully our obligations as a Member State of this Organization  and to contribute to the limit of our abilities to its strengthening and success."
"4",204,"ARG",28,1973,"﻿210.	 Mr. President  your unanimous election to preside over this new session of the General Assembly is a token of recognition of your qualities as a diplomat  your competence in international affairs  and of the zeal and interest that you have always shown in your participation in dealing with the complex problems that confront our Organization. Thus  I wish my first words before this General Assembly to go beyond the mere ritualistic dictates of the usual courtesy  and serve to pay the tribute of my delegation to one who for so long has been an honour to his country  to Latin America and to the United Nations itself.211.	This election  futhermore  fills us with personal satisfaction  since we know of the great affection that Mr. Benites — the man of the Pacific — feels for the land of the River Plate  where he served for so long and left the indelible mark of his friendship and his brilliant work. I whole-heartedly trust that success will continue to crown your endeavours in the delicate duties that you have assumed  and I am happy to assure you of the full cooperation of my delegation in your important task.212.	I am vested with the representation of a Government that is the result of the express will of a people that has recently  and by an overwhelming majority  endorsed the three banners of social justice  economic independence and political sovereignty. That firm determination bespeaks the irreversible commitment to eliminate for all time the socio-political systems of dependency.213.	My country is going through an unprecedented historic period whose starting point lies in the union of all Argentineans around the objective of national liberation. By means of the effective exercise of representative democracy  the Government and the people of Argentina have set out  at one and together  on the road that is to lead us to the establishment of a social order in which man may fulfil himself wholly  safeguarded by law against any form of exploitation. His rights and aspirations to a happy life will thus merge with those of the community.214.	All have a place in this great undertaking  from those who resolutely embrace the cause of justicialismo to those who advocate other tendencies  but who  in an atmosphere of peace and legality  are ready to be partners in the common effort.215.	Argentina is fully aware that respect for the plurality of ideas and obedience to the popular will are indispensable conditions in which to build a community organized on the basis of solid and lasting values.216.	In this spirit  my Government has decided to carry out a peaceful revolution — one that will profoundly change the Argentine society in order to meet the desires for justice and liberation that imbue our people.217.	This new orientation which guides the Argentine Government within our borders is also projected beyondthem and will govern our conduct within the framework of our international relations.218.	Our foreign thoughts  when crossing our borders  must be directed first of all to our own Latin America. We are convinced that in the future  we shall have to unite our forces and our resources in order to confront the difficulties that lie in wait for any who seek to ensure their freedom of action in a world beset by new imperialist threats. That convergence of efforts must logically start with those of us that possess the most obviously similar characteristics; and despite their powerful national personalities  our countries of Latin America do  in fact  possess a significant and real highest common denominator.219.	Since the very dawn of our emancipation we have been divided by varied outside interests in order that they might more easily obtain supplies of the raw materials so necessary for the progress of more advanced societies. I am most disturbed to have to state here that that quest for profit has not been abandoned and that certain power centres —  Governments and multinational corporations — still have their sights set on the vast region which our countries make up.220.	For that reason  now more than ever  union is a categorical imperative today. We must labour without flagging with one idea in mind: a single and indissoluble Latin America. We know that that cannot be achieved overnight  but we also know that if that is not our aim the end result will be an even greater splintering and thus a weakening that will render us unable to defend ourselves against any form of ambition on the part of foreign Powers.221.	Each must play his vital role in this process. It was in Latin America itself that the legal principle of the sovereign equality of States gained the fullest respect  but unfortunately that very principle has far too often been set aside. On the strength of mature awareness we can today reaffirm that all the States of Latin America must contribute to the common cause on a footing of absolute parity.222.	We share similar needs and identical hopes. Nor are the obstacles to our progress different  We are all players in the same drama: that of living with searing needs unsatisfied in a continent flowing with resources. Thus it is hard to imagine individual solutions  unless we are ready to make do with mere palliatives. Faced by common problems  our solutions must be general and for the whole and framed by the ideas of international social justice to which all the peoples meeting here aspire.223.	Very possibly some country may alone manage a beginning of liberation. But it can never secure it if it is isolated from the rest. That is why we see the process of Latin American liberation as a joint undertaking intended to benefit all.224.	No ideological barrier must be allowed to prevail over motives sprung from the very roots of our peoples. We can assume our role in world affairs only through pluralist understanding and union.225.	There can be no doubt that we are heading towards an international system possessing continental features  andto reach our goal we must fulfil our responsibilities with faith and optimism and by bringing to bear all the energies and reserves of the Latin American people. It is only thus that we shall all together approach our target  which has been defined for us by our common origin and an inevitable historical imperative. On this road we are prepared to cooperate with those who understand our yearnings and desires and wish to make their open and sincere contribution to the building of a politically  economically and socially just continent.226.	Our concern over the future of Latin America fits squarely within the wider concept of the third world.227.	We are deeply convinced that the peoples of Africa  Asia and Latin America are basically facing the same problems.228.	""Nations rich or poor""; ""developed or developing countries""; ""advanced or backward nations""; ""the haves and the have-nots"" — all are similar ways of disguising a single  crude and dramatic reality: domination or dependency.229.	But to shatter that alternative and obtain more just and equitable conditions the third world does possess a powerful instrument — solidarity. Numerically we are many  and we are imbued with principles that arm us with unchallengeable moral strength. But we must counteract our own lack of individual power by bringing to bear the vitality of our unity.230.	That process is already under way. It must now be extended and consolidated in all fields. But the struggle is not and will not be simple. Powerful interests will continue to fan futile divisions and to create artificial antagonisms.231.	It would be paradoxical for our countries to lose their united stand precisely at the time when the great Powers are strengthening their understandings to preserve their privileges.232.	To think exclusively in terms of individual interests would be to open the way to the designs of those who oppose our progress. It would be even worse to conspire against the common interest  preservation of which is our sole guarantee of survival as truly independent States.233.	The profound changes taking place in the political  economic and social structures of nations point  to the threshold of a new stage in the development of mankind.234.	To be worthy of the evolution that is altering the concept of modern life to its very foundations  we must muster all our energies to create the kind of society that our national  regional and cultural idiosyncrasies require  rejecting the foreign patterns foisted on us from outside  which are nothing but the refurbished attempts of certain Powers to fulfil their own desires of economic or ideological domination.235.	That possibility was foreseen by the leader of justicialismo  Lieutenant-General Juan Peron  when  three decades ahead of today's reality  he defined the humanistic and revolutionary doctrine of the ""third position""  which apart from depicting a special plan for the organization of the Argentine community  represented the first open confrontation on an international level of the imperialisms of the left and of the right.236.	Fortunately  today  a number of nations share this viewpoint  and proof was clearly given at the historic meeting recently held in Algiers  the Fourth Conference of Heads of State and Government of Non-Aligned Countries  where the non-aligned nations reiterated their unwavering determination to continue and to strengthen that movement  based on principles that are very comparable to those of the ""third position"".237.	The Government of the people of Argentina did not want to remain outside that undertaking which constitutes one of the greatest joint movements for liberation  cooperation and solidarity of this century. And so it brought the Argentine Republic into the movement of the non-aligned nations as a full member  and pledged all its efforts to contribute to the triumph of its objectives.238.	This is a good opportunity to reiterate our appreciation for the warm welcome given and the many signs of friendship shown to the Argentine delegation on the occasion of its admission to the movement. We should also like to place on record our thanks for the unanimous understanding and support shown on a number of questions which my country raised for examination by that great gathering.239.	In the field of shared natural resources and the human environment  to which my country attaches special importance  that support was particularly significant. Guided by noble motives of solidarity and co-operation  while it reaffirmed the principle of sovereignty over nations' own natural resources  the Conference recognized the principle of solidarity and of co-ordinated and joint action in the exploitation and use of the natural resources shared by two or more States. Thus the Algiers Declaration  sets forth the principle that co-operation between countries in the exploitation of their common resources shall be on the basis of a system of information and prior consultation  all within the framework of the normal relations existing between the States concerned.240.	The spirit of Algiers led also to the establishment of the rights of the coastal State to the exploitation of the natural resources of its seas and the protection of other related interests to a distance of 200 miles. For the first time  a group composed of the majority of the international community has proclaimed this important root of an agreement  which is in turn complemented by the recognition of the need to legislate on the regime of the continental shelf beyond the 200-mile limit in accordance with existing international law.241.	In Algiers  Argentina felt it was among brothers. But even more  it felt that it was understood  and in turn felt that it understood  in their diversity  the aspirations of all the other non-aligned nations. And yet  above even that  Argentina felt that it was a partner in an integrating current that was destined to change the future of the world.242. But  to conclude these pleasant reminiscences  may I publicly express our thanks to the Government and the people of Algeria for the generous hospitality they showed us and for their untiring efforts to ensure the success of that outstanding Conference. 243. The bipolar world  which was the main characteristic of the last decades  ceased to exist with the appearance of new centres of power in Europe and Asia. The agreements recently concluded among the great Powers are further positive elements that have contributed greatly to clarifying the world picture. We were among the first to welcome those events that put an end once and for all to the cold war  charged as it was with so many threats to mankind  and mark the beginning of a new and constructive era in the life of peoples. Convergence and co-operation among those who until yesterday had seemed irreconcilable antagonists are doubtless an indispensable condition for the reduction of tensions in the world.244.	However  for the atmosphere of peace to be stable and to benefit all  this convergence must not be achieved behind the backs or at the expense of the other countries. World opinion today could not tolerate it if  under the guise of a sound policy of detente  the great Powers were to be hammering out an up-to-date version of Yalta — in other words  if they were readying themselves for a new distribution of spheres of influence over which to wield their respective hegemonies.245.	The third world cannot be left out when the great Powers adopt their decisions  for those decisions must  obviously  affect it either directly or indirectly. In order to clarify the doubts and disquiet felt by many Governments it is essential to allow them to play their true role in the search for solutions to various problems.246.	And this participation can best be played out within the United Nations. But it must be a United Nations that is revitalized and strengthened in order fully to carry out its noble and worthy objectives. It is an irrefutable fact that the body created in 1945 does not meet the needs of the present day. And this can be clearly understood from the excellent introduction to the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization submitted by the Secretary-General. This outstanding document also makes clear that the Organization can be improved in many of its aspects  so that it may achieve  in the words of Mr. Waldheim  ""a potential unmatched by any human institution which has existed before"".247.	Personally  we consider that very soon it will be necessary to make certain changes in order to achieve a true democratization that will be more consonant with its growing universality. Among others  there is the basic change of eliminating the privileges that the five great Powers assumed in San Francisco.248.	This desire to democratize and update the Organization is particularly timely when the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have just joined our ranks — surely a significant event that is a source of satisfaction to those of us who have always advocated the universality of the United Nations.249.	We most cordially welcome the two representatives of the German people  with whom we are tied by a deep and traditional friendship. I also wish to welcome among us the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  a new independent State that is now added to our Latin American family.250.	We have asserted that we are now entering on a stage of international relations that is lit with the sign of cooperation and understanding. We are gratified at the promising atmosphere thus engendered and would hope that it might be extended to all corners of the earth. Yet we are very much afraid that the continuation of certain existing conflicts may jeopardize the encouraging prospects before us.251.	Our first concern is over the continued existence of anachronistic colonial issues that still upset world peace. The situation is particularly serious in the African continent where  in some areas  colonial oppression at its worst is still being practised. The eradication of colonialism — to use Mr. Waldheim's words again — is ""painfully slow"" [ibid.  p. 4].252.	In the Territories under Portuguese domination  the obstinacy of the colonial Power has created an arena for a harsh war — gestated over many years because of the unyielding attitude of those possessing the duty to assist those peoples to achieve their destiny of independence and sovereign integration in the community of nations.253.	This same picture is seen in Southern Rhodesia and in Namibia  where the minorities refuse to yield to the legitimate rights of the subjected peoples.254.	At a time when man is working under the sign of a spirit of liberation  the peoples of those Territories must be guaranteed the unconditional exercise of their right to self-determination in order to put an end to a cruelly anachronistic situation  whose anti-historic subsistence is an affront to the very essence of all human beings.255.	The practices of apartheid in southern Africa add one of the most reprehensible aspects to colonialism: that of an inhuman racism that is obsolete and yet has been raised to the level of an institution. In this way the Government of South Africa is showing utter contempt for the most basic human rights that this world Organization has advocated since its very inception.256.	The doctrine of justicialismo of my Government  interpreting the deepest essence of the Argentine community  most vehemently rejects any type of discrimination which  although always unacceptable  becomes inconceivable when made the official policy of the State  to the detriment of the majority of the population.257.	The Argentine Government sympathizes with all the millions of victims of apartheid and with those who fight to eradicate it. We shall take every appropriate opportunity to give proof of our will to co-operate actively in the international effort to put an end to such a situation.258.	Our concern ranges over the entire gamut of colonial situations that still persist in the world and overshadow relations among States. Within this context  the attention of the Argentine Republic is centred on the question of the Malvinas Islands.259.	In a note addressed to the Secretary-General by the Argentine Government on 15 August 1973 [A/9121 and Corr.11  we described the prevailing state of the question and the stagnation in which the matter finds itself due to the stand adopted by the British Government on the negotiations urged by General Assembly resolution 2065 (XX) between the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  in order that they might settle the dispute between our two countries over the sovereignty of the islands. Those negotiations  for whose renewal we have always been ready  must take into account the special nature of the problem and the unique characteristics of the issue which make it impossible for generalizations or for analogies to be invoked.260.	When a country sees its territorial integrity dismembered by an act of pure aggression typically imperialist in style  when the authorities of a Territory first  and then the population itself  are ousted and the State to which the Territory belongs has never at any moment accepted that usurpation  then it becomes impossible for anyone to tolerate the subsistence  at a time when the United Nations is in full spate  of a remnant of the nineteenth century power-politics as typical as is that of the Malvinas Islands.261.	No one is unaware of the subterfuge indulged in to pretend to consolidate the colonial aggression by evicting the original population and replacing them by others brought in by the imperialist Power. The tragic experience of the past and what is today taking place in southern Africa and the Middle East are present-day examples of those reprehensible practices 262.	It is thus paradoxical for the Government of the United Kingdom  after its criticisms of resolution 1514 (XV)  which spelt the culmination of the process of the elimination of colonialism  today to invoke it in part and with ulterior motives  for no other purpose than to support one of the many episodes of colonial expansion of that country.263.	Despite the obstacles that the United Kingdom may try to place in the road to the decolonization of the Malvinas Islands  our position towards the population of the islands has not varied and is always fully consonant with the decisions of the United Nations. The interests of the persons at present inhabiting the islands will be fully taken into account  according to the spirit and the letter of General Assembly resolution 2065 (XX)  as well as of the recent resolution unanimously adopted by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples on 21 August 1973 [see A/9023/Rev.l  chap. XXVII  sect. E]  The Argentine Government has already given valid proof of its policy by means of a series of measures that ease the communications and contribute to the welfare of the settlers on the Islands  and reiterates  from this rostrum  its desire to give wide and adequate guarantees for the interests of those settlers once the islands have been returned to the national heritage of the Argentine Republic.264.	My country has adhered — and continues to adhere —  to the path of negotiation with the occupying Power  but is forced to state that the procedure cannot be indefinitelyprolonged  thus serving as a means of maintaining the present situation. If the negative stance of the United Kingdom leads us into a stalemate  the Argentine Government will be forced to re-examine the policy which thus far has been based on goodwill and on respect for the principles of the Charter and of the resolutions of our Organization. If that be the case  it will be up to the United Nations to determine the way in which the terms of resolution 2065 (XX) have been vitiated due to the lack of real willingness on the part of one of the parties to negotiate.265.	Once again it is my duty to state that the Argentine Government and people  more at one in this than ever before  will not retreat in their determination to recover that part of our national territory that was wrested from us in an act of imperialism by the United Kingdom  an act that history has condemned. The survival of such a situation at this stage of the twentieth century  when the process of decolonization is reaching its end  is both inexplicable and indefensible. To put an end to such an intolerable anachronism is a matter that brooks no delay  and it can be achieved only through the full restoration of the islands to the land from which they were torn and of which they are and always will be an integral part.266.	Another source of concern to us is the continuation of the crisis in the Middle East  which continues to be the most serious threat to international peace and security.267.	We believe it to be indispensable that  within the next few months  and in connexion with the visit of the Secretary-General to the countries in the region  efforts should be redoubled to solve this delicate question. We have often stated before  and reiterate now  that in this case time is not the best ally for a peaceful settlement.268.	On the contrary  the lack of a solution to a conflict can at any moment generate frustration that may  in turn  light the fuse of a new armed conflict.269.	We have stated and reaffirmed our conviction that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) offers the best means of an honourable settlement for both parties. We continue to hold that same view. Yet  quite frankly and impartially  we believe that Israel must understand that the balance that that resolution advocated cannot be achieved while the Arab territories are still occupied by force.270.	Seven years after the adoption of that resolution  it is not a matter of trying further to interpret its meaning or to analyse its terms  it is a question of opting between establishing the just and lasting peace it advocates or maintaining an unyielding stand which  sooner or later  must lead to another armed confrontation.271.	We trust that common sense will prevail. And common sense clearly indicates that it is far better to achieve today an agreement acceptable to all parties than to count on indefinitely retaining the fruits of a military conquest.272.	During the debate on the important question of Korea  the Argentine delegation will make known its views in detail. However  I do feel constrained to state in advance that we shall not support any resolution of this Assemblywhich  directly or indirectly  may affect the territorial integrity of that country or that may deprive the Korean people of its right to self-determination — in other words  to decide on its destiny for itself and without any form of outside interference.273.	I could not conclude my statement without reaffirming our faith in the permanent values of man  our hopes for the establishment of a just human society and our determination to work with dedication so that the United Nations will be able to play its role today on the road to the universalist world of tomorrow."
"5",309,"AUS",28,1973,"﻿39.	I would first like to extend to you  Sir  the warmest congratulations of the Australian delegation on your election as President of the General Assembly. There has been for many years now a growing sense of community between us in Australia and our Latin American neighbours across the Pacific Ocean and a developing sympathy  understanding and awareness of our common problems and mutual interests.40.	The history of the United Nations since 1945 has been marked by outstanding contributions from a series of distinguished representatives from Latin America and none more so than your own. Your profound experience of the United Nations spans two decades  in the second of which in particular you have been able to play a guiding role in a wide range of United Nations activities. It is fitting therefore that we should now have this opportunity of saluting you as President of the twenty-eighth session of the Assembly.41.	I might begin by recalling that the present Australian Government came into office less than one year ago  towards the close of the last session of the General Assembly. This is thus the first opportunity for a minister of the present Government to appear at the rostrum of this Assembly and explain its broad philosophy and the policies it is pursuing now and for the future. I regard it as a privilege to be here and to be able to take advantage of this opportunity.42.	I want to emphasize first that those ideals which inspired the Australian delegation in helping to draw up the Charter in 1945 are valid today. At the San Francisco Conference the Australian delegation saw the United Nations as an instrument for peace and for human welfare everywhere. We conceived of its Charter not only as a charter for politicians and diplomats but as one aimed especially at promoting the dignity and well-being of the ordinary man and woman. We saw this Organization as a means for leading dependent peoples towards independence and as a means of eliminating discrimination of all kinds  including discrimination based on race. These are all clearly written into the Charter  and through such instruments as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights they have received further expression in this Assembly and in other United Nations organs as the years have passed.43.	We hold fast to these ideals  and the philosophy that guides the Australian Government today is a positive philosophy of faith in the United Nations  in its enduring principles and in its ultimate capacity to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of all mankind.44.	We are living at a time of constant change in the international scene  not all of it rapid  not all of it for the better  but much of it directed towards the end that we all ardently wish for  which is peace and security everywhere and the promise of a better life for peoples everywhere. In spite of disappointments and frustrations we can at least sense an atmosphere of relief from old tensions and an easing of old postures. I have in mind the European security pact negotiations  the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States and the Soviet Union  and the various movements towards peace and neutrality in Asia. The international community has been enriched by the full and energetic participation of the People's Republic of China.45.	On the debit side I need only mention as examples the seemingly intractable situation in the Middle East  the continued fighting in the countries of Indo-China and the recent grievous developments in Chile.46.	Let me try to identify the main principles and guidelines that set the general direction of Australian policies  and to place them in the context of the United Nations  its purposes and its operations. There have been some changes in Australia's outlook on the world and consequently in its national policies — changes which we have considered necessary and indeed overdue and which reflect our conception of a new and dynamic approach to our domestic affairs and our international relationships.47.	It was during an earlier period of office of the present Australian Government that the late Mr. Evatt  our then Foreign Minister  took a leading part in the drafting of the Charter. Nobody will claim that the Charter is perfect  but bearing in mind the transformation undergone by the United Nations since 1945  it has proved a remarkably durable and adaptable instrument. At the same time we acknowledge that there is room for modification of some of its provisions to accommodate changes that have taken place in the balance of influence of Member States. We will view with sympathy and support efforts in this direction  while recognizing that there are limits to what can be achieved.48.	One conspicuous element in Australia's faith in the United Nations is the enduring principle that discussion and dialogue are essential to the work of the Organization. We accordingly welcome as a major development the decision that  after a lapse of three years  the question of Korea should come under scrutiny and discussion in this Assembly.49.	Australia  as a member of the United Nations Commission on the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea [UNCURK] in Seoul  has been seeking to prepare the ground so that the Assembly's handling of the Korean question may help to lessen tension  facilitate accommodation and improve the prospects of Korean reunification. UNCURK itself has taken a timely initiative in recommending  in its annual report to the Secretary-General [A/9027]  that it should now be dissolved. Australia's efforts have been directed towards promoting conciliation and consensus on the Korean question. We wish to ensure that the renewal of the Korean debate should not be a polemical confrontation which would only be detrimental to the spirit of harmony and good relations which we are seeking to promote. We hope that the parties will be able to adjust to each other's positions without trying to push each other into a corner  and that the Assembly will arrive at a constructive consensus.50.	We have been active in extending our bilateral relationships throughout the broad region to Australia's north and east. In addition to establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China we have moved quickly to establish diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and have begun trade and other exchanges with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We have at the same time sought to broaden and deepen our long established relations with the other Asian and Pacific countries including t he group of States members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and our close neighbour  Indonesia.51.	This twenty-eighth session of the Assembly marks a further notable step towards the attainment of the ideal of universality of membership of the United Nations. My delegation has been most happy to welcome the admission to the United Nations of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic  both of which now have diplomatic relations with Australia. Their presence here is a symbol and a measure of lessening ideological tensions and a re-endorsement of international coexistence.52.	We also warmly welcome to membership in the United Nations the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  which on its attainment of independence earlier this year we have already welcomed as a fellow member of the Commonwealth of nations.53.	We in Australia have been sufficiently encouraged by the recent progress in negotiations among the countries of the south Asian sub-continent on their difficult and complex problems to hope that the remaining obstacles may soon be removed to the admission of another Commonwealth country  Bangladesh  to membership in the United Nations.54.	Our Government is deeply conscious that to realize the full benefit of our philosophy we must eliminate some of the heritage of the past  such as colonialism and racism  before the welfare of people around the world can be improved. Australia believes that it can take some modest credit for its part in ensuring that the chapters on economic and social welfare were included in the Charter. Those chapters provide the United Nations with the incentive and the means to advance human welfare and to adapt international action to the needs of the present. We know that some of the paramount objectives have fallen far short of achievement. We have poverty in most of our Member countries. We do not have the stability in trade and financial relationships among United Nations Members that we would like. But we have the means available to us to formulate solutions to the problems of the developing countries and to the problems of stability among all countries. The AustralianGovernment believes that we should utilize these means to the full.55.	Our Government's purpose of promoting human freedom  human dignity and human welfare calls  of course  for domestic as well as international action. We aim to enlarge welfare and social security and especially to protect the more exposed sections of our community. We are concerned not only with welfare in the broad sense but also with removing discrimination and with looking after those  of our people  including particularly our aboriginal people  who have suffered from discrimination in the past.56.	During the present Assembly we will celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. This anniversary of one of the most significant and enlightened achievements of the United Nations gives governments an opportunity to rededicate themselves to the promotion of human rights in their own societies and internationally.57.	It is a fundamental objective of Australia's approach to ensure that our own policies are soundly based on respect for and the protection and enhancement of civil liberties and basic human rights. When our present Government came to power  it immediately began to examine all the international instruments concerned with human rights with a view to determining what action we should be taking to give effect to them. Already this year Australia has ratified a number of Conventions of the International labour Organisation dealing with the right to organize and bargain collectively  equal remuneration for men and women  and the elimination of discrimination in the fields of employment and occupation. We have put in hand action to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.58.	Respect for human rights and opposition to discrimination lead naturally to positive support for the process of decolonization.59.	The Australian Government supports the principle of decolonization for all dependent territories and is participating fully in the efforts of the international community to induce the metropolitan administering Powers to take all steps necessary to ensure that peoples in dependent Territories are enabled to exercise their right to self-determination. Suiting the action to the word  Australia in January of this year rejoined the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  of which we had been an original member.60.	The most acute of the colonial problems remain centred on southern Africa  although the processes of decolonization are still to be worked out in many other areas as well. I have personally had the honour to be received with notable hospitality and generosity in seven African countries during visits undertaken to further Australian sympathy  knowledge and understanding of African problems.61.	We have been working as a member of the Security Council for the strict enforcement of sanctions against the illegal racist regime of Zimbabwe. Indeed  we see these sanctions as a test of the sincerity of Member nations to act in accordance with the principles and obligations of the Charter. We in Australia are determined to enforce them in full  and we will continue to deny the illegal regime any recognition or respectability.62.	We also see as a test of the sincerity of Member nations their attitude to the intolerable practice of apartheid in South Africa. This is a practice which we utterly reject. We shall continue to take every opportunity to condemn it and to co-operate with all those seeking responsibly to eliminate it.63.	We understand the frustrations that have led the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and the non-aligned countries to adopt the position that armed struggle is essential to end colonialism and racial discrimination. While we sympathize with the aims of the national liberation movements in southern Africa  we ourselves stop short of endorsing the use of force to attain these and indeed any other objectives. We hope that  through the application of the principles of the Charter  liberty and equality may be achieved without the tragedies of war.64.	Australia values its continuing co-operation with the Special Committee and the Trusteeship Council in the Territories for which Australia is still the administering Power.65.	Our principal residual responsibility as an administering Power rests in Papua New Guinea  the largest and most populous Territory remaining within the United Nations Trusteeship System. The termination of the Trusteeship Agreeement is now in sight. In close co-operation  the Government and House of Assembly of Papua New Guinea and the Australian Government are moving purposefully to bring Papua New Guinea to sovereign membership in the family of nations.66.	Since 30 April 1973 the ministers of the Papua New Guinea Government have had effective control over virtually all aspects of the internal government of the country. Formal self-government will come on 1 December this year; certain policy functions such as defence and foreign affairs will not  for constitutional reasons  be transferred until independence  but these functions are already being exercised by Australia only after the fullest consultation with  and advice from  the Government of Papua New Guinea.67.	Earlier this year the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly affirmed its right as the duly elected parliament of the people to decide when independence is to come. The Australian Government acknowledges that  on the question of independence as on the question of self- government  the House of Assembly should give effect to the wishes of the people. We expect Papua New Guinea to proceed to sovereign independent status by 1975 as a politically unified nation with a freely elected central government. We have pledged substantial and comprehensive help to the Government and people of an independent Papua New Guinea  which will naturally have a special place in the affections of the Australian people and in our network of political and other relations. Australia is not seeking any exclusive relationship with Papua New Guinea  which will want to find its own place in the international community.68.	The principle that well-to-do countries have an obligation to help those that are poorly off ranks high in the estimation of our Government  and we have taken a fresh look at our policies and programmes of development assistance with the aim of making them more sensitive and responsive to the requirements of the developing countries . To that end we have decided that there should be a separate government agency to administer Australia's development assistance programmes. We intend that our programmes of bilateral assistance should be increasingly directed to activities that will have the effect of spreading social and employment benefits.69.	We are also particularly conscious of the wish of developing countries to increase their exports and to bring bilateral trade more into balance. Our recent decisions to effect an across-the-board 25 per cent reduction in tariffs and to revalue the Australian dollar for the second time in nine months taken together represent a constructive attempt to play our part in liberalizing international trade. The tariff cuts are to be accompanied by significant new tariff preferences for imports from developing countries  which will greatly extend and elaborate Australia's scheme of generalized preferences first introduced in 1966. We are also giving improved technical assistance to developing countries to help them exploit their opportunities in the Australian market.70.	The current financial year will see an increase in all of Australia's major economic and technical aid programmes  and we are now for the first time giving vigorous support to the efforts of the United Nations in the population field. Although  as before  Australian aid will continue to be channelled mainly to the countries of Asia and the Pacific  we will next year be making increases in allocations to African countries as well as in our contributions to the major United Nations and other multilateral funds. Australia accepts the principal target of the International Development Strategy and will aim to raise its official development assistance to 0.7 per cent of the gross national product.71.	In the past  Australia has taken a cautious approach to the question of the link between the special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund [IMF] and development assistance. The present Australian Government supports the studies on this matter undertaken within the IMF Committee on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related Issues since we are conscious that the overwhelming majority of developing countries believe that their interests would be significantly advanced by some form of link.72.	Australia shares the deep concern expressed during this general debate about the world food situation. Our Government is determined that Australia should make a positive and constructive contribution to the international efforts to alleviate the distress and hardship resulting from this situation. Accordingly  Australia has reacted favourably to the proposal by the Secretary of State of the United States that the Assembly should consider organizing a world food conference in 1974 [2124th meeting  para. 71]. We have noted that the essence of Mr. Kissinger's proposal is similar to that in the action programme for economic cooperation adopted by the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries [see A/9330 and Corr. 1  p. 99]  which advocates the convening of an emergency joint conference of FAO and UNCTAD on this problem. Australia is flexible about the procedure for organizing the conference  but we are determined to join with others to find the most suitable  the most immediate and the most efficient way of bringing the attention of the international community to the problem of the world food supply with a view to reaching a practical agreement on the way in which it could be rationally and humanely managed.73.	The principles which guide Australia's policy of active support for the United Nations through the protection and enhancement of human rights  through opposition to colonialism and racism and through acceptance of the obligation to help those who are poorly   off are all part of a Central concern with the kind of life that our people can enjoy and with the kind of environment in which they are to live. The first responsibility for maintaining a congenial environment for mankind's working and leisure hours must rest with our own and other individual Governments  and Australia for its part is now equipped with an administrative apparatus which is being geared to take sensitive account of our people's interest in maintaining the quality of their surroundings.74.	But there is also much that countries can learn from one another. Placed as we are in a large island continent offering wide extremes of climate and terrain  we believe that we have some experience of our own which we can share with the international community in return for the lessons we can learn from abroad — experience in combating air and water pollution  in preserving our natural heritage and in contributing generally towards a satisfactory  and indeed an improving  quality of human living.75.	And so from the beginning  Australia took a lively interest in the proceedings of last year's United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm. We have declared our support for the achievements of that Conference  and intend to pursue policies that accord fully with the Stockholm principles. We are also contributing substantially to the United Nations Environment Programme.76.	The proliferation and testing of nuclear weapons are clearly incompatible with the outlook of any Government and people concerned with the quality of life. These activities divert into unproductive channels the resources  energies and skills which could much more profitably be expended on programmes for the political  economic and social development of the international community.77.	Australia ratified the partial nuclear test-ban Treaty in 1963  and our Government  this year ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] and the sea-bed arms control Treaty.  Australia pledges its full support to the efforts of the United Nations to achieve general and complete disarmament subject to effective means of verification  and our Government is now taking steps to ratify the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI)].78.	We find it deeply regrettable that the Governments of two nuclear Powers have continued to conduct nuclear- weapons testing programmes in the atmosphere  with associated hazards for present and future generations  despite the repeated expressions of disapproval by the United Nations and other international bodies and by individual countries. I take the opportunity to recall that on 22 June last the International Court of Justice gave an order for interim measures to restrain the Government of France from conducting atmospheric nuclear tests in the Pacific which would deposit radio-active fall-out on Australia. Australia is opposed to all forms of nuclear-weapons testing in any environment by whatever State  and we fully endorse the statement by the Secretary-General that ""the time has now surely come for a general agreement to stop all nuclear-weapons testing"".79.	The air and seas of our planet are accessible to all the nations of the world. Just as the international community cannot tolerate misuse of the earth's atmosphere for any purpose whatever  so we must try to ensure that the oceans are not misused.80.	The United Nations has been grappling for almost three years now with the task of preparing for a comprehensive conference on the law of the sea. The fact that progress has not been as rapid as we might wish is a measure of the importance of the subject and of the diversity and complexity of interests that will have to be accommodated in the new system of law.81.	As a matter of priority  the General Assembly must at this session review the progress of the preparatory work and confirm the decisions it took at its last session to convene the conference in 1973-1974. Australia  as a coastal State with interests in every aspect of the law of the sea  has a concern second to none in achieving agreement on a satisfactory convention. We hope that the Assembly  with an appropriate sense of urgency  will reach early agreement to convene the organizational session of the conference later this year and the substantive session in 1974.82.	Few delegations at the San Francisco Conference in 1945 could have envisaged the radical transformation of the United Nations that has taken place. The vast majority of the world's people are now represented here. Australia is encouraged by this remarkable achievement and by the work of the United Nations in promoting the fundamental principles of peace and human welfare. We intend to be as active at home as internationally in giving effect to the basic principles of this Organization. If  as we hope  we are now entering a more promising era of reconciliation  accommodation and peace in international affairs  the United Nations will be able to muster great energies and to concentrate more effectively on the economic and social problems of development and on improving the quality of life everywhere. Those noble purposes call for renewed dedication  unstinting co-operation and a ceaseless effort from every Member of this Organization  and we in Australia are determined to provide all three."
"6",356,"AUT",28,1973,"﻿1.	The twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly is presided over by a prominent representative of Ecuadorian diplomacy. Your rich experience  Mr. President  in the various organs of the United Nations will contribute greatly to the success of this session of the General Assembly. On behalf of the Austrian delegation I extend to you our warmest congratulations on your election. I would add to these our best wishes for the exercise of your high office.2.	The general debate so far has provided an accurate reflection of the political situation of the world. That is a good thing. It shows that the United Nations is close to real life  —  in other words  that it constitutes a reality in the political process. That fact alone enhances its effectiveness — an effectiveness which is of service to all States and  in particular  to small and medium-sized countries.3.	The word ""detente "" has been heard in each of the statements made in the debate so far. There are good reasons for that. The process of detente throughout the world has indeed moved forward since last year. In the past year no new centre of international conflict has emerged. That is of itself a considerable achievement  since it shows that local or continent-wide detente is not only of significance for those directly involved  but also improves the climate of world politics as a whole  and that in turn promotes the settlement of conflicts of interest  even serious ones  between States that were not originally participating in the process of detente.4.	However  it is not only detente that has been reflected in the course of the general debate so far. For those who have followed this debate  it has been impossible to overlook the continuing tensions of ideology  power politics and nationalism which still exist on various continents. The causes of conflict in the world are still numerous. Even without these causes of conflict constantly before our eyes  we could deduce their existence from the fact that advances in the field of disarmament and even in the limitation of the arms race have been extremely modest until now.5.	This is frightening for a world whose natural resources are beginning to be recognized as limited and whose inhabitants strive  as we all know  for quality of life rather than quality of weapons. Terrifying as this escalation of armaments may be  it is understandable in view of the fact that even today  and even among Members of the United Nations  it is not the removal of the causes of conflict or mutual faith in the peaceful settlement of disputes which guarantees peaceful coexistence  but the balance of military potential or — to take a term from the vocabulary of atomic- age philosophy — the concept of mutual assured destruction.6.	Coming at a time when we are not only talking about detente  but when  in wide parts of the world  strong elements of detente manifest themselves  these meetings in New York could and should afford us new opportunities to reflect on what we can contribute to the creation of a better world.7.	The present process of detente began by initiatives on the bilateral level. Without wishing to be exhaustive  I refer here  in a global context  to the rapprochement between the United States of America and the Soviet Union and to the establishment of a new relationship between the United States and China. On the European scale  this process of detente has been marked by the treaties the Federal Republic of Germany has concluded with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Poland  the treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic  and the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin. Bilateral initiatives were a prerequisite for these developments. We owe our gratitude to all the statesmen who undertook them and contributed to their success. Our task now  it seems to me  is to multilateralize these bilateral efforts — in other words  to render them of service to all other States on a broad international level.8.	This multilateralization of detente is necessary  as it reduces the incidence of crises in bilateral relations  which  as experience shows  are normally prone to it. It creates a kind of network which strengthens bilateral detente  and also means that States which were not parties to the original initiatives can profit from this lessening of tension.9.	On the global level  the United Nations offers the best means for multilateralizing detente. On the European level  we have the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  from which  judging by experience gained so far  the participating States can expect a certain additional degree of security and  above all  an additional degree of co-operation.10.	The admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic to the United Nations is a clearly visible sign of the present developments in Europe — and not only in Europe. My Government has never left any doubt that it sincerely wanted the admission of these two States to the United Nations. Their membership is not only an expression of normalization in Europe  but also a further step towards universality and greater effectiveness of the United Nations itself. May I therefore take this opportunity to extend once more a warm welcome to the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic  and also to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  as Members of this world Organization.11.	Smaller States — and they in particular — have to make their contribution to the multilateralization of detente. This duty can be discharged not only by constructive cooperation in international organizations  but also by the development of bilateral relations with other States  especially those which are our neighbours. Every day we all are faced with new problems in our respective regions. Differences of interest may and do arise. It depends upon us  on our approach to them  to find suitable and acceptable compromises in line with the new climate which is starting to prevail in international relations. If we wish to avoid outside interference  we have to settle our affairs by our own efforts. Conflicts of interest between States must be settled at the negotiating table. We are always ready to sit down to discuss problems which have arisen and to try to find solutions to them. Even if such negotiations should take a long time  we are convinced that patience and good faith will be rewarded by success.12.	An example of this is the treatment of the question of South Tyrol  which was the subject matter of General Assembly resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661 (XVI). Three years ago  I was able to inform the General Assembly that Austria and Italy had agreed on a proposal for a solution which made provision for an extension of the autonomy of South Tyrol and a relevant time-table agreed to by both States. 13.	I am happy to be able to state that the implementation of the proposal for a settlement of this question has made further progress since the last session of the General Assembly  and that the major part of the measures have been implemented through appropriate legislative and administrative instruments. A certain part of those measures is  however  still open. May I express the hope that the developments now in progress will continue to advance in a satisfactory way  which  in turn  will lead to an even better relationship between the two neighbouring countries.14.	As far as Europe is concerned  the first phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  held in Helsinki at the Foreign Minister level  established 10 principles which should prove of basic significance to mutual relations among States. I will not repeat them here. They are in full accord with the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  which this General Assembly adopted on 24 October 1970 [resolution 2625 (XXV)\ These principles confer rights and impose obligations. Where they confer rights  these rights must be exercised within a framework corresponding to the present state of affairs in the world. Where they impose obligations  these obligations must be discharged in good faith. Only in this way can we take those small steps which are necessary in order to make the process of detente irreversible.15.	Detente is not an end in itself. From detente we must go on to co-operation in the widest possible sense. But we can do so only if we are supported by public opinion  if we are able to convince our citizens that detente and cooperation are of direct benefit to them. Their support of such policies will in turn influence the process of detente  give it new impetus and open up new vistas of international co-operation.16.	As is well known  the citizens of Austria have  with the citizens of our neighbours  many personal ties which have their roots in history. We do not wish to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries  just as we would resist any attempt to interfere in our own internal affairs. But I refuse to believe that an appeal to remove administrative obstacles to the reunion of families  to the visiting of old and sick relatives and to the very personal decision man makes in choosing a partner for life constitutes interference in the internal affairs of other countries.17.	In recent days  the Republic of Austria and the Austrian Federal Government have come into the spotlight of international interest  and there have been misunderstandings about Austria's basic philosophy in certain respects. I therefore feel the Assembly is entitled to expect a clarification from me in this respect.18.	First  with regard to the aspect of terrorism  it is the Austrian Government which has for several years — in the International Civil Aviation Organization  in the General Assembly  and  at the regional level  in the Council for Europe — very strongly advocated multilateral action against terrorism. Effective and practical measures to combat international terrorism can be devised only at the international level  if they are really to be successful. All members are aware that to date the international community has not been able to agree on such international measures.19.	As long as no such international co-operation exists in the field of terrorism  each State will be compelled to face alone this new form of warfare directed against those not parties to a conflict. Accordingly  reactions to an act of terror will not and cannot be the same in all countries. Guided by its humanitarian principles  my Government regards the saving of human life as the overriding objective which transcends all others. That and that alone is the reason why my Government did everything to create the pre-conditions which made it possible for the four hostages taken in the terrorist act of 28 September to be freed.20.	I do not wish now to dwell in detail on the way in which the Foreign Minister of Israel commented from this rostrum Wednesday [2139th meeting] on the act of terrorism perpetrated in Austria on 28 September 1973  and on the Austrian reactions to it. My Government is convinced that terrorists are not given encouragement by the fact that a Government is not prepared to sacrifice human lives. Past experience provides ample proof that even the supreme sacrifice has not been a deterrent; nor will it be so in the future. The main responsibility for the persistence of terrorism lies with those who have contributed to the blocking of efforts to establish effective international co-operation against terrorism. A world-wide disease can be fought successfully only with world-wide remedies.21.	Those who really care for the fate of people desiring to travel through Austria on their way to their new homes should not make Schoenau Castle their battle cry or an ideology. Nobody can profit from a campaign against Austria  especially not the people for whom it appears to be organized. Such a campaign will never serve any purpose. My Government will not yield to any pressure  wherever it may come from  and expects that all States will  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  refrain from interfering in Austria's internal affairs. It would seem advisable not to lose one's sense of proportion and to endeavour to find the way to objective judgements and appraisals.22.	My Government leaves the door wide open for any future talks on humanitarian questions  and thus I come to the second aspect of this matter: the humanitarian position Austria has taken in the past  is taking at present and will take in the future.23.	Since regaining full independence  the Austrian Government and the Austrian people have received several hundred thousand refugees. Those who wished to continue their journey were able to do so; those who wished to remain in Austria have become citizens  integrated into the Austrian people. They thus have become not a source of unrest but an element contributing to peace in Europe. Furthermore  the Austrian Government and the Austrian people have  since I960 alone  greatly facilitated  and indeed made possible  the transit through Austria of about 165 000 persons seeking to make their future home in Israel.24.	Austria would have acted  and did act  in the same way also towards all other people irrespective of their nationality  their colour  their race  their religion and their political convictions. This  too  remains valid for the future.25.	I do not say this because the Austrian Government or the Austrian people expect special recognition for it  but because it seems to me that a reference to past practice is the most appropriate means to dispel misunderstandings and misinterpretations about Austria's humanitarian attitude now and in the future. The Austrian Prime Minister  Bruno Kreisky  made this abundantly clear when  on 29 September 1973  he said:""Austria is committed to the principles of democracy and humanitarianism  and I wish to emphasize that nothing will change in our basic attitude  our laws or our humanitarian practice because of what has happened or what may yet happen. In the interest of maintaining peace within Austria  certain minor changes will be made  but there will be no fundamental changes in our humanitarian approach. Austria remains a country which extends asylum to everyone who feels persecuted  and offers everyone who wishes to reach another country via Austria the opportunity to do so.""That is Austria's position. My Government is also ready to co-operate with international organizations  in particular the United Nations  if they are in a position to accept part of the responsibility which in the past Austria has carried alone.26.	Permit me finally to return briefly to the problems facing the United Nations. The Secretary-General of the United Nations  to whom we pay tribute for his devoted work on behalf of our world Organization  asked in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization the question:""Do the majority of Member States really want an organization which is more than a conference machinery and a forum for the pursuit of national policies? Do they really want an organization which can play a useful and active role in focusing international efforts on the solution of the most difficult and controversial problems and which in doing so will in certain situations develop an impetus of its own?"" 27.	My Government's answer to that question is a very short and simple one  based both on Austria's own interests and on the principle of international solidarity. The answer is  Yes  we want such a world Organization  and we are prepared to work together with other nations for it."
"7",427,"BDI",28,1973,"﻿126. From this international rostrum I have the honour of transmitting the message of fraternity and solidarity which His Excellency Colonel Michel Micombero  President of the Republic and Head of the Government of Burundi  addresses on behalf of his people — struggling to safeguard its independence and the results of its popular revolution of 28 November 1966 — to the other peoples of the world involved in the same struggle for the triumph of the ideals of peace  security  social justice and for the elimination of colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism and imperialism in all its forms.127.	It is also my pleasant duty to extend  on behalf of the Government of Burundi  the warmest and most sincere congratulations to President Leopoldo Benites and to the other officers of the Assembly who have just been elected to bring the work of the twenty-eighth session to a successful conclusion.128.	The choice of a distinguished diplomat like Mr. Benites  whose personality  confidence and objectivity are so highly esteemed  both in his own country and in the rest of the world  constitutes a sure pledge and an earnest of the success of this session.129.	On behalf of the active solidarity of our peoples  we know that the struggle for political and economic liberation in Latin America  Asia and Africa is something which Ambassador Benites not only cherishes  but which also constitutes for him j sacred duty.130.	My delegation will firmly support the initiatives and decisions which he will be called upon to take as President with a view to the attainment of the objectives of our Organization and in order to bring about respect for the principles of our Charter.131.	Permit me to pay a well-deserved tribute to our President's predecessor  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczyriski  who conducted our deliberations with brilliant intelligence  unshakeable faith in the Organization and high diplomatic talents. The progressive countries of the world highly esteem the stand of the Polish People's Republic for peace  decolonization and economic and social development  objectives which our outgoing President himself championed during the session and in other circumstances.132.	I have  furthermore  the honour of conveying to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  Secretary-General of the United Nations  my sincere congratulations for the record of his activities this year. Once again we should like to express to our distinguished Secretary-General our great admiration for the tact  patience and devotion which he has displayed in the difficult and delicate task of international affairs. We were particularly moved by Mr. Waldheim's efforts this year to bring about the triumph of the ideals of peace and security  and the development of friendly relations among peoples.133.	On 18 September 1973 [2117th meeting] the United Nations was strengthened by the entry of three new Member States: the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. My delegation is gratified at this decision  which is so appropriate for the international community. The principle of universality of our Organization does require  in fact  the representation of the greatest possible number of States so that all peoples can feel involved in the problems of universal peace and the economic and social development of nations  whatever their location or size. That is why we greet with enthusiasm the admission of the three new Members  which  for us  constitutes a new stage on the road towards the emancipation of colonized peoples. We expect from the two German States a major contribution to the solution of problems which are paralysing international society  such as decolonization  underdevelopment  the exploitation of man by man  and the scourge of racism.134.	Every year most of us travel thousands and thousands of miles to come to this rostrum in order to take stock of the activities and results of our Organization  from both the political and the economic point of view. Our presence will also enable us to gain some insight into the future prospects for the whole of mankind.135.	The people of Burundi  peace-loving and liberty- loving  warmly greeted the victories won and the successes recorded in recent years by the other peoples of the world that have inflicted resounding defeats on the imperialist and colonialist forces. In Africa independent States have had to face divisive manoeuvres and plots of all kinds hatched by imperialists with a view to the collapse of institutions and even the dislocation of nations. But the progressive forces  supported by the revolutionary forces of the world  have- repulsed victoriously the criminal assaults of these enemies of the human race. Other sovereign States have been the victims of aggression on the part of the Portuguese colonial regimes and the racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia. Here again these acts of aggression and intimidation have met with the revolutionary determination of worthy and valiant peoples who are always ready to repulse triumphantly the enemy  whatever the aid granted these regimes by the imperialist and neo-colonialist Powers. Neo-colonialist Powers have done everything in their power to oppose sovereign and independent States with the purpose of weakening the anti-imperialist front  but the vigilance and wisdom of Africa have confounded them.136.	The hour of victory against economic domination and cultural alienation has arrived in other African States which have taken energetic and revolutionary measures to win their independence and safeguard their authentic cultural heritage in spite of threats and blackmail of all kinds.137.	The trends towards national emancipation have forced the colonialist regimes to decamp from vast territories seized by the national liberation movements at the cost of the blood of the worthy sons and daughters of Africa. The war waged by Israel against the Arab countries and its permanent usurpation of the land of the Palestinian people have aroused the anger and condemnation of all peace-loving and justice-loving peoples. The Arab Republic of Egypt and other Arab countries which have been the victims of imperialist and Zionist aggression have been supported by all revolutionary peoples in their just cause.138.	In Asia  the peoples of Indo-China are marching inexorably towards final victory. Imperialism at bay shrinks at nothing to shed the blood of innocent people. In spite of the dimensions of the means of destruction used in that part of the world  every day the laurel of victory is held aloft by millions of fighters for freedom and honour.139.	In Latin America  liberation movements are gaining ground in spite of the heinous and criminal acts of despair  like the event which has just occurred and afflicted the Chilean people. But the blood of President Allende constitutes the revolutionary ferment which is out of the reach of the bullets of the imperialists and their lackeys.140.	The peace-loving States and peoples of the world are determined today more than ever to wage a decisive struggle  a struggle against hegemony and political  economic and cultural expansionism. However  we consider that this evolution of the international situation should not permit us to cherish any illusions. Real dangers continue to constitute a serious threat to international peace and security  to the independence and sovereignty of States.141.	The primary objective of the United Nations is the maintenance of peace in the world and the harmonious development of all peoples  and we are forced to note that we are still far from having attained these noble principles and objectives.142.	Of course  for some years now there has existed a climate of entente among the great Powers because of the strengthening and development of their mutual relations. This situation has succeeded in reducing the tensions and dangers of a generalized war. However  in spite of the provisions of the Charter  which prohibit the use of force in international relations  the threat or use of force for aggressive purposes against third-world countries is now assuming alarming proportions. The antagonisms of the super-Powers encourage wars and localized crises in certain parts of the world  thus leading to intervention in the internal affairs of other States.143.	It seems to me essential for this twenty-eighth session to lay down new bases for international relations founded on justice  security and development.144.	Colonialism  neo-colonialism and racism .gravely jeopardize peace and the economic development of the African continent. In Africa  colonialism  neo-colonialism and apartheid constitute a grave threat to peace and the development of the continent. For several years  resolutions have been adopted in favour of the liberation of the whole of Africa. Today  with the complicity of those very people who take those decisions  the situation has not developed in favour of liberty. On the contrary  it has deteriorated every day.145.	In South Africa  an oppressive regime is being inflicted upon the population with the full knowledge of the Members of this Organization  upon millions of human beings who are kept in the chains of slavery on the pretext that they are what are called men of colour. These barbarous crimes are encouraged by Powers which themselves only recently suffered from the scourge of mankind    namely  racism and apartheid. Have certain founding Members of our Organization already forgotten that it was to fight effectively against such scourges that the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco? Far from applying the resolutions adopted against the Pretoria regime  certain Powers encourage that regime by all available means in its horrible policy of escalation designed to achieve the moral and physical exhaustion of a helpless people. The regime of racial discrimination and apartheid has just increased its toll of victims by the massacre of African workers  which include a large number of African nationals from independent neighbouring countries. Provocations against what are called coloured men by the Pretoria regime are not even limited to the freedom fighters; the weapons of this reactionary police State cut down anyone and everyone at the whim of the South African leaders of the moment. This enslavement is supported by the NATO Powers and Israel.146.	In Namibia  while the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity [OAU] had authorized the establishment of contacts in order to ascertain South African intentions  Pretoria showed by its most categorical refusal that it had no intention of withdrawing fromNamibia. On the contrary  the racist Government has just undertaken a programme which it calls ""Bantustanization""  which constitutes a programme for the Balkanization of the Territory and for pitting Namibian against Namibian.147.	The policy of the fragmentation of Namibian territory pursued by Pretoria is tangible proof that South Africa is not ready to withdraw from international territory  but rather that Pretoria in fact wishes to extend apartheid there in its most criminal form.148.	The good faith of OAU and the United Nations did not win a favourable response from the Pretoria Government  and that is why the summit meeting of African countries held to celebrate the tenth anniversary of OAU considered that the mandate entrusted to the Secretary- General of the United Nations should be suspended because it was fruitless.149.	The delegation of the Republic of Burundi condemns once again the savage colonialism which South Africa inflicts on Namibia and the black people of South Africa. It is high time  indeed  for the Namibian people to be consulted about their own fate. The integrity and independence of the Namibian territory should be safeguarded.150.	In Zimbabwe  after almost eight years  the rebel regime of Salisbury is defying the United Nations. Indeed  in spite of the many resolutions condemning Rhodesia  in spite of Security Council resolution 253(1968) imposing economic sanctions  the racist regime of Salisbury is still in power. This situation might have changed if the United Kingdom had had good faith and if certain countries had not violated the economic embargo decided upon by the United Nations. In these circumstances  my Government requests once again that the United Kingdom should use all the means available to it  including armed force  to grant independence to the Zimbabwe people and to put an end to the rebel regime of Salisbury.151.	My Government would venture also to remind the Member States in this Assembly that countries which deliberately violate resolutions of the Security Council and the recommendations of the General Assembly are in contravention of their commitments under the United Nations Charter.152.	What is worse  the encouraged arrogance of the . Rhodesian rebels has prompted the regime to use economicwarfare against Zambia  which has done nothing wrong except to be governed by Africans whose attachment to democracy and the fraternization of races is offensive to the Fascists in Salisbury.153.	All peace-loving countries  confident in the United Nations and in OAU  are behind the Government of Zambia in its valiant and noble struggle for the triumph of the objectives of peace based on the liberation of Zimbabwe.154.	In Angola  Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau the revolutionary liberation is irreversible. The blind obstinacy of Portugal has led it to perpetuate its outrageous exploitation of African territories. The arrogant and reactionary ideas of the Lisbon authorities are a disgrace to that country  which boasts of having stifled-unsuccessfully  fortunately — theupsurge of emancipation of the colonized peoples. It is running against the current of history still to dream of a colonial empire when independence and sovereignty have now become the inalienable rights of peoples.155.	Portugal cherishes illusions by persisting in defying the recommendations of the United Nations and failing to heed the appeals of faith and goodwill which call upon it to put an end to its horrible colonial practices. The Lisbon Government is aware of the important defeats that have been meted out to it at the hand of the liberation movements. Thanks to the support of certain Powers  it believes it will stand fast for a long time to come. It should be disabused  because a people determined to win its liberty shrinks before no might or force.156.	Thus the fighting people of Guinea-Bissau have just proclaimed their independence. My delegation is happy to announce to this Assembly that the Government of Burundi recognized the Government of the democratic Republic of Guinea-Bissau from the very first days of its existence and will do everything in its power to support it. We would convey to the young State of Guinea-Bissau our most fraternal congratulations upon the memorable event of its liberation from the forces of colonial oppression. We now consider that the presence in Guinea-Bissau of a single Portuguese soldier constitutes an act of aggression against an independent and sovereign State. I take the opportunity offered by that well-deserved independence to pay a tribute to the promoter of the Guinean revolution  Amilcar Cabral  Secretary-General of the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde  the eternal hero of the struggle for the freedom and dignity of man.157.	In the light of the recent crimes committed in the regions under Portuguese domination  the Republic of Burundi once again calls upon the General Assembly to expel Portugal from the United Nations  because the grave crimes committed by Portugal against the peoples of Mozambique  Angola and Guinea-Bissau are a serious threat to peace and human dignity. Portuguese colonialism is a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter.158.	The situation in the Middle East remains tense and explosive because Israel continues to oppress and humiliate the Arabs under its control and is persisting in its blind and pointless policy of provocation and aggression towards the Arab countries of the region.159.	Until very recently my country still cherished the hope that it would see Israel come to reason by committing itself — as international opinion has ceaselessly called upon it to do  and as its own interests require-to a just  equitable and lasting solution of the problem that is almost as old as our Organization.160.	But we are forced to note that Israel remains a factor for instability in the region  which it is impossible to eliminate  and Israel is doing everything in its power to oppose any attempt  whatever the source  to re-establish peace and security in the region. It has opposed with blind obstinacy the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  the unanimous adoption of which was welcomed by the overwhelming majority of the States Members of our Organization as a decisive step towards a normalization of the situation in that troubled part of our planet. On the strength of unconditional support from a super-Power  it has ceaselessly derided and disregarded the wise and pressing appeals of the international community to reconsider its attitude towards the martyred people of Palestine and neighbouring Arab countries by guaranteeing the right of the Palestinians to a worthy and decent existence and by respecting the sovereignty  security and territorial integrity of its Arab neighbours.	' .161.	But  what is worse  the world is witnessing for the first time the implementation and systematic use at the State level of piracy and terrorism as a method of government and as a norm of behaviour in international relations.162.	The innocent victims of the shooting down of a Libyan civil aircraft over occupied Sinai are there to remind us that Israeli terrorism now no longer spares anyone  even innocent passengers ignorant of all the facts of the Middle East.163.	Everything is happening as if Israel were assuming that the patience of the international community is unlimited and that it has been given a blank cheque to persist in its policy of escalation of terror  violence  hate and murder.164.	The tragedy of the Middle East in general and the Palestinian people in particular deserves particular attention.165.	Do we really need to remind the Assembly that the restoration to the people of Palestine of international rights constitutes the fundamental condition for the establishment of a lasting peace in the region? The struggle of the people of Palestine for its usurped territory represents the effort of a people determined to recover its self-determination and sovereignty.166.	The Member States of our international Organization should offer material and political assistance to the Palestinian people in accordance with the spirit of solidarity which should characterize Member States whenever imperialism  colonialism or neo-colonialism seeks to wound the dignity of a State and to call its existence into question.167.	That is why my delegation considers the time has come for the members of this Assembly individually or collectively to take the measures necessary to make Israel respect the international commitments it undertook in freely adhering to our Charter. For its part  the Republic of Burundi will interpret its responsibilities in that sense until Israel ceases its acts of aggression and expansionism and until the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine are restored.168.	Thanks to its unshakeable courage  its high sense of dignity and its fierce determination to fight for the safeguarding and strengthening of liberty  progress and independence  the valiant people of Viet-Nam has driven its enemies to capitulation.169.	The signing of the Paris agreements on Viet-Nam without any doubt constitutes a brilliant victory for theViet-Namese people over the forces of occupation and aggression which for 12 years have unleashed their forces in successive waves over that part of Indo-China. We are particularly gratified at that happy event because my country has ceaselessly condemned the unjust  cruel  absurd and cowardly war inflicted upon the Viet-Namese people. The struggle of the Viet-Namese people proves eloquently and poignantly that the threat of violence  recourse to brutal and massive force  blackmail and intimidation avail nothing against a people which is proud and determined.170.	We call upon the imperialist and reactionary forces of this world to reflect on that example of heroism and sacrifice.171.	My delegation calls upon all parties to the Paris agreements to abide scrupulously by the spirit and letter of those agreements  as does the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam. Viet-Nam  which for 28 years has known nothing but the horrors of war  will now be able to devote its time  its energies and its enthusiasm to the tasks of national reconstruction for the welfare and prosperity of its people.c172.	The news of the opening of dialogue between the two Koreas has filled us with joy and hope.173.	The free determination of peoples is a sacred principle of our Charter. Therefore  the United Nations should refrain from any act or initiative which might constitute an obstacle to the reunification of the Korean people.174.	For that reason  to permit the Korean people to decide freely on its fate and future  free from interference and outside pressure  my delegation considers that the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea should be dissolved without further delay and that all foreign occupation troops should evacuate Korean territory. The United Nations flag cannot cover acts of aggression in any part of the world.175.	At a time when the two Koreas are embarking on the road to reunification and renewal of ties  it seems to us that the idea of the admission of the two Koreas to the United Nations constitutes a plot against the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people.176.	The situation in the Kingdom of Cambodia is very familiar to us. There  a legitimate and popular Government was overthrown by an imperialist Power  which everyone knows acted through Cambodian puppets. In order to give a respite to the clique of corrupt and suborned elements who usurped power at Phnom Penh  foreign troops of occupation have been landed in Cambodia and have imposed an atrocious  cruel and ruthless war on the peaceful people of that country. Cambodian patriots  in response to the appeal of Prince Norodom Sihanouk of 23 March 1970  did not hesitate a moment before launching the decisive offensive against the Cambodian traitors and foreign forces of aggression. Today  the United National Front of Cambodia and the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia control more than nine-tenths of the population of the country and more than nine-tenths of Cambodian territory.177.	It is the duty of the international community to do everything in its power to see to it that Cambodia becomes once again the oasis of peace that it has always been  thanks to the wise  skilful and far-sighted policy of its illustrious Head of State  Prince Norodom Sihanouk.178.	In Cambodia the restoration of peace requires  as one of its pre-conditions  the immediate withdrawal of all aggressive and occupying troops  the end of foreign intervention and strict respect for the right of the Cambodian people to self-determination.179.	The United Nations  for its part  should draw the logical inferences from the situation in Cambodia and also from the resolutions adopted by the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Algiers from 5 to 9 September last [see A/9330 and Corr.l].180.	Since the Government of Prince Norodom Sihanouk controls nine-tenths of Cambodian territory and the vast majority of the people of that country  and since the non-aligned countries represent two-thirds of the Members of our Organization and recognize Prince Sihanouk's Government as the legal and legitimate Government of Cambodia  the present session of the General Assembly should restore to the Government headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk its legitimate rights in the United Nations.181.	If the objectives and purposes of the Organization are still valid and relevant  the revision of the Charter becomes an urgent matter if we are to take account of new realities and developments in the international situation.182.	The right of veto  which has been accorded to five Members of the United Nations  has been used by some of them to block progress  peace and the emancipation of peoples. Without going too far back into the history of our Organization  I would simply remind the Assembly of the veto cast by the United Kingdom in February 1972 at the meetings of the Security Council in Addis Ababa in opposition to the solution of the Rhodesian problem by constitutional and peaceful means. I would also recall the different vetoes used by the other Powers in order to oppose any attempt to break the present deadlock in the Middle East crisis.183.	The veto  besides being a flagrant violation of the principle of the equality of States  constitutes a means of keeping whole peoples and regions in a state of humiliation  injustice  oppression and agony. It should therefore be abolished because its abuse is contrary to the spirit and objectives of the Charter.184.	But  apart from the veto  the actual membership of the Council  in my delegation's view  constitutes a shocking anachronism. It is absolutely unjustifiable to entrust the tasks of peace-keeping only to the great Powers most of which  modern history shows  have been and still are involved in the conflicts and crises which have shaken our planet. We must act in accordance with the evidence: you cannot be judge and party at the same time.185.	Until the General Assembly really becomes a world parliament and has effective and increased power in the maintenance of international peace and security  we think the Security Council should be composed in such a way as to be a faithful reflection of the international community  taking strict account of geographical distribution and trends of opinion and political tendencies in the General Assembly.186.	It is only then and then alone that all the peoples of the world  duly and democratically associated in the conduct of world affairs  will be able to enjoy the benefits of peace and international security.187.	My country has no claim to possess nuclear weapons  but it has no less interest therefore in the problems of disarmament. To avoid the temptations of a large-scale war which would profit no one  the General Assembly should demand the elimination of all existing nuclear stockpiles in the world and the banning of all tests of nuclear and chemical weapons. A world conference should replace the present Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  so that the fundamental problems of disarmament should no longer be discussed outside the framework of the United Nations.188.	Within the same context  the military alliances born of the last war  which fall within the framework of the cold war  should be dissolved. Similarly  the dismantling of all military bases is a necessity  as is the withdrawal of foreign troops from all parts of the world  because we do not recognize the right of any State to appoint itself an international policeman.189.	The threat of nuclear war should be removed by the destruction of accumulated stockpiles and by a permanent ban on such stockpiles.190.	The arms race  the stockpiling and the accumulation of war material is liable to provoke such panic among those Powers which do not possess nuclear weapons that  in order to break the monopoly  additional nuclear Powers are going to emerge  a phenomenon which will lead to a permanent state of escalation and the multiplication of hotbeds of terror. The money which will be swallowed up in such rivalry will serve only to satisfy the vanity of the great Powers.191.	We firmly believe that the enormous sums of money spent on armaments could serve the highly humanitarian cause  namely  the improvement of the standard of living of all peoples and particularly the economic and social development of the third world. The Republic of Burundi is convinced that the contribution to development which could be mad? by nuclear technology used for peaceful purposes will be most useful  while the resources released by disarmament could be used to improve standards of living  to intensify the struggle against under-development  and to narrow the economic gap for the benefit of all peoples rich and poor. Without claiming to possess the monopoly of truth  we can declare  without risk of error  that there does exist a real cause-and-effect relationship between disarmament and development. The disarmament equation  the equation that disarmament equals development  has become a truth which requires no proof.192.	Despite certain hotbeds of tension which threaten world peace  there exists for the time being a new political climate of detente among the great Powers. This new climate will perhaps make it possible for us to deal with greater lucidity with the problems posed by poverty  hunger and ignorance. We must  if we wish to safeguard universal peace  narrow the gap separating the rich and poor countries  a gap which for the time being is constantly on the increase- The developed countries should do more to avoid the crises which dangerously disturb international trade relations.193.	If  for two years  the United Nations has had to stress forcefully that the economic development of the world has to be planned by an appropriate strategy  it intended by this to remedy the errors of the First United Nations Development Decade and accelerate the upsurge of the poor countries over the years and in this way. to harmonize the equilibrium of our planet. This Strategy requires that the rich make certain sacrifices by using a part of their wealth to assist the developing countries to emerge from their uncomfortable economic position.194.	We are obliged to note that over the last two years the Second United Nations Development Decade has brought with it more disappointment than progress. Indeed  the donor countries for the most part continue to get poorer  while the rich countries become more and more prosperous. Furthermore  the rich countries continue to disregard the lot of the poor countries and their survival  since world trade is developing more and more to the advantage of the industries of the consumer society.195.	The present economic evolution of the world must change its course if we are in the future to ensure world economic equilibrium  the harmony of our relationships and  consequently  universal peace.196.	The failures of the first two years of the Decade have been accentuated by the world monetary crisis which has beset the Western currencies  has disorganized their exchange relations and is weakening the impact of our own reserves. Frequent periods of inflation and the unilateral measures taken by the rich countries to deal with them have affected and continue to disorganize the economies of the weak countries  although they bear no part of the responsibility for these crises. Hence  a feeling of frustration  mixed with indignation  has obliged us to ask the rich countries to control their economies and to institute machinery capable of preventing these monetary crises which have today become only too frequent. While urgent and concrete measures should be taken to reorganize the Western currency system  we think it essential that a new world monetary system should replace the existing one  because it is no longer in keeping with the interests of our planet.197.	The Burundi delegation is convinced that to have a monetary system which would safeguard the interests of the partners we can no longer confine ourselves to observing passively the changes worked out by the Club of Ten. All interested countries  small or great  rich or poor  should be not only consulted but associated intimately with the creation of a new world monetary order.198.	The international economic balance cannot be restored simply by a monetary diagnosis. It requires that other parameters be used. We are prompted  therefore  to express the wish that a healthier commercial co-operation be established in our trade.199.	The developing countries have so far been constantly suffering from a deterioration in the terms of trade. Primary products are often subject to quotas and are seldom fairly priced. The present system must change in favour of the poor countries. We hope that the major negotiations which are soon to begin will remove all the obstacles to the intensification of trade between rich and poor countries. We must establish a new system  which will open up new markets to the products of the under- industrialized countries  provide just and fair remuneration for primary products and allow healthy trade co-operation. It is in the field of trade that the developed countries can underpin the efforts of developing countries in dignity and reciprocity by a system permitting all parties to participate equally in the harmonious development of the world economy  and  in particular  the economy of the third world  so that everyone will be able to enjoy fully the fruits of his fairly remunerated efforts.200.	My delegation considers that  in order to accelerate the economic development of the poor countries  the United Nations should direct the policy of international financing organs towards respect for the strategy which it has outlined. The World Bank and its group of institutions should adopt a more flexible approach to the plans presented by the poor countries  particularly the least advanced.201.	But unfortunately we have had to witness political criteria affecting the financing of third-world plans. My delegation  therefore  unreservedly condemns that conduct on the part of international financial organs. Such an attitude constitutes intervention in the internal affairs of a nation.202.	We feel  similarly  that the criterion of profitability should be interpreted with generosity and that account should be taken particularly of the level of economic development of the recipient countries. Otherwise'  the objectives of the Second United Nations Development Decade could be seriously jeopardized.203.	Certain Governments have raised their voices in this Assembly to denounce the sinister activities of multinational companies and their bad effect on the development of their economies. We share the same concern with regard to these companies which  with the complicity of certain major Powers  have been preventing the developing countries from the exercise of their sovereignty over their own resources.204.	Solutions should be adopted to permit the third- world countries to dispose fully of their own resources and freely to decide the lines of their own economic and social development.205.	Among the developing countries there is a group of 25 which have been classified as the least advanced countries on our planet. Urgent appeals have been made at meetings of international organizations to accord them privileged treatment in the provision of capital and in trade relations. But those appeals have gone unheeded. Today they are still the most underprivileged. That is a situation which  if solutions are not found  is liable to create even more serious cleavages in levels of development.206.	To help these countries emerge from their present situation  some measures should be contemplated and put into practice. The more advanced countries  in the name of universal solidarity  should help the least advanced by lifting non-tariff barriers  eliminating quota restrictions and reducing freight costs. Those measures should be taken for the land-locked countries also  particularly because most of them are also among the least advanced countries.207.	At a time when the General Assembly is meeting  a distressing situation still prevails in part of our globe. The Sahelian region has been afflicted by drought  as members are all aware. The peoples of that region continue to suffer from the effects of this natural disaster. In order to normalize the situation and to erase the painful traces of this drought  years of tireless effort will be required. Let us hope that universal solidarity will contribute even more by assisting the Governments of these regions to hasten their return to normality.208.	The search for peace  the elimination of injustice and shameless exploitation among States are without any doubt among the most important and most powerful factors in the promotion of the prosperity and progress of mankind. To succeed in this noble task which the United Nations has assumed  all the nations of the world will have to agree resolutely to march hand in hand to achieve great victories against these scourges of mankind.209.	It is in that spirit of solidarity that I express hopes for the success of this session and for the well-being and prosperity of mankind."
"8",474,"BEL",28,1973,"﻿419.	 Mr. President  I should like first of all to congratulate you upon your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. For the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights we are proud to have as President a man who has the courage of his convictions.420.	It was not my intention to mention in this statement the problem of the Middle East. Tragic circumstances compel me to do so.421.	With the prolongation of the cease-fire  the hope of a diplomatic  just and balanced solution was born  andBelgium had begun to believe that 1973 would at last witness the opening of true negotiations. The breach of the cease-fire sets back the chances of a negotiated solution and again plunges this region of the world into the horrors of war.422.	The situation is complex. Egypt and Syria consider that Israel's refusal to withdraw from the occupied territories  its reluctance to accept the principle of non-acquisition of territory by force  could no longer be tolerated. The Palestinian people did not see approaching the moment when its legitimate aspirations would at long last be taken into consideration; Israel was becoming irritated at the difficulties of beginning a negotiation which would bring a peace that none of the parties would contest and by which its right to existence would be confirmed  thereby removing forever the spectre of its destruction.423.	Belgium was cognizant of the sincerity of the positions of each of the parties  believed in their desire to conclude peace and felt their concern at the prolonged deadlock. But it could not resign itself to believing that weapons would be preferred to diplomacy. War sometimes brings victories; rarely does it bring solutions. We have known this for thousands of years. In such circumstances  our Organization must not be discouraged; it has the obligation to attempt once again to achieve the reconciliation and pacification for which it was created.424.	The Security Council is in session — that is its duty. In our opinion  it must order rapidly the cessation of all fighting  and this without seeking first to determine the responsibility for this new confrontation.425.	Then  this time  and without delay  Security Council resolution 242 (1967) must be implemented.426.	My country  together with its European partners  will contribute to this end in order to establish secure and recognized boundaries in that region that are guaranteed by international commitments and protected by the presence of international peace-keeping forces. A situation of this kind would have made the present confrontation impossible.427.	I shall say no more for the moment  but  as a European country that has known two deadly wars  I appeal to the Security Council to take action to stop the bloodshed.428.	Mr. President  you are a citizen of Latin America  that vast continent whose peoples are striving to create a promising future. A gigantic task is being carried out in hope  and also in suffering and pain. With profound concern my country followed the evolution of the situation in Chile. The Belgian Government condemned most formally the overthrow by force of democratically elected bodies  and I cannot remain silent or fail to voice our concern regarding the maintenance of human and political freedoms in a country that is dear to us for more than one reason.429.	In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add. 1] the Secretary-General emphasized the progress achieved by our Organization in itssearch for universality. We are happy to welcome the representatives of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. As a European  I have special reasons for being gratified at the admission to the United Nations of the two German States. Their admission is the result of a realistic and courageous policy followed by the leaders of both States. It is also the fruit and the symbol  one might say  of the evolution we have seen in Europe and throughout the world of late. Cold war tensions are followed by detente; the era of multiple confrontations is succeeded by the present  the time for negotiation.430.	We must underline the fact that the two German States sought to complete the normalization of their relations through their entry into our world Organization. The logical effect of this admission  it seems to me  should be the abrogation of the provisions of Articles 53 and 107 of the Charter  which mention ""enemy States"".431.	We should also like to express our concern at the persistence of certain situations which jeopardize the Organization's desire for universality. Such is the case with regard to the African Territories of Mozambique  Angola and Guinea-Bissau. In this connexion we are duty-bound to note with regret that resolution 322 (1972)  adopted unanimously by the Security Council on 22 November 1972  remains a dead letter in all its parts. Belgium continues to uphold this resolution  for which it voted  because it believes that the exercise of self-determination and independence cannot be refused to the peoples of those Territories.432.	The purpose of the negotiations recommended by the Security Council is to transfer power to freely elected political institutions representing the whole of the populations concerned. In its bilateral relations with Portugal  as well as in the international bodies where it sits side by side with that country  Belgium  as in the past  will strive to convince the administering Power that it is up to that Power  first and foremost  to take the necessary steps to that end.433.	We are gratified to find that a spirit of mutual understanding has permitted the authentic representatives of Papua New Guinea and the Australian Government to proclaim the independence of that territory not later than 1975. The Commonwealth of the Bahamas has already joined us  following fruitful negotiations with the former administering Power. May these two glowing testimonies of accession to independence through negotiation encourage Portugal to do likewise.434.	At the same time that it reaffirmed the inalienable right of the peoples of the Portuguese Territories to self-determination and independence  the Security Council recognized the legitimacy of their struggle to acquire that right. In this spirit Belgium is prepared to consider the granting  through international organizations  of humanitarian assistance to the victims of that struggle.435.	We also express the hope that in Namibia  Southern Rhodesia  Korea and Viet-Nam  decolonization and detente will very soon  for the happiness of those peoples and in the interest of relations among nations  add to the universal character of our Organization.436.	The basis of the two trends — decolonization and detente in terms of closer co-operation among all countries of the world — is unquestionably the recognition of fundamental human rights. To desire detente is to renounce the aims of war  even when one believes that one can achieve them through non-violent means.437.	To desire detente is to eliminate the fear of an attack. It is to engender at the same time security  which is the first condition for any co-operation. True peace  a peace that is not a mere armistice  implies the rule of law; that is to say  a state where the rule of law prevails and respect for human rights is recognized for all citizens without distinction.438.	The sometimes uncertain and always cruel play of unbridled nationalism is certainly not the best road to peace. This is a truth that the peoples of Europe learned to their sorrow and at great cost and much suffering. This truth so dearly bought has led them to establish a ""Community"" as a framework for their reconciliation and co-operation.439.	The political purpose of that Community  as instituted by treaties  was recalled and confirmed by the summit conference of its nine members held in Paris in October 1972. At the same time  that Conference spelled out the terms of the challenge that the peoples of Europe intend to take up. By virtue of that challenge  the European Community proposes in particular to make a creative contribution  within the limits of its human  intellectual and material resources  and to affirm its own concepts in international relations in keeping with its desire for an open policy for progress  peace and co-operation.440.	The initial role of the European Community will be to show that it is possible to constitute a powerful entity on the production level and on that of human creativity  fully adapted to the industrial and technological requirements of our time  without  however  yielding to the temptations of what some have called the nationalist universalism of the great Powers. We believe that the realization of this ambition will be greatly facilitated if  at the same time and progressively  the constituent rules of the universal community grouping all the nations of the world are clearly spelled out on the basis of the provisions of the Charter.441.	It is in this spirit that my country  like the other members of the European Community  wishes to avail itself of the opportunity afforded by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. To consolidate detente and security in Europe means to seek out and create the necessary conditions for multifaceted co-operation among all the countries of the continent. As a prior condition to the search for security and co-operation of Europe as a whole  it was necessary to normalize relations between the two German States. Similarly  and in a wider context  we believe that normalized relations between all the European States — States whose economic and social systems are different — should provide an essential contribution to the establishment of the world community.442.	I have sought to place the integration efforts of the countries of the European Community in the perspective of a more distant goal  that of the universal community of all nations. In our view  talks and negotiations between Eastand West represent the next stage and a step towards that ultimate objective.443.	The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe must therefore be placed on a sound and secure basis. In this connexion  we attach particular importance to the development of the human relationships with which the Conference must concern itself. On that occasion too  a step must be taken towards enlarging the exercise of human rights.444.	We consider  indeed  that detente in Europe will be neither complete nor lasting so long as people are unable to meet together freely  without hindrance of any kind  so long as they are unable to express themselves without constraint and see what they wish to see  so long as there are still obstacles and barriers that prevent those who wish to do so from reading or being read.445.	In this context I associate myself with the warning of my British colleague  who stated that detente must be genuine and not an illusion [2128th meeting  para. 124].446.	The lot that we assign to a man — considered as an individual  as a member of a family or of the various groups constituting our societies — the lot of man determines to a great extent the quality of the relationships we propose to establish among States.447.	I do not lose sight of the fact that order and stability in international relations demand strict observance of the rule of non-interference in the internal affairs of States. This is the raison d'etre and the wisdom of Article 2  paragraph 7  of the Charter. Belgium has no intention of departing from that precept. However  it must be emphasized that non-interference cannot mean indifference  insensitivity  lack of concern for others. It seems obvious that  if it is impossible for us to build between us bridges of a certain human solidarity  the limits of our forthcoming agreement will be extremely narrow  not to say distorted.448.	What we have in mind is a detente that is not fictitious  but real and genuine  a detente among open societies. To my way of thinking  a detente of this kind implies not only a continuing exchange of products but also a guaranteed interchange of people and ideas.449.	The negotiations on balanced reduction of forces constitute a particular element in our efforts to consolidate detente in Europe; they represent at one and the same time a test and a step that could serve as an example. It is a test  for we -cannot visualize any serious effort in the matter of detente without a concomitant concern with regard to reducing the weapons for waging war or intensifying threats or tensions.450.	This concern for some tangible and voluntary manifestation of detente should be seen in the light of our concern for the further development of human relations and contacts. In point of fact  such relations and contacts have so far been limited to a strict minimum  that is  to only those absolutely necessary among the leaders and officials of the countries concerned. The negotiations on a mutually balanced reduction of forces are also a step that could serveas an example because  in the view of the Belgian Government  they could be the prelude to a general reduction of armaments throughout the world. Belgium was gratified  moreover  at the progress achieved in the contacts of the SALT negotiations. This is reassuring with regard to the commitments undertaken by the nuclear Powers on the conclusion of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)]. My country also welcomed the agreements concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union in their search for an adjustment in their bilateral relations and in their desire to reduce the risk of nuclear confrontation between the two Powers.451.	Furthermore  we have noted with satisfaction the fact that the dialogue between the United States and the People's Republic of China is proceeding in furtherance of greater stability in Asia. My Government is gratified by the progressive normalization of relations between those two great countries.452.	May I be allowed to thank the Secretary-General of our Organization for his first report on the studies conducted by the peace-research institutions [A/9130 and Add.l]. My country initiated this action because  in our opinion  fundamental research into the bases and the conditions of peace  into the sources  motivations and development of conflicts  can make a great contribution to the mission of peace of our Organization. The listing of the work already achieved is far from complete  considering that a great number of research centres have not yet responded to the action taken by the Secretary-General.453.	Furthermore  my delegation has had the opportunity on several occasions to describe the scope of our proposal  which goes much further than a simple compilation of peace-research efforts. We therefore believe that the undertaking must continue and we hope that the report which the Secretary-General will submit at the next session of the General Assembly will be more comprehensive.454.	It seems to me  moreover  that the basic research will be useful not only in connexion with the problems of war and peace in the conventional meaning of those terms. In the context of our relations in times of peace  the' research could also make an essential contribution to the thinking of statesmen and to informing public opinion. What is more  this has already been done. I have in mind  inter alia  the line of thinking to which the work performed at the instigation of the Club of Rome has given rise  as well as the studies conducted by UNCTAD or in connexion with its activities.455.	The development of international economic relations over recent years shows that the concept of collective economic security could usefully be studied in greater depth both at the research level and concurrently  preferably  within the framework of the specialized agencies. Whether we are concerned with the monetary crisis  with the preparation of tariff negotiations  with the problems resulting from the existence of multinational companies  with energy requirements  or with the limits to the resources of our planet  our universal interdependence and  consequently  the usefulness of thinking seriously about the conditions for economic security  become more and more apparent.456.	It has often seemed that men discover wisdom only when compelled to do so by the force of events. It is quite possible that we may be at one of these junctures in history.457.	With increasing sharpness  the United Nations is questioning the directions being taken by the international community in the fields of economic and social development. This critical analysis is being conducted both in the light of the traditional basic tenets of the growth concept and in the light of concerns that have become more imperative  such as the population explosion and the preservation of the human environment.458.	This critical rethinking is also proceeding with a view to improving the management of the international Organization and enhancing its effectiveness. On this subject  the efforts being made to formulate working programmes and medium-term plans for the Organization and its related institutions — a matter closely linked to an improvement in budget forecasts — are gratifying.459.	The multiplicity of the problems mentioned and the complexity of the programmes undertaken make the necessity for consolidation more and more pressing  at both the conceptual and the operational level.460.	Without any doubt  it is for the Economic and Social Council and the Assembly to effect such consolidation and to become the rallying-point for thinking on the matter.461.	The adoption by the Assembly in 1970 of the International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)] provided a framework for working out the necessary consolidation. The Organization has indeed addressed itself  during the current decade  to a review and evaluation on a continuing basis of the progress achieved in implementing the Development Strategy with respect to both the developing and the industrialized countries. It is clear that by systematizing the study of development problems the Strategy will make it possible to mark the road already covered  to measure the laps that have been completed  to review the priorities set  and to lay down new guidelines.462.	As far as Belgium is concerned  co-operation with the developing countries is based on the same principles as those underlying our efforts to promote detente and cooperation in Europe. In both cases  the aim is to forge friendly links among all nations and to achieve international co-operation through the solution of international problems by promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all  as provided in Article 1 of the Charter.463.	My country is fully aware of the particular duties incumbent upon it in this matter. Economic integration  of which it is a beneficiary within the framework of the European Economic Community  is not an end in itself. The nine countries have now set up a specific framework for establishing their trade relations and their economic cooperation with the African countries and Madagascar. Important negotiations were recently begun for the purpose of extending these links to other countries and gearing them to the new requirements of development.39464.	But over and above this regional approach  the disadvantages of which should be greatly reduced following the enlargement of the Community  the Europe of the nine has set itself the goal of co-operating with the developing countries on an increasingly world-wide scale. The system of generalized preferences is the start of this trend in the direction of a more general approach.465.	The promotion of commodity agreements is also' part of this approach. As is common knowledge  the purpose of these agreements is to help to stabilize the prices of commodities and to intensify the trade of the developing countries  and this intensification should also facilitate the future multilateral trade negotiations carried out within GATT.466.	Similarly  the monetary negotiations should take into account the interests of the developing countries and the increase in the resources which may be transferred to them.467.	The recent occurrence of a tragic situation has drawn the world's attention to one particular aspect of the idea of collective economic security. I am referring here to the surge of the drought which has stricken the populations of Sahelian region in central Africa.468.	Like so many other Governments  the Belgian Government has tried to express the feeling of solidarity which has emerged spontaneously among our populations in a tangible and effective form. To the extent that our means allow  we hope that we have helped to meet the needs which were  and still are  enormous. Our aid was provided bilaterally as well as through the co-ordinating machinery set up by FAO.469.	The work done by the latter organization deserves our praise. In reading the reports of the teams we have sent into the field  I am  however  struck by the amount of improvisation which was inevitable at the initial stage of relief co-ordination. I fear that the effectiveness of the voluntary action must have suffered as a consequence.470.	In order to improve the utilization of our aid capability  action on two levels might be considered.471.	The proposal submitted by the Secretary of State of the United States for the organization of a world food conference in 1974 seems to me to meet a fundamental medium-term need. However  I think it would be advisable also to consider the usefulness of setting up permanent emergency machinery for food aid problems as a whole.472.	The field of action of this machinery would be twofold. It would be both a centre of information and study and an emergency relief agency for critical food situations. I think that such an arrangement could be developed from what is already operating within the framework of FAO.473.	I wish to limit my statement to the crisis in the Middle East and to the two major matters of constant concern to all countries: political and military detente and co-operation for development. In our opinion  the need for action in these three fields derives from the fundamental principles ofthe Charter: justice and respect for the equality of rights of peoples and individuals. Unless there is respect for such rights our Organization cannot hope to fulfil the mission entrusted to it — that of being a centre for harmonizing the action of nations in the attainment of common ends."
"9",520,"BEN",28,1973,"﻿65. Mr. President  my feelings  as from this high rostrum I address you  our Secretary-General and the representatives gathered in this august Assembly  are no more than the serene concern of the neophyte who can contribute nothing other than his faith and readiness loyally to serve the common good of mankind. However magnanimous such feelings may appear to be  I cannot refrain from rendering reality's due. And the reality is that we are here in a forum with more than a quarter of a century of experience and existence  a forum which has forged for itself practices  a style and methods of action. It therefore goes without saying that a certain amount of caution when taking positions  certain urgings to realism and moderation in the face of problems calling for vigorous and immediate solutions and a certain degree of compromise which one is called upon to accept  failing firm and unanimous decisions in the face of international situations extremely serious to peace  might well exasperate beyond endurance the indulgence and patience of those who are not accustomed to move in diplomatic circles.66.	Indeed  the echoes which flow from here to the world of the laymen leave too much room for frustration and despair.67.	But we are here because we sincerely believe that the large majority of nations of the world have decided to live together in peace and to translate into concrete measures the will of peoples to base their relations on the principles of equality and justice. Starting from this premise  one may well think that our shortcomings and failures in the face of certain international situations are due less to the lack of collective will of States to settle the problems before us than to a certain amount of national selfishness and certain prejudices of which we have not yet succeeded in ridding our minds. One may therefore well believe that this Organization can be made to serve its real purpose  namely  to safeguard and preserve peace in the world provided its Members make greater efforts to observe the provisions of the Charter.68.	Thus we believe that this Organization can still pursue its task of promoting greater justice for all. To this end  men of goodwill must place all the resources of intelligence  science and wisdom at the service of the solidarity and co-operation we seek to accomplish here. In this connexion we are happy to see that the universal purpose of our Organization is becoming stronger  and it is with true satisfaction that we welcome the admission of the German Democratic Republic  the Federal Republic of Germany and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  to whose delegations we extend our sincere congratulations.69.	Mr. President  it will therefore not be only because it is customary or in order to discharge a duty  however pleasant  that I shall speak here of your election to the presidency of this twenty-eighth session. This event has for us a deep meaning at a time when the world has its eyes turned so often towards the American subcontinent. The important changes that have been progressively but surely taking place  since the beginning of the decade  are encouraging for the future and the development of the third world  while at the same time they are disturbing the erstwhile untroubled interests of the large monopolies of the wealthy world. From the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]  prepared at Lima and held in Santiago  Chile  in April and May last year  to the meetings of the Security Council held in Panama City from 15 to 21 March and the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries in Georgetown in August 1972  the Americas will have been the centre of attraction and the high point of the solidarity of the nations of the world which struggle to reconquer their dignity and their right freely to dispose of their economic heritage.70.	Today it is you  Sir  a worthy Latin American  imbued with the purest patriotic traditions of Bolivar  who are called upon to conduct the business of this Assembly to the service of which you have already devoted more than 20 years of your diplomatic career. Your unremitting efforts and your profound devotion to the service of peace and international security do both you and your country great credit. You will understand our pleasure in working side by side with you with thesame ideals and hopes for the successful discharge of the enormous task ahead of us.71.	Before going any further  Mr. President  allow me also to pay a tribute to the glorious memory of that other son of Latin America  President Salvador Allende  that great patriot  that convinced democrat  who was so tragically assassinated when he was engaged in a decisive battle for the economic liberation of his country.72.	Our Secretary-General also deserves our praise for the perseverance and patience with which he discharges the many and delicate tasks which we entrust to him. His relentless ardour and his vigorous interventions more than measure up to the seriousness and paramount importance which he attaches to the role of this Organization for the establishment of an order of peace and confidence in multinational relations. It is a thankless task and a heavy responsibility to have to unravel the contradictions and complexities of the different systems under which our States develop. He has accepted the risk and for that we are deeply grateful.73.	Since 26 October 1972 the State of Dahomey has been governed by a team of young men opposed to all internal dissensions such as those that jeopardized the development of my country since its accession to international sovereignty. Dahomey is a small country but a country that started along the path of independence with the best possible chances for its harmonious evolution in the concert of free nations. In fact  we are generally known as a well-spring of human resources with cadres whose value is appreciated even beyond our national frontiers. With the dynamism and the inventive spirit of these cadres  we are well equipped to lead our country out of the dependence the purely nominal liquidation of which could not truly liberate us. Regrettably  what Dahomey has known over these last 12 years is a situation of indifference and avoidance of responsibilities. The politicians who held the reins in my country during that period spent the better part of that time in creating and maintaining among the masses of our population violent feelings of regionalism. During that time neo-colonialism and international imperialism had found in our country a fertile soil for the development of their manoeuvres of exploitation and enslavement. Disorder was rampant while the peoples continued to wallow in the most poignant poverty and misery. Our show-piece foreign policy had no other backing than its incoherence and enslavement to foreign anti-national interests. Our African personality had disappeared and left the field open to borrowed cultures and reactions which largely favoured the pernicious doings of our thinking masters and our exploiters. Dahomey was the sick man of Africa and the reactionary press of our foreign mandarins did not fail to so proclaim.74.	But no people can stand living forever in the fetters of shame and exploitation. On 26 October 1972 the people of Dahomey  helped by the patriotic elements of our national army  put an end to these internecine wars and resolutely undertook to free itself from foreign domination. Our political charter  elaborated for the first time in our history by all the living forces of the nation  without exception  acting in unity  was solemnlyproclaimed and adopted on 30 November 1972. The first few lines of that document give a clear idea of the new course on which we have embarked:""The fundamental characteristic and the primary source of the backwardness of our country is foreign domination. The history of that domination is the history of political oppression  of economic exploitation and cultural alienation  of interregional and intertribal contradictions. But it is also the history of the lengthy struggle of the militant people of our country who  on 26 October 1972  marked a radical break with the past and started a new policy of national independence the basis and purpose of which are its interests and its personality.""75.	I felt that it was necessary to give this information on the new Dahomey that I represent at this twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly because the generally accepted logic demands that we put our own house in order first before we judge the neatness of the home of others. The principles that guide our foreign policy are very simple  but they are also characteristic of the important changes that have taken place in our national life. We are striving to develop our foreign relations with all countries in the world without discrimination  on the basis of respect for national sovereignty  equality and mutual advantage. It is thus that since the accession to power of the revolutionary military Government we have decided in all sovereignty and in full awareness of what we are doing to normalize our relations with the People's Republic of China  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the German Democratic Republic. In so doing we have sought to prove that Dahomey will be neither the bailiwick nor the private preserve  as it were  of any Power seeking hegemony.76.	In Africa itself we have tightened our bonds of fraternal solidarity with all the countries that practise a true policy of African dignity. But we wish to state once again that the revolution that has begun in Dahomey is not directed against any State and that it excludes from the outset any discrimination in our relations with the outside world.77.	This appears to us to be very much in keeping with the development of international relations inasmuch as at the present time the developed countries themselves have just put an-end to their cold war policy and proclaimed peaceful coexistence as a means of attenuating the consequences of oppositions and contradictions between their socio-political regimes. In fact  for the first time in the history of Europe  the plenipotentiaries of developed countries have met around the same table to consider ways and means likely to favour the development of relations between their respective countries in conditions of peaceful co-operation. We cannot but rejoice  and rightly so  at this historic initiative the results of which will not fail  I hope  to have generally beneficial effects on world detente and co-operation.78.	We wish that  at the same time  the conference on general and complete disarmament would make such progress as to enable it to serve as a support for the new system of international relations that the European States are seeking to establish. It is already comforting to note that the new agreements recently concluded between the United States of America and the Soviet Union bring a fresh contribution to the cause of international peace and security. We rejoice  and again express our hope  that soon the day will come when the enormous resources at present earmarked for armaments will be devoted to economic development for the well-being of all peoples..79.	Thus we believe that it might not be inapposite at this juncture to devote as much attention as necessary to the proposal of the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union aimed at a reduction of military budgets for purposes of assistance to development [2176th meeting].80.	However  in this second half of the twentieth century  the problem of international peace and security can no longer be solved within a regional or even a continental framework. The extraordinary development of the means of communication  the equally rapid growth in awareness of the peoples of the whole world  render the question of peace and security among nations one and indivisible. There will be peace and security for all peoples on earth  or there will be peace and security for none. Of this there can be no doubt.81.	Similarly  we note with concern that  while the great Powers speak of peace and appear to do everything to achieve it in Europe  there are some among them that  discarding all international morality and prompted by selfish national interests  continue to put arms in the hands of Stateless criminals  mercenaries and adventurers of all types.82.	Yes  despite the many wise resolutions of this august Assembly  despite the general disapproval of the international community  certain Powers continue to pursue their old policy of the cannon and the big stick  pursuing as their only objective the unbridled search for huge profits through the most abject and shameless exploitation of the third-world countries.83.	Thus Africa  my own continent  remains a theatre of imperialist wars for which Portugal  South Africa  Rhodesia and their allies are responsible.84.	The Middle East remains a theatre for a war of aggression and acts of violence for which the State of Israel and its allies are responsible.85.	The peninsula of Indo-China remains a theatre for wars of domination waged by local puppets and their allies.86.	Yes  despite general condemnation by the international community  Portugal  that insignificant and wretched country  continues to pursue in Africa its anachronistic policy of exploitation and domination. In resolution 1514 (XV)  the General Assembly of the United Nations clearly defined the course that should be followed by the Government of Portugal in order to lead its former colonies to independence. But the only reply to this wise and relevant resolution that the Fascist State of Portugal has ever given was to intensify its policy ofoppression and terror against the innocent and unarmed peoples of Angola  Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique. Buttressed by the complicity of some of the great Powers  Portugal believes it can remain indefinitely in those countries against the will of enormous native populations — a grave mistake which  unfortunately  also represents a grave threat to peace.87.	Today  in the area of the Sahara under Spanish domination  we find great tension engendered by the delaying tactics of the Madrid Government  which seeks to evade its obligations under the terms of the relevant decisions of international bodies. In order to prolong a situation the maintenance of which entails serious threats to peace in Africa  and disregarding General Assembly resolution 2983 (XXVII)  the Spanish Government is endeavouring to oppose the nationalists in the Sahara with an assemblage of puppet elements who have sold out to colonialism — a serious error resulting from political short-sightedness.88.	Recent developments in the situation in Zimbabwe as a result of the adoption by the rebel racist regime of Ian Smith of measures of coercion and economic strangulation of our brothers  the people of Zambia  have indeed moved international public opinion and have stigmatised once again the Fascist type of policy being practised in that British colony. We shall never cease to repeat that the responsibility for that situation falls squarely on the shoulders of the British Government  which refuses — for reasons involving its own interests — to take strong measures against the minority regime in Salisbury. The equivocal position of London with regard to the Rhodesian rebellion acts as encouragement to those other States that violate with impunity the Security Council resolutions on economic sanctions and that provide massive military and financial assistance to the racist regime of Ian Smith. This situation is one of extraordinary gravity and as such constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.^ 89. With regard to Namibia  that Territory which South Africa continues to occupy illegally in defiance of the relevant decisions of our Organization  the situation evolves day by day towards a clearer affirmation of the rights of the Namibian people to throw off the racist yoke of the Bantustans. Despite the repressive measures and arbitrary arrests carried out by Vorster's henchmen  the Bantustan policy is daily checkmated by the dynamic action of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO].90.	The boycott by the Namibian people of the illegal elections recently organized by Pretoria clearly demonstrates that that people is mature enough to take its destiny freely and fully into its own hands. We are not unaware of the efforts made by our Secretary-General to arrive at a peaceful settlement of this problem  for which we sincerely thank him. But what can we expect in the face of the obstinacy of the authorities of South Africa in pursuing their policy of repression and torture?91.	Further  racial discrimination established as a political philosophy under the name ""apartheid' continues to be the daily lot of the black peoples of SouthAfrica. The international community has condemned this shameful policy in a multitude of resolutions. The authorities in Pretoria have nevertheless remained deaf to this general condemnation. And why? Because they too can rely on the hypocritical manoeuvres of certain Members — and not the smallest Members — of our Organization who condemn apartheid here while at the same time increasing their economic  financial and military assistance to South Africa. This ambivalent and criminal attitude  which unfortunately is one of the contradictions and disgraces of this noble Assembly  is  in our view  a political mistake on the part of the great Powers and constitutes a grave threat to international peace and security.92.	It is true that nothing can indefinitely contain the aspirations of peoples seeking to achieve their freedom. All those peoples that are oppressed today because they are calling for greater dignity and justice; all those men  women and children who are helplessly massacred today so that the resources of their countries and the fruits of their toil may be the more easily plundered — all those peoples  I say  may perhaps not be victorious today nor even tomorrow  but they will certainly win some day. Of this there can be no doubt  and we loudly proclaim to all those who assist the minority regimes that for them the final choice will lie inevitably between recognition of the rights of the majority  and complete annihilation.93.	The resounding victory of the heroic people of VietNam  after 25 years of epic struggle against foreign domination  against the most aggressive and stubborn imperialists  against the most inhuman and devastating military Powers that mankind has ever seen  and the equally resounding victory of the people of Guinea-Bissau over Portuguese imperialism  prove  if that is necessary  that there is no point in trying to dominate a people by force.94.	Allow me here  since I have an opportunity to do so  to applaud solemnly the independence of Guinea-Bissau  which the Government of my country has been happy to recognize as a sovereign State.95.	It is  therefore  through negotiation on an equal footing and not starting from positions of strength that we must seek a settlement of conflicts which threaten world peace. It is a solution of wisdom that we have  always recommended and that we recommend again. From this high rostrum and in the name of all mankind  let all Members of this august Assembly unite their forces and place them at the service of just causes so as to shorten the sufferings of our peoples and avoid the despair that could plunge us into the infernal cycle of blind and deadly hatred. We are firmly convinced  in fact  that without the massive assistance and the complaisance of some of the great Powers all these illegal regimes would have already sought and found the road to peace and understanding with those populations that they are massacring uselessly today.96.	After so many years of war and suffering the peoples of the Indo-Chinese peninsula smile with a hope mixed with concern as they glimpse an uncertain peace before them. The hope of my country is that this peace won at such high cost by the martyred people of VietNam  will prevail and repel the forces of evil. We also wish sincerely that the Government of the United States will at long last disengage itself from this part of the world and let the people of Cambodia and Laos settle their own problems without foreign interfere.97.	We also wish that the important lesson drawn from the Viet-Nam war may guide our international action for the settlement of the conflict between Israel and its neighbours in the Middle East. Escalating arms and repression are no solution to this painful problem. Since 1948 the dispersed Palestinian people have lived in moral and material misery  as everyone here is aware. What success can we expect from a dialogue with people who have been deprived of all their possessions and reduced to indigence? What can we expect of people who daily live under the contempt and taunts that is the lot of the weak? What can we expect other than acts of despair? The problem of the Palestinian people whose lands were plundered is of great concern to my country. In 1948 this Assembly recognized the right of the State of Israel to exist  but at the same time it recommended that Israel should sign a just and equitable settlement to the Palestinian problem. Israel accepted the first recommendation concerning its existence but refused to respect the second  thus creating a crisis that ever since  and today more than ever  has constituted a threat to peace and security in that area.98.	Buttressed by the unconditional support of some of the great Powers  the State of Israel openly flouts the international community and wages a policy of terror and arrogance in the Middle East.99.	It is high time that Israel becomes convinced that solution to the problem is to be found in the strict and immediate implementation of all United Nations resolutions on the Middle East. We venture to hope that the great Powers will help  so that peace may return to that region and  at long last  the Palestinian people and the Arab States may recover their legitimate and inalienable rights.100.	What has been happening in the Middle East since 6 October 1973 confirms our opinion. If the Israeli authorities have always sought to delay the solution of the problem  no effort of our Organization will prevent an armed confrontation  because no nation worthy of the name would accept a situation where a part of its territory would be permanently occupied as the result of aggression.101.	We shall have occasion  in the course of the current session  to tackle the problem of the reunification and rehabilitation of Korea. Last year we noted with pleasure the laudable efforts of the two Governments of the North and South to pass from the stage of confrontation to that of negotiation. In order to avoid foreign interference likely to compromise the important achievements of that rapprochement  we have decided to encourage the two Governments to continue their discussions outside the framework of this Organization where one of the parties was not authorized to state its point of view. Today we are happy to note that as a result of international detentethe two Governments are represented in New York by observer offices. This dual presence  however  should neither perpetuate the division of the country nor constitute a prelude to the admission of two Koreas to the United Nations. In our view  any other solution could only compromise the independent and peaceful reunification aspired to by the two parties concerned. Thus  it will be understood that the presence of foreign troops in the southern part of the country cannot have our approval. It is for this reason that my country formally demands that United Nations troops stationed in South Korea be withdrawn and that the so-called Armistice Commission be dissolved.102.	One of the fundamental objectives of the policy of the Military Revolutionary Government of Dahomey is the realization of a society where all will live happily because they will have the minimum necessary for a decent life.103.	This aim  which Dahomey shares with many other developing countries  coincides with the purposes pursued by the United Nations. The Charter of our Organization  in fact  in Article 55 of Chapter IX lays down that ""the United Nations shall promote... higher standards of living  full employment  and conditions of economic and social progress and development.""104.	By adopting the international strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]  the United Nations community once again undertook to create conditions of stability and well-being and to ensure a minimum standard of living consistent with human dignity through economic and social progress and development.105.	To attain the realization of this fundamental condition which is essential to peace and stability throughout the world  two categories of complementary instruments are envisaged in general. First of all there are national measures for mobilizing human and material resources that are controlled by each of the developing countries in their respective territory. The Head of State of Dahomey stated in this connexion that ""first we must rely on our own forces  on our own resources  on the creative initiative of the masses in our struggle to shake off the yoke of foreign domination  to develop our economy and to give our people the dignity and personality of a free people"". But these national measures must be accompanied by measures of international co-operation which  on the whole  tend to improve the quality of human resources in the developing countries by facilitating the training of men and the acquisition of techniques that will make it possible to increase the productivity of those countries.106.	Production is  however  not an end in itself. Its primary purpose is to nourish men and to make it possible to accumulate  through international trade  capital goods designed to sustain  consolidate and diversify the development process.107.	The tasks that are required to achieve development are quite clear  the methods to accomplish them well known  and yet millions of human beings throughout thethird world continue to live an anachronistic life of poverty  when they do not simply die of hunger.108.	It is by living such dramas as those that have befallen the Sahelian countries that one realizes that with the present means available  national development measures are subject to the vagaries of fate beyond the control of the developing countries. As for international co-operation  everything goes on as if the wealthy countries cannot be moved except in the face of dramas that border on the catastrophic. Lucidity  intelligence and genius seem to be bowed in indifference and hardly troubled by the daily spectacle of hunger  misery and poverty. The generous impetus that in the recent past allowed reconstruction and development in entire continents ravaged by war is stifled in this instance by quibbling and casuistry.109.	There would be reason to despair of human solidarity  were it not that authoritative voices in the United Nations often come to shake the international community out of its torpor. We think  for instance  of the proposal made a few months ago by the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] concerning international action With a view to ensuring a minimum level of world food security. It deserves careful study in the hope that soon it will be applied in practice. We refuse to accept:""... that in these  the years of the 1970s  our world  with all its scientific capacity and the slow appearance of a spirit of communal action  may allow the persistence of a situation in which human beings depend on rain and good weather for their food.""110.	In this connexion  my delegation also welcomes the proposal of the Secretary of State of the United States  Mr. Henry Kissinger  to convene in 1974 a world food conference [2124th meeting]. However  we believe that the international community must not await natural catastrophes to help peoples that are affected  but rather should arm them so as to prevent those effects  for if it is- good to give fish to someone who is hungry  it is better to teach him to fish.111.	By helping the developing countries to fight the spectre of hunger within the framework of concerted international action  the world community will also liberate human resources which will be able to make a valuable contribution to development. The acceleration of this process in the trade field calls for the stabilization of the price of products from those countries as well as an increase in their export earnings without forgetting  however  the need to eliminate obstacles of every kind that stand in the way of primary products in the developed countries.112.	The present monetary situation hardly enables the developing countries to obtain sure earnings from their exports on the international market. Thus  in the course of the negotiations to be opened shortly to review and appraise international economic relations  special attention must be given to measures designed to confer true advantages on the trade of the developing countries by ensuring in particular an increase in hard currency  thediversification of their economies and the acceleration of their trade.113.	We are profoundly attached to international peace and security. Our efforts aiming at the promotion of the well-being of peoples stems from our conviction that the shortest road to the establishment of durable peace is not war but the economic and social development of the underprivileged.114.	The time has come to end this statement. I should like to end on a note of hope  the hope that is aroused in all hearts by the noble purposes of the Charter governing our Organization.115.	We see in the happy initiatives of peace and cooperation between the great Powers in general and the European countries in particular  a concrete realization of the objectives set by the nations that met in San Francisco at the end of the Second World War. The progress achieved lately along the path of general and complete disarmament leads us to believe that we were not dreaming when we advocated that one day mankind could live without confrontation born of conflicts of interest and influence and could pass on to an era of general solidarity where peoples would be happy and free and respect each other and each other's rights. In any event  for the great nations that dream is becoming a reality because the progress of science and technology makes it possible to envisage the process that will enable us to improve the quality of life. We want to see in these important changes that characterize our international relations today the proof that international peace and security are ideals  the realization of which can be achieved by nations and men.116.	Over 130 sovereign countries are represented in this forum where for close on a 100 days their plenipotentiaries will review all the burning problems threatening universal peace. I nave touched upon some of those problems  the majority of which have already been the object of numerous discussions and recommendations in this same Assembly. Be they the continuous assaults of the imperialism of the wealthy and colonialist Powers in Africa or elsewhere  of racial discrimination established as a system of government  of the occupation by force of the territory of other States  of peoples divided following foreign interference or economic dominationI of one part of the world by another  the third world today stands outside the peace initiatives that the developed world multiplies in favour of international detente. The most pessimistic perhaps are not wrong in detecting in those initiatives a general conspiracy of the ""haves"" against the ""have nots"". Because it is to be feared in fact that the settlement of differences between the developed countries may be achieved to the detriment of others. Universal peace is indivisible and there can be no true international detente if imperialism  colonialism  racism and economic exploitation of the weaker by the more powerful are still at the root of relations among peoples. There could be no international peace and security without the total elimination of those scourges from the life of mankind. This is a truth that it is our duty to keep well in mind throughout our work in order that theUnited Nations may be the true place of understanding and universal solidarity."
"10",565,"BFA",28,1973,"﻿90.	 Mr. President  on behalf of my Government I have the great pleasure of addressing to you my warm congratulations on the occasion of your election to preside over the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Your election is certainly a tribute to your country  which on many occasions has been able to demonstrate its devotion to the ideas of the United Nations Charter. My delegation is convinced that thanks to your able guidance and to the wisdom we know to be one of your qualities the General Assembly will acquit itself of its many tasks efficiently and successfully.91.	.May I also be permitted to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  for the able manner in which he presided over the twenty-seventh session.92.	I also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  on the faith he has displayed in the discharge of his heavy duties in the service of peace.93.	And I cannot fail to address a word of welcome to this Assembly of the German Democratic Republic  the Federal Republic of Germany  and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  States which I am convinced will make a positive contribution to our work.94.	At the international level the year 1973 offers two features of great interest to all those who  like the Republic of Upper Volta  have faith in the United Nations. The first feature  which is certainly encouraging  falls under the heading of that detente achieved through bilateral contacts or multilateral meetings which  while they have not always resulted in tangible achievements  have none the less had the advantage of confirming the tendency which has been emerging since last year  namely  the achievement of detente through negotiation. The second feature of international life at the opening of this twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly is somewhat more disturbing. I refer to the persistence or emergence of local conflicts that at any moment could lead to wars on a world-wide scale  as has happened in the past. Our lofty mission in this Assembly is to act in such a way that detente will win out over confrontation  which is most often due to frustration  injustice  a desire for power by States  or disparities in economic and social development. To carry out this mission  it is necessary to turn interstate relations in the direction of the world order envisaged by the Charter. True  this course upon which the United Nations set out more than a quarter of a century ago is long and arduous  but we are convinced that  confronted with the dilemma of war or peace  this august Assembly could not evade its responsibility  which is to maintain international peace and security.95.	I should like to state once again that my country is convinced more than ever that the United Nations Charter has defined and laid down fundamental purposes and principles which should regulate and strengthen good relations among all peoples. In particular we are in duty bound to work for and to place all the skill of mankind in the service of international peace and security  to respect the independence and sovereignty of States  large and small  to work for the elimination of all forms of oppression and colonial and racial domination  and to create in the developing countries conditions for harmonious economic and social development on a solid basis.96.	The sad realities of life today show us  however  how far we have departed from these noble objectives. Regions and developments which commanded our attention at our last session are still matters for concern.97.	Past experience has shown us that our common aspirations for peace and progress would be more easily achieved if the international community were not every day involved in dealing with tensions and confrontations which have overwhelmed certain regions. How much effort and how much money have been wasted in sterile struggles  the only results of which have been to sow insecurity  poverty and desolation in regions which in reality only aspire to peace.98.	Before this Assembly it is my duty to repeat once again the fact that we should make every possible effort to put an end to the process of decolonization in accordance with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  for there is no doubt  whatsoever  that one of the great dangers which at present threaten international peace and security is to be found in the persistence  at a time when all progress requires the freedom and the flourishing of the individual  of systems and regimes founded on colonial and racial domination. The ineffectiveness displayed so far by the United Nations in dealing with the burning colonial problems leads my delegation to think we should turn to new methods of approach that are more realistic and effective so as to accelerate the process of decolonization. That is all the more necessary  inasmuch as the United Nations has recognized both the legitimacy of the armed struggle of the liberation movements and their representative nature. For the time being  we can but restate our indignation and concern at the situation that has been created and maintained in Africa by the colonialist and racist Powers. Portugal still continues to flout with impunity the legitimate wishes of the peoples of Angola  Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau  and to defy the United Nations. But the armed struggle unleashed in 1961 against Portuguese colonialism in Angola  and subsequently in Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique  has entered upon a new phase  thanks to the great victories and the many sacrifices of the peoples of those regions. As a matter of fact  in the liberated areas  new structures have been set in place which are the incarnation of national sovereignty  making possible the work of reconstruction in all sectors of social life  education and production.99.	Helpless to halt the progress of the national liberation struggle  Portugal does not hesitate to intensify its policy of terror by basely assassinating the leaders and political statesmen of the liberation movements. Thus it was that after Eduardo Mondlane it was Amilcar Cabral who  on 20 January 1973  fell under their blows; and we cannot forget the systematic slaughter of civilian populations in Mozambique  and witnesses have testified to the scope of those massacres. Amilcar Cabral  to whom we wish to pay a tribute from this rostrum  was a soldier aware of his role in the service of his country; a leader and a fighter in Guinea-Bissau  he made an important contribution to the liberation struggle of all of Africa  of which he was a worthy son. The most disturbing fact is that Portugal has succeeded in associating its Western allies of NATO in its colonial wars. As a matter of fact  it is difficult for us to draw a distinction between Portugal and those Powers that supply it with weapons in order to facilitate its colonial enterprises in Africa. Indeed  they are nothing less than accomplices. It goes without saying that this situation continues to constitute a serious threat to international peace and security; hence it is up to the United Nations  in these circumstances  to show that it is and remains a valuable tool of recourse for peoples that have fallen victim to injustice and oppression. This has proven to be all the more necessary  since in neighbouring regions the situation is deteriorating from day to day.100.	In Rhodesia  while the United Kingdom continues to shirk its obligations by proving itself unable or unwilling to take effective measures to put an end to the illegal Ian Smith regime  the binding sanctions imposed by the Security Council are being violated by Members of the United Nations  and in particular-what is even sadder  —  by permanent States members of the Security Council. The United Nations should do everything in its power to enforce implementation of the sanctions it has adopted.101.	With respect to Namibia  there is no doubt whatsoever that the repressive measures and the pursuit of the so-called ""Bantustan"" policy by the racist authorities ofSouth Africa constitute sources of serious concern. The United Nations here bears a special responsibility  to the extent that  legally speaking  that Territory should be administered by the United Nations pending its attainment of independence. The contacts between the racist South Africa regime and the Secretary-General of the United Nations have produced nothing worthwhile so far. It seems to us  therefore  inappropriate to continue those contacts  which  in the last analysis  do harm to the legitimate interests of the people of Namibia. On the other hand  my country will continue to support the efforts of the United Nations Council for Namibia in the fulfilment of the task that has been entrusted to it by our Assembly.102.	In the field of decolonization we can be gratified at the co-operation existing between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. The fruitful conduct of the International Conference of Experts for the Support of Victims of Colonialism and Apartheid in Southern Africa  held at Oslo from 9 to 14 April 1973  is evidence of this. Upper Volta is ready to collaborate to ensure the implementation of the recommendations of that Conference-a Conference which has made an important contribution to the struggle for the liberation of Territories under colonial and racist domination in southern Africa.103.	In South Africa we are witnessing the violation of human rights as part of a policy of terror in the service of a system universally condemned: apartheid. This doctrine of the supremacy of one race over another is an absurdity in this century  and we shall never cease to combat it. This Assembly has declared that the apartheid system is a crime against humanity  which means  therefore  that any complacency  —  not to mention complicity  —  vis-à-vis South Africa is a challenge flung at the United Nations and the peoples of Africa. Still  throughout this year  one economic and trade mission after another from Western Powers has visited Pretoria and Johannesburg. The economic  financial and military assistance given to the racist minority Government of Pretoria by the NATO Powers enables it to continue and reinforce its apartheid policy. Once again  therefore  we invite those Powers to cut off all assistance to the racist South African regime and to combat it with all the means at their disposal. They can do so if they so desire.104.	The Middle East continues to be a serious source of apprehension for the international community. In spite of the numerous resolutions that have been adopted  the problem has not changed  and the situation of ""no peace  no war"" presages nothing good in a region where anything can happen from one moment to the next. The tensions and incidents on both sides of the frontiers between Israel and its neighbour States  the numerous complaints submitted to the Security Council throughout the year  followed by condemnations without any practical effect  are symptoms of the present impasse in the pursuit of an over-all solution to the Middle East problem.105.	We wish to reaffirm that it is unrealistic to question the political independence and territorial integrity of any State in that region. Similarly  the occupation or acquisition of territories by force is inadmissible and must be condemned. It must also be pointed out that consideration of the fundamental rights of the Palestinians is an indispensable element for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in that region. We must therefore achieve peace  and the successive failures of the numerous efforts undertaken since 1967 must impel us to persevere in the search for that peace  which is so desired by the international community. To this end  we feel that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) constitutes a solid basis for the settlement of the conflict. For the implementation of that resolution it is necessary that there emerge a common will on the part of the parties. But the present impasse  need I recall  unfortunately arises as a result of Israel's refusal to evacuate the Arab territories it has occupied by force  and this is a defiance hurled at our Organization by a State which owes its very existence to the United Nations.106.	The progressive colonization of those occupied territories as undertaken by Israel is a clear indication of the will of that country to annex  purely and simply  the territories in question. We believe that the international community should not permit that. In any event  as far as we are concerned  we condemn that policy.107.	In South-East Asia  the Viet-Namese drama has seen a happy change in course ever since January 1973 with the signature in Paris of the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam. My Government can only be gratified at that Agreement  which had been awaited for more than 30 years and followed five years of difficult negotiations  indescribable sufferings and tremendous loss of human life in Viet-Nam.108.	But today  while the war seems to be at an end  the peace is still to be won. And it is therefore up to the whole of the international community  including the United Nations  which was kept away from the drama  to participate in this fight for the peace.109.	What peace  we may ask  when in Cambodia everything is still to be done? That country  which was formerly a peaceful one under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk  who practised a policy of non-alignment  is today engulfed in a fate which was and still is that of Viet-Nam. Upper Volta-and I declare this from this rostrum loud and clear-supports the United National Front of Kampuchea  which effectively controls the major part of the territory of Cambodia. That is why my Government decided on 12 July last to recognize Prince Sihanouk's Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia as the only legitimate authority in Cambodia and to establish .diplomatic relations with it.110.	Upper Volta has always been anxious to spare no effort in promoting the greatest possible understanding between all States which share its own ideas of frank and friendly co-operation and respect  for the sovereignty of all the parties concerned. It is within that framework that we find the decision of the Upper Volta Government to recognize the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government representing the Chinese people as a whole.111.	At the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly  Upper Volta supported the proposal to adjourn the debate on the question of Korea  in the firm hope that the contacts which had been started between the two parties might come to tangible results.112.	The United Nations has a mission in Korea. That mission is to create by peaceful means a unified  independent and democratic Korea. The United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea  whose mandate was to set up such conditions as would promote that peaceful and independent unification  has so far been unable to carry out the role assigned to it by the General Assembly. For that reason  and in pursuit of conditions that would lead to the unification of Korea  my delegation is of the opinion that it is necessary to dissolve the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. Moreover  all foreign troops would have to be immediately withdrawn from the Republic of Korea as an additional measure in order to diminish tensions and thus promote unification. In the opinion of the delegation of Upper Volta  it is for the two parties themselves to find a negotiated solution to all disputes existing between them and to decide by common agreement upon their ultimate admission to the United Nations.113.	In Europe  the way realities have developed has led the leaders of the countries of the region to die Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. We believe that the crystallization of those realities will constitute an element of detente in international relations  especially in Europe. Among those relations  we wish to single out the historic fact of the normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. A tragic page in the history of post-war Europe has thus been turned  and we are happy at this.114.	My country  which maintains diplomatic relationswith the two countries  welcomes the conclusion of thefundamental Treaty between the two Germanys as a contribution beneficial to detente in Europe. We are happy at the possibility now given to those two great States to play their role in the United Nations in the service of peace  international co-operation and harmony between peoples. Tangible proof was given us this morning in the magnificent speech of Chancellor Willy Brandt of the Federal Republic of Germany [2128th meeting].115.	On the front of economic and social development  it will soon be 1975-half way through the Second United Nations Development Decade. An assessment of the results achieved so far shows that the objectives defined in the International Development Strategy might well continue to remain so many mirages which only move further away instead of at least giving the illusion of being fixed even if inaccessible.116.	In reality  even if those goals are achieved  the mean annual per capita income in the developing countries will be only $265  whereas it will be of the order of $3 600 in the developed countries. It is also to be noted that those are averages and that in fact in the least developed developing countries the mean per capita annual income will be of the order of $150.117.	In spite of the modesty of the goals assigned to the Second Development Decade  there is still much to be desired in the way of achievement.7 Treaty on the Principles of Relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany  done at Berlin on 21 December 1972.118.	the most recent statistics show that the flow of financial resources  and specifically the real flow of public aid to development  fell in 1972 from 0.35 per cent to 0.34 per cent of the gross national product of member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In percentages of the gross national product of members of that Committee  the total flow of resources fell from 0.82 per cent in 1971 to 0.77 per cent in 1972. If account is taken of the increase in prices and shifts in parities  the real value of public assistance for development will have decreased by 15 per cent between 1961 and 1971.119.	All these elements merely serve to emphasize even more the need for the inclusion in any reform of the monetary systems of a link between special drawing rights and additional financing for development.120.	As regards the untying of aid  my delegation has taken good note of the assurance given by the countries concerned to the Committee on Invisibles and Financing Related to Trade of the Trade and Development Board that negotiations will soon be resumed with a view to a total untying of financial aid to development. Until such time as agreement is brought about  my delegation expresses the hope that certain countries will singly or in groups adopt unilateral measures designed to attenuate the harmful effects of tying aid to the purchase of goods and services in the donor countries. In our opinion  all donor countries can and should commit themselves to untying by 1975 the sums provided by public aid and by contributions to international financial institutions.121.	It is amply evident that the increase in the volume of financial contributions and the easing of the conditions and modalities for the provision of these contributions are of capital importance in view of the needs of the developing countries.122.	Accordingly  all the developed countries should accept the target of 1 per cent and commit themselves to reaching it in 1975 at the latest. Similarly  in regard to public aid to development  as was stated by the President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development at the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]""... in order to raise the Rows of official development assistance from the current 0.35 per cent to the 0.7 per cent target  the developed countries would need to devote only about 1.5 per cent of the amount by which they themselves would grow richer during the decade.""123.	The winding down of the development effort has taken the form of increasing difficulties within the multilateral financial institutions; thus the reconstitution of the resources of the International Development Association has not yet been brought about. The United Nations Development Programme has seen its global resources reach a level very much below the projections accepted by all its member States  in spite of the highly laudable efforts made by certain developed countries  especially the Scandinavian countries. As a consequence  the activities of certain organs and specialized agencies have been seriously compromised.124.	These negative trends must be halted and reversed if the international community intends to achieve the goals1 set for the Second Development Decade.125.	The developing countries have also had a serious reduction in their share of world trade. That share has fallen from 30 per cent in 1950 to 17 per cent in 1970. The various series of multilateral trade negotiations within the framework of GATT aimed at and had as a result only the solution of trade problems of industrialized countries  in defiance and to the detriment of the vital trading interests of the developing countries. My delegation is of the opinion that the whole of the international community should be mobilized in order to see to it that the Nixon Round does not content itself with seeking solutions to the trade problems of developed countries  as the Kennedy Round did. The negotiations should attempt in particular to provide a serious solution for the trade problems of developing countries and to give the developing countries net additional advantages  an increased share in world trade  a diversification of their exports and an expansion of the generalized system of preferences.126.	As regards commodities  though we may be gratified at the clear improvement that was felt late in 1972 and the first six months of 1973 in world markets in those commodities  we are bound to recognize that the surge in prices has benefited only the transnational corporations  —   and  therefore  the developed countries-and not the producer countries. The rise occurred after several successive years of depressed rates and could have represented an important contribution to the economies of the exporting countries. My delegation hopes that in the light of those rates and of a more equitable level for producer countries  existing agreements will be reconsidered for the purpose of guaranteeing exporting countries fairer prices than those contained in the agreements.127.	In spite of the temporary rise in prices of certain commodities  the prices of other commodities-including tea  bananas  lemons and manganese  —  have remained at their low levels.128.	Negotiations in progress for the reform of the international monetary s-'stem and the Nixon Round under the auspices of GATT offer the international community an opportunity for decisive action concretely to promote the goals of the International Development Strategy.129.	In accordance with the provisions of UNCTAD resolution 84(111)   it is vital for problems of trade  financing  development and the monetary system to be resolved in a co-ordinated fashion with the full and entire participation of developed and developing countries in all phases of the discussions and decisions. As we indicated at the meetings of the UNCTAD Trade and Development Board  my delegation is convinced that such co-ordination can be effectively guaranteed only at the intergovernmental level. We hope that consultations will take place on this matter in such a way that a solution acceptable to the developing countries can be formulated..130.	As regards the least developed among the developing countries  the results of the first three years of the Second Development Decade show that in practically all cases there has been little or no over-all growth  while in certain countries there has actually been a sharp decline in per capita income.131.	My delegation has taken due note of the pertinent recommendations made by the Development Assistance Committee with respect to the conditions for granting assistance to such countries. This is a highly modest effort which has still to be implemented by the great majority of the members of the Development Assistance Committee. It is to be hoped that the easing of conditions for providing capital will be accompanied by a substantial increase in the resources destined for those countries  both bilateral and multilateral. I am thinking of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  the International Development Association  the International Monetary Fund  regional development banks  the International Finance Corporation  and so on. In spite of all the debates in all international forums  and the unreserved support of all member countries  the international financial institutions are still far from responding to the expectations of the least developed countries. My delegation hopes that this is a temporary maladjustment which will be corrected in accordance with the unanimous wish of the whole of the international community  as expressed at all international meetings since the third session of UNCTAD.132.	My delegation is also awaiting with interest the implementation of the specific commitments undertaken by the socialist countries of Eastern Europe.133.	The world is at present going through a food crisis  which is aggravated by the feverish rise in prices for urgently needed commodities. It is necessary for the whole of the international community to seek a concerted solution to this problem  which is vital and urgent for two thirds of mankind. As the Director-General of the Food and Agricultural Organization [FAOJ emphasized in his speech before the fifty-fifth session of the Economic and Social Council  for 20 years the stocks of cereals have never been so low nor the prices so high. He said:""The minimum anticipated needs for wheat in 1973-1974 cannot be covered through present production. There is also a shortage of rice  and cereals for animal feed may well be in short supply. ... In fact  are we to see in the next few months a world-wide shortage of cereals in the event of a bad harvest in one of the principal producing regions ...?""It is no longer possible to tolerate that the world should be subjected to a system of international rationing through prices during periods of shortage  —  in other words  to a system which would permit the richest or those who have come first to be served first and walk away with the biggest piece.""1o10 For a summary of this statement  see Official Records of the Economic and Social Council  Fifty-fifth Session  1861st meeting.134.	Indeed  affluence has drawn food-stuffs to the countries which are able to pay-to the rich and developed countries of the north. The cereal crisis has not yet been sufficiently considered for an appropriate solution to be found. We are of the opinion that it would not be wise for the international community simply to leave it to the caprices of the monsoons  which may or may not come. It seems to us that the problem is far more serious and that is why Upper Volta supports the proposal of FAO to establish a cereal bank which would stock the surplus in times of over-production and make it available for consumption during lean periods.135.	That is the only international measure which would ensure an appropriate solution to the problem. The developed countries  which are major producers of cereals  have here an opportunity to manifest their interest in the solution of this problem  which is hanging like a sword of Damocles over the heads of the poor developing countries  which are helpless before this problem  the solution of which goes far beyond their respective national capacities.136.	Pending a concerted solution to the food crisis  any restrictive measures in regard to production and stockpiling should be postponed.137.	In this respect my delegation gives its full support to the proposal of the United States to convene in 1974 a conference which would discuss the ways and means to maintain food-stuff production at an appropriate level and to mobilize the efforts of all countries to deal with famine and malnutrition resulting from natural calamities 138.	In Upper Volta and in the five other countries of the Sudano-Sahelian zone  drought has caused ravages among the 20 million inhabitants  their animals and their subsistence economies. Hundreds of persons have perished from thirst  hunger and diseases which have found easy prey among persons weakened by hunger. Millions of animals have perished  representing in practically all of these countries more than 80 per cent of' their livestock  —   and trade in livestock constitutes their principal source of export income. Indeed all the peasants of the Sudano- Sahelian zone supplemented their raising of livestock by a little crop-growing for local consumption. In fact food imports were already sapping the modest currency resources of these six countries. The foreign currency income depended in part upon the value of products which were constantly decreasing in price on the world market  such as peanuts and cotton. It is in that context that we have to consider the causes  the effects and the ways to remedy the situation in these countries. I should like solemnly to thank here all those that have responded to the appeal of the populations affected by the drought  be they countries  governmental or non-governmental organizations or private individuals. This spontaneous and generous reaction on the part of international solidarity has saved thousands of human lives and has strengthened the faith of these populations in what man can do for himself and for his neighbours.139.	However  the consequences of this drought remain with us. Even if the food production this year was better than that of the previous four years  it will not be sufficient to cover the needs of the consumers. Moreover  the countries affected by the drought have defined the medium-term and long-term measures for initiating the rehabilitation and the accelerated development of the countries of the Sudano-Sahelian region through the reconstitution of production capital: the regeneration of soil and the reconstitution of the herds and of the productive forces of the working masses.140.	1 shall not go into the specific details of the measures proposed by the Heads of State of the countries of the zone. Indeed  the Head of State of Upper Volta  President Sangoule Lamizana  designated by his peers  will have an opportunity of speaking here on 9 October for the purpose of presenting the measures agreed upon by the six countries.141.	For all the countries afflicted  this drought is a brutal blow in the sense of a deterioration of the ecological conditions of the soil as well as the living conditions of the populations. If the emergency measures have made it possible to solve urgent supply problems temporarily  at present the assistance of the international community must be sought in order to make it possible to bring about the implementation of measures through which these countries will build solid economies enabling them in the future to deal with and overcome calamities of this kind. The international community had already firmly committed itself to helping practically all these countries within the context of measures oriented towards the least developed countries. Only urgent and comprehensive implementation of all these measures  especially commercial and financial  will make it possible for these countries to approach  however modestly  the goals defined in the International Development Strategy. The international community can only turn to the developed countries and ask them to show the political will that is necessary to enable the populations concerned to reach a threshold of development placing them beyond the calamities that would otherwise be uncontrollable  even though they are foreseeable.142.	Thanks to the actions of certain peace-loving and freedom-loving countries  the United Nations has been able to prevent international disputes from deteriorating dangerously and sometimes has thus made it possible for conditions to be established for a final settlement.143.	However  we have to work even harder in order to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to influence events so that a spirit of detente and peace may prevail throughout the world.144.	My delegation firmly hopes that the present session of the General Assembly will do everything in its power to give effect to measures which are genuinely applicable in regard to the maintenance of peace  co-operation  justice and the dignity of man."
"11",654,"BGR",28,1973,"﻿147.	 Mr. President  I should like once more to extend my sincere congratulations on your election to the Presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its twenty-eighth session and to express my conviction that under your able leadership the session will be an active and a fruitful one.148.	I take this opportunity to express to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  Secretary-General of our Organization  our respect and gratitude for the useful work he has done during the period between the twenty-seventh and twenty- eighth sessions of the United Nations General Assembly.149.	It would be no exaggeration to say that the past year will go down in history as one marking a turning point in international relations  a year of transition from a state of cold war to an expansion and consolidation of the process of peaceful coexistence between the world's two socio-political systems. Everyone is familiar with the recent events which gave the impetus and were especially helpful in bringing about a long-term detente in the international situation.150.	Particularly important among these events were the meetings held by Leonid Brezhnev  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  with President Richard Nixon of the United States of America  Chancellor Willy Brandt of the Federal Republic of Germany and President Georges Pompidou of France. The splendid results of these meetings are the fruit of mutual goodwill and realism. At the same time  they mark a great success for the Soviet Union's peace-loving Leninist foreign policy  which was expressed in the Peace Programme adopted at the Twenty-Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.151.	I should like especially to emphasize how important the Bulgarian Government and all our people consider the favourable changes in Soviet-United States relations. These new relations will undoubtedly have a beneficial effect on the entire international situation. We must stress the extraordinary importance of the conclusion on 22 June 1973 of the Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War  which will create the genuine conditions for saving mankind from the spectre of nuclear disaster.152.	We are gratified to note the improvement in the European political climate. The results of the constant efforts exerted for many years by the socialist countries  including the People's Republic of Bulgaria  fill us with deep satisfaction. The second stage of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe began just a few days ago. That Conference opens prospects for transforming the old continent into a zone of peace and mutually beneficial co-operation based on universal recognition of and respect for the existing territorial and political realities. We are fully aware of the difficulties that remain to be overcome before the fundamental purposes of the Conference can be achieved.153.	True mutual understanding and co-operation are possible only on the basis of mutual respect and observance of the domestic laws and regulations of each country.154.	The history of the recent past has shown that attempts to meddle in the internal affairs of States are doomed to failure. But it must be borne in mind that such attempts have hindered the process through which relationsof peace  security  trust and co-operation are being built.155.	We believe that all the participating countries will approach the historic tasks of the European Conference with the proper sense of responsibility and that the Conference will be completely successful.156.	Among the main factors characterizing the new and favourable situation in the world  we should mention also the cessation of the war in Viet-Nam. Mankind breathed a sigh of relief when that cruel blood-bath came to an end. The Viet-Namese people won a magnificent victory and gained recognition of its right to solve its own problems and determine its own future. The establishment of a stable peace in Viet-Nam requires strict observance of the Paris agreements by the countries involved.157.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria  fulfilling its international duty  will continue  as in the past  to furnish assistance of every kind to the fraternal Viet-Namese people in its efforts to wipe out the after-effects of the war.158.	Socialist Bulgaria and the entire Bulgarian people are determined to support the strengthening and further development of the trend towards the relaxation of international tension in Europe and throughout the world. ""The Bulgarian Communist Party and the People's Republic of Bulgaria "" said Todor Zhivkov  First Secretary of the Central Committee of our Party and Chairman of the Council of State  in a recent statement  ""regard it as their national and international duty to continue to help actively to promote the process of improvement in present-day international relations"".159.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria has always attached the highest importance to its relations with neighbouring countries and has co-operated in the favourable development of such relations. Politically  the Balkan peninsula is a microcosm in which the two socio-economic systems live side by side. Part of the line separating NATO and the Warsaw Pact runs through the Balkans. This complicated situation helps us to appreciate even better the successes of recent years in advancing towards detente and towards the broadening of peaceful co-operation between the Balkan peoples.160.	Bulgaria will continue to pursue with the same steadfastness and consistency an active and constructive policy aimed at transforming the Balkans into a model of the implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social structures  into a zone of stable peace and co-operation.161.	The change in the world political climate did not come about by itself and is not the result of some fortuitous confluence of circumstances. The confirmation of the successes already achieved will undoubtedly require a great deal of determined effort. There have  of course  always been some forces-and they undoubtedly exist today-which are not interested in establishing a stable peace and in strengthening friendship and mutual understanding between peoples. It would be naive to expect that those who have incited and supported the policy of the ""cold war"" and stockpiled weapons for many years will now reconcile themselves to the positive changes that have taken place in the world.162.	The forces of international reaction also seek and find support among other forces actively opposing detente. They talk  without any justification whatever  of a ""nuclear diktat"" of the so-called super-Powers which are allegedly conspiring at the expense of other countries' interests. They are making an obvious attempt to sow doubts about the motives and objectives of the peace-loving policy pursued by the Soviet Union and the other countries of the socialist community  especially among small and medium-sized States  among countries struggling to consolidate their independence and to achieve economic and social progress  and also among the forces of the national liberation movements. They cast doubt even on the usefulness of the policy of peaceful coexistence  the principles of which underlie the Charter of our Organization.163.	We are confident that the facts will continue in the future  as in the past  to refute and expose the groundless ""theories"" of the partisans of cold war and international tension.164.	The logic of events confirms that each people striving to build a happy future for itself and earnestly desiring the same for other peoples  and each State  whether large or small  can only benefit from a general improvement in the international atmosphere. That is why we are particularly gratified to note the results of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned States  held at Algiers in September 1973. In addition to important and useful decisions on individual practical problems of the present day  the Algiers Conference expressed support for the policy of detente and recognized the truth that the policy of peaceful coexistence is in the interest of all peoples and of peace throughout the world.165.	We are firmly convinced that peace and international security will continue to grow stronger. This conclusion depends upon and accords with the objective fact of today's world and the balance which has already shifted in favour of the forces of peace and international understanding. It is this prospect that the countries of the socialist community  including the People's Republic of Bulgaria  are actively working and struggling for  together with all of the world's peace-loving forces.166.	We share the conviction  expressed by other speakers  that the main task today is that all countries and all people of goodwill throughout the world should do everything in their power to make the trend towards peace and international co-operation an irreversible one. Now  more than ever  the United Nations has the mission of promoting the fulfilment of that task.167.	The danger of a resurgence of old evils is not precluded of course. The need for an active struggle and for resistance against the forces attempting to halt social progress and the free and independent development of peoples is demonstrated by recent events in Chile.168.	World public opinion has reacted with concern and indignation to the actions of reactionary forces in Chile  which forcibly overthrew the legitimate Government of National Unity and brought about the death of President Salvador Allende  a valiant fighter for the just cause of the Chilean people and world peace.169.	The Bulgarian people wishes to express its fraternal solidarity with the Chilean people's struggle in defence of its right to develop along the path of national independence and social progress. We vigorously condemn the brutality of the reactionary forces against the best sons of the Chilean people  and we express our firm conviction that the final victory will belong to the working class  the labouring people of Chile.170.	A glance at the agenda of this session is enough for us to realize how broad are the opportunities for our Organization to make a real contribution to the cause of further improving the world situation and carrying' out the fundamental task of the United Nations  which is to strengthen international peace and security. The most urgent question in this sphere concerns the peaceful settlement of the Middle Eastern conflict.171.	The situation in the Middle East still contains the lurking danger of a new explosion. The aggressive and adventuristic policy of the Israeli ruling circles is an ever-growing danger to peace in that region  which is our near neighbour. The key issue in the settlement of the Middle Eastern problem continues to be that of the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967. It is the duty of our Organization to continue our active search for effective means to implement the well-known decisions of the Security Council.172.	The Bulgarian people and its Government will continue to give their full support to the Arab peoples in their just struggle for the restoration of the territories seized by Israel and for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East on the basis of respect for the rights and interests of all the peoples of the region  including the Arab people of Palestine.173.	The United Nations can and must help to remove another constant source of tension and conflict  namely  .colonialism. Through the joint efforts of all peace-loving peoples  our Organization must become even more active in helping to eliminate this shameful phenomenon of our age  which flagrantly violates not only the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law but also the concepts of elementary justice and morality.174.	The events of the past year give us reason to view the possibility of a settlement of the Korean question with some optimism. It is long past time to remove the surviving anachronisms and give the Koreans in both parts of the peninsula an opportunity to solve their own problems without outside interference. The People's Republic of Bulgaria fully supports the efforts of the DemocraticPeople's Republic of Korea for the peaceful unification of the country and cannot but oppose any proposals that might interfere with the attainment of that goal.175.	An encouraging development in the field of disarmament is represented by the opening of the second stage of strategic arms limitations talks and the signing on 21 June 1973 of a document on basic principles of negotiations on the further limitation of strategic offensive arms by the Soviet Union and the United States of America. Talks will shortly begin on the reduction of arms and armed forces in central Europe  one of the most sensitive spots on the globe. Now it is time for an over-all settlement of the problem of nuclear weapons tests  with a view to extending the nuclear test ban to all environments and all nuclear States.176.	It is our firm conviction that a significant impetus for the solution of the complicated problems of disarmament could be given by the convening of a world disarmament conference  in which all countries  large and small  nuclear and non-nuclear  would participate on a basis of equality. Those States which try to hinder the implementation of the relevant General Assembly resolution  2930 (XXVII)  and the preparations for such a conference must bear a heavy responsibility. For that reason we believe that at the present session the General Assembly must take decisions which will make it possible to proceed immediately to practical preparations in order that a world conference may be convened in the near future. A similar appeal was made by the non-aligned countries meeting at Algiers.177.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria believes that the Security Council would be doing a great service in the cause of peace and the security of peoples if it accelerated the practical implementation of the solemn declaration on the non-use of nuclear weapons  adopted last year at the initiative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.  Only four countries voted against that declaration  and there cannot be any justification for delaying compliance with the recommendation of the General Assembly.178.	The strengthening of trust among States and the related possibility of implementing new measures in the field of disarmament offer prospects for freeing considerable human and material resources for the solution of the important and complicated economic and social problems confronting mankind. The new situation is unquestionably favourable for the elimination of fundamental obstacles that still hold back the normal development of international economic relations and for overcoming the economic and social lag of the developing countries and eliminating the unemployment and mass poverty that afflict millions of people in various parts of the globe.179.	We welcome with great satisfaction the new initiative of the Soviet Union concerning ""Reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and the use of part of the funds thus saved for the providing of assistance to developing countries"" [2126th meeting] and also the appeal for reducing the military budgets of other States  particularly States with vast economic and military potential.180.	The significance and scope of this proposal are not hard to appreciate if we consider that in recent years the world's military expenditures have amounted to approximately $200 000 million per year.181.	The merits of the measure proposed by the Soviet Union lie in the fact that it is clear  specific and feasible if the countries concerned are prepared to implement it. The peoples of the States participating in the budget reductions would also gain thereby. The developing countries would receive considerable additional assistance. The process of detente would be given a further strong impetus  and opportunities would be opened for further effective measures in the disarmament field. For that reason  we support the inclusion of the new item 102 in the agenda of the current session and will co-operate in every way to help achieve the goals set out in it.182. The new period in international relations offers the United Nations broad possibilities for realizing its full potential  as laid down in the Charter 28 years ago. Whether the United Nations will be equal to the demands of today will depend on what its Members actually do to convert the present favourable trends in the world into a permanent factor of contemporary international life."
"12",699,"BHR",28,1973,"﻿102.	Mr. President  I wish to begin by expressing the gratification of the Government of the State of Bahrain at your election to preside over the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are looking forward with hope to a successful session under your wise leadership. I should also like to pay a tribute to our former President  Mr. Trepczynski  for the manner in which he directed the work of the previous session. Also  I should like to welcome the presence at this session of the delegations of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic and the presence of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas as full-fledged Members of this Organization.103.	The present session of the General Assembly has witnessed major developments in the relations between the big Powers. This has been the culmination of a series of events which took place during the last two years and which heralds a new era of relaxation in international tension and co-operation among the big Powers.104.	The restitution of the lawful rights of China in the United Nations [resolution 2758 (XXVI)/ has-been one of the encouraging factors in the new international climate. Meanwhile  there are many serious pending problems which urgently need action. We should not neglect these questions simply because they are not of immediate interest to the big Powers. In the view of my country  colonialism  apartheid and poverty have a large impact on the future of international relations and will adversely influence the international climate unless we grapple with these persistent problems and find a speedy solution for them which is not based on expediency but which will be in conformity with the dictates of right and justice.105.	I shall start with the Middle East question which contains elements of all the evils I have just alluded to  namely  colonialism  racism and poverty.	106.	It is not my intention to review the Middle East question with which Members are all familiar. The question is now so well known that the peace-loving peoples all over the world take every opportunity to express their support for the Palestinian people and their just cause and insist on the withdrawal of Israel from the territories it occupied in 1967.107.	In the beginning of this month  more than 70 nations and Heads of State met in Algeria for the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  representing more than half of the population of the world  and adopted a momentous resolution regarding this question. This resolution  which contains practical measures for settling this question  should serve as an incentive to our Organization for taking appropriate action to uphold the rule of law and restore to the victims of Israeli aggression their lawful rights. I shall quote the main provisions of this resolution  which now forms part of the Political Declaration of the Conference:""In the Middle East  the situation continues to give rise to deep concern. Israel's obstinate persistence in its policy  of aggression  expansion and annexation  as well as its policy of oppression directed against the inhabitants of the territories occupied by force  is a challenge to the international community  the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and a threat to international peace and security.""Drawing renewed attention to the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territories by force  the Conference calls for immediate and unconditional withdrawal by Israel from all the occupied territories  and pledges itself to assist Egypt  Syria and Jordan in liberating their occupied territories by every means.4""In this connexion  the restoration of the national rights of the Palestinian people is a basic prerequisite for the establishment of an equitable and lasting peace in thearea. The struggle of the Palestinian people to recover their usurped homeland is an integral part of the struggle of all people against colonialism and racial discrimination and for self-determination. Member countries of the Conference call upon all States  and in particular the United States of America  to abstain from providing Israel with arms  or any political  economic or financial support which may enable it to continue its aggressive and expansionist policy.""The Conference gives its firm support to and expresses its solidarity with the Palestinian people in their sore trial and the heavy sacrifices it is making to recover its national dignity and entity.""108.	As long as the aggressive Zionist State is dispossessing the Palestinian people of their homeland and rights  and is illegally occupying territories of three Arab countries  the world will not witness peace  as this troubled situation could explode at any moment  exposing our civilization to the danger of devastation. Bahrain would like to see the United Nations playing its proper and effective role in world affairs and see the countries which hold in their hands the key to the solution of this dangerous situation take an active part in doing so rather than stand aloof as mere observers.109.	This year  the United Nations will celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Bahrain is looking forward to participating ii this celebration. Bahrain attaches great importance to safeguarding human rights and fundamental freedoms for all peoples. It is significant to note in this respect that the new Constitution of Bahrain  which was approved by the Constituent Assembly  upholds the rights of the citizens of Bahrain in civil  political and social affairs. The Constitution of Bahrain is a solid foundation for a democratic life supported by both the people and the Government of Bahrain. One of the aims of the Constitution is to maintain the dignity and worth of the people of Bahrain and lead them to an honourable and fruitful life.110.	This year a major step towards world peace has been achieved by the signature of the cease-fire agreements in Viet-Nam. Nations all over the world have shown their relief at the cease-fire in that part of the world. Nevertheless  the situation in Indo-China is still precarious and may threaten the stability of political and economic life in that area. Accordingly  we hope that all parties involved will work towards the ending of hostilities and armed confrontation.111.	It is true that it is not in the interest of nations that the arms race should continue at a time when millions of people are living in misery and poverty. Statistics indicate that some $200 000 million a year are spent on military activities  while only half this amount-is spent on economic and social development. The world has not yet forgotten the destruction inflicted on human civilization by the last two world wars. So long as the arms race is not curbed  the threat of another world war will remain with us. The United Nations  through the goodwill and determination of its Members  can call a halt to the arms race and the production and stockpiling of destructive weapons. It is high time that the United Nations should play a more effective role in achieving general and complete disarmament and that Member States should meet their moral obligations towards the nations of the world  which are longing for peace and security.112.	The Indian Ocean is a vital area for the many nations who want it to be a zone of peace. The United Nations has declared that the Indian Ocean is a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] and should not be used as an arena for military activities which endanger the political and economic stability of the littoral and hinterland States. Bahrain  which declared its approval of this principle  appeals to all other nations to do the same and to refrain from jeopardizing the peace and stability of this area. Also  we believe that the Gulf area should also remain free from big-Power rivalries and foreign intervention.113.	Another aspect of global unrest is the policy of apartheid and racial discrimination. The United Nations has in the past spared no effort to combat these policies and practices through the resolutions that were adopted year after year. Nevertheless  these efforts have been in vain  mainly because those who carry out such practices persist in their wrong-doing and turn a deaf ear to all voices that condemn them. Moreover  these racist regimes are able to adhere to their vicious policies because of the moral and material support they receive from some other industrially advanced countries. The latter claim to be among those who laid the foundation of human rights  while at the same time they support racist regimes which suppress the indigenous populations and deny them their fundamental freedoms and inalienable human rights.114.	Colonialism and apartheid are crimes against humanity and can no longer be condoned. The international community must compel colonial and racist regimes to give up these odious practices.115.	The liberation movements in Africa are legitimate causes that must be supported and encouraged. Every nation on this earth has the right to self-determination  which  if denied  can be achieved through armed struggle. Bahrain confirms its support for the legitimate struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia  Angola  Mozambique  Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands.116.	In 1970  the United Nations initiated the Second United Nations Development Decade with a view to achieving the target of raising the national income of developing countries by 6 per cent. In order to achieve this objective there must be international co-operation  and in this respect the developed countries can help a great deal. Nobody can deny that the developing countries are primarily responsible for their own development. However  this should not prevent the developed countries from helping to improve the standard of living in the developing countries. The offer of technical assistance and the provision of financial aid can diminish the wide gap between the poor and the rich countries.117.	The increasing problems of the environment are placing a new challenge before those who are endeavouringto find solutions to combat them. No State whatsoever is immune from the problems of pollution of the environment. The United Nations has initiated an environmental programme and has set up a secretariat entrusted with the duty of following up the programme. It is hoped that all nations will co-operate amongst themselves and with the various international organizations in the struggle to combat the problems of pollution.118.	Now that we are meeting in this grand Assembly to discuss the matters included in our agenda  which may exceed 100 items in number  we should look back on the work of our Organization to see whether it has achieved its aims and purposes  particularly the maintenance of international peace and security.119.	The United Nations has been exceptionally ineffective in maintaining international peace and security. To take one significant example  our Organization succeeded in repelling the aggression committed by Israel during the Suez war in 1956  while it has so far been unable to compel Israel to renounce the fruits of its aggression in 1967.120.	It is our fervent hope that the lessons of the past will be heeded and that the General Assembly will take effective measures to maintain and promote the aims and purposes of the United Nations. Meanwhile  I would take this opportunity to reiterate my country's firm support of the principles and ideals of the Charter and to proclaim its co-operation with the Secretary-General  who needs our help and whole-hearted assistance in the noble cause he is working for."
"13",743,"BHS",28,1973,"﻿As this is the first opportunity which the Commonwealth of the Bahamas has to speak in the general debate of the General Assembly  it is appropriate that at this time I should indicate to other delegations the general principles upon which the foreign relations of the Bahamas shall be conducted in this Assembly and in its associations with other States. The necessity to state these principles briefly will limit what I have to say for the most part to some broad generalizations  but I shall also make some modest suggestions for action by this Assembly in areas which are of particular significance to the Bahamas.3.	A desirable starting point for me is the Preamble to the Independence Constitution of the Bahamas  which came into force on 10 July past and which reads as follows:""WHEREAS Four hundred and eighty-one years ago the rediscovery of this Family of Islands  Rocks and Cays heralded the rebirth of the New World ""AND WHEREAS the People of this Family of Islands recognize that the preservation of their Freedom will be guaranteed by a national commitment to Self-discipline  Industry  Loyalty  Unity and an abiding respect for Christian values and the Rule of Law;""NOWKNOW YE THEREFORE:""We the Inheritors of and Successors to this Family of Islands  recognizing the Supremacy of God and believingin the Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of the Individual ""DO HEREBY PROCLAIM IN SOLEMN PRAISE the Establishment of a Free and Democratic Sovereign Nation founded on Spiritual Values and in which no Man  Woman or Child shall ever be Slave or Bondsman to anyone or their Labour exploited or their Lives frustrated by deprivation ""AND DO HEREBY PROVIDE by these Articles for the indivisible Unity and Creation under God of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas.""Thereafter in the constitutional document are articles which  subject to those which provide for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual  make the Constitution the supreme law of the Bahamas. We thereby consciously subjected our national sovereignty to adherence to the concept of the rule of law together with the proposition that:"".. . the idea of the rule of law must embrace the doctrine that there is a national responsibility to create and maintain the social and economic condition which will give meaning and substance to the idea of equality under law"".4.	Throughout the years of colonial administrations  the energies and attention of the Bahamian people  in particular for my generation  were directed to the ultimate goals of majority rule  political and economic self-determination and sovereign independence. One of the by-products of this necessary preoccupation with internal and anti-colonialist politics was that public attention was directed inwardly to internal problems. Matters of external relations were  therefore  relegated to an unimportant position or thought to be irrelevant to what at the time were the most immediate matters of internal politics.5.	At the same time  however  there were external forces at work which were compressing the whole world into closer affinity and interdependence. A companion in growth and progress to our evolutionary advance to sovereign independence has been the remarkable change which has taken place during the past decade in communication and transportation facilities. Hence it is possible for words spoken here to be heard  and the speaker here to be seen  instantaneously anywhere in the world. It is also now possible to fly today from our capital city of Nassau to New York in 2 hours and 45 minutes  to Frankfurt in 9 hours or to Sydney in 25 hours.6.	Therefore  ever since 1964 when the first comprehensive written Constitution came into effect in the Bahamas and ultimate independence was assured  we have begun to look outward upon a world which was being shrunk by technology and which was being brought closer to us and to which we began to look with eager expectation. Indeed  this is evidenced by the fact that the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of the Bahamas came into existence four years before independence and the 1969 Constitution which we had gave a wide measure of responsibility in foreign affairs to the Bahamas Government. Thereafter  the Bahamas began consciously to turn its attention outward and to recognize that there was a place for it in the world which its necessity to prosper and survive demanded be filled.7.	It was therefore inevitable and a matter of course that the Bahamas  after independence  directed its attention to membership in the United Nations. It is not for the love of platitudes or a craving for fine words that in the Bahamas we take seriously the words of the preamble to the Charter of the United Nations which reads in part:""WE THE PEOPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS DETERMINED... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small. .. and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom ""AND FOR THESE ENDS to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours  and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security ..."".8.	The Commonwealth of the Bahamas is a new Member of this Organization. We have  none the less  observed the attempts which have been made by this body towards the realization of its purposes and principles as expressed in the Charter  to which all of us Members subscribe. The Charter imposes upon the members of this Assembly the enormous task of providing for the world conditions conducive to the betterment of the welfare of all mankind. This was the spirit in which the Charter founders drafted its constitution. This  similarly  must be the current resolve of its Member nations.9.	We in the Bahamas have not been unmindful of the fact' that in its 28 years the United Nations has experienced both failures and successes  and notwithstanding the view which is apparently held by some and is born of frustration  I do not believe  as I have read expressed in a leading national journal of a Member State recently  that ""... the sad  even bitter truth is that the United Nations is no longer in the mainstream of world politics"".10.	It may very well be that the enormous capacity of all kinds which exists within the States legitimately categorized as super-Powers has dwarfed the necessities of the other Members of the United Nations  but it is presumptuous to assume that the course of the super-Powers from time to time constitutes the mainstream of world politics. However  this would be the case if all the members of the Assembly passively allowed this to be so. Be that as it may  the aspirations of our people are no less real or immediate than those of the big nations and the demands made upon its leaders no less compelling.11.	My Government has a responsibility to the Bahamas to make its proper contribution to the collective efforts to the United Nations to create an harmoniously ordered world society; to create an internationally recognized rule of law which will guarantee the territorial integrity of States; to sustain a level of economic growth which will provide a continuingly increasing standard of living  education and social services for its people; and to assist in creating a system of human values and of morality which will create a climate of existence for mankind to enable it to enjoy and fulfil itself in peace.12.	But endless debate and tired cliches do not at all provide the machinery that will assist in finding solutions to some of the problems that now face us. These solutions ought not to depend on the interrelations between the sources of physical power and the location of authority  but rather upon the centralization of power and authority here as is envisaged by the Charter. Otherwise the pursuit of international peace and security will remain the province of a privileged few  and the credibility gap between the rhetoric of world international order and the realities inherent in the pursuit of the national interest of the few will become even wider.13.	The urgent work of the United Nations  made more urgent by the total interdependence of States in the world  has significance and meaning for us in the Bahamas as it does for every other Member State. World problems and their effect have no national boundaries. The unresolved Middle East problems may seem remote and irrelevant to the Bahamas  but they are not. The Bahamas has no natural source of economically exploitable energy  and the frustrating lack of a peaceful settlement in the Middle .East which propels rising prices of oil in the world has its effect on the cost of fuel  the cost of electricity  the cost of living in the Bahamas and ultimately the standard of living of its people. So we say there must be solutions found there.14.	The Bahamas is an archipelagic State  so located in the North Atlantic that heavily trafficked commercial shipping lanes pass through the archipelago. In the south-eastern Bahamas  the Crooked Island and Mira Por Vos passages exist for shipping to and from ports in the Caribbean and Central America  and to and from the United States of America and Canadian ports; in the north-west Bahamas  the Northeast and Northwest Providence channels are the shipping lanes through which pass practically all the commercial traffic between the Gulf of Mexico and Europe. The Bahamas has little known mineral resources  but has developed a successful resort industry and is in the process of diversifying the economy as rapidly as possible. We are aware  nevertheless  of the dangers to our ecology and resort-island facilities to which we are subjected by the large numbers of ships of all kinds which traffic through our waters. My Government is therefore conscious of the importance to the Bahamas of early international agreement on matters of territorial jurisdiction within the boundaries of our archipelago  on matters of territorial jurisdiction around the boundaries of our-archipelago  the limits of economic exploitation within and around the boundaries of our archipelago  pollution of our archipelago  rights of passage through our archipelago  and conservation and other related matters  all of which will affect the continued use of the sea lanes through the archipelago. All matters pertaining to international agreement on the law of the sea are therefore extremely relevant to the Bahamas.15.	We welcome the attempts which so far have been made to secure for archipelagic States a just and equitable regime pertaining to the sea and sea-bed around and within them  as this concept constitutes not only a means of protection of the economic resources and safeguards against pollution  but also acts to ensure the psychological  political and social unification of the whole group of islands.16.	The Bahamas is a major importer of food. Everything in the world  therefore  which is relevant to the supply of food and its cost is relevant to the Bahamas. Any action taken by this body which is calculated to increase food production  provide adequate conservation methods and improve the techniques of production will receive the active support of our delegation.17.	The world of yesterday was. divided and measured by colour  by race  by religious beliefs and by ideological persuasion. The world today is additionally divided by the developed and the under-developed  the rich and the poor  the haves and the have-nots. The Bahamas is legitimately categorized as a small nation and as such requires a very unique combination of ingredients to create a successful nation State out of scattered islands: but small nations can be made into viable economic entities with the help of the technological expertise available in the world which can provide all the answers to successful development. The successful development of all under-developed countries can therefore be achieved provided that the developed countries are prepared to commit themselves to the task in co-operation with one another  not competitively  and without expectation of reward in any ideological conflict. The Bahamas would be a willing participant in the promotion of any United Nations economic development programme calculated to redress the balance between the developed and the under-developed undertaken in a spirit of universal co-operation.18.	I have made reference to these few matters  by way of example only  to illustrate my proposition of the total interdependence of all nations in the world upon others  a fact which appears  sometimes  to be overlooked in the international contests of the national self-interests of big and powerful States  which interests  I believe  history will one day judge to have been some very narrow self-interests indeed. Practised as it has been by the big nations  it is little wonder that this contest of self-interest appears to have caused some lack of spirit and frustration here.19.	In this connexion  I have to say that  notwithstanding the fears which have been expressed with regard to the present dialogue between the super-Powers and the detente said to exist between them  I do not share those fears. Implicit in the normalization of relations between the great Powers is their desire that there be no necessity for the world to be divided into contesting blocs of nations. We must  so far as we are able  accept that implication in this detente and believe that they mean what they say  and believe that they know how the people of the world will interpret their actions. Taken as it appears to be  is it not right that we may conclude that the super-Powers have agreed that the world has changed  that competitions between ideologies can lead only to armed conflict  that different economic systems can survive together harmoniously and that the world can now look forward to a new order of international order and justice led by them in this place?20.	Over the 28 years of the life of this Organization we have witnessed the development of two super-Powers  the Republic of the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. In very recent times  we have seen wondrous signs of dramatic changes in East-West relationships evidenced  first  by the arrival  acceptance and seating here of the People's Republic of China and secondly  less than two weeks ago  by the admission to membership here of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. In the next decade or two we may come to see a United States of Europe comprising what is now the enlarged European Economic Community and in that time a United States of Europe and a People's Republic of China may themselves realize their full potential to become super-Powers.21.	In that event  and particularly if the detente fails to fulfil our hopes and dreams  it may become necessary to think again whether in the interests of international peace and understanding the Headquarters of our Organization should be located within the territorial jurisdiction of a super-Power  or whether it might more properly be located in a small but beautiful Member State which has no pretensions to power but which has many attributes for the congenial settlement of international disputes.22.	Our delegation will be authorized to offer  at any time the question may arise  one of the 700 islands of the Bahamas as an ideal compromise location for any future Headquarters of the United Nations or any one or more of its agencies.23.	I belong to a young country which is full of young people  not unlike young people of every other State represented here; young people who have become impatient with inconsistencies  indifferent to the claims of competing ideologies and to the cynicism of the old. It appears to many of the young of the world that the promise of 28 years ago has been too long frustrated by narrow prejudices and calculated self-interest and a failure to adhere to the clear intentions of the United Nations Charter.24.	Prior to independence  there was a small minority in the Bahamas which sought to dismember one island from the nation; but majority rule and self-determination prevailed in the end and the movement failed. So we can view with compassion now two Germanys  two Koreas and two Viet-Nams. However  ideological conflicts imposed upon a people can never divide it for ever  no more than the mind of man can ever be separated from its will to exercise its sovereign identity and freedom.25.	Do representatives believe that the world's youth are unaware of the fact that the United Nations has been unable to suppress the use of unlawful force; that narrow disputes go unsettled because super-Powers have been unable to agree; that interference with constitutionally elected Governments is overlooked; or that racism  in its most virulent form  is permitted to persist in southern Africa? Neither history nor succeeding generations will look with compassion upon a people that appeared to act without the guidance of morality or the rule of law.26.	The hope of the generation to which I belong  and that of those younger than I  is for the preservation of a world order subject to the machinery of the United Nations  not by the so-called real-politik of super-Powers which are able to juggle the sovereignty of smaller nations. I am  however  not so Utopian as to believe that it is totally within our competence and not within the competence of the great Powers to make this hope a reality.27.	If the United Nations  this world parliament  is to have immediate meaning and significance  if the conflicting claims of morality and power are to be reconciled  that can be accomplished only by the collective and concerted effort of the great Powers  each one of which  like the rest of us  has given solemn accord to the principles of the United Nations Charter.28.	We have the means to give new hope to mankind  to create a stable international order dominated by total and absolute political and economic self-determination and human arid moral values which make human beings paramount  not things or abstractions.29.	In all such ways as are available to us  the Bahamas delegation will be committed to making the hope of the young and the world a reality in our lifetime. To that end  we shall actively support action by this body that will: first  create machinery to enable the United Nations to resolve all existing territorial boundary matters which now remain unresolved and thereafter to guarantee the inviolability of those fixed physical boundaries  making it an offence against international law to acquire or dismember a State by force; second  create a permanent peace-keeping force to enable this body to enforce the guarantees of territorial integrity which will be afforded to every State; third  actively promote the further development of the developing and under-developed world by a massive development programme sponsored by the active participation of the two super-Powers in particular  acting not in ideological competition but in universal concert  so that no State in the world need be made subject or bondsman to any ideology and every State may enjoy real self-determination  free to pursue its own best internal policies; no nation need thereafter be subject to the hegemony of any other State  and the world may be freed from the confining limitations and conflicting pressures implicit in competing economic systems; fourth  remove the last remnants of colonialism from the world  in particular from southern Africa  and all forms of foreign domination of the small by the big; fifth  build upon the detente between the great Powers to create the climate for positive and active co-operation by them in proving to the world that peace is merely the means by which national boundaries may be transcended and a world order created with their collective co-operative leadership  by which their unlimited technological skills may be applied in the equitable distribution of the wealth of the earth and the seas; sixth  accomplish the international renunciation of ideological conflict  competition between economic systems  religious bigotry and racism in all its subtle forms.30.	The delegation of the Bahamas is committed to serve those ends. Some  perhaps  are Utopian  but all are capable of attainment provided that we all have the collective will."
"14",809,"BLR",28,1973,"﻿90.	The positive progress being made in the international situation  which has been brought about by the continued implementation of the policy of peaceful coexistence  has been adequately reflected in the statements of almost all heads of delegations who have taken part in the general debate now coming to an end at the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. The peoples of the world  who welcome with relief the process of international detente  which has begun  have once again recently found themselves confronted with dangerous developments as a result of the expansionist policy of the ruling circles in Israel  who have unleashed military action against the Arab countries. Representatives who have spoken here have welcomed the relaxation of international tension and have severely condemned the brigandage and violence which the Israeli aggressors have raised to the level of State policy.91.	The debate has also shown that the ranks of those who favour peace and international security  freedom and independence for all peoples and economic progress and social justice have grown considerably. It is also obvious that the favourable development of international relations is ensured by the active and constructive policy of the Soviet Union and the other socialist States  and that the successful implementation of the programme of peace put forward by the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union would serve the interests of all peoples of the planet.92.	The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR  which has played a part in the work of the United Nations since its establishment  notes with satisfaction that throughout the Organization's existence  and particularly during recent years  an ever-growing number of Member States have been displaying increasing interest in the most vital matters considered in the United Nations and have been giving constructive consideration to and showing active support for the proposals put forward by the socialist States. The time is past when the advocates of the ""cold war"" and the increase of international tension could block any proposal of ours for the simple reason that it was put forward by a socialist country.93.	No one — including those who speak from the forum of the United Nations — can doubt that the peace-loving  high-principled  class-based  internationalist  open and honest position of principle of the Soviet Union and the other States of the socialist community is in keeping with the interests and needs of all peoples  since it is aimed at strengthening peace and international security  consolidating alliances with peoples struggling for their national and social liberation  developing relations between States with different social systems on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence  struggling decisively against aggression and ensuring that the favourable changes which have been achieved on the international scene become irreversible.94.	What is important is that work on the fundamental reconstruction of relations between countries and between peoples in the interest of peace and co-operation is being conducted on a bilateral and a multilateral basis  by leaders of States in summit meetings and talks  both at the governmental and at the social level  involving the greatest variety of bodies and organizations and covering an ever-wider range of issues. All peace-loving forces throughout the world welcomed with ardent approval the visits of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Comrade L. I. Brezhnev  to the United States of America  the Federal Republic of Germany and France  the fruitful results of his talks with the leaders of those countries and the agreements which were concluded. That has been confirmed by many Ministers for Foreign Affairs who have spoken here  and who have stressed the great international importance of the results achieved through such summit meetings.95.	The anti-imperialist programme of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in September 1973  which speaks of the necessity for a resolute struggle for freedom  independence and peace  and condemns imperialism  colonialism and racism  merits approval and support. We are convinced that the forthcoming World Congress of Peace Forces  to be held in Moscow  will also make a worthy contribution to peace and security on earth.96.	As is well known  the second stage of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has recently begun. Talks between the USSR and the United States of America on strategic arms limitation have been resumed  and very important bilateral meetings are being conducted  or are pending. Talks on reductions in military forces and armaments in the Central European region will soon be continued. Consequently  opportunities for new steps toward further detente and the expansion of many forms of co-operation between States are more than adequate. The goodwill not only of the socialist States  but also of each participant in these vital meetings and talks  is needed in order to achieve success.97.	Considerable opportunities are also opening up for the General Assembly of the United Nations. It is essential that the constructive spirit of the general debate should be  maintained during consideration of specific items on the agenda; that will enable the General Assembly to make its own weighty contribution to the further relaxation of international tension. At the same time  it is essential to ensure constant vigilance and to rebuff resolutely any intrigues begun by forces which  openly or covertly  oppose a relaxation of tension in the world  advocate the stockpiling of weapons  sow distrust and enmity among peoples and impede the strengthening of peace and international security. Statements of individual speakers — fortunately only a small number — in the general debate have shown that there are still some who  while camouflaging what they say with words of peace  in fact hold positions which conflict with the interests of peace and co-operation. Such positions  even if stated or acted on by only a few  cannot go unnoticed. Through the joint efforts of each and every peace- loving State we can make those who oppose the relaxation of international tension submit to the will of peoples yearning for peace  justice and progress.98.	I should like to dwell further on a few of today's most vital international problems.99.	Twice within the lifetime of a single generation Europe has been the seat and the scene of world wars  which has brought the people of the Byelorussian SSR inexpressible grief and huge losses of life and has both times  as a result of total devastation  almost completely destroyed the economy. Consequently  it was with particular satisfaction that the working people of the Byelorussian SSR welcomed the recent favourable developments in Europe promoting the strengthening of peace and security.100.	The principles of the non-use of force and the inviolability of frontiers in Europe have been given legal status in treaties concluded by the USSR  the Polish People's Republic and the German Democratic Republic with the Federal Republic of Germany; a four-Power agreement has been concluded on West Berlin; the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed that the Munich diktat is null and void; and the first stage of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has been successfully completed. All these constitute a convincing victory for reason and realism and the success of the policy of peaceful coexistence. We want the European Conference to be a complete success and we hope that its work will be accomplished in the shortest possible time  without any delays or procrastination  and that Europe will become a continent of lasting peace and fruitful co-operation among States. There are many possibilities for achieving those ends. They are clearly and precisely set out in the draft general declaration of the foundations of European security and the principles guiding relations between States in Europe  which is being considered on the initiative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  and also in other proposals made by the socialist countries and relating to items on the Conference's agenda.101.	We again welcome the admission into the United Nations of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany  and we note with satisfaction the final and irrevocable recognition and consolidation of the international status of the German Democratic Republic as an independent sovereign socialist State.102.	The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR has always favoured the extension of detente to the whole world  to each region in it. During the current session of the General Assembly  speakers have noted with satisfaction the end of the war in Viet-Nam and Laos and the cessation of the bombing in Cambodia. We should at the same time firmly condemn the Saigon administration's violation of the Paris agreements ending the war and re-establishing peace in Viet-Nam  demand that they be strictly observed  and urge the full implementation of the agreements reached in Laos as well as non-interference in the internal affairs of all the peoples of Indo-China. In addition  we regard as totally unjustified the delay in the settlement of the problem of granting observer status in the United Nations to the representatives of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam.103.	The victory of the Viet-Namese people  the current reduction of tension in southern Asia  the active struggle for the restoration of peace throughout Indo-China and the growing support for the just demands of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the withdrawal of foreign forces from South Korea and the final dissolution of the bankrupt so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea are gratifying events in the continent of Asia. Now one of the primary tasks before us is the strengthening of collective security in Asia. In our view  all Asian countries without exception should join in this work and should ensure the triumph of such principles of mutual relations as the non-use of force or the threat of its use  respect for sovereignty and the inviolability of frontiers  non-interference in the internal affairs of others and the development of all-round co-operation on a basis of mutual respect and equality among peoples. One can only deplore the fact that some in Asia  following a policy of frantic anti-Sovietism and opposition to detente  do not desire the implementation of those principles  and will not face the fact that they are specifically set out in the United Nations Charter  the decisions of the African-Asian Conference  held at Bandung in April 1955  and other widely recognized international documents.104.	Because of the absence of a political settlement in the Middle East  the Israeli militarists have been able to fan the smouldering fires of military conflict in that area and  pursuing their expansionist policy  have unleashed military action against Egypt and Syria. Israel and those external reactionary circles which have constantly connived at its aggressive tendencies bear full responsibility for developments in the Middle East. In present conditions  unity of action and solidarity among all peace-loving countries are essential in order to ensure the restoration of the lawful rights of the Arab peoples. The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR  guided by the interests of peace  is ready to support the most resolute measures taken by the United Nations in order to ensure the full implementation of Security Council and General Assembly decisions relating to the Middle East  in other words  to bring about the total withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied Arab territories and to secure respect for the independence and inalienable rights of the States and peoples in that region  including the Arab people of Palestine.105.	A significant contribution towards intensifying the process of detente can be made within the United Nations if consistent and multilevel efforts are undertaken and if each Member of the United Nations displays readiness to cooperate in a constructive manner  and not to adopt the attitude of a dissatisfied critic or passively wait for others to act. These efforts must be specific and consistent  and must help to ensure that the agreements which have been reached are observed  that problems which are being considered are settled  that existing obstacles are overcome and that new initiatives are put forward which are in keeping with the interests of all peoples and with the United Nations Charter. The aim of consolidating successes already achieved and multiplying them in number requires resolute efforts on the part of all peace-loving forces. We must not lose sight of our ultimate objectives  but must strive towards them — and must always move forward  exploiting any opportunity  however small  to take specific measures which wouldgenuinely ensure a lasting peace. We know that such opportunities are available to us.106.	It is quite clear that the agreement concluded on 22 June 1973 between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America  aimed at preventing the outbreak of nuclear war between them and ensuring that they do all within their power to prevent any chance of such a war breaking out  is of enormous importance for the peace  of all mankind. Both sides have assumed a specific obligation to refrain from the threat or the use of force against each other  their allies or other countries in circumstances that might endanger international peace and security. It is vital  in order to ensure universal security and an enduring peace on earth  that other States should accept the principles which have been established jointly by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America  namely  the non-use of force and the adoption of resolute measures to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war. That could be done in various ways. The process would be encouraged by the earliest possible adoption by the Security Council of appropriate measures to ensure the full implementation of the resolution adopted last year by the General Assembly [resolution 2936 (XXVII)]  which on behalf of States Members of the United Nations  solemnly declared their renunciation of the use or threat of force in all its forms and manifestations in international relations  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons.107.	In the matter of disarmament  States have before them a broad field of action. An overwhelming majority of countries approves the agreements reached by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America on defensive and offensive strategic arms  and also the readiness displayed not only to limit offensive strategic weapons quantitatively and qualitatively  but also to adopt measures for the progressive reduction of such weapons. Some action has also been taken in the United Nations to limit and reverse the arms race. Nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere  in outer space and under water have been prohibited  well- known treaties concerning the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the prohibition of the emplacement of such weapons on the sea bed and the ocean floor and in outer space are being implemented  and a convention governing the removal of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons from military arsenals has been approved [see resolution 2826 (XXVI)]. But these are merely first steps toward the ideal of general complete disarmament  which has been approved by the United Nations.108.	Unfortunately  in recent years  the number of States becoming parties to the already existing agreements has been increasing at a slower rate  and one of those agreements is being openly violated by certain nuclear Powers. During the past year  the question of the prohibition of all nuclear tests by all States everywhere has remained at a standstill  and no progress has been achieved in the elimination of chemical weapons and the implementation of many other proposals submitted for consideration within the United Nations. Unfortunately  the General Assembly's decision concerning the convening of the World Disarmament Conference [resolution 2930 (XXVII)] has also reached an impasse because of the positions of two major Powers. Such circumstances require redoubled efforts on the part of all States to settle disarmament problems. It is essential to ensure that those who oppose disarmament and the convening of a World Disarmament Conference should cease to ignore the will of an overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations and all peoples of the world on these matters. The time has clearly come for States Members of this Organization to adopt a position on disarmament problems which would make possible active progress towards their practical solution.109.	'	Considerable opportunities in that field are opened up by the item ""Reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations by 10 per cent and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries""  which has been included in the agenda on the initiative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics [item 102]. The aims of this proposal  which combines measures of political and military detente with opportunities to increase many times the funds available for international assistance to the developing countries  not only are desirable  but are feasible in today's circumstances. The proposal does not prejudice the principle of equal security of States  and will benefit both the peoples of the countries putting into effect the proposed reduction in their military budgets and the peoples of the developing countries who are struggling for economic and social progress.110.	The Soviet proposal fully takes into account the desires of the developing countries  since its implementation would enable them  in an atmosphere of detente and greater security  to intensify their efforts to accelerate economic and social progress on a basis of radical social and economic transformations  full utilization of domestic resources and expansion of international assistance. It is no accident that this proposal has been welcomed by the overwhelming majority of such countries. However  we should ignore the wiles of those who invent artificial and unfounded arguments against this proposal  the more so as their so-called arguments do not hold water and merely show that there are still forces in the world interested in prolonging the arms race. One speaker here has openly called for an increase in the military expenditure of the United States  the countries of Western Europe and the developing States. It is also said that the trustworthiness of published data on the military expenditure of each State should be checked. This is nothing but an attempt to replace the question of reduction of military budgets by the question of control by the opponents of this proposal over all the economic and financial  activities of States. But we know full well that  even if this extreme curiosity — which is tantamount to interference in the internal affairs of the States — were to be satisfied  the opponents of disarmament would always find new  equally contrived ""arguments"" to avoid accepting the proposal submitted by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and supported by many other States. We have already heard one of these arguments. One speaker alleged that his country was already granting greater assistance to the developing countries than that provided for in the proposal of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Statistics and United Nations studies refute that allegation. Moreover  that speaker does not take into account the well-known fact that not only his country's annual military expenditure  but its entire budget over many years  would be insufficient to compensate the developing countries for the funds of which their economies have been plundered and continue to be plundered by violent means or by means of the so-called unbalanced exchange  to say the least.111.	If the United Nations wishes to make progress in the sphere of disarmament  it should also completely reject the untenable assertion that the question of the reduction of military budgets should not be discussed in the General Assembly because the proposals on this question were not approved by the Assembly during the years of the ""cold war""  when the voting machinery was in the hands of the opponents of disarmament. If we follow this line of reasoning  it means that we should not have worked for the convening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  or for the issue of the invitation to representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the consideration of questions relating to Korea  or that we should give up the struggle for peace  for decolonization and against racism  for the sole reason that  in the past  the proposals on these questions were rejected in the United Nations — and we know by whom. But these are different times  and there are many new possibilities for overcoming problems which were previously blocked. The United Nations must take advantage of these new conditions  in which peace-loving forces have serried their ranks arid international tension is easing  and give additional impetus to the realization of the noble purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.112.	The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR will actively strive for an effective solution of all the principal problems on the agenda of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. A number of them have already been referred to. We will also do our utmost to ensure the implementation by all States of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)]  and to press for the completion and the approval of a draft treaty concerning the moon and the international convention on principles governing the use by States of artificial earth satellites for direct television broadcasting [A/8771  annex].113.	As in all previous years  my delegation will be in the ranks of those who are consistent supporters of the active struggle for the complete elimination of colonialism and the securing of freedom for peoples which are under Portuguese colonial domination or which are kept in slavery by the racist regimes in southern Africa. We shall resolutely support the efforts of the United Nations to put an end to the pernicious activities of international monopolies in dependent Territories  and we shall urge that the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations should fully promote the process of decolonization in their activities. The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR welcomes the proclamation of a new independent State  the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  on land won from the Portuguese colonialists  and wishes the people of that country success in building a new life in conditions of freedom  independence and the complete liberation of their homeland from the colonial yoke. We wish success to all colonial peoples in their just struggle for freedom and independence.114.	My delegation will fully support United Nations efforts to eliminate apartheid and all forms of racial discrimination  or any other infringement of basic human rights. At the same time we shall press for the approval of the draft Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid  the implementation by all countries of existing international legal instruments concerning the struggle against racism and the safeguarding of human rights  and also the adoption of the draft principles of international co-operation in the detection  arrest  extradition and punishment of persons guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity [A/9326].115.	At the present session of the General Assembly many delegations have referred to the question of the observance of human rights. Most of those who have spoken have quite rightly demanded the elimination of apartheid and racism and the cessation of violations of human rights by aggressors and colonialists. Unfortunately  individual representatives are attempting to use United Nations efforts to ensure the observance of human rights in order to interfere in the internal affairs of other States. They are ready to protect the ""rights"" only of individuals who  by their irresponsible utterances or actions  are rendering a service to the forces of imperialism and reaction and slandering the socialist States or attempting to defect to the camp of the aggressors. At the same time  these so-called protectors of human rights close their eyes to the mass crimes of racists  colonialists and reactionaries  not only in violating human rights but also in physically destroying innocent persons because of their democratic convictions. They do not say a word in support of the rights of democrats in Chile and their patriotic efforts to carry out socio-economic transformations in the interests of the working people of that country. They waste no time in recognizing the military dictators' regime in that country  though elsewhere throughout the world  including the Byelorussian SSR  the people have unanimously condemned the actions of the military junta in Chile  which killed the President of the country  Salvador Allende  dissolved the National Congress and local organs of power  trampled on the rights of workers and banned trade unions  abrogated constitutional guarantees for the elementary democratic rights of Chilean citizens and is now pursuing a bloody reign of terror against the progressive forces in the country and the entire Chilean people. The self-styled defenders of human rights remain silent on these events. Many of them remain silent too when the question of the struggle against apartheid and racism and the fight for the rights of Africans is discussed  or the violations of human rights in their own countries. As a rule  these speakers represent countries which are not parties to the conventions  treaties and covenants aimed at combating racism and ensuring the observance of human rights which have been prepared in the United Nations.116.	The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR is proud of the fact that  in our Republic and throughout the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  there are genuine guarantees for an immeasurably wider range of human rights than those provided for in international legal instruments approved by the United Nations. We are party to all the most important international agreements on human rights and conscientiously observe them. This year the Byelorussian SSR ratified the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI)  annex] and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [ibid]  and it calls upon all countries to adhere to these documents and to join in the genuine struggle for the safeguarding of human rights and freedoms everywhere and for the elimination of flagrant and mass violations of such rights.117.	The views of the socialist States  including the Byelorussian SSR  on questions of equitable economic    commercial  scientific and technological co-operation in the interests of all peoples  with due regard for the needs and demands of the developing countries  are well known. They are actively put into practice in the United Nations and in other international bodies concerned with such problems. We do our best to prevent and overcome the pernicious effects of the activities of the neo-colonialists and international monopolies on the economies of developing countries  and also to protect the interests of the developing countries and to ensure that they can overcome the obstacles to their economic and social progress created as a result of long domination by the colonialists and of the policy they still pursue of plundering the peoples of the developing countries or of infringing their legitimate rights in international economic relations. We provide considerable assistance to those countries  partly through our participation in United Nations international assistance programmes.118.	May I dwell briefly on one more question — the need for strict compliance by all  without exception  with the United Nations Charter. Present conditions of detente and the consolidation of all anti-imperialist forces provide a genuine opportunity  greater than ever before  for the full utilization and implementation of all provisions of the Charter in order to ensure that the activities of United Nations bodies are carried out exclusively in order to achieve the purposes and principles of the Organization  the most important of which is the strengthening of universal peace. Today  more than ever before  any attempt to undermine the United Nations Charter  and thereby the Organization itself  is absolutely unacceptable. Those who favour a revision of the Charter obviously hope that  by endless arguments about the merits and shortcomings of the Charter and about what should be done in the future  they will be able to avoid the need to comply with the Charter or to justify their previous activities  which have been contrary to the Charter. The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR appeals to all participants in the General Assembly to reject any direct or indirect proposals allegedly intended to make the United Nations more effective  but in fact aimed at revising  violating or not complying strictly with the Charter. We still have considerable work to do to ensure that the United Nations Charter is complied with by all  everywhere  in every sphere of international life and human activity  so that the peoples of the world are satisfied with its activities and the results it achieves.119.	The Byelorussian SSR has always attached great importance to the United Nations and  through 28 years' participation in its work  guided by its Leninist peace-loving foreign policy  has done its best to achieve the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR has always striven to ensure that the United Nations should be an important and effective instrument in maintaining peace and reducing international tension  and that it should be used in the interests of comprehensive and equitable co-operation among States. We have pursued and are pursuing this policy  both duringGeneral Assembly sessions and in all bodies in the United Nations and its specialized agencies of which we are members. We shall continue to do so in the future everywhere — both in the principal organs of the United Nations and in its subsidiary bodies; at major international conferences and in small meetings; in the formal consideration and settlement of questions and in the course of consultations with all those who are concerned for peace and progress on earth."

We have come from every country in the world in the name of all races  all peoples  who speak the most diverse languages and profess the most different faiths  but we do so prompted by a common desire for understanding for the sake of peace and justice on earth. Thus  the United Nations possesses the necessary condition of universality and is an expression of the natural and healthy principle of unity in diversity.277.	I wish before this distinguished gathering to convey a message of friendship from the people and Government of Bolivia to all the nations representedhere: our solidarity with their efforts and sacrifices to forge the destiny of man; our satisfaction at their achievements in the economic  political and social fields; and our sincere desire for a greater rapprochement so that we may get to know each other better and help each other more in effectively supporting so many shared ideals.278.	As a Latin American  and in particular as a citizen of the favourite child of Bolivar  which with Ecuador maintains a lengthy and beautiful tradition of sharing the same glorious and historic sufferings  I am particularly gratified to see raised to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly an enlightened Ecuadorian statesman and diplomat  Mr. Leopoldo Benites. His wise election is a continuation of the presence of Latin America in the United Nations which began with the Foreign Minister of Brazil  Mr. Oswaldo Aranha  followed wisely by Mr. Luis Padilla Nervo of Mexico  Mr. Jose Maza of Chile  Mr. Victor Andres Belaunde of Peru  Mr. Carlos Sosa Rodriguez of Venezuela and Mr. Emilio Arenales Catalan of Guatemala. We are convinced that the difficult task that the world has entrusted to you  Mr. President  = will be crowned by success.279.	May I also express my cordial congratulations to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski for his wise and able conduct of the past session. In truth  his election was a wise decision  for in the course of our deliberations he guided us with great skill and talent.280.	I am also particularly gratified to express my sincere appreciation of the valuable and fruitful work of our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose strong personality enhances the prestige of our Organization and confers the seal of seriousness and responsibility on his very difficult and special tasks.281.	My delegation is sincerely pleased at the admission to our Organization of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. In the case of the latter  my Government has recently established diplomatic and trade relations.282.	The presence of both Germanys  a single nation divided into two States  is a living and consistent expression of a pragmatic policy with a great capacity to adapt to contemporary realities and an important contribution to the ideals of peace nurtured by mankind.283.	I am convinced that both Germanys  representing a people who have known as much as any other the hardships of war  will make a valuable contribution to our work  a contribution that brings with it an age-old flow of wisdom  discipline and creative sense.284.	Similarly  I extend the most fraternal welcome to the State of the Bahamas which not long ago proclaimed its independence and is a new member of the Caribbean group of nations within the American system. This young nation so full of vitality and hope will  I am convinced  inject newstrength into the visionary action of Latin America in our Organization.285.	My country is living the drama inherent in all countries suffering from limitations in the exploitation of their natural resources. Rather than a problem of dependence  it is a matter of means and of the use of adequate technology. That is why we seek in international co-operation the way to fill these gaps.286.	Like other nations both in our own geographic area and in other parts of the world  we struggle against the chronic evils of fiscal deficit and monetary instability. The constant deterioration of the terms of trade has a direct bearing on this economic phenomenon.287.	The situation to which we have referred leads to a progressive increase in the cost of living and its inevitable counterpart  popular discontent and systematized subversion. But it is worth while stressing that  as we have said  this is not due to bad or ineffective administration.288.	Ours is the fate of the poverty and backwardness that characterizes so many countries side by side with strong  powerful and wealthy nations. The solution  then  is not so much in ourselves as in the highly industrialized rich countries  which are called upon to show with deeds the solidarity they claim and the global approach they advocate.289.	International social justice is not to be based on the indifference of prosperous States in the face of the afflicting situation of needy nations  nor can it stem from an international division of labour which condemns the latter to produce in favour of the former. In human societies it is no longer admitted that man should work for the exclusive benefit of a fortunate few.290.	Just as we seek to consolidate world peace  we must guarantee social peace among our peoples. The former must be built on mutual respect  the balance of power and the observance of the institutions and the principles that govern them; the latter can be based only on a communal society in which the concept of the dignity of the human person prevails and which is spared the misery  the poverty and the acute social ills of our time.291.	So long as we do not achieve a structuring of the world society in which resources and the resulting benefits of their application are for the benefit of all  we shall need international financial assistance and a rationalized transfer of technology. This is what my country needs to achieve a relative well-being for its people and to create with the other countries on the continent and in the world a better future. Whatever happens in the private context of nations also happens in the international sphere.292.	If financial assistance to carry out development works is curtailed or"" denied  Governments may feel tempted to resort to illegal sources of foreign currency inthe black market — sources that hurt the image of the dignity of States because of the particular profit they produce and the humiliation they impose on those who engage in such practices.293.	After the Revolution of August 1971 it is true that Bolivia received substantial support from the Government of the United States of America to overcome the crisis and establish a process of growing democratization  which culminated in the convening of elections for next year. We must sensibly finance our five-year development plan  which is to give our country a great new start in life.294.	So much is said of the popular explosion on earth and of the shortage of food-stuffs that one wonders why the necessary assistance is not provided so that these may be produced in abundant quantities in countries like Bolivia. Irrigation schemes such as that of Abapo-Izozog have been conceived to irrigate initially 300 000 hectares  with prospects of arriving at the ambitious figure of 2 million. The El Bala dam  on the Beni river basin  in the gorges of the eastern Andean mountains in the Department of La Paz  was declared at the last Conference of Foreign Ministers in Lima as being of interest for all the countries in the Andean basin. Other minor projects  like the Oquitas project  also await the magic wand of international contributions and financing from regional and world credit institutions.295.	One problem that disturbs the Bolivian people because it affects its sovereignty and hampers its free progress is that of its status as a land-locked country. As regards this important question  we are not making complaints. We place ourselves in the current of modern trends which seek  in the last analysis  to establish a world community of nations. To embark upon this road  which may appear Utopian to some  is in fact to solve many of the peremptory needs which exist in the world  such as that of Bolivia.296.	We have always maintained that Chile and my country complement each other. The nation of O'Higgins appears to me to be more imprisoned between the sea and the Andes than my own country  which has direct contact through five open frontiers with five Republics. An outlet to the Pacific would firmly establish friendship between Chile and Bolivia and dispel so much mistrust which darkens the future of the southern tip of America.297.	Inspired by the most laudable American sentiments  we have proposed a dialogue so that through direct talks we may devise a solution which is in keeping with our great problem and which will enable Chile  by way of reciprocity  to obtain benefits in keeping with its interests and which would guarantee the welfare of its people  the prosperity of backward regions and the security of northern Chile. We nourish the hope that now that its present Government is devoted to tasks of moral and material reconstruction  soon the necessary favourable conditions to open negotiations will exist so that these two countries may arrive at an important agreement governing their future.298.	In the regional context  Latin America continues its inevitable course towards unity. There is a general awareness of this. It began in the Amphictyonic Congress of Panama convened by Bolivar in 1826. Before that  both extremes of South America had met  with the same desire for universality  in the famous interview of Guayaquil  which brought together Bolivar  the Liberator and San Martin  the Saint of the Sword.299.	That unionist trend gained renewed topicality and importance with the Continental Treaty of 1854 and the Union and Defensive Alliance of 1865  concluded in Lima. With the subsequent constitution of the Pan-American Union and the present Organization of American States  Latin America succeeded in creating a Central American Common Market and the subregional organizations of the River Plate basin  the Andean Pact and the Amazon countries.300.	The Latin American Free Trade Association [LAFTA]  that is  the Latin American common market  despite its shortcomings  pursues the achievement of its laudable purposes. CECLA  that is  the Special Committee on Latin American Co-ordination  is achieving the purposes for which it was established.301.	All these bodies reflect pressing needs and undeniable realities  although there is a general demand to make their structures adequate to the requirements of a changing world and to the challenges of human intelligence with its awe-inspiring creations and daring feats in space  which are leaving behind and unsolved the most acute problems of our world.302.	We agree with what was said by the most enlightened statesmen on our continent in this world forum to the effect that the great problem of Latin America is the problem of under-development. To overcome this condition  we have been striving to create broader markets in a joint effort of economic association.303.	The marginal condition of vast masses of mankind is another of its conflicting realities. Social and economic structures must be changed  beginning with an agrarian reform  a policy for the distribution of national revenue for the benefit of man's health  housing  education and food.304.	Political stability  on which the progress of Latin American countries is based  does not depend on the will of its leaders  but on the economic and social conditions in which their peoples live. That is why there is urgent need to contribute collectively to the improvement of such conditions if truly we seek to take a long leap in history. The criticisms levelled against the instability of many of our Governments must go hand in hand with co-operation and aid. Anything else is like regretting the fate of a patient to whom we do not give the medicine he needs to get well.305.	Apart from Bolivia's problems of access to the sea  we have in Latin America the case of the Panama Canal  sovereignty over which Panama claims and in this it is backed by the other Governments of the continent. Thesame thing happens with the sacrosanct cause of the Bolivians which has found such great understanding among the Governments of Caracas  Bogota  Quito and Lima  on the occasion of the recent tour of those countries by my country's President  General Don Hugo Banzer Suarez.306.	With regard to the colonialism subsisting in our region  our nations are at one in demanding its total elimination and the protection of the right to self-determination of our peoples.307.	I could not end this part of my statement without expressing my feelings upon the tragic death of the President of Chile  Mr. Salvador Allende  whom I had the honour to meet in the interview we had in the city of Buenos Aires when General Lanusse handed over power to ex-President Campora. That death recalls that of Balmaceda  another distinguished Chilean President  and reveals a profound human quality in President Allende. The leader of Chilean socialism fell like a courageous captain at the head of his cause and in defence of his Government  like Mayor Gualberto Villarroel  a leader of nationalism in my country  immolated in the Quemado Palace on the altar of his ideals  and of Oscar Unzaga de la Vega  founder and leader of the Bolivian Socialist Falange  who lost his life in an open fight for freedom  justice and democracy.308.	Now let me speak of America  but not of its special peculiarities. Historically and geographically its unity is. absolute. Columbus and Americo Vespucio discovered it and gave it its name. It is unnatural to exclude from it North America. We cannot conceive of a unit without one of its parts. We constitute a hemisphere  the hemisphere of human hope. Why not think rather of adding Canada  which shares our common territorial heritage and  like all our countries  emerged from the same historic adventure of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries? Let us move forward rather than backward.309.	I have been particularly concerned about the situation of the relatively less developed countries in South America  namely  Bolivia  Ecuador  Paraguay and Uruguay. That is why  in the Andean Pact  we came to an agreement on the holding of a meeting between these countries to assess the meaning of the integration agreements  the treatment of these countries in the UNCTAD classification  the forthcoming negotiations to be held under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] and the financial co-operation of international institutions  as well as the general progress achieved in this policy of development.310.	The aforementioned analysis within the continental  framework must cover the Central American and Caribbean nations  members of the Central American Common Market [CACM] and the Caribbean Free Trade Association [CARIFTA].311.	To that meeting  to be held in the Bolivian city of Cochabamba in the second half of January 1974  representatives of LAFTA  the Andean subregion  the River Plate Basin  the Economic Commission for Latin America  the Latin-American Institute for Economic and Social Planning  UNCTAD  GATT  FAO  the UnitedNations Development Programme [UNDP]  the World Health Organization  the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization  the International Labour Organisation and the International Monetary Fund. The financial institutions to be represented are the World Bank  the Inter-American Development Bank and the Andean Development Corporation  and  as special guests  representatives of the CACM and CARIFTA with their regional banks and financial institutions and the International Union of Catholic Employers' Associations.312.	We believe that this event  which is to be held under the auspices of the economically less developed among the countries of South America  on the initiative of the Foreign Ministry of Bolivia  will be crowned with success. A vast organic and rational agenda  which has already been transmitted to the parties concerned  will highlight the historic importance of this international forum.313.	Until not long ago the human spirit was disturbed by the doubt that it might not be able ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" — one of the most noble principles in our Charter.314.	It would appear that we did not feel able ""to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours"" and ""to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security"" as also prescribed by the Charter.315.	However  thanks to the innovating initiative of President Nixon and his personal aid  Mr. Kissinger  the present Secretary of State  there has been a relaxation in international relations between the great Powers and peace has been brought to areas of the world that were either beset or threatened by war.316.	The policy of decolonization is also being strengthened and it is possible that in the near future all forms of political  religious or racial discrimination will disappear.317.	Fratricidal violence and inhuman terrorism  cloaked in apparently altruistic aims  calls for common legislation to characterize them and sanction them. Sectarian convenience or electoral interests should not be allowed to protect them or to mask them under the cloak of feigned ignorance when such facts are objective and condemned by universal conscience.318.	As regards international pending problems and latent conflicts  a desire for war  or the wish of the strong to dictate to the weaker  serve no purpose. What we need is a negotiated solution which is beneficial to all and falls within the framework of the Charter.319.	No one can maintain that conquest gives rights. Before the United Nations  the American doctrine of 3 August 1932  which condemns territorial acquisition derived from war  had anticipated this concept.320.	But there are essential elements in the life and sovereignty of a country  elements without which a State cannot feel secure. Bolivia claims its frontier on the PacificOcean  There  in the beginning of the universal road of the seas  it finds its security.321.	The Organization must watch over the subsistence of its Member States and must assimilate all the national entities that are not yet Members or have been left outside the Organization.322.	The right to international life does not depend on the vote of a council or the consensus of an assembly. Nations  like' men  have a right to respect for their existence.323.	Reason does not obey the dictates of the strong or the whim of the majorities. The truth is one  luminous  undistortable  like the sun that gives us light.J24. You may divide nations but you cannot change nature. When you try to change nature it reacts with greater violence. It is like history  which is presided over by the law of Karma  of which the thinker  Lin Yutang  speaks so eloquently.325.	Justice  human and international  cannot be fettered. It is the beacon that lights the way of universal conscience and guides man along the paths of history. There are entelechies  like justice  that are stronger than the power of the dominators.326.	In view of all this  there is a hope in the minds of hungering peoples and of nations in subjection  a hope that they may achieve their liberation and come under the benevolent regime of free and civilized coexistence.327.	Instigation to violence  material assistance to subversive underground warfare  concealment of terrorism — all these in fact do not favour peace or contribute to justice. Warlike actions are just as tragic as those deriving from violent and treacherous conspiracies.328.	Occurrences involving bloodshed  systematic hatred and destruction must be prevented in all countries. Such is the unavoidable necessity for all who are born into this world and for all who do not wish to perish in the whirlpool of senseless human passions.329.	The greatness of nations does not reside in the capacity to dominate our planet or to conquer outer space  but in the careful consideration and wisdom they should contribute in guiding mankind to the full realization of its destiny.330.	Man does not base his happiness on the heady wine of material victories at the expense of his fellow men  but rather on the subjective realization of relative well-being and on the search for his origin and his destiny. All else is an affront to the freedom of his conscience and reduces him to the lowest level of the zoological scale.331.	Along with all of this  we hear a great deal about detente. After the relaxation of international tension  where do we go? To smother danger is not to build a new order.332.	Mankind must go to the root of its troubles. Resources can be found by Powers to arm themselves and to explore outer space; but there are no means to be found tocombat disease  illiteracy  the hardship n: which millions of human beings must live  hung* unemployment and poverty.333.	It is proposed that military expenditure be reduced by 10 per cent for the purpose of assistance to developing countries. Armaments  as everyone knows  are a prelude to war. This phenomenon is taking place  paradoxically  in the present-day world  where some go begging for their bread while others waste their money on weapons. It is to be hoped that the aforementioned suggestive idea will not remain simply a demagogic playing with words or a mere lyrical pose. Let us arrive at an agreement in this regard and let even the medium-sized and small nations participate in that endeavour — those very nations which should not  in addition to the misfortune of their under-development  have to suffer the catastrophe of an armed struggle.334.	In ancient times  as is well known  people armed to prepare themselves for war. Some centuries have gone by and it may be hoped that the human mind has changed in some respects. Peace is secured by suppressing wars at their very root. There is neither justice nor virtue in poverty. The source for brotherly human coexistence is to be found in well-being. Let us therefore cultivate the earth rather than produce in our factories the tools for destroying and cutting short human lives.335.	If happiness is the magnetic north that guides mankind  freedom is the natural atmosphere in which the life of nations is lived. International relaxation of tension can thus be reflected in economic relations  but it is anachronistic indeed if there remain captive peoples as a consequence of a war.336.	There are Powers that have decided on how not to interfere in the internal life of other countries. Their trick consists in converting other countries into satellite nations through armed occupation. It is of no help if the victims maintain the contrary in praise of their executioners.337.	Man is free by nature and he broke the chains that enslaved him many years ago. We cannot condone the existence of subject peoples. It is not true that self-determination encourages a retreat from independent life and from the autonomous and sovereign right of people to govern themselves.338.	It is usual to see the mote in the other's eye but not the beam in one's own  as the Holy Scriptures tell us. It is for that reason that some call for the withdrawal of certain armies from occupied territories. But we see no example of such withdrawals on the part of the forces which are subjugating nations that have been free for centuries.339.	Some are loud in denunciation of armies that overthrow governments. It is commonly forgotten that the armed forces of a nation form a substantial part of the people. Much more serious is the case of the troops  the tanks and aircraft that invade countries and conquer peoples with age-old cultures and independent traditions.340.	The history of peoples cannot be enclosed in chapters  as happens with the citizens of a country when they are placed in concentration camps and prisons andsubjected to torture. The life of nations is continuous and permanent. Their lands and their right to govern themselves can be taken from them  but never their life  never their presence as stars in the wide firmament of mankind and of time itself.341.	The time has come to think more seriously about a sort of universal human society on earth. With the elimination of international rivalries and the quenching of the mad thirst for universal domination  there will come about a joining of efforts  of technologies and resources in the exclusive service of all mankind.342.	Governments do not last for ever. All our traditions confirm this. The elements of power vary with the passage of time and the effects of circumstances. Powers decline and new ones emerge. The balance of power varies and we must seek therefore to avoid as far as possible its periodic fluctuations. This does not mean we must try to stratify history  which would be deadly for man  but rather that we must avoid using national resources for wasteful purposes of conquest and domination.343.	It is important that international coexistence be safeguarded. Ideological pluralism is a fact and a doctrine  if you will. We are compelled to respect other peoples. They have the right to choose whatever form of political life is best suited to them. What must be fought against is precisely any disregard of the right to self-determination. It is this that separates Governments and not the nature of the regime that rules.344.	International organizations base their existence on constitutions. There are declarations recognizing the rights of men and of citizens. There is need for the Mexican document which defines the economic rights and duties of States. There is much to be said concerning this and it is both logical and proper for the small countries to go before the great countries in a dramatic demand for international justice together with effective and sincere co-operation in development.345.	Several nations of America  Europe  Africa and Asia are awaiting the establishment of rules that will define and guarantee the inherent powers enjoyed by land-locked countries. The legislation in this regard must apply to all universally. Just as with the sea-bed freedom of navigation and direct access to coasts and fisheries cannot remain within the framework of mere declarations.346.	Preferences are established in favour of the economically less developed countries with regard to subregional  regional and world bodies. This has been stated in Tokyo to the Director-General of GATT and the representatives there assembled. Bolivia  with justice and good reason  requests the special consideration of this matter  one that will embrace all the peoples which  furthermore  lack a sea coast.347.	Among the rights of man there is the right of free transit and residence. It is a law of men that cannot be restricted as it is recognized throughout the world. The contrary would be to recognize slavery and to prevent children from returning to the homes of their elders.348.	My delegation cannot but express its concern over the debates in our Organization. It could be said that we often forget the spirit of the Charter. We seek conciliation among men  yet we are accustomed here not to employ the dialectic of intelligence  but rather that of frozen attitudes.349.	The clearest and purest essence of democracy lies in the right to dissent. To be able to exercise this right without the risk of annihilation  man has shed his blood throughout his journey through history.350.	The right to express one's view is as precious as the right to existence and a worthwhile life. Only animals produce sounds without meaning for us  like the roaring of the blind tempests of nature. To deny that right is equivalent to turning man into an animal.351.	The policy of special privilege is contrary to justice. A few cannot live at the expense of the poverty of the great majority of mankind. Nor does exploitation by industrialized countries of the producers of raw materials contribute anything to peace.352.	National income should be distributed among the ordinary citizens  just as it is necessary to adopt a policy of equitable regulation of what is bought and sold by countries of differing economic conditions.353.	Finally  we must talk about faith — about the faith of man in himself  about the faith of peoples in their creative capacities  about the faith of the international community in its organizations and the precepts that nourish them. I wish to state  in the name of my Government  that the Bolivian people believes in the effectiveness of the subregional and regional groupings to which it belongs. It believes in the River Plate Basin and the Andean Group. It believes in the Organization of American States. And  finally  it believes in the United Nations  the Organization to which we look to guarantee universal peace and without which there would be no security for either man or nations. And the Bolivian people expresses the hope that it will be able  moreover  to stop the resumption of operations in the Middle East."
"16",938,"BRA",28,1973,"﻿Mr. President  I wish to begin by expressing the gratification of the Government of Brazil and my own at your election to preside over the twenty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your vast diplomatic experience and the brilliant services you have always rendered to your country  to the inter-American system and to the international community assure us that our work during this session will be guided by your proven lucidity and political acumen. As a Brazilian  I recognize among your attributes the outstanding values of the noble people of Ecuador  a country which has always been linked to Brazil through friendship  mutual respect and a co-operation which we are today expanding more than ever; as a Latin American  I am aware that your personal attributes are highly representative of the long lineage of statesmen and internationalists who have built up the cultural and political heritage of our continent. The historic deeds of those statesmen and leaders mirrored the common cultural origins of Iberia — that discoverer of seas and continents  sower of civilizations  and heiress to and propagator of the Mediterranean cultures. Luso-Spanish Iberia intermingled with the aboriginal races of America and acquired a new dimension through the contribution of the blood and cultural values of Africa. This is exemplified by my own country  Brazil  where all these influences were amalgamated  rendering it for that very reason so profoundly Latin American and so much part and parcel of the Latin American world which nominated you  Sir  as an authentic representative of our continent  to the presidency of this Assembly. 3.	The presence in this hall of the delegations of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic  resulting from a long and patient process of political evolution  is a positive sign of the detente now sought by contemporary diplomacy. My country  which did not hesitate to sacrifice the lives of its sons to defend the ideals of freedom and democracy on European battlefields  can well appreciate the true significance of the admission to the United Nations of both those States. To the United Nations  founded as an alternative to the use of force in inter-State relations  this event overcomes one of the most acute problems of the political balance-sheet of the post-war era. Brazil maintains with the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany relations that I dare to describe as exemplary. Wide-ranging common interests have for many years been drawing our two countries together again  under reciprocally and increasingly advantageous conditions.4.	It is my hope that negotiations in progress with the German Democratic Republic  with which we have been sustaining fruitful commercial relations for over a decade  will result very soon in a reciprocally beneficial relationship based on mutual respect.5.	It is with the greatest pleasure that I welcome in a very special way the delegation of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  a sister country from our continent  which we shall receive with an open heart into our Latin American group and with which we wish to develop increasingly broad and cordial co-operation.6.	No one in good faith can fail to applaud a policy of detente which seeks and propounds understanding and co-operation as alternatives to mistrustful isolation and to latent conflict. We look upon this relaxation of tensions with renewed hopes that inspired diplomatic action may gather momentum and reach all the existing hotbeds of crisis and eliminate them. None the less  while squarely facing the political  economic and social realities of our times  we are bound to ask objectively: detente for whom  detente for what?7.	We view as the source of the policies of detente a willingness on the part of the super-Powers and the great Powers to launch a process of peace-seeking and understanding which has brought about a National and pragmatic placation of the conflicts of interests in the vast field of the political-strategic balance as well as in the area of dominant influences — dominant because they are built on objective conditions of unmatched power. That willingness to desist from further confrontation has motivated and rendered possible new European developments — as evidenced in recently concluded treaties and in other agreements still under way — aimed at establishing peace in Europe and creating a European security system  envisaging the reduction of arsenals and troops and also serving the purpose of stimulating closer economic co-operation. Although laudable  meritorious and of extreme importance  this detente none the less cannot-by inference be a regional goal  nor can it be thought of as a temporary arrangement to accommodate certain conveniences and interests.8.	We hope that this determination to desist from confrontation  this rationalization of what is politically viable and diplomatically feasible  will provide elements of action to extend those processes of peace-bringing and understanding to all areas of conflict  thereby safeguarding and rendering compatible the mutual interests of the parties directly concerned.9.	Detente  as we envisage it  should be the extension to the whole of the international scene of this political will to pacify and co-operate. It should inject this political will into the body and system of our Organization. It should offer opportunity for finally implementing the purposes and principles of the Charter  and for the United Nations to pay its ethical debt to itself — namely  the eradication of underdevelopment. To reduce detente to a rationale for the use  and for the balance  of power  to regionalize its scope and objectives —  and hence to forgo using it as an instrument for normative reconstruction and as an inspiration and guide line for a policy of global relaxation — would be tantamount to reviving the fallacy of arrangements based on considerations of power which are transient and fleeting because they fail to comprehend the dynamics of internatiotial problems and because they are uninspired by any sense of the future.10.	From the renewed diplomatic interaction which these first steps in the process of detente may set in motion  a more equitable international order must emerge  one which should foster an effective system of collective political and economic security based neither on oppression nor on the alleged acquired rights of the strongest but on the recognition of the just claims and interests of all States  their sovereign right to full economic development and social well-being  and their participation on an equal footing in the institutionalization of the rules of collective behavior. It is hard  if not impossible  to believe that the policy of relaxation of tensions will succeed outside those parameters. The past is teeming with examples of the fragility of arrangements contrived merely to serve the momentary interests of the exercise of power or to allocate such interests within the fallacious framework of spheres of influence. These arrangements have never survived the wear and tear inflicted by crises and contradictions of policies inspired by the myth of power and its alleged rights and hence policies which are unequitable and unjust  What we need today — now that we would appear to be more experienced and more convinced of the frailty of the exclusivist concepts of international security — what we need today  I repeat  more than a temporary harmonization of means  is a common and global concept of the ends we seek.11. As a means or an instrument  the policy of relaxation of tensions will either achieve greatness or demean itself  depending on the ultimate aims it pursues. As it is not endowed with mechanisms for automatic control and adjustments  the success of detente will be contingent on our capacity to expand it so that its long-term aims are not lost sight of and so that it does not become an instrument for the imposition of hegemonic arrangements. I am ready to agree that such is not the purpose. Since it is not  let us stand guard to prevent it from being reduced to such a purpose by temptations along its course and by unforeseen crises. It is our belief  furthermore  that the new orientation that is being sought for international relations will be meaningless in the long term if those attempts aim at no more than drafting a charter to discipline inter-State interests in the affluent areas of mankind and fail  therefore  to meet the very legitimate claims of countries outside that area.12.	This is an ovemding concern of Brazil's foreign policy which  conscious of its global responsibilities and commitments  assigns priority to close co-operation with all developing countries  and especially those of Latin America.13.	During the last few years  it has been my duty to translate into diplomatic action the instructions and directives laid down by President Medici to foster and expand the political  economic and cultural ties between Brazil and the sister nations of our continent. Bilaterally and multilaterally  Brazil's inter-American policy will firmly continue to seek the goals of solidarity  reciprocal assistance  understanding and the minimization of sporadic dissidences  since Brazil is averse to rivalries  resentments and hegemonies which have no place among us.14.	It is our conviction  however  that while regional scenarios must be dealt with in accordance with their specific needs  they should be seen in perspective within the system of the United Nations. The lines of negotiation now prevailing cannot run parallel to the normative system of the Charter but on the contrary must be geared to it; otherwise  they will lack consistency and will not profit from the constructive evaluation and invigorating support of the community of States joined together in this Organization in the search of peace for all  security for all and collective progress .15.	It is for this forum to decide on the compatibility between instruments laterally negotiated and the purposes and principles of the Charter  so that the convenience of some will not be construed as the measure of the interests of all the others. Thus  once submitted to the scrutiny of our General Assembly  the agreements on the non-use of force in international relations and on the prevention of nuclear war  which are timely and valid in principle  will gain a new normative dimension  thereby allaying the suspicion that they may become an instrument for the imposition of a tutelage system by the great Powers. The expectations aroused by the policy of ddtente will materialize only if the relaxation of tensions puts an end to the nuclear arms race and if effective measures of general and complete disarmament are not confined to the secret negotiation of agreements that do not go beyond disciplining the expansion and sophistication of nuclear devices.16.	Like so many other Member States  Brazil hopes that the relaxation of tensions in critical areas will prevent the interrelated questions of disarmament and collective security from remaining intractable and unsettled in this forum  as they have been to date. The task of achieving disarmament and arms control was assigned to this General Assembly by the founders of our Organization as one of its primary responsibilities. I would be less than candid were I not to express my Government's disappointment at the lack of concrete results of disarmament negotiations  particularly during the last two years  both in this Assembly and in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. Vitiated by its original flaws  the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference has not really come into being.17.	In the specific case of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  we are led to the conclusion that it has increasingly eluded its tasks  or to say the least  that it has been incapable of carrying them out. Notwithstanding a much-touted spirit of conciliation  the meetings of the Conference and the negotiating process itself have been handicapped by political restrictions that have blocked the possibility of reaching meaningful decisions. What is the explanation for the frustrating results of so many efforts? It seems clear that the work of the Conference has not been as attuned to international trends as one would hope or wish. The ambiguous relationship between the General Assembly and the Conference  which has existed since the very inception of the Disarmament Committee — that is  since the Zorin-Stevenson Declaration of 1961' — may perhaps have been the greatest obstacle to our goal of making its work more responsive to the aspirations and desires of the community of nations. In reality  the important bilateral understandings between the major nuclear Powers have been arrived at  and continue to be arrived at  outside the Conference. As a result  obviously  the Conference is gradually transforming itself into a mere advisory body.18.	But the widening gap between the General Assembly and the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament does not stem solely or exclusively from a question of deficient machinery or structure. As it happens  negotiations on the most vital disarmament issue  namely  nuclear disarmament  have proceeded without the involvement of all the nuclear Powers  as though the main responsibility for the arms race did not devolve upon all those Powers  individually and collectively. Unless effective steps are taken to ensure the presence and co-operation of all of them around the negotiating table  the quest for disarmament  irrespective of the negotiating machinery available  faces the threat of becoming politically irrelevant or being reduced to a subject of merely academic interest.19.	Brazil believes  therefore  that the time has come for the General Assembly to rededicate itself with renewed vigour and zeal to the disarmament purposes enshrined in the Charter. This would thus appear to be the opportune time for a debate in the Political and Security Committee focusing on the existing machinery for negotiation on disarmament and on the methods of improving it. I am well aware that various proposals to that end have already been put forward and that they all deserve careful study. If a broad exchange of ideas is to prove of value  the General Assembly should consider the advisability of reconvening its own Disarmament Commission  where the full membership of this Organization is represented  to seek new and effective instruments for collective negotiation. The Disarmament Commission could act as a kind of preparatory body for the world disarmament conference.20.	In today's world  political security is intertwined with collective economic security. I have already dwelt on ddtente  which is undoubtedly one of the major political facts of the 1970s. If it is not allowed to degenerate by having its scope reduced to that of mere political accommodation  if it maintains momentum and creative spirit  the current relaxation of tensions may well open up new and extraordinary prospects for international economic co-operation. To that end  it should go hand in hand with the global objectives of expansion and economic development and should ensure economic security  with which political security will thrive.21.	The world's economy indeed is passing through a critical transitional period; in order to expand  international trade needs new rules to correct present-day distortions in this field; concurrently  the monetary crisis persists unchecked. It would be absurd and dangerous to suppose that minor plastic surgery or superficial measures  unrelated to each other and to the root cause of such evils  might eradicate them. I believe  none the less  that in these times so deeply marked by a collective malaise in economic and financial relationships  the elements of disruption and distortion will finally  however paradoxically  arouse our consciences to the need for more effective world-wide solidarity and collective participation in the global enterprise of development and expansion.22.	The complexity of the world's economic and financial system and the growing importance of the external sectors of national economies have made of the adjustments and harmonization of existing diverse interests basic factors conditioning the global security process. The prevailing political situation and the series of bold initiatives which are being taken at the major conceptual and operative levels encourage us to believe that the embryonic awareness of joint responsibility for the settlement of important international economic and financial questions will begin to supersede the view that the affluence and well-being of a few can coexist indefinitely with the under-development of the destitute two thirds of mankind.23.	The trade negotiations which have begun in Tokyo under the auspices of the Genera] Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] should provide the world with an opportunity to ascertain whether the principles of solidarity and cooperation which ought to inspire a concerted effort towards development and expansion remain mere dreams  mere abstract expressions of contemporary political semantics  or whether  on the contrary  they will act as a driving force in the reformulation of the world trade system  so as to afford a fair and equitable division of labour  which is an essential condition for the growth of world productivity. The aggregate growth of the world product and its improved distribution call for a recognition of the need to accord special treatment to the developing world so that it may increase its participation in international trade and cease to be a minor  statistical and decreasing part of it. It would be a tragic mistake to believe that only or chiefly the interests of mature economies will be in play in those negotiations  or that the fate of the world's economy is linked merely to the harmonization of the currently conflicting conveniences of those who  as of now  weigh more decisively in international trade. If the multilateral trade negotiations confine themselves to these purposes  they will have rendered a disservice to the international community and will have the effect of curtailing the objectives of global development and expansion. This was the conviction that emerged from the last meeting of the Special Committee on Latin American Co-ordination held in Brasilia  in connexion with the coordinated position of the Latin American countries in regard to these negotiations.24.	I believe that  on another level  the same can be said for the crisis that assails the international monetary system and the need to reform it. It would be impossible and futile to conceive of this reform  which is so urgent  without taking into full account the claims of the developing countries  without seeing to it that their needs are met and without affording them solutions for their problems that neither the Bretton Woods Conference nor  more recently  the unproductive and short-lived Smithsonian Agreement could find.25.	The Brazilian Government' is gratified at seeing that the reinvigoration of the Economic and Social Council is taking place concurrently with events of such great importance in the trade and monetary fields. Now that it has gained renewed vigour and is disposed to exercise the normative role in the field of international economic relations envisaged for it by the Charter  the Council has demonstrated  both in New York and in Geneva  that it has resumed its functions within the panorama of the United Nations. These functions relate essentially to its right to oversee all matters pertinent to social  economic and financial co-operation  a right which will make it a central negotiating forum within our Organization.26.	Parallel to these institutional developments  which augur a more active participation of the United Nations in rendering international economic co-operation more dynamic  we have been given the opportunity in this year of 1973 to embark on a comprehensive review of the nature and range of this co-operation  through the first exercise of review and appraisal of the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXVj] as concluded a month ago by the Economic and Social Council. The balance sheet for the first two years of the Decade is not encouraging  to say the least. The gap between developed and developing countries has widened  and even among the developing countries the performance of individual economies has been extremely uneven.27.	While some very positive results have been registered in certain regions or countries  the over-all picture continues to be gloomy. What is worse  the flow of development assistance and financial transfers has lost the momentum reached in the late 1960s. The industrialized world seems more and more concerned with its own internal conflicts.28.	Brazil has taken the initiative of reviving the concept of collective economic security. We see in this economic counterpart of political security the synthesis of our aspirations for a better world  one in which global development  expansion and social progress may become additional components of our concept of peace and security. The Economic and Social Council has already had the opportunity to begin a very timely debate on the subject and should now study the concept and its institutional and functional implications in greater depth.29.	The definition of this concept in terms of doctrine and practical potentialities requires prolonged examination  analysis and critical evaluation. On the basis of the existing interrelationship between political and economic security  one of the possibilities worthy of consideration is a study of ways and means to endow u\e United Nations with the faculty to launch economic peace-making and peacekeeping operations to prevent or remedy critical situations. Once ideas have matured and the elements of the concept  together with its operational capabilities  are broadly identified and accepted  an effort at negotiation to that end would render the Organization even more active in one of the areas in which it has  it is only fair to say  distinguished itself in these 28 years of its existence.30.	Among the issues attracting the growing attention of the international community  there stand out the peaceful uses and practical applications of outer space in promoting development.31.	The Brazilian Government is convinced that in this area  as in so many others  it is indispensable that the interests of all countries be duly taken into account  regardless of their respective stages of development in the area of space research. Moreover  at this point  it is necessary to discipline activities in the fields of remote sensing by satellite of the natural resources of the earth and of space communications  so as to ensure strict respect of the sovereign rights of States. On the basis of these principles  which uphold  after all  our international system  it should be possible to ensure that the progressive results of the exploration and peaceful uses of outer space are equitably shared among the members of the world community.32.	While addressing the Assembly last year  I referred broadly to the question of review of the United Nations Charter and I stated that  in the opinion of Brazil  the review or reform of the Charter remains an essential element in the process of the political and diplomatic reactivation of the United Nations. I consider it essential that the General Assembly at its next session finally assert its willingness to study this subject with imagination and political foresight in order to enable us to adjust our constitutional instrument to the realities and the needs of today's world. Brazil will continue to press this point precisely because it believes in the destiny of this Organization.33.	The unrestricted adherence to the ideals  purposes and principles of the United Nations is  and will remain  a fundamental premise of Brazil's foreign policy."
"17",1058,"BTN",28,1973,"﻿1.	In unanimously electing the President of the twenty-eighth session  the General Assembly has not only honoured a distinguished son of Latin America but also recognized his great skill and wisdom as a seasoned diplomat. My country has always had admiration for the friendly peoples of Latin America  and I wish to assure the President of our fullest co-operation in the discharge of his responsibilities. We are confident that under his wise leadership  we will be able to accomplish the tasks we have set ourselves.2.	I should also like to take this opportunity of associating my delegation with those who have expressed their appreciation for the patience  devotion and the great ability with which the outgoing President  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski of Poland  guided our deliberations during the last session.3.	We are happy to welcome in our midst today the representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany  the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. Bhutan believes in the universality of the United Nations and we are convinced that the admission to the United Nations of these three States will mark an important step towards making our Organization not only more representative but more effective. The Federal Republic of' Germany and the German DemocraticRepublic  with their great economic strength and impressive record of post-war achievement  are bound to play an important role in the United Nations. The newly independent nation of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas will undoubtedly bring to bear its healing touch on the problems facing the world body.4.	We look forward very much to co-operating with the delegations of these States both within and outside the United Nations. However  let me hasten to add that the process of universality of the United Nations will only be complete when all countries are represented in this great Organization. We hope  therefore  that the General Assembly will be able to act in a similar manner when dealing with the admission of other States to the United Nations.5.	We in Bhutan are just recovering from the irreparable loss we suffered last year in the demise of our great King  His Majesty Jigme Dorji Wangchuck. We were indeed fortunate in having a person of his wisdom and vision to guide the destiny of our country at a momentous juncture in our history. Our-present King  His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck  has reiterated his firm resolve to continue the great task started by his late father to build a modern Bhutan in which the people will enjoy social justice and economic prosperity. As we end the official period of national mourning for our late King  we realize  with even greater urgency than before  the unfulfilled tasks to which we have to address ourselves. We are  however  determined to forge ahead and complete the task of building our nation. In the external sphere we are convinced that a policy of non-alignment and peaceful coexistence based on friendship with all countries is the only practical policy for Bhutan.6.	We  therefore  have become a member of the non- aligned group during the recent Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Algiers. This  however  does not mean that Bhutan does not wish to play its rightful role in the comity of nations. Our policy of non-alignment is not a negative concept; it is in fact a policy based on the foundations of. independence of thought and action. We believe this policy is consistent with the United Nations objectives of reducing tensions and building a world in which relations between countries are based on the principle of mutual respect  sovereign equality and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.7.	Last year  in our statement before this Assembly [2053rd meeting]  we had the occasion to welcome the signs of detente which had begun to emerge on the international scene. As we meet this year  we have reason to be satisfied with the hopeful change in international relationships between nations and particularly between the major Powers of the world. In this context we welcome the development of normal relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States. The normalization of relations between Japan and the People's Republic of China will  in our view  undoubtedly contribute to stability in East Asia. The visit of Mr. Brezhnev to the United States this summer is yet another milestone along the road of reducing international tension and promoting a better understanding between the most powerful nations of the world. We welcome as a constructive development the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the stabilizing agreements among Central European States. These are undoubtedly significant developments which have brought Europe out of the dark days of the cold war and also contributed substantially to promoting peace and harmony in Europe and throughout the world.8.	Unfortunately  the improved climate so noticeably visible in Europe has not had a comparable effect in Asia and several other parts of the world. Although the conclusion of the peace agreements in Viet-Nam and Laos is a major step  Indo-China is not yet completely free from war and its disastrous consequences. The aftermath of war is as terrible as the war itself  as it involves the enormous task of reconstruction and the rehabilitation of the people in Indo-China which we hope will gain the co-operation of all the peace-loving nations. We therefore hope that the peace so assiduously achieved in Laos and Viet-Nam will be an enduring one and that it will be extended to Cambodia  too  by peaceful negotiations between the parties concerned.9.	My delegation welcomed the promising signs of dialogue and understanding between the representatives of North and South Korea last year and we expressed the hope that that dialogue would lead to an understanding between the two Koreas for the eventual reunification of that country. It is the earnest hope of my delegation that both North and South Korea will continue their efforts to arrive at an amicable understanding so that the people of that peninsula will be able to devote their energies to the more pressing tasks before them. Bhutan fully supports the aspirations of the Korean people for reunification of their desire to live in peace and harmony  and hopes that the dialogue and conciliation between North and South Korea will be further promoted.10.	Nearer home to us in Bhutan is the situation on the Indian subcontinent. The agreement on resolving the humanitarian problems flowing from the 1971 conflict  signed recently  clears the way for giving shape to the hopes of peace upheld in the Simla Agreement of 2 July 1972. We in Bhutan welcome that agreement between India and Pakistan with the concurrence of Bangladesh as a vital step for bringing about the much desired durable peace on the subcontinent. The parties concerned have indeed shown a great sense of urgency  accommodation and understanding for the solution of the unfortunate humanitarian problems.11.	In that spirit we hope that the reality of Bangladesh will also be recognized. It is a reality recognized by over 100 Members of the United Nations. If we sincerely subscribe to the principle of universality  then the doors of the United Nations cannot be kept closed to the 75 million people of Bangladesh. We hope that before long it will be possible for the representatives of Bangladesh to take their rightful place in this Assembly of nations as full members.12.	At a time when we welcome international detente and look with great expectation for a durable world peace it is unfortunate that armed conflict and hostilities have broken out once again in the Middle East. The underlying cause of that tragic event is  we believe  the continued occupation of Arab territories by Israel and the failure to implement Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which formed the basis for a just settlement. It is  however  gratifying to note that the Security Council is mindful of its responsibility and its commitments towards international peace and security in general and the Middle East situation in particular. We sincerely hope that the Security Council will take all possible steps and effective measures for the restoration of peace in the region. My delegation also feels that it is necessary to recognize the legitimate rights of all the States in the region to their existence within recognized boundaries  in the interests of a just and durable peace.13.	One other area which continues to cause concern to my Government and to pose a threat to world peace and security is southern Africa. The people of Namibia have been denied the basic right to live in freedom and dignity. The policies of apartheid and racialism continue to be followed unremittingly in South Africa  in violation of all canons of civilized behaviour. In Southern Rhodesia the minority regime continues to rule the majority population by force of arms. It is regrettable that the illegal racist regime of Southern Rhodesia should survive  with the support of certain vested interests. We believe that all peace-loving countries which uphold the cause of justice  freedom and human dignity based on equality should accept and intensify sanctions against Southern Rhodesia. The policy of repression being followed by the Portuguese Government in its colonies in Africa continues to pose a serious threat to peace and security. Bhutan supports the struggle for independence being carried on by the peoples of all colonial territories. We believe that the solution of those problems requires a determined international effort  and we for our part are ready to join with others in any practical action that the United Nations may pursue in that regard.14.	In the field of disarmament Bhutan welcomes the series of agreements reached between the United States and the Soviet Union  including preliminary arms limitation measures and the historic Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War  signed at Washington on 22 June. We are convinced that those agreements will contribute greatly to peace and security in the world and provide a further impetus for progress in the direction of complete nuclear disarmament. We are hopeful that as a result of those agreements we shall be able to achieve the ultimate goal of the total destruction of all nuclear and thermonuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. In that connexion we reiterate our support for the convening of a world disarmament conference and express the hope that the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference set up last year [resolution 2930 (X VII)] will be able to make sufficient progress so that such a conference may be convened at an early date.15.	Bhutan has always supported the creation of zones or areas of peace  and last year we had occasion to express our support for the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace [resolution 2382 (XXVI)]. We hope that it will be possible for the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean [resolution 2992 (XXVII)] to complete its preliminary work so that the much desired consultations with the permanent members of the Security Council and the major maritime users of the Indian Ocean may commence at an early date. It is important for the peace and security of the countries of the Indian Ocean area that the Indian Ocean be kept free from great-Power military rivalries and interventions. In this connexion it is also important that all foreign bases should be removed from the area. We for our part are willing to co-operate with the countries of the region to give practical shape to the proposal.16.	Bhutan is looking forward to the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea with great interest and expectation. It is the hope of my delegation that as a result of the preparatory work done by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction the Conference will be able to take a decision on some of the outstanding issues pertaining to the law of the sea. As a land-locked country  Bhutan has a vital stake in the resources of the sea. We believe that this common heritage of mankind must be so exploited as to give each one of us an equitable share. The potentialities of the sea  as yet unassessed  may prove to be of immense value to all countries  and more particularly to the developing countries.17.	When the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade was adopted in 1970  there were great expectations that the Strategy would be fully implemented for the benefit of the developing countries. We are  therefore  disappointed that the commitments assumed by the international community are not being implemented fully. It is important to review the progress made in the implementation of the strategy so that the interests of the developing and  particularly the least developed countries  can be given consideration.18.	I cannot end my statement without paying a tribute to the work being done by our distinguished Secretary- General. During the short period that he has been in office  he has demonstrated beyond doubt his rare ability  capacity for hard work and devotion to duty. We wish him well and express the hope that he will be able to accomplish the great task before him. We on our part pledge our co-operation to him."
"18",1142,"CAF",28,1973,"﻿1.	 I wish to congratulate the President whole-heartedly on his election to preside over the General Assembly. The confidence shown by all States Members of the United Nations is a credit to him  to his country and the whole of Latin America. His lengthy experience in international affairs and in the United Nations has ?'ell prepared him for this great task  and I express the sincerest wishes that his tenure will be crowned with success and personal satisfaction.2.	Our congratulations go also to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  the retiring President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly  who conducted our debates last year with such vigour  faith  competence and dash.3.	To Mr. Waldheim  our Secretary-General  we express our gratitude and our admiration for his untiring activities  for his understanding of world problems  for his availability at all times to Member countries and in particular the poor countries  and for his broad-mindedness and his outstanding qualities as a politician  a diplomat and a negotiator. He does not spare himself  and we thank him for his untiring efforts  his faith  his patience and the judicious use he makes of his many talents. We thank Austria for giving us this expert  this champion of detente at a time when the world is so much in need of one.4.	Finally  may I be permitted to hail the presence in our midst of three new Member States: the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  the Federal Republic of Germany and theGerman Democratic Republic. The advent of these countries enables our Organization to take a major step towards universality. We sincerely rejoice and express our gratitude to all those who have contributed to this progress  towards peace  independence and the universality of our Organization.5.	If one were to look at things from the general point of view  one could well say  without fear of error  that the world is going through an historic phase of the utmost importance  about which men rejoice everywhere; on earth. The outer signs of the new turn that international affairs have taken are crystal clear: there was the arrival two years ago in our Organization of the People's Republic of China; there were the treaties between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union and Poland; there were the direct meetings between the Heads of State of the great Powers and the conclusion of the first co-operation agreements among them; there was the reconciliation between Japan and China; there was the armistice in Viet-Nam  then the International Conference on Viet-Nam and the peace agreements of Paris; and this year there is the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the arrival in the United Nations of the Federal Republic of Germany  the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas; there is the proclamation of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau that we hail joyfully and which my country  the Central African Republic  has recognized de jure. May all our wishes for success accompany it in its first steps. Other promising signs appear on the horizon; Japan is proposing a conference on peace and security in Asia; attempts are still being made to bring peace throughout Indo-China; in the Indian subcontinent we witness with pleasure the reconciliation of two great nations  India and Pakistan  two pillars of our Organization; and a concrete dialogue has been opened in Korea.6.	All of this is good and worthy of praise and applause  and we must do everything in our power to consolidate and intensify this ray of hope  this springtime in international relations. The cold war  which sowed haired  divided peoples and brought about an unbridled arms race will soon be  we hope  no more than a bad memory. Mankind  entering its global era  endowed with a universal Organization marked by accommodation rather than the desire for domination of the great Powers  appears at last to have embarked upon the path of common sense and reason. The peoples of the world are not mistaken. They therefore applaud these developments  in the north and the south  in the east and the west  in the rich countries as well as in the poor countries  over and above ideologies and systems  over and above races and colours.7.	Our twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly  like the two preceding sessions  forms part of this great historical trend that has been called detente. It reflects that movement; it acts in favour of detente and carries its fruits far beyond it  towards a more noble and even more necessary objective: namely  entente and co-operation among all peoples.8.	What can we actually do in the course of this session of the General Assembly to show ourselves worthy of our peoples and to promote the building of peace  justice and progress that is so impatiently expected of us? May I be permitted  despite the very modest place that my country  the Central African Republic  holds in the concert of nations  to make a few suggestions.9.	First of all  our first duty in the present circumstances is to settle rapidly and definitively the conflicts and sources of friction that still poison international relations and which  by reason of their duration or by a sudden recrudescence' risk delaying progress towards detente and even destroying it. It is important that the question of the Middle East  a potential hotbed of serious explosions  with far-reaching ramifications  be settled once and for all.10.	It is important that peace return to the whole of Indo-China. It is important that the problem of Cyprus be erased from our books. It is important that the question of Korea  too  be settled once and for all. Efforts are under way in regard to all these problems and it is to be hoped that they will soon be successful in order that those regions can be purified in the atmosphere .of the great movement of detente that we are witnessing.11.	We must deplore the fact that in that movement which is the result essentially of the initiatives of the great Powers one burning question  a question which affects a whole continent and which overflows into international relations  has not been given its rightful priority. I am speaking of the problems of colonialism and racism in southern Africa. It is imperative that the vast move for detente embrace Africa also and that a concerted effort be undertaken with the assistance of the entire international community  and particularly that of the great Powers  in order to settle the situation in that vast region — a situation that is so dangerous for world peace and security.12.	We live in an era in which priorities may vary from region to region and country to country. For the rich countries detente has become a matter of priority. For Africa —  for Africa  I say — independence and racial equality  objectives already attained elsewhere in the world  constitute that priority. It is therefore for the international community to help us in achieving our legitimate aims which are in keeping with international morality. There cannot be two yardsticks in international ethics. The rich world in the United Nations continues to appeal to Africa for co-operation in the fields of environment  population  terrorism  the law of the sea and so on. But what does the rest of the world do to help Africa achieve its objectives  its priorities? Hence  the questions of southern Africa must be included as a priority item on the agenda of international detente. To continue along the present course is not only morally unworthy of the international community but also dangerous  because violence will only increase and  in our time  violence knows no frontiers. At the present time we are witnessing a vast European effort to settle problems under the auspices of theConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The Prime Minister of Japan  Mr. Tanaka  for his part  has launched the idea of a conference on peace in Asia. Perhaps the time has come to think about a similar effort  at a conference on independence and peace in Africa  which would endeavour  with the assistance in particular of the great Powers  to achieve independence  racial equality and peace — all fundamental objectives of the Charter — in our torn continent.13.	In this connexion  I should like to quote the very pertinent words spoken by our Secretary-General last year at the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OA U] held at Rabat  Morocco  from 12 to 15 June 1972  that should dictate our approach and behaviour with respect to this crucial problem of contemporary history. He said:""How great would be our joy and how relieved we would be if I were able to declare today that the whole of Africa was free and independent. The march of progress and independence has encountered many obstacles which today unduly delay  at the cost of much suffering  an ineluctable historical evolution. Sooner or later that process will be achieved by peaceful means or by force. There is no nation in our world which is so interdependent that it can resist forever the profound changes whose legitimacy the international community recognizes.""14.	""	Secondly  problems accumulate so quickly and human sufferings are still so great in so many countries of the world that we must  as rapidly as possible  go beyond the stage of detente  which is no more than a period of transition  and embark deliberately on a period of active human solidarity and international co-operation. The application of the United Nations Charter has frequently been delayed and hindered over these past 25 years by the cold war. The cold war having disappeared from view  we must return to the spirit of San Francisco and give an unprecedented impetus to our Organization which has  in the meantime  become fully representative of the whole world and of all human aspirations. The provisions of the Charter  be they political or economic  must be revived in the spirit of the detente and the co-operation that have become such an imperative need.15.	We feel that  in particular  meetings between heads of State must be increased  not only bilaterally but also within this Organization  which offers a universal framework at a time When so many universal problems and difficulties stand in the way of the happiness of mankind. It is here  from this rostrum  that the views of the various nations must be given by their authorized leaders. It is here  in these halls and corridors  that practical plans of fraternity and human co-operation must be conceived and adopted. It is here  at the clearing-house of the problems and aspirations of the whole world that we must build the peaceful  unarmed  just and prosperous world community  united in its cultural and human diversity.16.	There remains so much-to be done. Poverty  hunger  disease and illiteracy that are still rampant in the worldshould make us ashamed  especially when we think of the enormous resources wasted on dangerous and useless weapons. Here  too  we must draw all the logical consequences of detente. Might it not be a good thing for the Economic and Social Council to include an item on its agenda entitled ""Detente and economic development"" and review new actions that might derive from that detente for developing countries? To a large degree  assistance to poor countries in these past years stemmed from the cold war and the competition between the great Powers. What will happen to that aid? Could we not conceive of the possibility that competition would give way to co-operation and that joint aid programmes between the great Powers would be offered to the poor countries? The alliance of the scientific  technical and economic might of the rich countries could work miracles for the poor countries if they so wished. We sincerely hope that there will be a great alliance against poverty  an alliance in which all the advanced countries would participate regardless of their political or social system. Would it not be natural  moreover  with this trend of detente to envisage at least a doubling of multilateral resources and  in particular  those of the United Nations Development Programme? We sincerely believe that the Second Committee of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council should attempt to relaunch aid on a vaster scale both bilaterally and internationally in the light of that detente. In so doing  special attention should be paid to the poorer developing countries  and above all to the landlocked countries. A first effort has been made in that direction by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] in Santiago  Chile  and by the United Nations Development Programme  but we hope that a less strict definition will be adopted for that category of countries and that greater resources will be envisaged for them.17.	Yes  there is still so much to be done on our earth that an entirely new spirit  an unprecedented solidarity and cooperation  much greater generosity and understanding and much greater foresight must inspire us in the future 18.	We have barely scratched the surface of knowledge concerning our planet. Research on the potential of our seas and oceans  which cover three quarters of our globe  has intensified recently; and we must applaud the agreement on oceanographic research concluded this summer in Washington between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. 19.	Only 30 per cent of our lands are inhabited and exploited. It took a terrible drought in the countries of the Sudano-Sahelian region and a further encroachment of the Sahara to open our eyes and to show us how meagre were the resources devoted to a better knowledge of our deserts  to the struggle against their extension and  better still  to their conquest and exploitation.20.	Would it not be a good thing  at a time when so much is said of over-population and the population explosion  to consider a little further the possibilities of occupation and production that our earth offers us? Would it not be wise for the international community at this stage  after the warning given by the Sahara  to launch a vast programme of cooperation between countries which have deserts in order better to know those areas and to find the means of limiting their expansion and perhaps of conquering them for the welfare of man? That again is a practical suggestion that my country wishes to put forward  having in mind our brothers in the Sudano-Sahelian region.21.	Our knowledge of the tropical and equatorial regions is not much more brilliant. The scientific and technological efforts of mankind have concentrated mainly on the natural conditions and the resources of the Nordic and rich countries. The exploration of the great biological potential of the tropical and equatorial regions has barely been sketched. One realizes to what extent efforts in these fields could be profitable when we think of the successes of the experimental stations of the Ford Foundation in Mexico and the Philippines which are at the root of the ""green revolution"" in wheat and rice. Now that the cold war is dying and an era ^f friendship is being initiated between the great scientific and ' industrial Powers  has not the time come to think of a new scientific and technical strategy  a true impetus to be given to our knowledge of the resources of our planet  and especially of 'he African continent  for the greater benefit of man?22.	Peace  justice and progress in the world are to a large extent the fruit of peace  of justice and of progress in our respective countries. Hence  it is a good thing that each year countries should come to this rostrum to tell the world what they have done to contribute to the peace and well-being of their peoples. So far as the Central African Republic is concerned  we believe that we have honestly fulfilled our obligations and duties.23.	Not only have we lived in peace with our neighbours  but the head of our State  His Excellency General Jean-Bedel Bokassa  a pilgrim of peace  continues to do everything in his power to contribute to the maintenance of international peace.24.	Our Government  moreover  thanks to the policy in force since January 1966  the ""Bokassa Operation""  has established an original strategy for development and has worked for the well-being of its citizens.25.	We have co-operated with our African brothers in the political  economic  cultural  technical and scientific fields within the framework of the Organization of African Unity [OAU\.26.	We have co-operated with all the countries in the world in political  economic and social organs of the United Nations as well as in all large international conferences and in the specialized agencies.27.	May we be forgiven for not always having the necessary highly skilled personnel to participate successfully in all these endeavours. The poor countries also have a paucity of diplomatic and technical personnel and the effort demanded by the complexity of international affairs  very often in highly scientific and technical fields  often exceeds the means of a country such as my own. But we try to do our best to add our block to the common building.28.	The world has fortunately survived  without a new world war  one of its most dangerous periods  the most awesomely armed  and the most all-encompassing that has ever existed. We are on the threshold of a new era  without precedent in history  full of challenge and promise  but weighed down by problems  complexities  impatience and claims. We  men of all nations  without distinction as to colour  creed or culture  have a noble role to play  that of tackling together almost super-human tasks  for the well- being of the humble  the suffering  the disinherited  in their quest for peace  justice and progress for the whole of mankind."
"19",1186,"CAN",28,1973,"﻿1.	Mr. President  I begin by expressing Canada's congratulations to you on your election to the presidency. As a representative of Ecuador you have played an active role in the affairs of Latin America and in many areas of world co-operation. We welcome your election and wish you well in carrying out the high duties of leadership of the twenty-eighth session.2.	By the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic  the United Nations has taken another big step towards universality. Canada applauds the breadth of mind-the evolution from stalemate in Europe — that has made these States welcome within our Organization.3.	Canada also warmly welcomes the admission of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas as a full Member. As a country that has long enjoyed close links with the Bahamas  we are confident that the influence of our newest Member will be directed to the highest interests of the United Nations.4.	The United Nations is becoming universal-is it becoming more effective as an instrument for the attainment of the hopes and aspirations of mankind?5.	Since last we met here one of the architects of this Organization  the Right Honourable Lester B. Pearson  died in Canada. In those bright  hopeful days when he and others were engaged in preparing for the birth of the United Nations  Mr. Pearson expressed his fear that when the unifying pressures of world war have subsided  ""nationalist pride and prejudice would become strong again-and the narrow concept of the national interest prevail"". This judgement on the future was all too quickly proven accurate. Yet as conscious of its imperfections as any man  Mr. Pearson remained convinced that the United Nations was indispensable for even the most slow and painful march away from mass violence and poverty.6.	It is true that in certain key areas of world security  the United Nations appears to have been bypassed. Improved relations between the great Powers have been achieved essentially through bilateral efforts. Significant steps have been taken towards greater European stability with the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and talks of mutual balanced force reductions. The agreement reached bilaterally between India and Pakistan  restoring the conditions of peace and future co-operation in the subcontinent  has been warmly welcomed by the world community.7.	All of us are  in some degree  affected by these deliberations and decisions  and we recognize that it is the nature of our world's society that all of us do not have the opportunity to contribute to the decision-making as we would wish through this world forum. As the Secretary- General has said in the excellent introduction to his annual report:""It is necessary to emphasize that there is no inevitable clash between bilateral and multilateral diplomacy. They are  or should be  mutually supporting  each having particular advantages in particular situations. There is no single road to peace- we have to try all roads.But we should never fail to assert the interest and the primacy of this Organization where it has an indispensable role to play.8.	Such was Canada's view at the International Conference on Viet-Nam held early this year in Paris. At that Conference I attempted to have the United Nations and the United Nations Secretary-General firmly integrated into the peace observation machinery which was being established at that Conference. These efforts failed.9.	After five months of efforts to play the role of an impartial international observer  we withdrew from the International Commission of Control and Supervision in Viet-Nam  frustrated  but by no means embittered.10.	Canada remains prepared to play its part in peacekeeping and peace observation. But we have learned a lesson from our long and frustrating attempts to have these peace-keeping bodies operate objectively. The lesson is this: peace-keeping and peace observation operations stand the best chance of success if they are conducted under the authority of the United Nations Security Council.11.	We have long assumed that progress in technology  agriculture and communications would mean progress for the underprivileged-a ladder on which people could climb away from hunger  disease and degradation. Yet tragically the word ""progress"" has come to mock us. The gap between rich and poor is wider than ever. Material achievements are threatened by spiralling world inflation  increasing pollution  unforeseen commodity shortages and by the capricious movements of world finance.12.	For ill as well as for good  we are increasingly interdependent however jealously we guard our independence. No nation can solve inflation in isolation from the others. No nation can assure the cleanness of air or the purity of water that flow freely across political boundaries. Faced individually by each sovereign State  the challenges are insurmountable. For they are universal problems and they can only be met effectively by universal solutions. The United Nations and its agencies are the only bodies with the authority and with the breadth of representation to meet these challenges.13.	Even collectively these challenges are intimidating. Our experience with the problem of international security - not least  the problem of the Middle East - has taught us that they will not be overcome by conferences alone  by resolutions or by formal votes. They require a profound and clear-headed appreciation of the dimensions of the problems matched by a common will to work co-operatively towards solutions.14.	In the opinion of the Canadian Government  we must try to avoid barren and abrasive confrontations  which are frequently the result of formal voting processes. Consensus is another and often surer route; it is the technique we are using increasingly at our Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings. The results are not dramatic  but they are none the less real. Consensus does not mean the imposition of the will of the majority on a reluctant minority which feels its vital interests arc at issue; it means the shared recognition of what should and can be done. I believe we attach far too much importance to the voting scores. Votes are little solace to the hungry.15.	There have been three successive years of drought in parts of Africa and the Asian subcontinent and of abnormally poor growing seasons in many other parts of the world. Until now only a few food-producing nations  including Canada  held surplus food stocks  and even these existing stocks fluctuated according to weather conditions and international demand. Over the years  efforts to create food banks have proved largely unsuccessful.16.	Now a constructive proposal to ensure world food security has been introduced by the Director General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO].  Its rate of success will be directly proportional to the effort made by each nation to adjust accordingly its food production and stocking policies. I urge every nation-not just those which are the traditional producers of surplus food-to support and co-operate with the FAO in this task. I am sure we have all noted with great interest the proposal made yesterday by the Secretary of State of the United States to convene a world food conference in 1974 [2174th meeting]. We in Canada look forward to discussing this proposal in detail  as it must be our aim to exorcize the dreadful spectre of starvation that menaces millions of human beings.17.	Canada has supported the revitalization which  over the past few years  has been' transforming the Economic and Social Council. A very important change for Canada and for Canada's relations with Europe was our election by the Council to full membership on the Economic Commission for Europe. One of the Council's prime responsibilities is the successful implementation of the action programme adopted by this Assembly for the Second United Nations Development Decade-the International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. That Strategy is neither perfect nor immutable. Our appraisal of it has already proven to be a difficult process. It is not  however  an impossible process  and it is one that I hope will become easier as we all become more attuned to its requirements.18.	We stand in the shadow of other terrifying and universal problems  which can be overcome only by international co-operation. Last Year I spoke out strongly about terrorism and I must do so again. Civilization cries out for effective action by the international community to protect innocent persons against premeditated acts of violence.19.	Since last year international efforts to combat terrorism have gathered some momentum through various international organizations and instrumentalities. Over 86 States have  for example  signed the 1970 Hague Convention on aerial hijacking.  It is encouraging to note the growing list of ratifications of this Convention to combat acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation by States from all the geographical regions and of all political views.However  terrorism has not been eliminated; it remains a double-edged sword. In its indiscriminate sweep it cuts at the roots of international order  as well as at the hand that wields it. We shall look to all nations and to the General Assembly for action on further measures to combat acts of terrorism.20.	And terror has another face: it is that of nuclear poison and the ultimate threat of nuclear holocaust. Although 10 years have elapsed since the partial test-ban Treaty  came into force  there has been no further progress towards achieving the cessation of all nuclear tests-which was the ultimate objective of the signatories of that Treaty. Despite improving prospects for international security resulting from strategic arms limitation agreements  there has  regrettably  been no sign that either of the superpowers is prepared to curtail underground nuclear testing or to enter into active negotiations towards the achievement of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Nor have two great Powers brought to an end nuclear testing in the atmosphere  despite the overwhelming weight of world public opinion.21.	The global dimension is clear and striking in the use we make of the oceans. Coastal States must protect their economic and environmental interests. On the other hand  there must be certain traditional freedoms on the oceans to facilitate world-wide exchanges. We continue to believe that these elements of the law of the sea are not irreconcilable and that a proper balance can and must be achieved. Canada believes that these rights  which are essential to the well-being of developing and developed coastal States alike  can be exercised in a manner that will take into account the rights of other legitimate users of the sea — in other words  mankind as a whole. A new international order recognizing both the fundamental rights and the responsibilities of States in respect of the oceans can emerge  and we hope will emerge  from the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  if the Governments here assembled have the will.22.	Similarly  outer space offers exciting prospects of benefit in meeting terrestrial needs in resource management  communications and education. These prospects can be realized for all our peoples only by searching for new and imaginative forms of international co-operation; and I believe that through the United Nations we are well embarked on this search.23.	Last year the General Assembly accepted the Canadian offer to be host to a conference on the urgent and vital question of human settlements [resolution 3003 (XXVII)]: the United Nations Conference- Exposition on Human Settlements is now scheduled for Vancouver in 1976. We were delighted that the General Assembly responded so warmly to this offer and we are encouraged by the co-operation and enthusiasm which have been displayed during the initial planning stages for the conference.24.	This year we celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet in parts of southern Africa minority regimes  still deny man's basic rights through stubborn opposition to his Efforts to achieve equality. Canada recognizes the legitimacy of the struggle to win full human rights and self-determination in southern Africa and is studying ways to broaden its humanitarian support for those engaged in these efforts. The most effective way to mark this twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration will be for each nation to redouble its concern to extend human rights to all its people. But concern must be expressed through achievement.25.	Mankind's occupation of this planet has been neither wise or far-sighted. Because of our greed  our indifference and our ignorance  we are speeding on a fatal collision course with our environment. The exploitation of our natural resources has been incessant  uncaring and exhaustive. Our air and our waters are becoming foul and poisonous. We seem to be incapable of feeding and clothing adequately our growing millions. So far  we have been unable to live peacefully together or to share our bounty so that all may live a life of dignity.26.	Although there is no doubt that in some circumstances the agencies of the United Nations can and do move swiftly  on the whole no one can accuse this Organization of approaching its problems with unseemly haste. Too many items have taken up permanent annual residence on the agenda. Still  some progress is being made. The increasing universality of the United Nations  as I remarked at the beginning of this statement  is an outstanding example.27.	But it seems to me that there is lacking a sense of urgency-a collective sense of urgency about the towering problems confronting mankind and this Organization. In our race with poverty and starvation  terrorism and armaments  pollution and bigotry  we are too apt to forget that time is not on our side."
"20",1247,"CHL",28,1973,"﻿111.	This is the first opportunity that the present Government of Chile has had to state from the highest world rostrum the background and the facts that led the armed forces and police to take control and establish a regime of national restoration and dignity. I shall deal at some length with this subject  although I am aware that one of the fundamental principles of the Charter is that the United Nations shall not intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of States. That principle  which also governs bilateral relations among members of the international community is one to which I will refer more especially later.112.	However  because of the events that have taken place in Chile  a campaign that is so false  so malevolent  so vicious  so well orchestrated has been launched  with the intention of distorting the facts and the intentions  that I felt it both fitting and proper to refer to those events  even though I firmly contend that no State  and no international organization  has the right to meddle in or judge what has taken place in my homeland.113.	I understand that the events in Chile have not left world public opinion indifferent. Although many countries  in the most varied regions of the world  year after year for different reasons undergo changes in their political and social life  the case of Chile is a very special one  for two reasons.114.	The first reason is that my country  after more than a century and a half of independence  has stood as an example of civic life and has never tolerated dictatorships  racism or totalitarism and that our eminently apolitical and professional armed forces have been an example to the world. We who wear the uniform are proud of that tradition.115.	The second is that Chile  having agreed to the establishment by democratic means of a Government imbued with foreign doctrines  loyally collaborated in the search for a socialist direction compatible with our own national reality and our traditions of freedom  justice and dignity; so much so that  at the beginning of the socialist experiment  the political parties unanimously supported the Government  as in the nationalization of the copper industry  and likewise the armed forces  when called upon in moments of grave crisis  accepted upon their shoulders the burden of heavy responsibilities.116.	But these generous  democratic and selfless attitudes proved futile  since they were able only briefly to contain  and not to stop  the disastrous course along which the Unidad Popular  in its eagerness to consolidate a tyrannical power  was forcing the country. Chile  alone  without the help or inspiration of any  its patience exhausted and drawing on the courage  drive and inner resources that are a feature of our people  was able to react and put an end to a totalitarian system that has subjugated so many countries of the world  before it was too late.117.	I shall refer to what happened in my country three years ago. In September 1970 Chile was confronted with a procedure that was normal in our history of democracy: a presidential election was to be held. On 4 September the candidate representing the Unitad Popular won 36.2 per cent of the popular vote in a free  democratic election  precisely in keeping with the historic traditions of Chile.118.	This triumph was a surprise and upset to the majority of the people  since the ideology professed by the winning candidate made many of my countrymen fear that the country might adopt a course very contrary to the tradition and history of Chile.119.	Under the political Constitution of the State  the election had to be ratified by the National Congress  since none of the candidates had obtained an absolute majority of the popular vote. The political parties that had supported the Marxist candidate were a minority in the Chilean Congress; consequently  interpreting the national feeling  the majority political parties made the confirmation of the candidate who had obtained a relative majority conditional on solemn respect for the provisions of the Constitution  supplemented by a special Statute of Guarantees.120.	From the very dawn of our independent life  Chile has been careful to preserve  both in reality and in our fundamental Constitution  the basic human rights of the individual and respect for the common good. In the case of the Unidad Popular candidate  the majority parties insisted that these guarantees must be more precisely confirmed  even in specific matters  through the supplementary Statute to which I referred earlier. As a result of this requirement on the part of the parliamentary majority  the National Congress unanimously  and with the favourable vote of the candidate himself  approved constitutional reforms intended primarily to reaffirm the independence of the armed forces and respect for their professional function. This stood in the way of the creation of military groups outside the Constitution and the law. The reforms would also reaffirm the freedom of the information media  the political rights of citizens and the gains achieved by the workers in organized labour andensure the participation of professionals  technicians  employees and workers in the process of economic development.121.	It was only after the approval of this Statute of Constitutional Guarantees that the congressional majority  which  I repeat  had opposed the posture of the Unidad Popular candidate  agreed to confer upon him the presidency of Chile.122.	The Chilean political system is based upon the absolute independence of the public authorities and upon their unlimited mutual respect. The President of the Republic  the National Congress and the courts of justice have rights and powers specifically defined in the political Constitution of the State  which also defines the way in which they shall relate to one another.123.	Furthermore  there must be added the fundamental role played in the Chilean legal system by the Comptroller-General of the Republic  since his decisions and rulings determine the administrative process of the nation.e124.	In other words  when the legitimately elected President took over the highest office in Chile  he swore to respect the independence and authority of the other organs of the State. He committed himself to respect the legality of the Chilean State  the heritage of the people  which over the years has been moulded to reflect the basic consensus enabling them to live together. Any assault on legality is  therefore  not only a destruction of the cultural and moral heritage of the nation  but also a denial of any practical possibility of democratic life.125.	In a veiled and surreptitious way at first  but quite openly later  the Government entirely ignored the basic principles that I have enunciated here and  what was even more serious  repeatedly violated the constitutional provisions that the National Congress had demanded as a guarantee after the elections of September 1970. The cynicism with which the Government was acting was amply demonstrated when the head of State later made known in a press interview that he had accepted the Statute of Constitutional Guarantees as a tactical necessity to assume power  and that what was most important at that moment was to take over the Government.126.	Under the tolerant eyes of the Government  the. media of the free press were harassed and  instead of. implementation of the Agrarian Reform Law drawn up by the previous administration  a system of illegal takeovers were established. Authorities arbitrarily took over small  medium-sized and large industries; politicians  villagers  students and representatives of law and order were murdered with impunity. Labour leaders and union representatives who did not support the Government were persecuted and imprisoned  and an attempt was made to impose a totalitarian educational system on all Chilean children.127.	I think a separate mention must be made of the Government's attitude towards armed groups of civilians. It not only permitted them  but openly encouraged them and thus illegally allowed the entry into the countryof foreign agitators and weapons. By 11 September this year  more than 13 000 known foreigners  most of them extremists  were known to be in the country in an illegal manner. Their sole mission was to set up a parallel army to oppose the regular armed forces. Representatives in the Assembly can well understand what that number of persons could mean to a country with 10 million inhabitants. But the conduct of those foreigners went even further. They took over management positions in the public administration  in illegally sequestered factories and in the direction of the national economy. We saw  with shame  how foreigners became part of Chilean delegations entrusted with the task of negotiating international agreements.128.	To all this must be added the inability of the Government to draw up an economic plan that would meet our real national needs  and this failure led to a catastrophe from which Chile will not recover for many years. The economic experience of Marxism in our country  because of the damage it has done  will be difficult for my countrymen to forget.129.	Let me cite a few figures to support what I am saying.130.	According to the latest official statistics of the Government of the Unidad Popular  agricultural production dropped by 20 per cent last year  industrial production by 9 per cent  and mineral exports  the fundamental mainstay of our economy  by 28 per cent.131.	In 1970  the total currency in circulation in Chile was 12 114 million escudos. At the end of this year  according to projections  the currency in circulation will be at least 23 times greater.132.	In 1970  Chile's external debt was $2 630 million. By 31 December 1973  that debt will have reached $3 450 million. And  to make things worse  this increase in foreign indebtedness was due primarily to the import not of capital goods destined to increase production  but of food and other perishables which the Marxist economy had been unable to produce inside the country.133.	In 1970  Chile's trade balance showed a surplus of $78 million. Thus far this year  it shows a deficit of $438 million; and to this must be added the fact that  under the management of the Unidad Popular Government  the country lost its entire reserves of foreign exchange  which in 1970 had reached $448 million.134.	In 1972  the deficit in fiscal expenditure amounted to 40 per cent of the total budget. For this year  it is estimated that the deficit will surpass 50 'per cent of total public expenditure.135.	All these economic facts caused the country to sustain the highest inflation rate in the world: 323 percent over the last 12 months.136.	In March of this year  under the control of the armed forces  as required by law  normal parliamentary elections took place  although it was later discovered that the registers of voters had been very cleverly altered and tampered with.137.	Nevertheless  those elections clearly and precisely confirmed the fact that the Government of the Unidad Popular could count on the support of only a minority in the country. The opposition parties obtained a large majority in the Senate and in the Chamber of Deputies.138.	Even so  the Government refused to alter its line of conduct and  ignoring the will of the people  formed a bellicose Cabinet that intensified its assaults on the lawful structure of the State. This forced the other public institutions to assume a daily more energetic defence of institutionality in the country.139.	The Government was careful to demonstrate apparent respect for the judicial branch for the benefit of the outside world. It is true that it took pains not to interfere visibly with the structure itself; but it drew upon all sorts of resources in order to undermine the hard-won prestige of the judiciary as the guardian of civic rights. It had no compunction about carrying out defamatory campaigns; its officers indulged in all sorts of disrespectful acts  and judgements were deprived of all meaning  being disregarded whenever it suited the partisan interests of the Government of the Unidad Popular. Moreover  the authority to grant pardons was abused in the most inconceivable manner and the courts were denied the use of police power to enforce their decisions.140.	Time and again  the Supreme Court entered its protests  but the Government  far from changing its mistaken plan of action  pushed harder and harder  until the Court ultimately  in communication with the President of the Republic  felt obliged to denounce these events as conducive to ""a crisis in the legal system about which this Court cannot keep silent"". The abuse of the law became worse and worse until  last May  in a note to the head of State  the Supreme Court stated publicly something that was even more serious: namely  that the country was faced with ""a peremptory and imminent breakdown of the legal system"".141.	And yet  the Government continued with its policies  and the head of State even tried to justify them by instigating a public polemic with the Supreme Court  which only succeeded in reinforcing the Court's original position.142.	But the judiciary was not the only institution that had to try to defend the public interest and to point to the serious misdirection of the Government: the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic was also the object of increasingly inflammatory attacks and repeated slights. The Government abused the instrument of ""mandatory decrees""  thus implementing a ruling system bypassing Congress; and the President of the Republic even went so far as to ignore the opinion of the Comptroller-General when it came to the promulgation of a constitutional reform approved by the parliament  which the Executive proposed to enact only partially.143.	After fighting hard to find a political way to protect the national interest  the parliament itself finally assumed a position comparable to that of the judicial branch and of the Comptroller-General of the Republic. Even the possibility of submitting the Government to a plebiscite had been rejected by the Unidad Popular  thus proving its lack of democratic support even more openly.144.	On 22 August last  the Chamber of Deputies  which is the controlling branch of Congress  clearly and energetically denounced the Government's headlong path to destruction. By 81 votes to 47  the Chamber adopted a very important resolution  the main points of which I should like to quote.145.	To begin with  the resolution pointed out that sovereignty is vested essentially in the nation  that the authorities can only exercise powers delegated by the nation  and that a Government  by assuming rights not conferred by the people  is liable to charges of sedition. The resolution went on to declare:""It is a fact that the present Government of the Republic  since its inception  has been engaged in the conquest of total power with the obvious intention of subjecting all persons to the strictest State economic and political control in order thus to achieve the installation of a totalitarian system absolutely opposed to the representative democratic system established by the Constitution.""And  it added:""To accomplish this objective  the Government has not violated the law and the Constitution in isolated instances; rather  these violations have become permanent policy  to the extreme of systematically ignoring and encroaching on the power of the other branches of government  continually violating the guarantees that the Constitution assures to every inhabitant of the Republic  and allowing and sheltering the creation of illegitimate parallel powers that constitute a grave danger for the nation  all of which has led to destruction of the basic elements of our institutions and of our government of law.""146.	The Chamber of Deputies also indicated that the Government had committed inter alia the following violations and abuses:""It has usurped the principal function of Congress —  that is  to legislate — by adopting a series of highly important measures for the economic and social life of the nation  which are indubitably a matter of law  by mandatory decrees abusively issued or by simple administrative rulings based on legal loop-holes. It must be stressed that all this has been done with the deliberate and acknowledged purpose of changing the nation's structures  recognized by the law in force  by the sole will of the executive  with absolute disregard for the will of the legislative branch.""It has continually mocked the functions of control of the National Congress by depriving of all real effect the congressional power to dismiss from office cabinet ministers who violate the Constitution or the law or who commit other crimes or abuses specified in the Constitution. And  what is most serious of all  it has done away with the high function of the Congress as the constituent power by refusing to promulgate the constitutional reform covering the three areas of the economy which was approved in strict accord with the rules established by the Constitution.""147.	The resolution of the Chamber of Deputies did not stop there. It went on to enumerate the Government's principal abuses of the fundamental guarantees and rights afforded by the Constitution and  furthermore  added:""In this breakdown of the rule of law  the formation and development of armed groups under government protection is especially serious since  apart from being a danger to the security of individuals and their rights and to the internal peace of the nation  such groups are intended to confront the regular armed forces. It is also especially serious that the police force is kept from performing its most important functions in the face of criminal attacks perpetrated by violent groups supporting the Government. Because of their grave importance  notorious and public attempts to use the armed forces and the police force for partisan purposes cannot be passed over in silence; neither can attempts to break down their institutional hierarchy and politically infiltrate their ranks.""148.	For the benefit of the Executive  the Chamber of Deputies' resolution closed with a description of the serious breakdown of constitutional and legal order that confronted the Republic and the need immediately to rectify precisely defined situations and facts  the urgency of channelling the actions of the Government in a lawful direction and the need to ensure constitutional order in Chile.149.	As I have already pointed out  there was a long and patient wait by the citizenry and the other branches of government  which were always ready to facilitate solutions to the situation. As I have mentioned  the armed forces also loyally and professionally collaborated with the Government. Their mission was stretched beyond the limits of their vocation  since a number of times they were required to assume responsibilities with serious political consequences. Thus  in October 1972  confronted by a tenacious civil strike and in order to calm public opinion and guarantee parliamentary elections scheduled for six months later  representatives of the Chilean army  navy and air force assumed cabinet posts. I myself acted as Minister of State at that time and bent every effort loyally and efficiently to fulfil the mission entrusted to me by the President of the Republic.150.	We ministers who were members of the armed forces repeatedly tried to convince the head of State of the need to adopt measures that might change the course of the nation. We did achieve some revisions  but everything was erased once our mission of ensuring fair and honest elections had been accomplished and we left our cabinet posts.151.	After the elections of March of this year  and in order to comply with our sacred duty to preserve the democratic system  we repeatedly tried to convince those in charge of the country of the extremely dangerous path they were following. We were answered with promises that were always broken and with assurances that bore absolutely no relation to reality. While astute campaigns were organized to prevent a possible civil war. surreptitiously professional agitators  weapons and other highly destructive elements continued to enter the country with the specific purpose of preparing for the bloody coup de grace to our democratic system. I shall not tax the patience of the Assembly by describing the entire background that proves this. The caches of weapons and explosives; clandestine hospitals and blood banks; plans for violence  assassination  sabotage; the division of the armed forces and the organizing of mercenaries and guerrillas — all showed us that the abyss towards which our country was heading was even deeper than we had discovered when we adopted the historic resolution of 11 September.152.	It was not only the knowledge of those threatening plans that moved the armed forces and the police force in Chile to take the decision imposed upon them by their oath to protect the homeland.153.	With the public demoralized by so much abuse and so many threats upon their lives  humiliated by so much illegal and discriminatory rationing  and ruined by a black market directed and organized by government supporters  a strike erupted in one of the great copper mines. It lasted 74 days  and was followed by a civilian uprising of vast proportions. The truckers' union  the professional associations  retailers  large groups of craftsmen  workers and labourers  still not intimidated by foreign slogans  joined to protest with the only weapon they still possessed: the paralysing of the country. And in that historic uprising of the civilian masses  noble and true to their traditions  the long-suffering Chilean women and large groups of young students were in the vanguard.154.	The situation was becoming extremely dangerous and the Government  incapable of solving any problem and basically oriented towards the seizing of total power through violence  once again resorted to the patriotism of the armed forces and the police force of Chile. Once again those of us in uniform gave generous assistance by assuming cabinet posts. From the vantage-point of our high offices  we were very soon able to confirm the speed with which the country was heading towards total chaos. We noted the deep deterioration of national security. The irritating injustice of a regime that called itself ""popular"" while its leaders lived in ostentatious luxury  outraging the people who had to form long queues for food  was brought home to us. We could prove  too  the extremely dangerous level of foreign intervention in our affairs  as well as the way in which bands of actual criminals were preparing to administer the final blow to all those who were not already unconditionally enslaved.155.	Crime increased from day to day. One high naval officer  aide-de-camp to the President  was the fatal victim of a nefarious attack; a young army officer was assassinated by a foreign extremist; military intelligence services uncovered criminal acts of subversion within the ranks of the Navy  instigated by important members of the regime  including the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party  to which the President himself belonged.156.	Our final effort to participate in the Cabinet of the deposed Government did not successfully prevent the avalanche of events. Civic protest did not cease; the danger of a confrontation between the majority of the unarmed citizens and the strong paramilitary cells organized by Unidad Popular  which had drawn up a plan to assassinate civilian and military authorities and thus assume power completely  made it imperative for the armed forces and the police force to carry out their fundamental obligation and save the integrity of our nation.157.  On 11 September we acted  guided only by the oath we took many years ago  to defend our country and combine our efforts to preserve Chile as a sovereign nation  prosperous and free. We acted in concord with the immense majority of our countrymen  who  in fear and desperation  saw how an ideology alien to our history was cleverly taking advantage of our legal structure in order to impose upon us a totalitarian regime. We acted as institutions  without the influence of any leader. The Government junta that currently presides over Chile  with the support of the nation  is made up of men who do not seek power and who lack personal ambition. They are one body  patriotically united  that has taken on the immense but inevitable responsibility of restoring our homeland.158.	I must draw the attention of representatives to the resolution adopted by the full Supreme Court of Justice two days later  on 13 September  whereby the highest court of the Republic  recognizing the intention of the new Government to respect and implement the decisions of the judiciary without prior administrative review of their legality  ordered the nation's courts to continue their work  certain that the administrative authority would guarantee the normal discharge of its obligations.159.	The present Government has sought and immediately received the patriotic co-operation of professional people  technicians  workers  employees  businessmen and craftsmen. The Government has emphasized that its basic purpose will be the implementation of effective social justice  which will never be achieved through deceit  easy promises  bribery or the criminal division of our people. Rather  it will be done through honest work  a common dedication and community of interest. The present Government is not the return to a recent or remote past. The workers have fought far too long and far too hard defending their legitimate rights for that. The armed forces are a part of this noble people and we shall never betray those who  like ourselves  have dedicated their efforts to returning Chile to the place history has reserved for it.160.	We maintain our traditional respect for and hospitality to foreigners; but we shall be very careful to avoid a repetition of the reprehensible acts of foreign intervention that have caused the country so much suffering. With the assistance of everyone  we shall rebuild Chile.161.	The armed forces and the police force have assumed the task of redirecting the country along the path of liberty and law. Once we have achieved our goal  we shall not hesitate to withdraw to our barracks and to our ships. The time it takes to return to normality will be as brief as possible and will depend to a large extent upon the efforts of all Chileans dedicated to that noble end.162.	Now I should like to refer to the fundamental principles of the foreign policy of my Government.163.	As I reaffirm Chile's total commitment to its legally contracted international obligations and respect for its treaty obligations  which are the basis of world order  peace and security  I wish to state also that my country's foreign policy will be based upon its loyalty to the purposes and goals of the United Nations and to each of the provisions of the Charter. We signed the Charter in San FranciscO and we have always co-operated not only with this institution itself but also with all the organizations directly or indirectly connected with it. You may rest assured that that traditional policy of Chile will not be altered in any way. In fact we shall emphasize  loyally and without excesses  our co-operation in the work undertaken by the United Nations. This Organization is the most effective instrument for the achievement of international peace and security  for the growth of friendly relations and for respect for the fundamental rights of States. We must all dedicate our political will to these endeavours and comply fully with the resolutions of the principal organs of the United Nations. We must act in good faith and recognize that progress in the organized international community is achieved mainly through compliance with the basic resolutions of the Organization  such as the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]  the Declaration on the Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)] and the conclusions and recommendations of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. We reiterate our commitment to the principle of the universality of the United Nations and to the need to guarantee equal participation for all its Member States. The Organization should not be isolated from the mainstream of world events and  as the Secretary-General has said in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization  it must be recognized that bilateral diplomacy and multilateral diplomacy are mutually complementary and that  therefore  it is necessary to explore all the paths that might possibly lead to peace.164.	I take this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  on his strong leadership of the Organization. I should like to express our thanks for his constant concern for the problems of Chile and for the effective co-operation of the United Nations in our development plans. We have confidence in his ability to lead the Organization in new directions that will strengthen it as the main instrument for the achievement of international co-operation. We extend our best wishes for the success of his efforts towards peace in different parts of the world.165.	Another guiding principle of our foreign policy will be  as always  the principle of non-intervention in the domestic or external affairs of other States. But as we solemnly promise to respect national sovereignty  and therefore its obvious corollary  the self-determination of peoples  so must I categorically declare that we shall never allow foreign intrusions in our internal affairs or in the conduct of our international policy.166.	To comply with this fundamental principle  one of our first acts was to sever diplomatic and consular relations with the present Government of Cuba. We have been able to prove that over the last three years there has been constant interference by Cuban agents  some official and some unofficial  in our internal politics and even in our foreign policy. When the break came  42 Cuban diplomatic officials were accredited to Chile — as opposed to six Chileans in Havana — of whom only two belonged to the foreign service. Last September  987 Castro Cubans were discovered to be illegally in my country. In the course of the present year  from 1 January to 31 July  633 people came to Chile from Havana on diplomatic or official business. They intervened in every political  economic and functional organ of the State and  above all  in the presidency of the Republic. Instructors and top leaders of the paramilitary groups were either Cuban or had been trained by Cubans.167.	It has been fully proved that gun-running was systematically protected by the Government. For example  in March of last year  13 cases were known to have arrived in Chile  flown in on a regular Cuban airline flight and intended for the purposes of the presidency of the Republic. Those cases did not go through customs  but were received directly by the Chief of the Chilean Political Police. When the Chamber of Deputies duly protested  the then authorities maintained that the cases contained ""works of art sent as gifts by Prime Minister Fidel Castro"". Now we have learned what those ""works of art"" were: 13 cases containing 472 side-arms and machine-guns  two sub-machine-guns and 40 000 cartridges.168.	The weapons and ammunition thus far found in the hands of the misnamed ""people's militia"" are not the type used by the Chilean armed forces  and their numbers are really surprising. They included not only side-arms and sub-machine-guns  but also heavy machine-guns  rocket launchers  anti-tank guns  106 mm. cannons  as well as large amounts of explosives. This arsenal  brought into Chile principally from Cuba through the surreptitious procedures I have described  was mainly manufactured in the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. What has been thus far discovered is enough to equip an army of 20 000 men.169.	I do not wish to go into details of this Cuban infiltration in Chilean internal affairs. But I should like to read out a hand-written letter from Prime Minister Fidel Castro to the President of Chile  dated 29 July 1973. In order better to understand its terms  I must recall that a short time before  in circumstances that are still mysterious  the aide-de-camp to the head of State  Commander Araya  had been assassinated. The reaction to that new political crime was so great in Chile that the head of State instituted a dialogue with the chief opposition party  the Christian Democrats. That dialogue turned out to be hopeless because the President's desire was obviously to gain time and not arrive at any concrete solution. At that moment  Cuban Minister Carlos Rafael Rodriguez and the Chief of the Secret Police  Manuel Pineiro  arrived inSantiago  ostensibly to discuss the Algiers Conference of non-aligned countries. They carried with them the handwritten letter from Prime Minister Castro. I have a photostat of it in my hand and any representative who may wish to read it can ask for a copy from the Chilean delegation. I shall read out the contents of the letter; it is extremely important because of its implications. It reads as follows:""Havana  29 July 1973.""Dear Salvador:""Under the pretext of discussing with you questions concerning the meeting of non-aligned countries  Carlos and Pineiro are coming to see you. The real purpose is to discuss with you your situation and  as always  to offer you our willingness to co-operate in the face of the difficulties and dangers which hinder and threaten the process. Their stay will be very short  since they have many pending obligations here  and it is not without sacrifice to their work that we decided that the trip should be made.""I see that you are now taken up in the delicate question of the dialogue with the Christian Democrats in a serious atmosphere created by the brutal assassination of your naval aide-de-camp and the new truck- owners' strike. I can therefore quite well imagine the great tension that exists and your desire to gain time  to improve the relationship of forces in case a battle breaks out and  if possible  to find a way to allow the revolutionary process to continue without civil strife  while protecting your historical responsibility for what might occur. These are laudable goals. But if the other side  whose real intentions we are not in a position to evaluate from here  should insist upon a treacherous and irresponsible policy that would exact an impossible price from Unidad Popular and the revolution  which is in itself quite likely  do not for one minute forget the formidable strength of the Chilean working classes and the strong support they have always offered you in your difficult moments. If you should call upon them because the revolution is in danger  they can paralyse those that threaten to overthrow the Government  preserve the loyalty of those who hesitate  impose their conditions and decide once for all  if necessary  the future of Chile. The enemy should know the working class is forewarned and ready for action. Their force and combativeness can tip the balance in the capital in your favour  even though other circumstances might be unfavourable.""Your determination to defend the process strongly and honourably  even if it means risking your own life  will draw to your side all the forces able to fight and all the decent men and women in Chile. Your courage  your serenity and your daring in this historic moment for your country  and above all your strong resolve and heroic leadership  are the key to the situation.""Let Carlos and Manuel know how your loyal Cuban friends can help you.""Once again I send you the affection and unlimited confidence of the Cuban people.""Fraternally  ""Fidel CASTRO.""170.	Now I wonder — do we need any more barefaced proof of intervention in Chilean political life? Can there be any doubt regarding the origin of the political directives and the support for illegality?171.	I do not need to take up any more time of the representatives here by describing the recent and absurd Cuban attempt to accuse Chile in the Security Council. It can only be explained as a futile and desperate attempt to cover up the seriousness of their intervention in the internal affairs of my country.172.	Chile  in line with the tradition that it has always followed  reserves the right to turn to the appropriate international organizations if and when necessary.173.	On the basis of the fact that we can maintain normal relations only with those countries which respect us  we also severed relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea — after we were able to prove that there had been intervention in our internal affairs and an involvement of that country's diplomatic representatives in the training of guerrillas.174.	On the other hand  we wish to maintain diplomatic relations with all countries of the world  irrespective of their ideology or their political  social or economic systems. We believe that the diversity of governments has nothing whatever to do with relations among States. Ideological pluralism is and will be another element of our foreign policy. For these reasons we regret that certain Governments to which we had expressed Chile's desire to maintain relations on a normal basis have nevertheless decided to break off such relations with a curious uniformity and under the most varied and false pretences. We ask ourselves  what has happened to the principle of ideological pluralism  so often exalted by those Governments? In the future they will have to take the initiative of resuming diplomatic relations with Chile  since they have  again with surprising uniformity  stressed the fact that those ties are merely suspended. They will find no opposition on our part — so long as our future relations can be based upon mutual respect and non-intervention in internal and external affairs.175.	We are particularly interested in strengthening our ties with the Latin American countries. United as we are by a common origin  we face a common destiny  and to achieve it we must work together.176.	I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your well-deserved election. My country feels deep affection and respect for yours  and our history has always been closely linked to that of Ecuador. For many years we have learned to appreciate your intelligent  active work in international affairs. Today these qualifications and this experience guarantee the success of your difficult task as President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly.177.	Imbued by that Latin American spirit  we shall fully support all the regional and subregional integration procedures that involve Chile  such as the Latin American Free Trade Association and the Andean Subregional Integration Agreement. We also support and endorse theSpecial Committee on Latin American Co-ordination as a basically Latin American Forum where our countries can analyse and adopt unified positions on matters of particular interest and concern to them.178.	The Chilean Government wishes emphatically to repeat its support of the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources of the earth  the sea  the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof for the economic development and welfare of the peoples of the world.'179.	We also press most firmly for the right of nations freely and independently to dispose of their own natural resources. We unreservedly support all the principles  agreements and resolutions adopted within the framework of the United Nations and within the sphere of the regional and subregional Latin American organizations on this important subject.180.	We thoroughly support the efforts of the developing countries to gain approval for a charter of economic rights and duties of States that  once implemented  would establish the basic economic and social principles to govern the international community in these matters. This initiative of the President of Mexico has our wholehearted support.181.	Within the dynamics that govern international economic relations  foreign investments must be in harmony with the goals and programmes established by the host Government and must also reflect the welfare of that Government and that country. Just as we do not accept imperialism  so with the same emphasis do we reject economic imperialism  whether it comes from States or from great transnational corporations.182.	In the United Nations  Chile will fight against any form of colonialism or neo-colonialism. That policy was not  as some may have believed  an innovation by the Government of the Unidad Popular. It has been the traditional policy of my country for many years. It is the result of a deeply rooted feeling in our country's traditions.183.	The economic independence of developing countries has been  is and always will be one of the fundamental goals of Chilean foreign policy.184.	I wish to reiterate to representatives my Government's commitment to non-alignment  a position that reflects the aspirations of all countries which like Chile are fighting to obtain for their peoples true economic and political independence.185.	Within the strange tangle of falsehoods that have been spread abroad as a result of the events of 11 September  reports have been circulated that Chile would return foreign refugees from political  racial or religious persecution to their countries of origin. From the very outset I assured the Secretary-General of the United Nations — and I do so again from this rostrum — that such refugees who are in Chile legally and have not been implicated in any crime are fully protected  and that any others who are expelled will not be returned to their countries of origin but will be allowed to choose their destination. After very pleasant discussions with the Regional Representative for Latin America of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees we have reached a general and entirely satisfactory agreement. We stated that we will accept his help when it comes to practical solutions that might affect refugees who have decided to seek Chilean hospitality.186.	The international negotiations regarding the law of the sea have proceeded to their decisive phase. The current session of the General Assembly will have to decide on a date for the already planned second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.187.	Chile was and continues to be a supporter of this international negotiation  to which we attach the greatest importance. The future of the seas and oceans that cover more than two thirds of the earth's surface is extremely important economically  politically and even militarily. New legal provisions are being established and progressively developed; internationally accepted rules are being updated to conform with the economic  technological and political realities of today.e188.	This new law should clearly cover economic development. It should set up an international regime for the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction that would give adequate expression to the fact that they are the common heritage of mankind. In treaty form it will have to express the natural right of the coastal States to dispose of the resources of their adjacent seas  specifically of the 200-mile zones which have an essentially economic meaning — a theory which is being supported by a large majority of nations today.189.	The statement of the representative of Chile has been lengthy and I must apologize for that. But I felt in duty bound to give a broad outline of the foreign policy of my Government and also to go into some detail regarding the events that took place in my country last month.190.	I understand the interest that these events have aroused in the world  even in countries distant from my own  countries which are relatively unfamiliar with our idiosyncrasies  our traditions  and the vigour of our people. There is no doubt that the so-called ""Chilean experiment"" of setting a course towards socialism aroused the curiosity and even the sympathy of many who saw in the example of the so-called Unidad Popular  a path worthy of imitation or at least of assimilation. But it is one thing to assess a foreign experience from afar  seated in comfortable armchairs or in discussion around a well- served table  and it is quite another thing to experience it.191.	Contrary to what the Chilean people themselves believed at first  it was not evolution or social progress that was taking place in Chile. There was simply a power machine being set up by which  through the use of legal loop-holes at first  and later through open and outright illegality  the country was being led to tyranny and consolidated totalitarianism.192.	The Chilean people did not deserve to pay such a high ""cost of revolution""  as some came to call the loss of lives  suffering  discrimination  hunger and sectarianism brought about by the Unidad Popular. Worse still  my country  on the verge of financial and economic bankruptcy  plagued by misery and divided into irreconcilable camps  was on the point of falling into chaos and into actual dissolution of the nation. In a supreme effort  and after having exhausted every legal possibility  my country has been able to avoid the most cruel and brutal of civil wars and set its feet on the road to national reconstruction.193.	None of this could escape the uncommitted foreigners who live in Chile  much less the diplomatic representatives of friendly nations who looked on impartially  but with anguish  while the country disintegrated. Politicians and ideologists outside the country may of course have another view. I remind them of the words of Bossuet: ""The worst aberration of the mind consists of seeing things as one would like them to be and not as they are"".194.	Chile has now taken a different road. The new Government will not retreat one step from the victories won by the workers  or from its policy of absolute national independence. We will whole-heartedly defend the interests of Chile in the face of any kind of imperialism.195.	But it is not easy to rebuild out of so much rubble and debris. Nevertheless  we trust fully in the aid of divine providence and we know that  thanks to the spirit of sacrifice and patriotism of every good Chilean  there will be no difficulty that cannot be overcome.196.	The costly and painful experience we have suffered has left us something positive. We now know the lurking poison behind deceiving mirages. Suffering has brought the Chileans together  overcoming the selfishness of the powerful and the hate which the weakest had been led to feel. The country will not forget the lesson that has allowed it to recover self-confidence. Once again it has been proved that in the spirit of Chile there still flames the fire of those who created a free and independent nation  embodying in its history what Ercilla sang of our strong indigenous race: a nation never ""mastered by foreign yoke""."
"21",1293,"CHN",28,1973,"﻿Since the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly  some notable events have successively taken place on the international arena. First  there was the cessation of the war in Viet-Nam and Laos. Secondly  there were the talks held and the agreements concluded between the two super-Powers-the United States and the Soviet Union. Thirdly  there was the convening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. In. the meantime  the third world has further awakened and grown in strength  and the African  Latin American and non-aligned countries held a series of important international conferences. What is the characteristic of the present world situation? Is the international situation really moving towards a general detente? This is a question in which people are interested. The delegation of the People's Republic of China would like to state its views on this question and a number of other questions with which the current session of the General Assembly is confronted.3.	First  what is the characteristic of the present world situation?The Chinese Government has long held that our world is now going through a process of great turbulence  great division and great realignment. The basic contradictions in the world are all sharpening  in particular the contradictions between imperialism and colonialism on the one hand andthe oppressed nations and peoples on the other and the contradictions among the imperialist countries  especially those between the two super-Powers. Although no new world war has broken out since the Second World War  local wars resulting from imperialist aggressions have never ceased. The great victory of the heroic Viet-Namese people's war of resistance against United States aggression and for national salvation has once again proved that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. A small nation can defeat a big one and a weak nation can defeat a strong one  so long as they dare to struggle  are good at struggle and persevere in struggle. It is not the people who fear imperialism; it is imperialism which fears the people. Revolution is the main trend in the world today. Now that the war in Viet-Nam has ended  can it be assumed that the world will henceforth be tranquil? Obviously not. When the Korean war was ended in 1953  some people thought that no more gunshots would be heard in the world. Not long afterwards  however  the Suez war broke out and then the Viet-Nam war started. And even today  the war in Indo-China has not stopped completely  for there is still fighting in Cambodia. Tension in the Middle East has not relaxed in the least. The colonialists and racists are carrying out armed suppression against the African people and the African people are developing armed resistance against them. The aggression against  subversion and control of and interference in countries in Africa  Asia and Latin America by the super-Powers are continuing without end. A recent case in point is the military coup d'etat in Chile. President Salvador Allende died a martyr at his post. We express profound condolences on his heroic death. At the same time  we hold one should not forget how harmful the absurd theory of so-called ""peaceful transition"" is to the anti-imperialism revolutionary struggles of the Asian  African and Latin American people  a theory which has been advocated by another super-Power. The dismemberment of a sovereign country by armed force and the legalization and perpetuation of that division have also become a tendency on the part of the big Powers in their attempt to dominate the world. In the economic field  the gap is widening between the rich and developed countries and the poor and developing countries  and even among the developed countries there exist many contradictions  and hence detente among them is far from being the case. The recent Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-aligned Countries  held at Algiers  strongly condemned racism  Zionism  colonialism  imperialism and hegemonism and strongly demanded a change in the present state of affairs in the world  demonstrating a further awakening of the Asian  African and Latin American peoples. In a word  we consider that the characteristic of the present situation is one of great disorder throughout the world and not tranquillity. And the main trend amidst this great disorder is that countries want independence  nations want liberation  and the people want revolution. 5.	Second  why is there no tranquillity in the world today?6.	We have always held that all countries in the world  big or small  should be equal; that all countries  irrespective of their social systems  should establish normal State relations on the five principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty  mutual non-aggression  noninterference in each other's internal affairs  equality and mutual benefit  and peaceful coexistence; and that international disputes should be settled peacefully on the basis of these principles without resorting to the use or threat of force. This should apply to relations between big Powers  to relations between a big Power and a small country  and all the more so to relations between a strong and a weak  or between a rich and a poor country. It was on these principles that China started to improve its relations with the United States and established diplomatic relations with Japan. In their joint communique issued in Shanghai on 27 February 1972  China and the United States further declared that they should not seek hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region and were opposed to efforts by any other country or group of countries to establish such hegemony. The same principle was reaffirmed in the Sino-Japanese statement of 30 September 1972 on the establishment of mutual diplomatic relations. In our view  the above-mentioned principles are the minimum criteria for the equality of all countries in international relations and indicate the correct way to achieve a relaxation of international tension.7.	As sovereign States  the United States and the Soviet Union are fully entitled to take the measures they deem appropriate to improve and develop their bilateral relations. However  we cannot but point out that the Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War signed by them on 22 June 1973 goes far beyond the scope of bilateral relations. One may ask  Who has given them the right to enter into what they call ""urgent consultations"" in case of a dispute between either of the parties and other countries and even between any other two countries? The phrase about disputes which ""appear to involve the risk of nuclear conflict"" is open to any interpretation  and their so-called ""urgent consultations"" are bound to be followed by actions dictated by their own interests. Does not this mean that they may interfere at will in the relations among all countries on the strength of the huge numbers of nuclear weapons in their possession? China absolutely will not go begging for nuclear protection from any country  nor is she afraid of nuclear threat from any country. But we feel in duty bound to state our views on this matter since it concerns all the people of the world.8.	The signing of such an agreement by the Soviet Union and the United States is by no means accidental  but is derived from the so-called principle which they agreed upon in 1972 that the Soviet Union and the United States have ""security interests. . . based on the principle of equality"". What is meant by ""security interests.. . based on the principle of equality""? To put it bluntly  it means rivalry for world hegemony — wherever one goes  the other will do the same. What they are doing now is simply to wrap up this content in the form of an agreement.9.	In fact  this Agreement is a mere scrap of paper. It contains no explicit undertaking on the non-use of nuclear weapons; still less does it envisage the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. The United States Government was more frank when it stated that the Agreement is only a general statement of policy which does not involve any particular positive actions that either side has to take  and pointed out that agreements are not always maintained and there is nothing self-enforcing about this document.10.	However  the Soviet leaders have made a great fanfare  lauding that Agreement to the skies  alleging that it ushered in ""a new era"" in international relations and opened up ""historical vistas for strengthening universal security as a whole "" and that it was ""indeed of historic importance for all mankind"". They have their motives for so eulogizing the Agreement. One may recall Khrushchev's famous remarks: ""Even a tiny spark can cause a world conflagration"" and ""We"" — that is  the Soviet Union and the United States-""are the strongest countries in the world  and if we unite for peace there can be no war. Then if any madman wanted war  we would but have to shake our fingers to warn him off."" In this way  if the Soviet Union could be bound together with the United States  would not the whole world have to cringe to them? However  in our view  things may not necessarily turn out that way.11.	It is not so easy for the Soviet Union to bind itself to the United States. Shortly after the signing of the Agreement  the Soviet Union pressed forward with its underground nuclear tests and hastened the development of missiles with multiple warheads. The United States will not take this lying down. Why? Because the desperate struggle for nuclear superiority and world hegemony still goes on. The contention between the Soviet Union and the United States now extends all over the world. A vivid proof can be found in the recent subversion of a government in Asia and another in South America. Their scramble is becoming increasingly fierce. That is the reason why there is no tranquillity in the world today. So  what peaceful coexistence is there to speak of? There is. only a travesty of peaceful coexistence; the substance is coexistence in rivalry. But whether such coexistence can last is  of course  another question.12.	The Soviet leaders noisily proclaim that as a ""socialist"" State the Soviet Union is the ""natural and surest ally"" of the developing countries. In the past  some people in China also believed this  because they saw the Soviet Union as the homeland of the great Lenin and the Chinese revolution  a continuation of the October Revolution. Therefore  how could the Soviet Union  as a socialist State  fail to give the developing countries whole-hearted internationalist assistance? But since Khrushchev rose to power  we came to realize  thanks to the long and direct experience we had gained as a result of the Soviet Union's demand for the establishment of a joint fleet in the China Sea  its withdrawal of experts  its tearing up of contracts  border intrusions  subversions  and so on  that this was not the case  and that what the Soviet Union practised was not internationalism but great-Power chauvinism  national egoism and territorial expansionism. Therefore we will not blame those friends who have so far failed to see this for lack of experience. How can a socialist turn into an imperialist? There is in fact nothing strange about it if one goes a little into the history of the international Communist movement. Was not Karl Kautsky once a somewhat well-known Marxist? But he later betrayed Marxism and capitulated to imperialism. It was Lenin who passed the final historical verdict on Kautsky in his well-known pamphlet Trie Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky.  People can change; so can a State. It has changed  and what can one do about it?13.	Lenin pointed out on one occasion: ""We judge a person not by what he says or thinks of himself but by his actions."" That applies to a State as well. What has the Soviet Government done to other countries in these years? This is clear to the broad masses of the people of Czechoslovakia  Egypt and Pakistan  to the peoples of Cambodia who are fighting dauntlessly  and to other peoples who have been subjected to its aggression  subversion  control  interference or bullying. The actions of the Soviet Government have amply shown that it is ""socialist in words  imperialist in deeds""  as Lenin said.14.	The Soviet-United States Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War cannot hoodwink many people or intimidate the peoples of the world  but can only arouse indignation  misgivings and disillusionment. The tide is mounting against the hegemonism and power politics practised by the super-Powers.15.	Third  who is really against detente?16.	Shortly after the war in Viet-Nam came to an end  the United States Government pronounced 1973 to be ""the year of Europe"". That was followed by the first stage of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe — a conference advocated by the Soviet Government for many years. All this indicates that Europe is the focus of contention between the two super-Powers — the United States and the Soviet Union — and that the so-called European Security Conference is nothing but one of the forms of contention. Its proceedings showed  however  that it went far beyond the scope to which the two superpowers wished to confine it. At that Conference many countries stated pointedly that deeds and not empty promises are called for in the matter of security; that European security must be based on the safeguarding of national independence and sovereignty; that one must not become mentally disarmed and off guard simply because the European Security Conference has taken place; and that in order to guarantee European security  military blocs must be disbanded  foreign military bases dismantled  and foreign troops withdrawn  so that the relations between European countries may be established on the principles of mutual respect for independence and sovereignty  complete equality and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.17.	Moreover  some countries pointed out that the security of the Mediterranean and the security of Europewere inseparable and that there could be no security for Europe when the Mediterranean is under the armed threat of  and contention by  the two super-Powers. All this is tantamount to a direct blow at those who seek by means of this Conference to consolidate the occupation of many European countries which resulted from the Second World War or the events thereafter  and to proceed further to disintegrate Western Europe and dominate the whole of Europe. The European Security Conference is still going on; but  judging from the proceedings of its first stage  it will further expose the ambitions of that super-Power which seeks to divide and disintegrate Western Europe.18.	While stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations and its world-wide contention with the United States for spheres of influence  the Soviet Union is clamouring for ""spreading the zone of relaxation to the whole world"". Accordingly  it has lately picked up once again the long-ignored trash known as the Asian Collective Security System. This is most amusing. It reminds us of the American by the name of John Foster Dulles  who  after the war in Indo-China was brought to an end by the first Geneva Conference in 1954   hastily rigged up the so-called South-East Asia Treaty Organization  which was directed against China and whose members were mostly non-Southeast Asian countries. The Soviet Union is a European country and the chief of the alliance deriving from the Warsaw Treaty. Why should it be so eagerly concerned about the ""collective security"" of Asian countries? Has the ghost of John Foster Dulles gone to the Kremlin? Actually  would it not be less devious and more direct simply to extend the Warsaw Treaty to Asia?19.	Lately  the Soviet leaders have tried to pin an additional label on China  namely ""opponent of detente"". As the Chinese saying goes  this is putting Mr. Chang's hat on Mr. Li's head. Since you say you are so anxious to relax world tension  why do you not show your good faith by doing a thing or two — for instance  by withdrawing your armed forces from Czechoslovakia or the Mongolian People's Republic and by returning the four northern islands to Japan?20.	We hold that imperialism means war. There is a danger of war so long as imperialism exists. Today  when the various types of basic contradictions in the world are sharpening  the danger of a new world war still exists  and the people of all countries must be prepared  and must not let themselves be misled by a temporary and superficial facade of detente. Only thus can we better strive for a bright future for the world. In the final analysis  the destiny of mankind is decided by the people in their hundreds of millions who persevere in struggle and unity  and not by the one or two super-Powers.21.	Fourth  there is the Cambodian question.22.	The Chinese Government resolutely denounces the United States Government for continuing to support in various ways the puppet regime in Phnom Penh and wantonly to interfere in the affairs of Cambodia. The regime of the traitorous Lon Nol clique  which is now installed in Phnom Penh  was imposed on the Khmer people by the United States imperialists and their allies and has been illegal from its very inception. The Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia under the leadership of the head of State  Prince Norodom Sihanouk  is the sole legal government of Cambodia. The People's Armed Forces of National Liberation of Cambodia under its leadership have liberated over 90 per cent of Cambodia's territory  with over 80 per cent of the population. The Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia has been recognized by nearly 50 countries. The participants at the recent Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  which met in September at Algiers  have declared that the Royal Government of National Union under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk is the only legal government of Cambodia and earnestly requested all countries which love peace and justice to give it formal recognition [see A/9330  p. 12]. This is a voice of justice. The Chinese Government holds that the continued usurpation by the traitorous Lon Nol clique of the seat in the United Nations is a contempt for all countries that uphold justice  for the Fourth Conference and for the United Nations itself. The Chinese Government firmly maintains that the present session of the General Assembly should take a decision immediately to expel the representatives of the traitorous Lon Nol clique from the United Nations and restore to the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia under the leadership of the head of State  Prince Norodom Sihanouk  its rightful seat in the United Nations.23.	Fifth  I turn now to the Korean question.24.	There are now before the General Assembly two draft resolutions on the Korean question — one sponsored by the United States  the United Kingdom  Japan and other countries [A/C.1/L.645]  the other sponsored by Algeria  China and other countries [A/C.1IL.644 and Corr.l]. Regarding the former draft resolution  the Chinese Government considers that the position for retaining the United Nations Command and the United States forces in South Korea and for the entry of both North and South Korea into the United Nations is unreasonable and contrary to the joint communiqué of North and South Korea issued on 4 July 1972   although it contains the positive element of dissolving the so-called ""United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea"".25.	The withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean question are long overdue. According to the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement of 27 July 1953   a high-level political conference for the settlement of the Korean question ought to have met within three months after the Armistice Agreement became effective. The conference was not held only because of the obstructions put up by the United States side at the time. Subsequently  the question was again discussed at the 1954 Korean Political Conference in Geneva. The then United States Secretary of State  Mr. John Foster Dulles  peremptorily rejected all reasonable proposals  thereby blocking once again a solution to the question of the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean question. The United States was then absolutely unwilling to withdraw its forces from South Korea.26.	What could be done about it? Well  if you would not withdraw  we would.27.	In 1958 the Chinese People's Volunteers unilaterally and unconditionally withdrew from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Consequently  there are no foreign forces on one side in Korea  while large numbers of foreign forces  mainly United States forces  are stationed on the other side. This most unreasonable state of affairs cannot but constitute an obstacle to the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea.28.	Is South Korea so lacking in national self-respect that it must rely on the support of foreign forces? Obviously  such a state of affairs cannot be tolerated by the people in South Korea. Subsequently  thanks to the initiative of President Kim II Sung of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  a joint communiqué of North and South Korea on the independent and peaceful reunification of the country was issued on 4 July 1972  leading to the start of a dialogue between the North and the South. This was a big step towards the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the problem of the reunification of Korea by the Koreans themselves. With the issuance of this communiqué  the Korean Armistice Agreement  signed 19 years ago  to a great extent ceased to play the role it once had. The Koreans in the North and the South have themselves agreed upon refraining from committing armed provocations  big or small  and upon taking active measures for preventing incidents of unexpected military conflicts. Is this not the best guarantee for the maintenance of the armistice?29.	It is captious to say that the dissolution of the United Nations Command and the withdrawal of foreign forces would nullify the 1953 Armistice Agreement. It should be recalled that the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed between the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on the one hand and the United Nations Command on the other. According to that kind of reasoning  would not the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers mean that the Korean Armistice Agreement had long been nullified? Since the Chinese People's Volunteers could withdraw from Korea  why cannot the foreign forces in South Korea under the signboard of the United Nations Command do the same?30.	The continued presence of the so-called United Nations Command and of foreign forces in South Korea is at variance with the principles agreed on by the two sides in Korea on 4 July 1972 that ""unification shall be achieved through independent Korean efforts without being subject to external imposition or interference"". In point of fact  it is the very presence of this outside force that has emboldened the South Korean authorities to reject a number of reasonable proposals put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  thus causing the dialogue between the North and the South to bog down. The Kim Dae Jung incident which occurred not long agohas shown how abjectly the South Korean authorities depend upon foreign forces. In order that conditions may be created to accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea  the United Nations Command should agree to disband  and all foreign forces stationed in South Korea should agree to withdraw.31.	As for the entry of both North and South Korea into the United Nations  this is plainly an attempt to legalize and perpetuate the division of Korea  which runs counter to the principle agreed upon between the North and the South that has a homogenous people  a great national unity shall be sought  above all as one nation  transcending differences in ideas  ideologies and systems"". In his five propositions put forward on 23 June of this year [see A/9027  para. 19]  President Kim II Sung of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has pointed out that the North and the South should not enter the United Nations separately and that if they want to enter the United Nations before the reunification of the country is achieved  they should enter it as one State  at least  under the name of the Confederal Republic of Koryo after the Confederation is enforced. This proposition is entirely reasonable and merits the sympathy and support of all countries that uphold justice.32.	Sixth  there is the question of Bangladesh.33.	At the time of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly in 1971  the Soviet Union supported India in dismembering Pakistan by armed force. The General Assembly and then the Security Council adopted resolutions by overwhelming majorities calling for cease-fire  troop withdrawal and the repatriation of the prisoners of war by India and Pakistan f General Assembly resolution 2793 (XXVI) and Security Council resolution 307 (1971)]. At its twenty-seventh session  in 1972  the General Assembly further adopted two interdependent resolutions calling for the repatriation of Pakistan prisoners of war and expressing the desire for the admission of Bangladesh into the United Nations [resolutions 2938 and 2937 (XXVII)].34.	It was not until 28 August of this year that an agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war and civilians was reached between India and Pakistan at New Delhi. This agreement has come much too late  but its ultimate conclusion is to be welcomed. The agreement reached is on paper  and there will have to be a process before it can be turned into reality. Complications may yet arise. The Chinese Government holds that the question of admitting Bangladesh to the United Nations can be considered once the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council are implemented without qualification. But this can be done only after the thorough implementation of the United Nations resolutions  and definitely not before.35.	Seventh  there is the Middle East question.36.	Although the two super-Powers are both trumpeting about a general world trend towards detente  a tense stalemate of ""no war  no peace"" still prevails in the Middle East. When the Soviet Union dismembered Pakistan in 1971  no one said there was the risk of a nuclear war. Neither has anyone made a similar warning in connexionwith the current United States intervention in Cambodia. It is only in the Middle East that  at the mention of an attempt by Arab countries to repulse Israeli aggression and recover their lost territories  the air is filled with cries about a risk of nuclear war between the two super-Powers. Why is this so? Because the situation of ""no war  no peace"" created and maintained by the two super-Powers serves them best in their scramble for spheres of influence  oil resources and strategic positions in the Middle East. In. appearance the two super-Powers are each supporting one of the antagonistic sides  but in essence they are like two clay figurines which have been kneaded together and then remoulded  so that there is something of each in the other. Take the case of the aggressor Israel. Could Israel be so unbridled in its truculence if it received only supplies of American weapons but none of Soviet manpower? In our opinion  the so-called risk of a nuclear war has been deliberately fabricated to scare people. It is futile to count on the super-Powers to bring about a settlement of the Middle East question. Nor will the situation be changed by any resolution adopted by the United Nations. The only way out is to act independently and rely on one's own efforts. China has never had anything to do with the Israeli Zionists. China firmly supports the Palestinian and other Arab peoples in their just struggle against Israeli zionism. We believe that so long as they uphold unity and persevere in struggle  the Palestinian and other Arab peoples  with the support of the people of the whole world  will certainly surmount all the difficulties on their road of advance  recover their sacred territories and regain their national rights.37.	Eighth  there is the question of opposing colonialism.38.	An excellent situation prevails in Africa. In the past year  the African people have achieved a series of new victories in their struggle to win and safeguard their national independence and to oppose racism  colonialism  neo-colonialism  imperialism and hegemonism. Through their struggle they have come to realize more and more the necessity of armed struggle and mutual support. The Assembly of the Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  at its tenth ordinary session held last May in Addis Ababa  issued the resounding call to ""eliminate all forms of colonialism on the African continent"". The conference documents fully manifested the unity and co-operation of the African countries and their militancy against the common enemies  as well as the determination of the African people in the territories which have not yet become independent to expand their armed struggle for national liberation. With imperialist and superpower support and connivance  the racist regimes and colonialist authorities in Africa are resorting to more insidious and brutal means in their desperate struggle to buttress their tottering rule. They have long refused to implement the United Nations resolutions which reflect the just demands of the African people. What deserves special attention is that while the old-line colonialists are on the decline  neo-colonialists of different shades are trying to take their place by means of cunning and deceptive manoeuvres. The super-Powers are sowing dissension among the African countries so as to fish in troubled waters. The African people are still faced with the task of a protracted  complicated and tortuous struggle. Africa belongs to the great African people. The Chinese people stand firmly by the African people. We resolutely support the peoples of Mozambique  Angola  Azania  Namibia  Zimbabwe  Guinea-Bissau  Spanish Sahara and other regions in their just struggle for national liberation. We warmly hail and give recognition to the new-born Republic of Guinea- Bissau. We resolutely support the just struggles of all African countries against aggression  subversion and the sowing of discord by colonialism and neo-colonialism and in defence of State sovereignty and African unity. We are confident that the awakening African people will continue to win new victories in the course of their coming struggle.39.	Ninth  there is the question of opposing maritime hegemony.40.	The determined struggle for the recognition of maritime rights in a zone of 200 nautical miles initiated by Latin American countries has won increasing support among the numerous small and medium-sized countries. Both the Assembly of the Heads of State and Government of the OAU and the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held earlier this year  expressly declared that a coastal State is entitled to establish an exclusive economic zone or a zone of national jurisdiction with the maximum limit of 200 nautical miles. And land-locked States are also entitled to share sea-bed and fishery resources. On this problem of maritime rights  the numerous small and medium-sized countries are waging a gigantic and vigorous struggle against the maritime hegemony of the super-Powers. With a view to seeking hegemony on the seas and oceans  the super-Powers are trying in vain to preserve the outdated law of the sea and are doing their utmost to restrict the territorial sea and scope of jurisdiction of all countries. They insist that the three-nautical-mile or 12-nautical-mile rule for the territorial sea is sacred and inviolable  arguing that the expansion of the territorial sea and the zone of jurisdiction will narrow down the open sea. This is a bluff. What sacredness and inviolability! The three-nautical-mile rule was a man- made stipulation  and so was the 12-nautical mile rule. Both rules reflect the reality of the time when the seas and oceans were controlled by colonialism and imperialism. What is there that is so sacred and inviolable? As to the assertion that the larger the territorial seas and the zones of jurisdiction  the smaller the open sea  the question must be asked  What is the open sea? The so-called ""open sea"" has  in fact  always been the ""private sea"" of a few strong naval Powers. The numerous small and medium-sized countries have now stood up; they constitute the majority and demand a change in the so-called law of the sea  which is advantageous only to the imperialists. What fault can-one find with this? In a proposal submitted by the Soviet Union and its allies to the United Nations Industrial Development Board on 2 June 1972  they said that ""the sovereignty over the natural resources is depending to a great extent upon the capability of utilizing these resources by the industry of the developing countries .. '."". 41.	At the 101st meeting of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction held in Geneva on 22 August 1973  a Soviet representative said that the developing countries could not increase their catch even if they had a 200-nautical-mile zone  because they lacked the technical know-how  fishing capacity  and so forth. These statements simply mean that the greater the might  the greater the right. This is the logic of imperialism  pure and simple. Why are the super-Powers so violently opposed to the position of the small and medium-sized countries for enlarging the territorial sea and the zone of jurisdiction? It is not difficult to see the underlying motive if only one takes a look at the contention between the United States and the Soviet Union for maritime hegemony in the Mediterranean  the Persian Gulf  the Indian Ocean  the Caribbean  the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean and their rivalry in setting up bases and plundering the fishing and sea-bed resources there. When the territorial sea and the zone of jurisdiction are enlarged  their ""private sea"" over which they act the overlords will contract. How can the super-Powers not desperately oppose this? However  their opposition will eventually prove futile. So long as the numerous small and medium-sized countries are united by seeking common ground on major points  while reserving differences on minor ones  and persevere in tenacious and protracted efforts  their struggle against maritime hegemony is bound to triumph.42.	The struggle against maritime hegemony is an important aspect of the struggle waged by the numerous developing countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America to protect national resources and develop the national economy. It is also a new focus in the current struggle against hegemonism. In other economic spheres  the developing countries are also more closely co-ordinating their actions and strengthening their unity in the struggle against exploitation  plunder  dumping and monopoly by imperialism and big-Power hegemonism. The bilateral and regional economic co-operation of the developing countries is growing  and the various organizations of raw-material- exporting countries are expanding. More and more developing countries have come to realize that  in order to consolidate political independence  it is imperative to attain economic independence  and that in order to develop the national economy  it is imperative to rely on their own efforts and strengthen their mutual support and cooperation. It was by plundering and exploiting the people of Asia  Africa and Latin America that colonialism and imperialism accumulated their fortunes. Therefore  the people of these continents are fully entitled to demand repayment of this debt. However  in the light of China's own experience  colonialism and imperialism will never repay the debt and  what is more  they will create more difficulties for those countries which are defending their national independence and developing their national economy. It is futile to harbour any unrealistic notions about .them. We must persist in opposing imperialism  colonialism and hegemonism. We must rely on ourselves  rely on the people  wage an arduous struggle and exert sustained efforts. We believe that  by so doing  the developing countries will certainly become prosperous.43.	Tenth  there is the question of disarmament.44.	The Chinese Government has always stood for disarmament. But what we stand for is genuine disarmament  not phoney disarmament; still less empty talk about disarmament coupled with actual arms expansion every day. At present  we face the harsh fact that the super-Powers are hawking disarmament  and the Soviet Union in particular is most energetic about it. Nearly every year it comes up with some sort of proposal on disarmament at the General Assembly. Last year  it boasted of the great significance of its agreement with the United States on the so-called limitation of strategic nuclear weapons. And this year  it is even more vehement in lauding the so-called epoch-making significance of the Soviet-United States Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War. Meanwhile  it has sanctimoniously proposed a 10 per cent reduction of the military budgets of the five permanent members of the Security Council and the utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries [2124th meeting]. This is Krushchev's old war which has been peddled for more than a dozen years. It has not deceived many people. How are military budgets to be assessed? To study this problem alone  a committee will have to be set up and work for many years. Can military budgets really be reduced? Anyway  nobody has ever seen this happen. We think it is better to stop this kind of empty talk  and stop it quickly. If you are really the ""natural and surest ally"" of the developing countries you should come up to this rostrum and declare openly that your military aid to all developing countries which is used to resist foreign aggression is gratis and free of charge  that you will not be a merchant of death  and that  although you have charged previously  you will not press for the payment of debt and interest  especially in the case of the struggling Arab countries. Be forthright and simple. Declare publicly that you will cancel all the military loans  that there is no need for repayment and that you will let them be gone with the wind. Would not that be more practical?45.	What general disarmament? Actually  in the world today  it is the two super-Powers that are engaged in an uncontrollable arms race. Their aim is nuclear superiority and the nuclear hegemony with which to dominate the world. To put it bluntly  any disarmament must first of all be the disarming of these two super-Powers. But can this be realized? On this point  the United States Government is somewhat more candid than is the Soviet Government. It admits that military expenditures cannot be reduced in the context of rivalry between the two hegemonic Powers. As to the numerous small and medium-sized countries  the real problem they face is definitely not disarmament  but the strengthening of their necessary and independent defence capabilities. Even Western Europe is inadequate in defence capabilities. How much more so are the large number of small and medium-sized countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America? What have these countries got to disarm? To talk about general disarmament in these circumstances is gibberish. If such proposals were really accepted  it would mean to ask the whole world completely to disarm itself in front of the two super-Powers and allow itself to be ordered about.46.	The Chinese Government is in favour of convening a world conference on genuine disarmament. But there must be the necessary pre-conditions and clear aims for the conference. That is  all nuclear countries  and particularly the two nuclear super-Powers  the Soviet Union and the United States  must first of all undertake the unequivocal obligation that at no time and in no circumstances will they be the first to use nuclear weapons  particularly against non-nuclear countries and in nuclear-weapon-free zones. For example  the Soviet Union should undertake obligations in respect of the nuclear-weapon-free zones in Latin America  and they must withdraw from abroad all their armed forces  including nuclear missile forces  and dismantle all their military bases  including nuclear bases  on the territories of other countries. Only thus will it be possible for all countries big and small to discuss on an equal footing and with equanimity and to solve the questions of the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons and other questions free from any threat of force.47.	Some people charge that China's position on the disarmament question is ""either all or nothing"". This is a distortion. One may ask  What difficulties are there for nuclear countries first of all to undertake the obligation  as the first step towards nuclear disarmament  that at no time and in no circumstances will they be the first to use nuclear weapons  particularly against non-nuclear countries or in nuclear-weapon-free zones? Is this not a truly effective first step towards the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons? But these disarmament- advocating ""saints"" would not even agree to undertake this minimum obligation. Does this not suffice to show that they are actually imperialists who persist in arms expansion and aggression  menacing the people of the world and aspiring to world hegemony?48.	The People's Republic of China is taking part in the activities of the United Nations for the third year. We wish to say frankly that what we have experienced in the United Nations has caused us to become worried. Speeches are multiplying and resolutions are piling up in the United Nations  yet the Organization has not been able to look into matters which it ought to — for instance  the question of the prevention of nuclear war — and it is impotent in the solution of many major world issues — for instance  the Middle East question. If things continue this way  what future is there for the United Nations? However  we are not disheartened. We believe that the present conditions in the United Nations should be changed and that the Charter should be revised. How can the United Nations go on working in the same old way it did more than 20 years ago  when the world has already changed? The third world has risen up. The United Nations must be able to give expression to the desires of the numerous small and medium-sized countries  truly to give effect to the principle of the equality of all countries big or small and to cease to be controlled by the super-Powers and their small number of followers if it is to be worthy of its name. China is ready to work together with all countries which love peace and uphold justice for the achievement of this noble aim."
"22",1415,"COD",28,1973,"﻿88.	 Mr. President  first of all may I thank you for allowing me toaddress the Assembly from this rostrum. Furthermore  on behalf of the nationals of the countries commonly called the countries of the third world  I wish to congratulate you on your brilliant election to preside over the General Assembly of the United Nations. I have no doubt that  owing to your well-known reputation as a statesman  you will carry the heavy burdens it imposes with competence and to the immense satisfaction of the General Assembly and to the pride of the so-called third world. Glancing at your biography  Sir  I find both pleasure and pride in discovering that you  like myself  were at one time a journalist.89.	The people of Zaire  at one with the Popular Movement of the Revolution  our national party  has entrusted me with presenting the thanks of the citizens of Zaire to the United Nations through this august Assembly.90.	If a small minority of States Members of this Organization refused to participate in the Congo operation at that time  the great majority nevertheless spontaneously placed troops at the disposal of the Organization  or assisted financially in the carrying out of the operation that allowed us to maintain peace and the unity and integrity of national territory. Through the United Nations  Zaire wishes to give heart-felt thanks to all parties.91.	I will take advantage of this opportunity to pay a tribute also to the Secretaries-General of the world Organization who have worked so hard and have been able to assure us of our existence.92.	My thoughts go out particularly to the late Dag Hammarskjold  who died in the service of this important Organization and of the Republic of Zaire.93.	My tribute must also be addressed to his successor  U Thant  who gave himself body and soul to the maintenance of peace in the world and who paid special attention to the cause of Zaire.94.	I am very grateful  finally  for the appointment of Mr. Kurt Waldheim as Secretary-General of the United Nations. I wish for him a brilliant and fruitful career.95.	All the world knows the circumstances that surrounded the accession of my country to independence. In 1960  Zaire  which was still called the Congo  collapsed one night like a house of cards. A number of experts in colonialism had decided hastily that our people were congenitally incapable  attempting to prove thereby that the independence of new nations was an unsuccessful operation. We were presumed and judged incapable of governing ourselves without the colonizers.96.	But we believe that the accident that occurred in Zaire was foreseeable. Despite the fact that by the Act of Berlin of 1885 the Zaire river basin was opened to the entire world  Zaire itself was isolated from the world. It was outside the pale of progressive ideas.97.	Furthermore  at the time it attained independence my country  80 times larger than its one-timemetropolitan area  had only 10 national cadres that had completed their university studies; and in the administration  in the army and in the private sector  there was not a single Zairean cadre.98.	It was for that reason that 1960 to 1965 were dreadful years for us and we are forced to recognize that anarchy  chaos  disorder  blindness and incapacity prevailed in Zaire.99.	Some of you may have to consult your dictionary to find out precisely what the word ""anarchy"" means  but we in Zaire were so well acquainted with it that many people felt that the word ""anarchy"" was an invention of Zaire. That is why disorder in any part of the world was baptized ""congolization"".100.	Our country suffered because of its lack of political preparation; but it suffered above all because of the greed of the West and the East. Both of them tried to gain a decisive influence over us so that they could control our important natural resources. Some wanted to recolonize us economically  whereas others wished to dominate us ideologically.101.	Zaire  which went through indescribable chaos to become an organized and well-governed country  after its unfortunate experience finally recognized its true friends. The Zairean experience is based on a political philosophy that we call authenticity. This is an awareness on the part of the people of Zaire that they should return to their beginnings and search for the values of their ancestors in order to appreciate the values which contribute to the country's harmonious and natural development. It is the refusal of the people of Zaire blindly to espouse imported ideologies. It is the affirmation of the worth of the Zairean  or of any man  as he is and where he is  with the mental and social structures that are his own. A return to authenticity is not narrow nationalism  a blind return to the past. On the contrary  it is a useful instrument for peace among nations  a condition for existence among peoples  a platform on which co-operation among States can be built. For authenticity not only implies a profound knowledge of one's own culture  but also a respect for the cultural heritage of others.102.	Thus  strengthened by this experience  we in all modesty believe that Zaire can now give to the world its own interpretation of problems that confront us.103.	We shall start by dealing with our own continent  Africa. For Africa today remains the only continent where colonization  racial segregation  apartheid and contempt of man because of the pigmentation of his skin persist. Africa is a continent that has suffered some of the greatest humiliations of recorded history.104.	For centuries the situation of the black man in Africa has deteriorated. Under the pretext that they had come to Africa to civilize us  the first whites  the pioneers of that civilization  began by emptying our respective countries of their fundamental substance through the shameful practice of slave-trading — and even at that period the chief offenders were the Portuguese. Our ancestors were not considered as men  or even as beings with intelligence and feeling. They were considered as a set of muscles fit for mechanical labour such as we expect from an animal — a horse  a buffalo  a donkey or an ox.105.	Slavery continued and in the nineteenth century became a veritable catastrophe for the African continent. To justify themselves  these colonialists and slave-traders pitted us against our Arab brothers  affirming their role in slavery. They pretend to forget that the Arabs were only brokers and commissioners  because slave-trading of the blacks was carried on for the sole profit of the whites.106.	The colonial countries of Europe very rapidly learned the meaning of the adage that you can never be better served than by yourself. Thus  in 1885 the great slave-traders of the period met in Berlin and  like vultures  carved up the African continent among themselves. No more would slave-trading raids cost them dear. Unorganised occupation would not occur again; it would now be premeditated and organized. The exploitation of the blacks would not be sporadic; it would now become systematic  permanent and definitive by the pure and simple appropriation of the African territories by the slave-traders. The black had no longer to escape the raids he lost his rights  his country and his freedom. The process of dehumanization had begun. The black had to give up his personality  his mental and social structures — in a word  his authenticity.107.	Pseudo-scientific arguments in which the black was alleged to be an inferior being were not lacking to justify this business of dehumanization. They maintained that the white colonizers were different from the blacks whom they colonized and  therefore  superior to them. In order to perpetuate the exploitation of the black by the white  the colonizers systematically set about destroying African traditions  African languages  African culture —  in a word  making a brute of the black man so that he could only speak  think  eat  dress  laugh or breathe as the white man did.108.	Despite the huge organization created to perpetuate the slavery of the black man  the whites of Europe could not extinguish the flame of freedom and dignity in black Africa. Thus  about 1960 an irresistible and irreversible feeling for freedom seized all the peoples of Africa and led to disarray among the colonialists who were not prepared for it. The black man broke his shackles and said ""No"" to exploitation and' to his alienation by the West.109.	A fruit falls only when it is ripe; but in the storms' and the tempests of history the fruit falls  whether ripe or not.110.	From that time on  we believed that the colonialists finally understood that history cannot be turned back. But today's experience shows that Africa has not yet reached the end of its suffering  for the colonialists are still waging a rear-guard action. In fact  white mercenaries paid by certain countries have tried to re-conquer some countries that have already gained independence. This was the case in the DemocraticRepublic of the Sudan  the Federal Republic of Nigeria and in my own country  Zaire.111.	In the town of Bukavu  in eastern Zaire  a white mercenary from Europe  seriously proclaimed himself President of the Republic of Zaire. Had a black man done so in Europe  he would immediately have been taken for a hoaxer or a mental case; but  since he was a white man doing so in Africa  the colonialists mobilized the press  radio and television and placed them all at his disposal  not only to offer him publicity  but also to ridicule the Chief of State of Zaire  myself. My position has not been challenged in my own territory  or in any of the countries represented here. But such provocation was an intolerable insult to me which I cannot pardon.112.	At this very moment that I am speaking to you  the anachronistic situation at present prevailing in Angola  Rhodesia  Mozambique  Namibia and South Africa would be unthinkable without the hidden support of certain Powers.113.	How can one explain the fact that a country like Portugal has the strength to control enormous territories such as Angola and Mozambique unless it is upheld by more powerful nations than itself? In fact Portugal is an economically  socially and culturally under-developed nation. It has no democracy. It has no military force. Its sole record is that of having the highest level of illiteracy in Europe. Its strength and its arrogance are directly linked with its membership in NATO. Portugal  with its colonies  is strategically necessary for that military organization.114.	The volume of investment and capital coming from the West to the Portuguese colonies increases daily. The building of the Cabora Bassa dam  which will serve mainly the Republic of South Africa  shows unequivocally that the interested Powers will always oppose the liberation and independence of the countries I have mentioned. Furthermore  the Minister of the Interior and of Information  Mr. Cornelius Mulder  recently stated that the Republic of South Africa was ready to supply military support to all the countries of southern Africa  including Mozambique and the other Portuguese territories  in order to combat what he called terrorism —  in 'other words  the heroic struggle of the African nationalists. Mr. Mulder made that statement when he was on a visit to Rhodesia to inspect the units of the South African army that are fighting  together with the Rhodesian forces  against the Zimbabwe patriots.115. Between the two Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique there is a country where some years ago a similar situation developed. Call it what you will  it is a scandalous situation. I am referring now to Rhodesia. One morning we learned from the press that after a number of secret meetings between the Government of Her Very Gracious Majesty the Queen of England and the British settlers in Rhodesia  the latter had rebelled against their Government  their country and their sovereign and that the authorities of Great Britain were unable to induce their compatriots in Africa to change their minds.116.	The motto of Great Britain is Dieu et mon Droit —  God and my right. I presume that means that the role of the Government of that country is to ensure that justice prevails where it has authority; but glancing at the history of that great people we note that it has largely justified the existence of that motto and even gone beyond mere justice at times to what it might term the sole right of the great island. To be convinced  all we need do is recall the innumerable movements of rebellion and independence that have been so violently squashed by Great Britain in the course of its history. As regards Africa  the example of Kenya suffices — strikingly so. In fact  the injustice of the British Government  which reserved the best lands for its own settlers in that country  led to the legitimate revolution of the Mau Mau. That revolt was savagely squash  by the butchery of approximately 15 000 persons.117.	The case of the United States of America  which valiantly struggled to attain its independence  is far too well known to be dwelt on here. Everywhere  in Kenya  India  Guyana  Cyprus  Aden  Palestine  Gibraltar  Anguilla  Great Britain has resorted to force to ensure that its authority would prevail — everywhere except  strangely enough  in Rhodesia.118.	And yet the Africans of Rhodesia  counting on the justice of that great country  had earlier trusted the British Government; unfortunately they had to change their tune. One day 2 000 black rioters who had climbed the trees around Salisbury airport to welcome the then Prime Minister  Harold Wilson  chanted the following: ""We are black. We are the orphans of Rhodesia. No one helps us. No one loves us."" The white police answered  ""Leave those damned monkeys. Let them go back to the trees they came from.""119.	That is why we denounce racism. It is premeditated; it is ignoble; it is inhuman.120.	Much has been said about economic sanctions to put down the secession in Rhodesia but in point of fact Great Britain carefully protects its friend in NATO  Portugal  and the latter in turn protects its friends the British settlers of Rhodesia. Paradoxically  they do not manage to discourage the secessionists  but they are managing to stifle an independent country — Zambia. Great Britain  which considers itself the most traditionally democratic country in the world  the defender of fundamental freedoms and the legitimate rights of man  accepts  tolerates and implicitly upholds its 200 000 rebellious subjects who  contrary to the elementary rules of democracy  keep 4 million blacks in slavery.121.	The situation of the Portuguese and British territories reaches as far as South Africa. That is the only country in the world where the whites have raised segregation to the level of an institution. The term apartheid would not exist in human language had the whites not been in South Africa.122.	Instead of being logical with themselves and consistent in allowing blacks and whites to be separated  each group developing according to its own fashion  the whites push their barbarism by exploiting the black man  as they did in the old days of slavery. Thus  thanks to an almost free labour force  420 000 blacks extract by hand two thirds of the world's production of gold  for the profit of the whites. And the blacks of South Africa have no right to strike  no trade union rights  no rights at all. They have asked for an absurdly small increase in their wages  taking account of the present world price of gold  but they have simply been beaten down by the South African authorities.123.	The Republic of South Africa has plagued the United Nations for over 20 years with the problem of Namibia. Now the South African racists are Balkanizing that great African territory.124.	Faced by this conspiracy against independent Africa  three countries  those most directly concerned  have tried to co-ordinate their efforts in order to ensure  on the one hand  their own security and  on the other hand  the freedom of the countries at present occupied. I take advantage of this opportunity to pay a warm tribute to my brothers  Julius Nyerere and Kenneth Kaunda  for their wisdom and their determination to secure African liberation. The pooling of our resources within the framework of a permanent tripartite conference  will  I am sure  allow the creation of an axis of dissuasion  Kinshasa-Lusaka-Dar-es-Salaarn. All those who love Africa should assist Tanzania  Zambia and Zaire in shouldering their responsibilities.125.	On a number of occasions  particularly in the Lusaka Manifesto   Zaire has joined other African States to convince and persuade the racists of southern Africa to give up their wrong ways  but that attitude of good will has been received with complete contempt.126.	Now that we have achieved political  economic and social stability  we cannot be happy while our brothers of Angola  Mozambique  Zimbabwe  South Africa and Namibia are still languishing under the yoke of the Portuguese colonialists  the British settlers of Rhodesia and the racists of South Africa. Furthermore  Zaire is the link between a number of African countries.' We are surrounded by French-speaking  English- speaking  Portuguese-speaking and Arab-speaking countries.127.	Frantz Fanon used to say that Africa looked like a revolver whose trigger was in Zaire. It is therefore an imperative political duty for Zaire to make its material and military contribution to all its neighbours that are still subjected to colonialism of any sort. The daughters and sons of Zaire have entrusted me with informing this Assembly that as of this moment Zaire as a whole is mobilized to fight against all the racists and colonialists of southern Africa. If we must place our finger on the trigger of the African revolver of Frantz Fanon  Zaire is ready to shoulder all its responsibilities. All countries that call themselves our friends will  I trust  be on our side  and in practical fashion. For as far as we are concerned  passivity in this field is equivalent to complicity.128.	My country is ready to undertake this sacred struggle  whatever may be the sacrifices involved. And we shall never retreat  regardless of what may happen  regardless of what it may cost. The struggle for African liberation also has its moments of satisfaction  and it was with enthusiasm that we welcomed the birth of a new independent State  Guinea-Bissau. Zaire hastens to support the candidacy of that new State for membership in our Organization.129.	It is obvious that Portugal feels that it has been undermined by this new victory for Africa. For  despite its belonging to NATO  despite the quantities of weapons and troops used to keep Guinea-Bissau under its thumb  the daughters and sons of that country have just thrown Portuguese colonialism out of their national territory. Thus any new intervention on the part of Portugal in Guinea-Bissau will have to be considered as aggression  pure and simple  against an independent State.130.	Every continent has its problems  and Africa has its own. It is the situation I have just described to you.131.	But there is another problem also of the greatest interest to our continent  namely the situation in the Middle East. In plain words  it is the Israeli-Arab question that concerns us.132.	The situation prevailing in that part of the world is without doubt the most complex and the most delicate confronting mankind today. To listen to the protagonists  one is tempted to conclude that the point of departure agreed to by all is Security Council resolution 242 (1967). But each of the parties has its own interpretation of that resolution  and in any case no one is implementing it.133.	You may perhaps be wondering where Zaire stands in this matter. In Zaire  before taking any decision  we try to analyse the facts objectively. It seems to us both childish and unrealistic to believe in the myth about throwing the Israeli people into the sea. That people does exist and it has a right to live. But it is also true that the Palestinian people has the same right as the Israeli people  that is  the right to have a homeland and to live in peace. It is therefore inadmissible that the refugees of 1947 should have been displaced to become refugees a second time in 1956 and a third time in 1967. The Jewish people  which suffered under nazism and from all sorts of racism  should understand better than any other people the sufferings of the Palestinian refugees  who for a quarter of a century have been without a homeland.134.	Time and again Israel has called for secure and recognized frontiers. But Israel has never said what they should be. For 1956. replaced 1947  arid 1967 replaced 1956. Perhaps tomorrow other frontiers will be demanded  and for that reason the Arab people believe  in their turn  that they run the risk of being thrown into the sea  only this time it would be the Indian Ocean. In the Middle East there exist three kinds of reflexes: the reflex of fear  for the Israeli people; the reflex of 'despair  for the Palestinian people; and the reflex of humiliation  for the Arab people. That  we believe  is how the problem stands.135.	Lately  when an African country takes a sovereign decision in the Israeli-Arab conflict  the Israeli authorities declare that that decision was dictated purely and simply by the Arab countries; and what is more  that the African leaders were paid for taking such a decision. Such allegations are serious and insulting.136.	Furthermore  we can only be astonished at the visit to Israel just recently made by the Minister of the Interior and for Information of the racist State of South Africa  Mr. Cornelius Mulder. That visit gives us a lot to think about with regard to the orientation of Israel's African policy  and hence  the future of Israel's relations with independent Africa. Zaire  which has now reached the moment when it must choose  must dispel all misunderstanding and remove a certain ambiguity resulting from its African vocation. Zaire has therefore to choose between a friendly country  Israel  and a brother nation  Egypt. But between a friend and a brother the choice is clear  and our decisions are made in full independence and freedom from all pressures.137.	Therefore  by virtue of the prerogatives conferred upon me by article 24 of the Constitution of the Republic of Zaire  I announce to all the world the breaking-off of diplomatic relations with Israel  such severing of relations to continue until Egypt and the other Arab countries involved have recovered their territories at present under occupation.138.	Like the Middle East  concerning which I have just spoken  Asia has for some decades been torn by savage wars. Nevertheless  we are gratified at the development of the situation in Viet-Nam and Laos. And here we must straightforwardly recognize the political courage of the President of the United States of America and his Government in having realized that a military victory was impossible despite the resources being employed.139.	Concerning Cambodia  we believe that what goes for Viet-Nam and Laos also goes for that country. I fervently wish for the people of Cambodia a rapid return to conditions of domestic peace.140.	Regarding the problem of Korea  the Republic of Zaire enjoys excellent relations with both parts of that land  North and South  that share the votes of the Korean people. For this reason  we suggest to all Members of our Organization that they refrain from taking any action that might widen the gulf between the two parties  and that  rather  they help them to pursue the course that they have freely chosen for themselves  namely that leading to reunification. In the meantime  they can be admitted as observers. And if they succeed  as we earnestly hope they will  in reaching unity  we will  needless to say  have a single Korean nation represented here by a single delegation. But if  unfortunately  the goal at present being sought is not reached  then we shall have to bow to the inevitable and admit two delegations  just as we have done in the case of the two Germanys.141.	Zaire believes that the admission of the two Germanys to membership in the United Nations is a contribution to the maintenance of peace in the world.Zaire  therefore  through me  welcomes the presence in this hall of the representatives of those two countries.142.	Turning now to the Conference on Security and Co -operation in Europe  according to information in our possession  that security also concerns the Mediterranean basin. But when we speak of the Mediterranean basin we are also talking about the coastal countries  and this inevitably brings into the work of that Conference our brother countries in Africa  namely  Egypt  Libya  Tunisia  Algeria and Morocco.143.	I would like to say something now concerning some problems very close to us  those involving international economic relations between the rich countries  commonly called the ""developed countries""  and our countries  arbitrarily called the ""countries of the third world"". I am speaking here  of course  as a representative of my country  but also as an African leader and a citizen of what is known as the ""third world"".144.	In Zaire we challenge that term  ""third world""  which to us makes no logical sense. For if what is sought is an economic definition  that is to say  if we talk about a country with a capitalist system  which belongs to one category  and a country with a collectivist system  which belongs to another  that would mean that all the others are neither capitalist nor collectivist. And this is not quite true from the economic point of view  for certain so- called ""third world"" countries have in fact either a capitalist system or a collectivist system. Nor can one justify the term ""third world"" from either a geographical standpoint or a population standpoint  because the ""third world"" does not constitute one third of mankind  but rather two thirds; and that is why we find that the term ""third world"" is accompanied by a feeling of condescension. Consequently  this term is outmoded. For those who invented it  there exists a category of countries known as ""Western"" countries  and others which form the club of what is known as ""the East"". Apart from these  all other countries are pigeonholed under the same label: ""third world"".145.	The element of scorn  of contempt felt by certain colonial countries does not stop there. They began by calling the so-called third world countries ""backward"" countries. The people who coined this word found it too strong themselves and tried to mitigate it by replacing it with the word ""under-developed"". And now  in order to avoid wounding diplomatic sensibilities  we are called ""developing"" countries.146.	In Zaire we wonder exactly what development means. Is it possible to term ""developed countries"" those which possess an impressive number of cars  which build thousands of miles of roads  which pollute the waters  the seas and^ the air? Shall we call ""under-developed countries"" those whose inhabitants are poor — as certainly they are — but which have fewer cases of suicide  fewer murders and fewer disturbed and sadistic people?147.	I must confess that I have never considered Zaire  my country  as under-developed  because my people are disciplined  hard-working  full of dignity and pride  whilethe countries which call themselves ""developed"" are the scene of social disturbances  of strikes. That is why we prefer the term ""equipment"" to that of ""development"". We are quite willing to recognize that we are under- equipped by comparison with other countries  and that is precisely the understanding of the specialists in the Western economy when they are in a mood to face the facts.148.	The United States of America is the leading member of the club of the 10 richest countries of the world and it has proved this by landing the first man on the moon. But it is never said that the other nine members are under-developed by comparison; all that is said — as we say — is that they are under-equipped by comparison with the United States.149.	What I have said proves that the concept of ""developing countries"" is wrong and specious because for each of us there is always someone who is better equipped or worse equipped than himself  and we are all in a perpetual stage of development; that is to say  we are developing. Also  those who call themselves developed should realize that the under-equipped countries have themselves realized their own condition. Indeed  the latter have finally understood that the division of the world is not a function of ideology or a degree of industrialization of the various countries.150.	The world is divided into two camps: the dominators and the dominated  the exploiters and the exploited. The poor countries are not what they are because of . congenital incompetence; they are so because of history which has resulted in certain countries dominating  exploiting and robbing others in order to get rich themselves. It is a matter of mathematical logic: when the rich exploit the poor  the rich become even richer and ^he poor become even poorer.151.	Today it is good publicity to talk of the assistance given by the rich countries to the poor countries. When a rich country gives only one kilo of medicine to a poor country  the press  radio and television are called in  diplomatic speeches are exchanged; some boast of the aid and others give thanks for it. This propaganda has even aroused  among certain theoreticians of rich countries  opposition to assistance to poor countries because they say it is the poor of the rich countries who enrich the rich of the poor countries. Nothing could be less true because  if you take a good look at the situation  you will note that  paradoxically enough  assistance benefits the donor country above all.152.	In fact  what are the forms of assistance? One can distinguish three forms in particular: fellowships for students  assistance in personnel  and financial assistance.153.	When a fellowship is granted to a young student from a poor country  it is spent entirely by the student in the rich country. It may even happen that the scholarship is not sufficient  that the poor country has to provide a supplement; that is to say  in fact  what amounts to a transfer of capital from the poor country to the rich country.154.	The same goes for those who are called technical assistants; their salaries are spent in the country of which they are nationals. In Zaire  for example  we house them  we provide them with transport  we pay their salaries  and we pay for their annual vacations and their return tickets. As for their salaries  half is transferred monthly to their accounts in their home countries. A large proportion of our external payments is made up of transfers of salaries from expatriate workers. Again in the case of Zaire  every year we have to grant a sum of $40 million for salary transfers for technical assistants.155.	Reference is often made to financial assistance  but if one takes a close look at that too  it will be seen that the credits of the donor countries are accompanied by conditions with regard to the provision of equipment and by exorbitant interest rates and very short repayment periods. Furthermore  they remain in the vaults of the banks of the rich countries  and the beneficiary countries do not receive a single cent to spend at home. So it is actually as if the poor country were financed without actually benefiting from this financial assistance. It might be said — to use the language of financiers — that what we have here is a kind of self-financing of the rich countries.156.	Furthermore  my country transfers annually to the former metropolitan country  as payment for services and in dividends of the private companies established in our country  a sum which ranges from $300 million to $350 million. And that is why I am wondering who is helping whom. I am convinced that in this particular field we are not really speaking the same language.157.	That is why  if the rich countries really want to help the poor countries  they must protect them from credit facilities  research departments and international experts. Let me explain. At the drop of a hat  unscrupulous merchants in the West offer us all kinds of credit facilities. They may sell us paper  cigarettes  water  even air  on what they call easy terms  without taking account of the way in which this causes our external indebtedness to deteriorate.158.	The rich countries should not be concerned only with assisting their industries to export on any terms whatsoever  but should also take account of the financial situation of the importing countries.159.	I have just said that we in Zaire prefer the term ""equipment"" to that of ""development""  and there is ho disgrace in recognizing that we are behind in .terms of equipment in comparison with many countries in the world. This is the result primarily of a lack of sufficient skilled manpower. This lack has given rise to a category of individuals known as experts. These experts should come to do a precise kind of work and for a limited time  until their counterparts have been trained. But what we very often see  unfortunately  is that  instead of considering themselves transient elements  they cling to their jobs  working in ivory towers and hiding their files so that they will always be needed.160.	As to the research departments  they are rather like the tongue of Aesop: the best and the worst of things. While it is true that a good research department can carry out a useful survey for the country  it is also true  unfortunately  that often a research department does not work towards the solution of a problem  but rather to identify many problems which give rise to new surveys. Many research departments are therefore not really doing their proper work — that is  solving a problem —  but  rather  are working to create new markets.161.	If I criticize the organization of technical assistance  it is not just for the sake of doing so  and it does not mean that I am not sincerely grateful to all those who have helped my country to overcome its difficulties  but because I consider there are other ways which are more disinterested and more effective.162.	Take  for example  co-operation between China and Zaire. Since the month of January this year  Zaire has been the scene of a unique experiment in the field of co-operation: that is  the assistance given by China to my country. The Chinese technical assistants in our country receive no air tickets from us and they transfer no salaries to their home country. The Chinese experts adopt the same way of life as their Zaire counterparts. The Chinese moves about  lives and eats exactly as does his Zaire counterpart. In the field of financial assistance  China has made us a large loan on a very long term and without interest. This  in my view  is a fine example to follow if you want to help an under-equipped country.163.	We should always have present in our minds the fact that the world is at a cross-roads. It is no longer divided by ideology  nor even all that much by race or by political geography  but by economics  and this is the real essence of the question of relations among the peoples of the world today.164.	More than once the poor countries have uttered cries of alarm  asking the rich countries to understand their precarious situation in the economic world today. The last summit meeting of non-aligned countries in Algiers   whose report will be given from this rostrum by the current President  Mr. Boumediene of Algeria  stressed unequivocally the danger of allowing such a situation of flagrant injustice to persist.165.	More than once we have denounced the scandalous deterioration of the terms of trade  and certain theoreticians of the West  in order to ease their consciences  have attempted to demonstrate that the quality of manufactured products has improved while primary commodities have remained the same  and that hence it is logical for manufactured products to cost more than primary commodities. Such theoreticians have demonstrated obvious bad faith. For example  when you are making up a menu  you may have meat  vegetables  fruit  coffee and tea. Now you may think that those products have not changed much over the years  but the prices of the products of the rich countries — meat  for example — have soared upwards  while coffee and tea remain subject to permanent fluctuations. Rubber  which we produce  costs less than it cost 2*0 years ago  while thetires that we buy have constantly gone up in price. The petroleum produced by the under-equipped countries is cheaper than the mineral water produced by the equipped countries.166.	The consequence of all this is the appreciable improvement in the standard of living of the equipped countries  to the detriment of the under-equipped countries. As an example  the peasants of the Kivu mountains  who grow tea  are always barefoot  while the management of Lipton  which markets the Zaire tea  lounge about in the finest mansions of the world.167.	I think that this injustice stems from the fact that the rich countries are at the same time judges and litigants  because it is they and they alone who set the prices for our primary commodities and the prices of their manufactured products.168.	This situation is often aggravated by the policy of the large multinational companies which  when they invest in a country  take no interest in that country but simply in their profits; and when those companies come to us they do not create a new company  but a tenth or a hundredth or even a thousandth branch. The host country therefore becomes a simple pawn at the mercy of the might and power of a given multinational company.169.	The problem of the poor countries is merely a reflection on a world scale of the problems which exist on the national level. Thus  the workers and peasants are often in revolt in the rich countries  and the leaders of those countries find this quite normal; whereas our revolt  just as legitimate  is passed off as obliviousness  demagogy and political instability.170.	It is quite wrong  therefore  to believe that the assistance of the rich countries has the result that the poor of the rich countries enrich the rich of the poor countries. I believe that you will come to the same conclusion as I  after what I have just explained: that it is the poor of the poor countries who enrich the rich of the rich countries.171.	It is time  in my humble judgement  to think of true solidarity and of assistance on the world level. Assistance must be genuine and not a matter of publicity. In Africa  primarily in Zaire  when you help someone you should do it with discretion. You must be sensitive to the dignity of the recipient  because any assistance which humiliates the recipient is never appreciated. Assistance must be deep- seated and not simply a passing matter.172.	The drought which has afflicted the Sahelian countries in Africa has certainly led to some bursts of generosity. Food parcels have been sent — but I have not heard of a single rich country which has decided to make a gift of those countries' debts to it. That would be true aid.173.	I would request this great Assembly to adopt a resolution requesting the rich countries to remit the debts of the drought-stricken African countries because the scourge of the drought has only served to aggravate their already precarious situation. Let us not forget that several of those countries have the sad privilege of being among the poorest countries of the world  a fact recognized by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.174.	B»'t assistance should not only be the business of certain rich countries vis-à-vis all poor countries. In my view  we must all help each other. A poor country always can find another country poorer than itself that it can help  and it is not impossible that in the rich countries there are poor people who are even poorer than the poor people of the poor countries. They also need everyone's help.175.	That is why it is time to talk of world solidarity. All countries must participate in aid  everyone giving to those more unfortunate than himself some assistance which comes from his heart. That is what we intend to do in Zaire  because everything we do is without publicity  without conditions  without calculation and without ulterior motives.176.	Among the claims of the under-equipped countries  particularly the former colonial countries  there is a matter of vital importance. This relates to the cultural heritage of our countries. During the colonial period we suffered not only from colonialism ' slavery  economic exploitation  but also and above all from the barbarous  systematic pillaging of all our works of art. In this way the rich countries appropriated our best  our unique works of art  and we are therefore poor not only economically but also culturally.177.	Those works of art  which are to be found in the museums of the rich countries  are not our primary commodities but the finished products of our ancestors. Those works  which were acquired for nothing  have increased in value so much that none of our countries has the material means to recover them.178.	What I am telling you is fundamental  because every rich country  even if it does not possess all the masterpieces of its best artists  has at least the bulk of them. Thus  Italy has those of Michelangelo; France  of Renoir; Belgium  of Rubens; and Holland  of Rembrandt and Vermeer. Another circumstance which demonstrates that what I am saying is right is that Hitler pillaged the Louvre during the Second World War and took away the magnificent works of art which were there. When liberation came  even before thinking of signing the armistice France did everything in its power to recover its art objects  and that is quite right. That is why I would also ask this General Assembly to adopt a resolution requesting the rich Powers which possess works of art of the poor countries to restore some of them so that we can teach our children and our grandchildren the history of their countries.179.	I believe also that it is my duty to draw the attention of this august Assembly to the collective responsibility of the human race. All leaders are responsible not only to their own nationals but also to all their fellow-men. Indeed  it is no longer enough to sweep the street outside your own house to have done your proper duty; you also have to see if your neighbour has done the same as you and particularly if he is not passing over to you the dirt in his own household.180.	Now the whole world is talking of the disappearance of the human race because of the pollution in all environments. The misfortune in such cases is that we are witnessing a true inflation of texts and books which  in their desire to draw attention  in fact do the opposite.181.	Without any doubt  it is a matter of prestige to possess the atomic bomb or even better the thermonuclear bomb; but to make it operational  and particularly to miniaturize it  you obviously have to carry out tests  and that is not always convenient. We condemn all nuclear tests wherever they take place and we do not condemn any one country more than another. In this particular area  we do not agree with the atomic countries which are asking all others to ratify Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex]. For our part  we have ratified it with enthusiasm; yet  we do not manufacture bombs or even bullets. But the countries concerned are telling us every day about the invention of evermore sophisticated weapons. Now what is responsible about that?182.	In Zaire we are flattered when we are considered the champions of the conservation of nature. But what is the use of this national effort if our efforts are cancelled out by people thousands of kilometres away from us. That is why we had no hesitation in paying our contribution — sizable when compared to our means — to the United Nations Environment Programme.183.	I propose to you that the United Nations sponsor a world study to identify all forms of pollution and ways of fighting them. This study should logically be financed by the rich countries  not just because they can afford to do so but particularly because they are the principal polluters.184.	If I have primarily addressed myself to the so- called developed countries  it is because we  who must endure the backlash of what they do  have to cry out loudly in order to be heard. But it is my duty to level some criticism also at the so-called third world countries  which is in fact tantamount to a kind of self-criticism.185.	It is not enough just to condemn colonialism  imperialism and racism; it is important too to ""measure our strengths and weaknesses and to unite in fighting the battle of development. If Africa were really united  there would no longer be any racists in Africa  there would no longer be any British colonialists to massacre our brothers in Zimbabwe  there would no longer be any Portuguese colonialists to enslave our brothers in Angola  Mozambique and the Cape Verde Islands.186.	If the Arabs were also united  they would force the great Powers to impose a just solution in the Middle East.187. A few examples will suffice to illustrate the lack of unity among the under-equipped countries.188.	As long as telephone communications and air links between our different States still pass through the former metropolitan  making them even richer  we cannot talk of harmonious development. As long as trade among our States remains haphazard because we produce the same products and compete with each other in the markets of rich countries  we shall always be playing into their hands and enslaving ourselves. As long as those of the so-called third world countries which are rich  particularly those which are petroleum producers  while complaining of the exploitation of the industrialized countries  let their savings rot in Western banks  our development will always be in jeopardy.189.	That is why I utter a warning that we should all forget our small rivalries and our petty sordid interests in order to constitute among ourselves  in harmony  a great force  not a force against the East and the West but a force which would enable us to sit down and talk as equal partners with both sides. Furthermore  we have a real advantage by comparison with the rich countries because they have made mistakes which we can avoid  and that is particularly the case with the conservation of the environment  water pollution  urban concentrations  noise pollution and all the unpleasant aspects of modern life. And if the economists of the equipped countries were sincere  they would confess that our populations in the countryside incontestably possess the greatest riches  and ones they themselves do not possess — calm and quiet.190.	Moreover  there is a difference  in our view  between poverty and wretchedness. We are called ""poor countries"" because some of our compatriots go barefoot  do not wear many clothes and sleep in rudimentary dwellings. But the modern life of the sophisticated countries shows that millionaires leave their Cadillacs in garages and make long journeys to our countries precisely to walk barefoot  sleep under the stars and sunbathe. No doubt  what they are looking for is natural happiness and a genuine joie de vivre. Does that mean that one has to be rich to be able to afford to live like a poor African?191.	Our world  which thanks to evolution has become small  is ceaselessly undergoing rapid transformations  which make imperative an adaptation of mental attitudes. At the national level  each State is adapting itself to modern developments by all kinds of decrees taken as the days pass. What is true for each of our States should be all the more so for the United Nations itself. Our Organization  which has now survived for 28 years  has not evolved much  although the circumstances obtaining at its creation have changed entirely.192.	The Powers which at Yalta imposed their hegemony on the world — just as the Powers did in 1885 and were able at their whim to carve up Africa into a thousand pieces — proceeded from hot war to cold war  one side fearing the capitalist danger and the other the Communist danger.193. Today peaceful coexistence has become a reality and the circumstances prevailing at the time of the drafting of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco have changed  and there is no longer any reason for the great Powers of 1945 to be the only permanent members of the Security Council  alone possessing the right of veto. We cannot understand how  28 years after the war  Europe should be represented by three countries with the right of veto  Asia by a single country with the right of veto and the American continent by a single country also with the right of veto. The maintenance of peace is no longer the monopoly of a few privileged States but rather the business of everyone.194.	The defeated countries of yesterday — Japan  Italy and the two Germanys — have since then acquired economic  political  demographic and cultural power which it would be ridiculous to ignore. The United Nations has gone from 45 Members at its founding to 135 today. The African continent  which in 1945 was nothing but a mass of colonies with no say in matters  now numbers 41 independent countries  or nearly one-third of the entire membership of our Organization.195.	And that is why logic  justice and equity dictate  among other things  the permanent presence of the African continent in the Security Council. A thorough review -f the Charter of the United Nations is long overdue  otherwise we ourselves would be guilty of institutionalizing imperialism.196.	In conclusion  I should like to sum up. I have spoken at length of Africa to denounce two scourges which no longer exist anywhere except in that continent: colonialism and racism. The situation in the Portuguese colonies amounts to racism of white against black. The injustices of the British settlers in Rhodesia against the Zimbabwe patriots is the domination of the black by the white. Apartheid in South Africa and the problem of Namibia also represent contempt for the black by the white.197.	We can no longer accept a situation where throughout the world all races are free except the black race of Africa. And that is why we are determined to do everything in our power to change this state of affairs. The domination and exploitation of the black on the soil of its ancestors by the white foreigner must cease.198.	I have tried to analyse the situation in the Middle East and I have concluded that true friendship consists in telling the truth. Zaire supports the right of the Israeli people ""to existence and peace  but we can find no justification for the occupation of Arab territories by Israel.199.	I have noted a favourable development towards peace in Indo-China  and all the Members of this Organization should support the strengthening of that peace. It is urgent that the Member States concerned by the civil war in Cambodia should help to restore peace in that country.200.	With regard to the Korean problem  I have proposed a solution which would promote the unification sought at present by the two parties. In the initial phase  it would be a matter of admitting the two entities as observers until a favourable solution is reached which they deem appropriate for the future and the happiness of the Korean people itself.201.	I have denounced the injustices committed by the rich countries against the poor countries  because the former have everything to say and the latter nothing to say. I have stated that we cannot be at the beck and call of the great Powers that flatter racists for the sake of their  alliances.202.	I have suggested a revision of the Charter of the United Nations to adapt it to the present situation in the world  taking into account particularly the representation of the African continent and also the fact that those that were defeated yesterday have  in their turn  become today great Powers  and the decisions of our Organization should be applied by all its Members without differentiation and should not remain a dead letter in this forum. I have also suggested  for humanitarian reasons  that the great Powers should remit the debts of the drought-stricken African countries. I have supported the candidacy of a new African State for membership of the United Nations  namely Guinea Bissau. I have proposed that this august Assembly adopt a resolution requesting the rich countries to return works of art to the countries that have been the victims of expropriation. I have suggested that a study be undertaken  at the expense of the rich countries   determine the causes of the different kinds of pollution in order better to fight this scourge throughout the world.203.	I have pointed out that security in Europe also implies the security of the Mediterranean basin and that it is imperative for the African countries that border on the Mediterranean to be associated in any work affecting that security. They are the fraternal countries of Egypt  Libya  Tunisia  Algeria and Morocco.204.	It will have been noted  I hope  that in Zaire we express ourselves freely and clearly. And I would ask all the friendly countries represented in this hall that may have taken offence at anything I have said to realize that in Zaire our judgement is based on justice alone.205.	Like any other human endeavour  the United Nations is not perfect because of  among other things  all the reasons that I have mentioned. Severe criticism is often levelled at it from many quarters — by some because it does not fully meet their aspirations  and by others because it is not at their beck and call.206.	For our part  without passing any value judgementon the United Nations  —  and we are certainly far from wishing to make an assessment of it here — we do note in Zaire that the achievements of the United Nations are more positive than are its shortcomings. We hope that  thanks to it and through it  we shall be able to do more to promote co-operation among the inhabitants of our planet in the economic  cultural  scientific and technical fields  for the building of a better  fairer and more just world  in absolute respect for the authenticity of everyone.  c"
"23",1461,"COG",28,1973,"﻿86.	Ten years ago  on 2 October 1963  I addressed the United Nations General Assembly for the first time from this samerostrum.5 At that time I had the twofold historic mission of declaring to the world that the Congolese revolution was the expression of the unanimous will of the whole people determined to live free  alone the master of its destiny  and to set forth the views of my Government on the major international problems which divided us and most of which  unfortunately  continue to divide the Members of our Organization.87: Today  returning here  I am happy and proud to say that the Congolese revolution has survived ail the gloomy prophecies. It has indeed just witnessed a rousing celebration of its tenth anniversary. It has overcome the many obstacles which imperialism and internal reaction have placed in its path  and it is doing very well. Its leader  Commandant Marien Ngouabi  is exercising determined and clear-sighted leadership  equalled only by the fierce will of the Congolese people to live free  in peace with everyone.88.	Today I am happy to note that the gross injustice which had long been inflicted upon the People's Republic of China has been redressed and that the great Chinese people is now in a position to place its great wisdom and rich experience at the service of the world and peace  in frank and sincere co-operation  which is a gratification to. us all.89.	Today I welcome with true satisfaction the simultaneous admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic to our Organization. This historic event belies the false theses which had prevailed until last year. I warmly welcome the representatives of those two countries and those of the Bahamas who have just taken their places in this Assembly.90.	Today I note with great pleasure that the Laotian people  who have so long been in the nightmare of war and division  are finally making progress towards a normal existence even though the forces of evil are still striving vainly  to overturn the verdict of history.91.	Today I should like to welcome once again the brilliant victory of the heroic people of Viet-Nam which has been reflected in the signing of the cease-fire agreement at the beginning of this year in Paris.6 It is now for the United Nations to require that this Agreement  which has been constantly breached by the Saigon administration  always encouraged by United States imperialism  should be strictly respected. The Vietnamese people is entitled  like all the other peoples of the world  to a free existence  a normal life and institutions of its own choosing.92.	Unfortunately  hardly did the flames of war in VietNam die down than United States imperialism lit another fire in Cambodia. But there again  under the enlightened leadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  the valiant Khmer people are every day giving proof that traitors to the motherland will only have meted out to them  when the time comes  the punishment they deserve. The representatives here in this Assembly know very well that the United National Front of Kampuchea controls nine-tenths of Cambodian territory.93.	They also know that the fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which has just been held in Algiers  took an historic step when it demanded that the rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia  headed by Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  should be restored in the United Nations and in the other international organizations and that that Government should be recognized as the legitimate government representing the people of Cambodia. The People's Republic of the Congo entirely approves this action  and the United Nations should see to it that it is actually brought about  because this alone will make it possible to restore peace in that part of Asia.94.	Still in Asia  the situation in Korea is slow in developing. We certainly do not want the fragments of this mosaic to prevent us from identifying the problem in its totality. Without any doubt the status of observer  after a laborious and arduous quest  has just been granted to North Korea; but the duty of the Organization is to help this country  which has suffered so cruelly from foreign interventions in its political life  to bring about its reunification by peaceful means  free from any external influence.95.	Today something that is even more tragic — Israel also is stubbornly rejecting the verdict of history. This stubbornness led in 1967 to the situation of which we are well aware  which itself has just given rise to serious developments in the Middle East less than a week ago. We do not want to address ourselves to a country which has systematically refused to comply with the unanimous will of the international community. We would rather say to those who support the Zionist and expansionist State of Israel that it is certainly high time for them to revise their calculations  because tomorrow it will no doubt be Israel itself that will reproach them for having imprisoned it in illusions which today are more than outmoded. We would also like to ask the fraternal Arab countries if it is not time to forget the things which may divide them and to combine their efforts against an enemy which is humiliating the whole Arab nation and which defies us all.Ct;96.	Many countries of the third world have already realized the danger represented by the expansionist and arrogant policy of Israel and are ending their relations with the Zionist State  thus heeding the appeal of our Arab brothers who consider  quite rightly  that this is the least they could do. We would like to hope that the neighbouring countries in the combat zone will understand that the time has come for them  too  to meet all their responsibilities and to provide Egypt and Syria  which have been the victims of aggression  with the concrete assistance which they need so much at the present time.97.	The People's Republic of the Congo  for its part faithful to the fundamental principles of its policy  has broken off all relations with Israel  without any pressure whatsoever from any source and without any kind of calculation. We are side by side with the valiant people of Palestine who are waging their struggle  and we fully support the fraternal countries of Egypt and Syria that are fighting so bravely for the restoration of their territorial integrity  because  for us  one of the most intolerable and inadmissible principles of our time will remain the acquisition of territory by force  which is after all nothing but a modern form of colonization. And the question of colonization brings us quite naturally to Africa.98.	Colonization is  of course  an historical phenomenon  which is in no way justified and which nothing could ever justify. Consequently  it is a phenomenon which is reprehensible at any time and at all times. But colonization is also a fact of history. It is because we are faced with a fact of history that you will understand that in this particular area President Marien Ngouabi will of course be attaching much more importance to what is happening than to what has happened.99.	What is happening is that the former colonial Powers  in their anxiety to preserve their unjustly acquired advantages  are perpetuating in the most subtle ways their domination over the new independent States.100.	What also is happening is that the great Powers  influenced by their selfish narrow interests  want to make satellites of the small countries.101.	What we are faced with in each case is neo-colonialism  which is as inhumane  reprehensible and worthy of contempt as colonialism.102.	What is happening also is that in spite of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  which will soon be 13 years old  colonies in Africa still survive — the list of them has often been enumerated here and this makes it unnecessary for us to repeat it. The country which is persisting in perpetuating this phenomenon is sufficiently well known to you to make it unnecessary for us to name it here.103.	We of the People's Republic of the Congo are not racists and we hope that we will never have to respond to abominable acts of racism with other acts of racism  equally detestable. But we are also aware that patience has its limits  and that is why it is urgent for the international community to call upon this small country  and particularly those who would support  it  to rally to the side of history before seriously jeopardizing the chances of mankind of living in perfect harmony without distinction of race or religion.104.	The methods pursued by the last of the colonizers in Africa are well known to us all. The panoply of them has just been added to by individual attempts on individual persons  as for example  the cowardly assassinations of illustrious sons of Africa  such as Edwardo Mondlane and Amilcar Cabral. These assassinations have only served to strengthen the scorn and the hatred of the whole of Africa and have also strengthened the determination of freedom fighters in their struggle.105.	The Assembly knows the daily tragedy afflicting the people of the territories under colonial domination.. There are numerous documents relating to them which are available to each of our delegations. The massacres in Mozambique have been described in the smallest detail by Mr. Marcelino dos Santos and the Reverend Hastings. The forced systematic exploitation of the riches of Angola is well known to us all. I have quite deliberately brought these two aspects together to show with what cruelty and what cynicism colonialism is striving to destroy  in the countries which it dominates  the two essential elements in the life of a nation: man and nature.106.	Hence  my Government feels that the best thought- out and the most sincere speeches will do nothing to change the situation. It is acts which are necessary. The opportunity is unique. It has just been offered to us by Guinea-Bissau. The country of Amilcar Cabral has just won a victory over the oppressor  a striking victory which we must not only welcome  but which we must do everything we can to strengthen. If the United Nations really wishes decolonization in accordance with its own Charter  Guinea-Bissau should be immediately admitted to membership and should take its place here without debate  because I do not think there is any Member country which has received any mandate from the people of Guinea-Bissau to represent them here. Such a decision  while it would be strictly in keeping with the principles of the Charter and would fall squarely within the framework of the objectives of the Organization  would be a great incentive to the fighters of Angola and Mozambique  and a serious warning to the racists of Rhodesia and South Africa.107.	With regard to the situation in Rhodesia and Namibia  with regard to the policy of apartheid in South Africa  nothing remains to be said  and it is possibly only the way of saying it which has changed. It is for this reason that  here too  my Government considers that the United Nations should take concrete action and Request the Western Powers to choose between their selfish interests and those of the whole international community.108.	May I be permitted  from this rostrum  to assure once again the peoples of Palestine. Guinea-Bissau  Angola  Mozambique and all those waging an armed struggle  of the total and unconditional support of the Congolese people. We support them because the causes for which they are fighting are just and because there is no peace without justice  even if there is detente.109.	We are in fact going through a very exalting stage where the acceleration of history makes it possible for us to note  every day  appreciable changes in the world panorama. A decade of ideological confrontations dominated by the snows of the cold war is now being succeeded  we are told with tranquil assurance  by a so-called phase of political realism and international detente. My country  like many other third-world countries  can only welcome the advent of this new era  this golden age which we are promised; because we need peace to build in our own countries a society of prosperity and dignity and to deal more effectively with the thorny problems of the well-being of our working masses. But in truth  can there really be peace without freedom? My delegation would like to invite everyone  without futile emotion or passion  without demagogy  but in all objectivity  to reflect on this concept of detente which  if it is historically justified  must nevertheless be given a more real content  if we want to increase its credibility among the disinherited of the earth even a little. The twenty-eighth session has been placed by many speakers within a general framework of detente. Detente appears to be the watchword which is to inspire all of our delegations throughout our work. I am among those who find it repugnant to use this rostrum for sterile polemics. But  as I have stressed earlier  good sense should be based on the inspiration of actual facts which occur every day in order to shed the proper light on this notion of detente to which the peace-loving peoples of the world so legitimately aspire. This concept of detente  which has been widely canvassed and which  if we are to believe the acclamations accompanying its birth  has no enemy  is liable to remain a useless instrument of analysis if it is reduced to the role of being the privilege of a minority of the all-powerful and becomes deflected from its supreme objective  which is to strengthen the common wish of people to organize the live forces of our planet to serve understanding  friendship  justice  peace and the progress of humanity without any discrimination. In any case  imposed from the summit of the pyramid without taking the least account of other elements which nevertheless constitute the key to the explanation of the international situation  detente runs the serious risk of having a brief and tragic career because in our world today it is no longer possible to pretend to ignore in the international arena the long-exploited and scorned third world.110.	I am aware that my purpose may seem to be at variance with a certain uniformity which has been maintained by our culpable passivity  but we all know the evil consequences that may develop from a vacuum ascribable to a lack of perspicacity and the indecision of peaceful peoples. It is therefore more necessary than ever now for all nations to give their support to the policy of detente whose outlines and content should be clearly defined here so as to avoid reducing the United Nations to the humiliating role of a distant and scorned witness. We will gain nothing from closing our eyes to the brutal realities which constitute  unfortunately — and will for a long time to come — the backdrop of our world. For us  true political realism is that which has as its purpose fighting imperialism and its acolytes and which consists of unequivocally supporting the restoration of sovereign rights and self-government for the benefit of all countries  and in particular for the countries which are still groaning under the yoke of colonialism and racism; political realism that would be worthy of proper attention is that which would include in its programme in golden letters the right of peoples to dispose of their own resources  to decide on their own destiny  the inalienable right of peoples to have the regime of their choice and to determine in all freedom what their alliances will be.111.	The concept of detente makes it very natural for us to think of peace  and of war too. And as representatives know  in our day war is waged with ever-more murderous weapons  ever-more sophisticated weapons  which the under-equipped countries do not possess — fortunately  or unfortunately perhaps — and which they will probably never need if the great Powers were a little more sincere and had more good faith in their intentions. What we want is that people should be clearer when they speak of disarmament. In our view  the countries which have for so long been oppressed and exploited and are once again today exposed to all kinds of interference and aggression have the right to defend themselves.112.	If a franker dialogue could take place on the subject of detente and disarmament  perhaps we would then be able to take a big step towards the indispensable democratization of international relations. Indeed  it is becoming ever more intolerable that important problems  which may affect the very life of our Organization and the future of mankind  should continue to be the subject  or a kind of preserve  of the club of the all-powerful.113.	The Organization's Charter should be revised and adapted to new conditions  because we believe most sincerely that the right of veto  for example  has become an anachronism and should disappear.114.	It is also urgent to have redefinition of relations among States to put an end to external intervention  which is ever-more open and arrogant  in the internal affairs of young nations. Every country has the right to be free  to conceive and to execute its own policy.115.	As was proclaimed by the Algiers Conference  the sovereignty of States over their natural resources should become an inalienable principle for everyone. This problem leads us to consider the situation — which we would have preferred not to mention — which was created in Chile by the reactionary coup d'etat of 11 September 1973. We condemn most vigorously — and representatives no doubt have sensed this throughout our statement — any intervention in the internal affairs of other countries. And we would have said nothing about the events in Chile if — as was so well understood by the fourth non-aligned Conference in Algiers — what was under preparation in Santiago and which led to the cowardly assassination of President Salvador Allende was not considered by the third world as a vast plot against us all. President Allende  who was constitutionally elected  scrupulously respected the institutions and democratic practices to which his people were so profoundly attached. His crime  his only crime  was to have tried to restore to the Chileans that which the multinational companies had taken from them.116.	Today  while abominable genocide is being organized in Chile  while duly accredited diplomats to that country have seen their immunity grossly violated  and while the democracy so dear to the Chilean people is becoming every day more and more a shadow of its former self  the world of the United Nations is leaning back and reclining in its'-intellectual comfort. Here  again  the last word belongs to history.117.	It is quite deliberate that in our statement we shall not go into any details about economic problems. That would have made it necessary for you to listen to yet one more speech that would serve no purpose  particularly because it is now clearly established that in order to become equipped the developing countries must  above all  rely on themselves. I will simply say that the policy of charity must give way to freely agreed co-operation  which should be to the mutual benefit of the contracting parties. We — the small countries  in particular — should in the problems of development  work for the strengthening of the United Nations  especially of its specialized agencies  whose efforts  despite their limited resources  have just so felicitously added themselves to our own action.118.	Those were the thoughts which Commandant Marien Ngouabi  President of the Central Committee of the Congolese Labour Party  President of the People's Republic of the Congo  asked me to submit to this august Assembly over which you  Sir  are presiding today.119.	We hope that the delegations here will benefit from your eminent qualities as a jurist and a humanist  your valuable and long experience in the service of the international community  so as to ensure that the work of this twenty-eighth session will be the great success that the whole world expects it to be.120.	We are convinced that  like your predecessor Minister Trepczynski — to whom we pay a cordial tribute here —  and like our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose devotion to the cause of peace is beyond all praise  you will spare no effort to encourage the States Members of this Organization  which have wandered into paths to which they have been led by their selfish  sordid and outmoded interests  to reconcile themselves with history  a history which no reasonable nation has the right to oppose eternally."
"24",1508,"COL",28,1973,"﻿121.	On behalf of my delegation  I should like to greet the Secretary-General of the United Nations ' Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who this year made an extremely important and fruitful visit to Latin America when the Security Council held its meetings in Panama. His words on that memorable occasion  were heard with immense satisfaction since they bespoke the intention of the United Nations to deal with the political and economic problems of the developing countries. During his stay in the capital of my own country  we expressed our thanks to him personally.122.	With the very deepest feelings of sincere friendship  I should like to congratulate the President of this session of the General Assembly  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  who has for so many years outstandingly and effectively represented in this Organization a nation friendly to Colombia. We are truly gratified by this well-earned election  which honours a Latin American personality and a country with an admirable international tradition. Our President  who knows the United Nations well  will at all times be the impartial leader of our debates.123.	In this introduction to my statement  may I refer to a great Colombian who died this morning  Eduardo Zuleta Angel  an eminent jurist who  in 1946  presided over the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations. He played an important part in the drafting of the Charter in San Francisco. For my country and for the world Organization  this is an irreparable loss  which we mourn deeply.124.	I must also speak with sadness of the death of two other important personalities  the President of Chile  Salvador Allende  and the poet of America  Pablo Neruda. Allende was a leader with whom we were linked by friendship  and Neruda was an intellectual of great international standing.125.	History is a constant process of correction and innovation  and no one today will challenge the fact that we stand on the threshold of a new era in international relations which bears the sign of a spiritual  political and economic convergence of continents.126.	Thanks to the extraordinary means of social communication provided by scientific and technical progress  countries feel more closely united precisely because they are more directly connected. Intercontinental distances have been shrunk by supersonic planes  and images are projected from one end of the world to the other in fractions of a second. This same inner inspection of the earth and its latent wealth is being pressed forward from a space laboratory with a meticulous precision undreamed of by scientists 20 years ago.j 27. Globalism - that trend towards universal convergence-leaves far behind the stances and the alliances of the period following the Second World War  when we saw taking root the bipolar system of power distribution of the world  with its sequel of grim and intense rivalries between the great Powers that headed the two confronting camps  the United States and the Soviet Union. In fact  occasions were not lacking when that very confrontation spelled a dangerous approach to the edge where an atomic holocaust could take place  and there were times when the United Nations itself was felt to be unreal.128.	Armageddon in the twentieth century would be brought about by the two opposing blocs resorting to their respective atomic arsenals. But  fortunately  for mankind  that terrifying apocalyptic spectre has been dissipated by the emergence of a new period  one of an interrelationship among differing political and ideological systems  an interweaving of the great Powers  and an arrival at joint agreements for their mutual benefit in the economic field and in trade.129.	Beyond the policy of confrontation and the bipolar system lies a period of globalism  a system truly planetary in its dimensions and political  economic and social scope. But without being carried away by optimism we can assert that this new era of world co-operation is characterized by the following features: first  wide international co-operation among all countries; secondly  peace-as the target of international policy and action--more deeply felt and more arduously won; thirdly  the end of colonialism and the repudiation of racial discriminations as outmoded institutions not in keeping with the dignity of the subjected peoples; fourthly  international law as the equally global concept of international relations and the reflection of a gamut of concerns going from the good behaviour of States to the problems of outer space  the sea-bed and the ecology of continents and fifthly  economic and social justice as the necessary premise for the new ordering of international trade  the international distribution of labour and the monetary system.130.	Thus the assumption of membership in the United Nations by so many new States of Africa and Asia that have achieved their independence is a clear index of that universality that imbues our debates. Gradually a multipolar system has been developing that allows for the distribution of international competences among a larger number of sovereign States and replaces the erstwhile division of the international order among confronting blocs. And the symptoms of globalism multiply. The problems of the sea-bed  the ocean floor and outer space are discussed. Ecology has made its debut among the list of contemporary issues. Over 130 nations now participate in our work and technological and industrial progress is not confined to a single continent but has moved to the Far East-to Japan  whose rebirth is so gratifying to us.131.	The presence of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations has revitalized our Organization by the addition of a nation that is among the most densely populated in the world  while the admission to our midst of the two Germanys and of a newly-created American State  the Commonwealth of the Bahamas-which we welcome with such pleasure-puts an effective end to a history of rivalries and animosities and is a decisive step towards international rapprochement.132.	Without denying that these positive results have been obtained by dint of a direct understanding among the great Powers-primarily the United States  the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China-we wonder whether we are not at present witnessing a return to the formulas of the balance of power that were so typical of European international politics of the nineteenth century and the days of Prince Metternich.133.	Our concern lies not in the existence of a system of balances and counterbalances among the great Powers-or in the fact that such a system ushers in an era of useful trade and financial exchanges; for we cannot deny the meaning of history based on what we have called ""ideological pluralism""  namely  the coexistence of different systems within the framework of international co-operation and mutual respect for the sovereignty and self-determination of peoples.134.	We merely point out that that very balance of power is achieved by agreements concluded on the fringe of the United Nations and is creating a special system of relations among a privileged group of States-a group that is governed by principles and goals that differ from those of the United Nations. The division of the world into great power blocs on the one hand and the rest of the nations on the other is a fact of contemporary life but it nevertheless shatters international solidarity.135.	This might well be the appropriate moment to state that never before has the need-and perhaps the urgency - been more clearly seen of setting in effective motion the machinery and the processes of the United Nations.136.	The United Nations is the immense arena for the convergence of all peoples of the earth. The Charter of the world Organization not only possesses specific juridical values embodied in a series of commitments on the part of all its Members to abide by certain obligations and enjoy certain rights; it not only represents the duty of resorting to juridical processes in the settlement of international disputes. but it also carries an effective political value.137.	The Charter of the United Nations must always be interpreted juridically and politically. It contains as much of law as it does of politics. It is far from being a mere collection of guiding principles and procedures; it also contains a variety of compromise formulas for the adoption of new attitudes in keeping with the circumstances of history that is passing through what one Latin American author has termed ""the commonplace of revolution"".138.	The Charter of the United Nations and its principal organs- the Security Council and the General Assembly- must be resorted to constantly in the shaping of the framework for international relations. The very play of balances among the great Powers must have the purpose of ensuring the improved functioning of the United Nations.139.	Globalism  internationalism. United Nations: surely these are synonyms. Exclusivism  political separatism  the forgetting of the developing countries: surely these are contradictions of the history we are now living. Prince Metternich ought not to be revived; he should be surpassed.140.	In fact  our day calls for the closest association among all continents  among ail peoples  among all races.141.	The primary condition for the new order of peace to become a reality lies in the overriding need for the non-proliferation of nuclear arms. Along these lines  Latin America pointed the way with the 1967 Treaty of Tlatelolco on the prohibition of nuclear weapons in the hemisphere  as did the United Nations in 1968  when the General Assembly adopted the important measure of recommending to States the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. That Treaty and the Moscow Treaty of 1963 which prohibits all nuclear tests in the atmosphere or in any environment that might cause radioactive contamination were the first steps taken along the road to general and complete disarmament precisely for the purpose of strengthening the new world order. The so-called test-ban Treaty-though it be limited in scope- is nevertheless the indispensable prelude to the creation of what U Thant referred to in 1963 as a better awareness of the need at least to limit the manufacture of devices for mass destruction.142.	It is for those reasons that this year Colombia repeated its protests against the atomic tests carried out in the Mururoa Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. We did so standing together with the members of the Andean Pact  namely  Bolivia  Chile  Ecuador  Peru and Venezuela. We did so because  apart from the knowledge of the dangerous effects on the ecology of the seas and oceans of such tests  there was the matter of principle dictating that we take up the international work of disarmament without delay..143.	The 1967 report of a group of consultant experts  in response to General Assembly resolution 2162 A (XXI) of 5 December 1966 on the effects of the possible use of nuclear weapons and on the implications for States of the acquisition and further development of these weapons  set forth among other conclusions that an atmospheric explosion of a device at a height of less than 100 000 feet produces an energy discharge of 50 per cent-heat radiation of 35 per cent  and radioactive discharge of 15 per cent. One third of these radiations is produced within the first minute of the explosion  and the radioactive effects are carried by the atmosphere over great distances.144.	In the case at issue there was also a formal judgement handed down by the International Court of Justice at the request of Australia and New Zealand  and our deepest hope is to see the highest court of the United Nations fully respected by the Member States when it intervenes in matters of peace. There can be no other way of establishing an order of law in the world but by seeking the non- proliferation of atomic arms.145.	We are deeply convinced of the primacy of international law and of the fundamental role of the International Court of Justice as the authorized interpreter of the commitments assumed by States Member's of the United Nations.146.	The report of the Group of Consultant Experts on the Economic and Social Consequences of the Arms Race and Military Expenditure nominated by the Secretary- General pursuant to resolution 2667 (XXV) of the 1970 session of the General Assembly  contains statistics of the problem that are truly alarming.147.	By the end of the decade of the 1970s the level of total arms expenditure rose beyond S200 000 million a year  and  as the experts point out  those military expenditures were two and a half times greater than the entire amount allocated by Governments to health programmes  one and a half times greater than the amount devoted to education  and 30 times greater than the total of the official economic assistance given by the developed countries to the developing nations. 148.	Mankind must think carefully whether this colossal squandering of wealth is justified or not. The large-scale manufacture of multiple independent re-entry vehicles has been perfected. These can be launched against a number of targets simultaneously and can  in one launching  wipe out antiballistic missiles. So  therefore  we ask ourselves  how far will this frenzied race of man towards his own destruction take us? For the developing countries a modern supersonic fighter-plane represents 10 times the cost of the machine 10 years ago and requires a far more highly sophisticated and complex control system than that used until 1945.149.	The same can be safely said of the other modern weaponry. It is true that part of that expenditure is laid out for scientific research  but it is no less obvious that a greater transfer of resources for the improvement of the health  education and nutritional possibilities of mankind would help to dispel the demographic problems that seem insoluble today. Nor should we lose sight of the fact that the Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade called for a 6 per cent rate of growth and an increase in domestic savings to reach the 20 per cent level by 1980. Yet how can these levels be reached if the arms race continues in the world.150.	Therefore  the Second United Nations Development Decade hinges on disarmament. In resolution 2930 (XXVII) the General Assembly invited the Governments of all States to continue efforts to create conditions conducive to the holding of a world disarmament conference and to that end created a Special Committee to prepare for that conference  and included Colombia in its membership.151.	We have always held the opinion that disarmament should be achieved not only within the concept of universality that underlies our Organization  but also bearing in mind regional circumstances and what we might term the ""defence balance"" of each of our continents. Conditions in Latin America are not identical with those in Europe  or Africa  or Asia. Each of those regions is beset by needs that are well known to the experts in arms types and face logistic conditions on which the concept of continental defence must rest.152.	We would therefore presume that  just as a Conference of Security and Co-operation in Europe would inevitably tend to create a balance of forces between those countries that have adhered to the system of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the States signatories of the Treaty of Friendship  Co-operation and Mutual Assistance  signed at Warsaw in 1955 -the Warsaw Pact - so  too  the States of other regions-in particular those of Latin America and Africa -which have their own regional organizations could also establish in the United Nations specific plans governing the defence and arms balance in their respective areas. We advocate a regional approach to disarmament.153.	Thus we would see the regional groups playing a decisive role in the preparation of the forthcoming world disarmament conference. Otherwise  that conference might suffer the same unfortunate and uncertain fate of so many earlier efforts-made without a regional approach - to solve the problems that may effect over 130 States possessing different economic and political systems  and lying in different latitudes.154.	In the inter-American regional organization  Colombia has put forth these same ideas in order to avoid unnecessary military expenditures in Latin America and help to accelerate economic and social development.155.	We are happy to agree with the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the fact that the necessity for international co-operation has never been so urgent  but we ask ourselves what are the main functions that this Organization should therefore be called upon to perform.156.	Starting from the assumption that world-wide confrontations have been set aside thanks to the solid progress achieved in rapprochement by the great Powers  there are still in existence the ""peripheral conflicts""  or  if you prefer  local wars. The Viet-Namese experience must be studied in order to avoid the failure of the peace-keeping mission of this international Organization if it stands immutable  with the rigidity of a statue  when  in some part of the world  wide-scale military operations are taking place or when mass destruction of towns and human beings is taking place  simply because such a war has not legally been declared.157.	The fiction that conflicts do not exist if they have not been formally declared or if the outmoded diplomatic niceties of the announcement of the outbreak of hostilities have not been fulfilled seems to overlook the shocking fact of the existence of the victims of the sophisticated weapons that arc used in combat in a well-known demographic area. We must agree that the United Nations should play a pacifying role in undeclared wars as well as in those legally recognized as existing.158.	There is. furthermore  the fact that wars of today inevitably end at the negotiating table  given the inability of the combatants to destroy one another. War  therefore  merely postpones the solution to problems instead of settling them.159.	The procedures for international conciliation in the United Nations must therefore be made more supple and the part played by the Security Council or the General Assembly more persevering.160.	The new global concept of international affairs-was very obviously demonstrated by the special meetings of the Security Council held in Panama at the beginning of this ""year. It was a most heartening experience for us to see such a high political organ of the United Nations dwelling more directly on the problems of the Western Hemisphere and hearing the opinions of the Latin American nations at first-hand.161.	Speaking for my own country  I was able to draw attention to some problems occurring specifically in our continent  problems which condition the maintenance of peace there. The persistence of under-development and the existence of large masses of the population outside the main current of development cannot be corrected except by vast plans for industrial development and for improving the economic and social infrastructure. This calls for an increase in our capacity to export and to generate a potential wealth that can be distributed among the less fortunate in the form of salaries and educational  health and housing assistance.162.	The major problem besetting Latin America is under-development. The population of our countries literally flocks to the cities in search of better living and working opportunities  and there is no chance of grappling with What has been termed the ""revolution of rising expectations"" of the third world  unless there is a new international division of trade and unless more favourable access is opened up to the exports from those countries. At the same time  it is imperative to admit that the developing countries have the right to regain the resources previously granted to others in colonial contracts  as one way of exercising their sovereignty.163.	Peace  therefore  is not the outcome of certain diplomatic protocols  but rather the result of a better economic balance between continents  and of a meeting of the aspirations for social justice that move our countries. Political peace itself is a precarious tool at best  unless it is accompanied by economic and social peace. In other words  international security must be assessed in economic and social terms.164.	But peace also depends on the solution that may be found to other problems that affect a region. So Colombia very sincerely endorsed the plea of other Latin American republics for a solution to the question of Panamanian sovereignty in the Panama Canal Zone. Nothing could be more just than that that country be allowed to put an end to a system that bisects its territory into two separate areas divided by a belt of water and land governed by another nation.165.	The Republic of Panama brought its problem directly to the United Nations because  procedurally  it was hamstrung in the inter-American regional organization  and the Security Council showed itself capable of entertaining the concern of peoples within the new global concept of international affairs.166.	Because of the trend towards globalism  we are witnessing a crisis in the regional organizations and in the way in which they were conceived after the Second World War as a means of dealing with the problems of the cold war and the conflicts arising out of the Power-bloc confrontations.167.	Security treaties  such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization of 1949 and the Treaty of Friendship  Co-operation and Mutual Assistance among the socialist countries-the Warsaw Pact of 1955 — were designed as defensive alliances to cope with problems arising out of the cold war; but they have been left standing as isolated bodies  and now call for readjustments in the light of new situations flowing from European co-operation-not to mention the Middle-Eastern and Far-Eastern security alliances that have been dissolved by circumstances. In our own inter-American system  the inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance  includes far wider aspects  but aside from that instrument the economic problems that  we face cannot be solved by our regional organization.168.	The future of such organs-and particularly that of the inter-American organization-will depend on the way they decide to or can adapt to the new circumstances of a world in evolution  in which wide political agreements are sought outside ideologies and where it is nonsense for the cold war to have ended between the great Powers but to continue in Latin America  where the vestiges of the period of confrontation are carefully nurtured.169.	In some aspects Latin America has entered the twentieth century and in others it has remained in the nineteenth. We now require a new continental policy for our Hemisphere  one based on United Nations principles for co-operation and relations among States that will permit each people to seek its own development and greater social justice  without interference of any sort.170.	First of all  each State must be entitled to establish relations with any other. International law  as practised in the world today  recognizes that freedom as inherent in sovereignty and as part of the concept of mutual and full respect for the independent personality of each State. Sooner or later this principle will have to prevail in the Western Hemisphere if we wish to restore friendship among the peoples of the region and be consistent with the notion of ideological plurality.171.	Secondly  in the future we will have to avoid a recurrence of certain interferences that have taken place in recent years and that have been in the nature of reprisals on the part of large corporations against certain countries. The credit of international agencies cannot be made to depend on restrictions derived from claims by private interests against a country  but must be open to the developing countries according to their capacity and ability. Intervention  in any of its forms and manifestations  is contrary to the very spirit of the day.172.	Finally  Colombia is concerned over the basic aspect-the fate of human rights in the Hemisphere and in the world and the guarantees that must surround the dignity of the human person. We witness with sorrow the existence of certain situations in which the principles that we felt to be deeply embedded in contemporary civilization are entirely eradicated.173.	Colombia is proud of its democratic lineage and reiterates its faith in the rule of law and of public liberties as a permanent system of coexistence based on equality and respect for all ideologies within the framework of the republican order.174.	It is easy  therefore  for us to advocate the doctrine of ideological pluralism which Colombia has championed successfully in the General Assembly of the Organization of American States. That rule of law which we apply to the individual citizen we have endeavoured to extend to every nation  so long as the latter  in turn  is willing to comply with  and accept  law and justice as norms governing the conduct of States.175.	We are defenders of this doctrine in so far as we believe in universality for international relations and the application of the principles of the self-determination of peoples and of non-intervention. But pluralism to us does not mean yielding our own national way of life  or forgetting our own democratic tradition  or even disregarding human rights elsewhere in the world. To us  it means mutual tolerance for the diversity of ideological systems and political regimes.176.	This pluralism  resting four-square on international coexistence  and based on clear legal principles  is professed by Colombia as a theory derived from our own national history. It also takes into account the image of a world governed by criteria of tolerance and respect among nations. Territorial sovereignty and the political independence of States are the foundations of ideological pluralism.177.	U is a doctrine that looks to the future  and not to the hatreds of the past.178.	The general economic situation is not satisfactory. The world is afflicted with a supply crisis. Furthermore  there is the grave uncertainty felt by the developing countries over the growing imbalance in the terms of trade. However  development plans presuppose the knowledge of the future pattern of world trade and of the monetary system.179.	The forthcoming trade and currency negotiations  to take place over the next few months  will be crucial to peace. We find ourselves at a point where the development gap has widened between the wealthy and the poor countries and is aggravated by the technological gap between the same groups. To a certain extent  the agreements among the great Powers tend to create a circle of privileged nations that act outside the confines of international conferences.180.	The creation of economic blocs has been a very different approach to world economy and one that was not dreamed of in 1944  when the ground was prepared for the monetary system  or even two years later  when world trade was organized. Freedom of trade has disappeared  as also has the concept of set parity  two principles that were then voiced as guidelines for economics  and we are daily moving deeper into a world bisected into the group of industrialized nations and that of the poverty zones of the third world.181.	Latin America has drawn a lesson from these events in order to strengthen its co-operation and encourage its dynamic and important efforts such as the Andean Agreement for Subregional Integration.182.	A very eager desire is expressed among the developing countries to be able to participate effectively in the resources of the sea adjacent to their coasts. Thus  new principles of the law of the sea are being elaborated such as that of the ""patrimonial sea""  which Colombia  together with other countries of Latin America  has defended. We are gratified to see that that initiative has won the support of other important countries  since it allows the establishment of the rights of the coastal State over an economic zone located beyond the 12-mile territorial sea. while respecting the notion of freedom of navigation and overflight and freedom to lay cables or submarine pipelines or to carry out scientific investigation under the control of the coastal State.183.	The great Powers must grant this equitable distribution of the ichthyological resources so as to allow the needs of the coastal populations to be satisfied. We have no doubt that the law of the sea evolves subject to obvious economic needs  in the same way as it did when for years it reflected the imperialisms and colonialisms of eras we believe obsolete. But the economic zone of the coastal State must then be the great and new principle of a truly universal law of the sea  one that will be the outcome of the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea..184.	I do not wish to overlook two burning issues of the present day. The unification of the two Republics of Korea will be a further contribution to the pacification of the Far East  and their admission to membership in the United Nations will doubtless help to extend the universality of our Organization.185.	The as yet uncertain atmosphere in the Middle East leads us to make an appeal for reconciliation and peace. Colombia has always believed that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) contains the basis for a just and lasting peace  and any action by the United Nations leading to peace must be predicated upon it. However  we do feel that it would be helpful to enhance the powers of Mr. Gunnar Jarring of Sweden as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in the Middle East  in order to encourage agreement among the States concerned in accordance with the terms of that resolution.186.	Our participation in the United Nations and the remarks we have made on the problems that appear in other parts of the world reflect Colombia's intention to seek an international order governed by law and built on justice. International life must daily become more imbued with the rules of law that must themselves be the expression of the universal agreement of peoples. Contrary to the case of the last century  the world today is no longer an inchoate mass that can be shaped and commanded from a few influential capitals. The premises that allowed colonialism and the distribution of spheres of influence have today disappeared.187.	Yet at present international problems are even more complicated because to the old matters of conciliation and peaceful means of settling international disputes must now be added the new problems besetting the world community  which have to do with the fate of mankind  its right to life  the protection of economic security and the preservation of the environment. We might safely say that man and all men are the main subject for international organizations such as the United Nations-organizations that hope to influence conditions of peace and security in the world.188.	Peace must thus depend on an over-all preservation of human life and a larger investment of the resources made available to the wealthy countries when no longer used for armaments. Peace is a single problem of anguished and. generally speaking  impoverished mankind  in that vast field the. United Nations has an agenda of infinite scope. The regional organizations are in a critical situation since they are unable to deal with the disquiet of a world knitted tighter together by means of communication  technology and science and by the solidarity that today exists among all nations.189.	We could not guarantee that those desires will all be fulfilled entirely without conflicts or suffering. But we can make an appeal to men of all races and say that it is the widest programme and the most urgent to which generations can aspire.190.	For the time being  the United Nations is the greatest political hope of mankind."
"25",1633,"CRI",28,1973,"﻿ Mr. President  your election to preside over this important Assembly gives immense pleasure to the delegation of Costa Rica. This is a just tribute to your country  the sister Republic of Ecuador  and a well-earned recognition of your personal attributes as a distinguished internationalist and an experienced fighter for peace  and justice among nations both in and out of the United Nations.2.	Mr. President  to echo the words of your inaugural statement [2117th meeting]  the delegation of Costa Rica also wishes to express its sorrow at the recent deaths of two Heads of State: the constitutional President of Chile  Mr. Salvador Allende  and His Majesty King Gustav VI Adolf of Sweden.3.	My country enjoys cordial diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany  which it has done since its inception  and has had relations with the German Democratic Republic for the last year. We are happy now to offer a warm welcome to the representatives of those two recently admitted Members of our Organization. Their admission represents an important step towards making the United Nations truly universal. The fact that the necessary agreement was arrived a'/ between the two German States to permit their simultaneous admission is further proof of the relaxation of tension that kept the world divided into two antagonistic and apparently irreconcilable ideological blocs. The presence in this hall of the representatives of the two Germanys is a comforting symbol of the fact that the ""cold war"" has almost entirely given way to peaceful coexistence.4.	The progressive liquidation of colonialism allows us also to tender our welcome to a new American State: the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. We wish that young nation the greatest success and we also hope that it will very soon be admitted to our own regional organization  the Organization of American States [OAS]  where all free and independent States of this hemisphere have the right to be represented.5.	My delegation voted enthusiastically in favour of resolution 2937 (XXVII). which expressed the desire of the General Assembly that the People's Republic of Bangladesh be admitted as a Member of the United Nations. We did so with the certainty that its Government would do everything possible to comply with Security Council resolution 307 (1971) on the just settlement of the problems flowing from the armed strife and on the repatriation of prisoners of war. We confidently hope that when the Security Council deals with the matter again  its members will unanimously recommend the admission to the United Nations of the People's Republic of Bangladesh.6.	Costa Rica encourages the aspirations of the Korean people to a prompt reunification of their ancient country  today divided into two States: the Republic of Korea  in the south  and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  in the north. We in Costa Rica  too  would like this reunification to be carried out through peaceful means  without foreign interference  and by the application of a formula which will permit the two Koreas — and all the Korean people — freely to decide what they prefer concerning the organization of a single State of Korea  and the form of government and the economic and social structure that will be best suited to the present historical reality and the just aspirations of that sorely beset nation.7.	The dialogue between the organizations of the Red Cross of the North and of the South of Korea  which started in 1971  fortunately culminated in July 1972 with a joint communiqué and with the formation of a North and South Korean Co-ordinating Committee. We trust that the dialogue between them will continue to be governed by a spirit of co-operation in order to overcome the obstacles that for 27 years have kept the Korean people divided.8.	This direct dialogue can advantageously replace the good offices of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. And in accordance with the hope that I expressed earlier that it will be the Koreans themselves who will solve their great problem  my Government is ready to vote for the dissolution of that Commission  as its own members have recommended.9.	However  my delegation does not believe that the moment has now arrived also to dissolve the United Nations Command in Korea  created by Security Council resolution 84(1950) of 7 July 1950. Our view is based on the fact that it was that joint Command-representing the United Nations as the only counterpart of the forces of North Korea and of the People's Republic of China-which signed the Armistice Agreement in 1953. For that reason we believe that the premature dissolution of the Command  before negotiation on agreements constituting a valid alternative to the Armistice Agreement  might endanger all the complicated arrangements that have kept the cease-fire in force for the last 20 years.10.	The Costa Rican delegation  of course  which desires to have the Koreans settle their own affairs themselves  would be ready to vote in favour of the dissolution of the United Nations Command when the representatives of the two Korean States officially notify the Security Council that they consider the Command no longer necessary.11.	Since the question of Korea appears on the agenda of the Assembly this year [item 41]  we trust that  in the debate that will be held on the matter  representatives of the two Korean States will participate  enjoying the same rights and the same obligations.12.	Costa Rica has repeatedly stated its adherence to the principle of universality for our Organization. We believe that for the peace of the world and for a more effective functioning of the United Nations it is indispensable that all independent States with duly recognized Governments of their own be admitted to membership. It is for those reasons that my delegation is ready to support warmly the admission to the United Nations of both the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. My Government believes that full participation in our work by the two Korean States  far from being an obstacle  would make it easier to hold new dialogues to bring about the peaceful reunification of the great Korean nation.13.	In the introduction to his annual report on the work of the Organization  our efficient Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  reminds us that the original concept of the United Nations was that of ""an organization of which the primary function was to maintain  and if necessary impose  international peace and security..."" 14.	Now  although Mr. Waldheim recognizes that this concept has been expanded by the adoption of long- and medium-range targets  he contends that the first duty of the United Nations still is ""the day-to-day effort to maintain peace and security [ibid.] —  and it could be no other  for without a truly peaceful atmosphere  other international activities cannot be adequately developed. It is for those reasons that it is appropriate that at each session of the General Assembly we think deeply about the meaning of peace and the ways of achieving it.15.	It has been repeatedly stated that peace is more than a mere absence of war. It is  rather  the fruit of justice. In modern days  in accordance with the thinking of His Holiness the Pope  peace has become the new name for development As a fruit of justice and the leaven of development  peace has its own channels  the main one being dialogue  communication among men. Genuine dialogue is impossible without honesty and sincerity. When it is achieved no problem bessetting human relations  however difficult it might appear  is insoluble  and thus we see the great value of the word  the spoken word  the sign of the greatness of the individual and the indispensable bridge for the legitimate progress of mankind.16.	War breaks out when words end  or  rather  when man decides to shatter his communications with other men. When we cease to hear words we begin to hear the rattling of machine-guns and the roar of cannon  and we see the realm of death take over and barbarism reign. In other words  barbarism begins when words die. Culture is words  culture is dialogue; barbarism is lack of communication.17.	And herein lies the importance and fruitfulness of the United Nations at the world level  and of the OAS and other similar organizations at the regional level. Although they do not solve all international problems  their mere existence as forums for a dialogue among peoples is an extremely important element for peace. When there is the possibility of a dialogue  then there is hope for peace. Peace began to be seen in Viet-Nam when the North Americans and the North Viet-Namese declared themselves ready to talk. Peace has not yet been able to prevail in the Middle East because it has not been possible to establish a direct dialogue between Arabs and Israelis.18.	In Central America peace now appears promising since the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Honduras and El Salvador have begun a dialogue in Washington and in Mexico.19.	And  as I said earlier  the talks initiated in Korea by the Red Cross organizations of the North and the South promise to be an effective instrument for the peaceful reunification of the peninsula.20.	As a United Nations Member in good standing  Costa Rica struggles everywhere to ensure the consolidation of peace  and that is why we have started a dialogue with all those countries which wish to speak with us  without considering their political ideology or their form of government. We are convinced that it is not necessary to possess a nuclear arsenal or to be a world economic power in order to possess a voice that can be heard  supporting and encouraging peace. Even small nations like my own  with clear-cut historic vision and a tradition against war  can and should raise the standard of peace.21.	For my Government peace will continue to be the ultimate objective of all our activities  both domestically and externally  and thus we daily feel more identified with the primary task of the United Nations.22.	All the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations are the bases and beacons of our foreign policy. It is for that reason that this year Costa Rica  with the unanimous support of the Latin American group of States  has decided to put forward its candidacy for one of the elective seats in the Security Council. We are thus trying to show my country's readiness to accept its part of the general responsibilities of the United Nations. Were we to be elected we would make the greatest effort in that post to interpret the feelings and aspirations to peace  justice and development that imbue the peoples of Latin America whose representatives would be choosing us to represent the entire region.23.	In the course of the general debate at the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly  note was taken with satisfaction of the favourable way in which relations among the great Powers had evolved. We pointed out then that tensions between the East and the West were being reduced  tensions which for years had kept us plunged in the cold war and which at times seemed to be pushing the world towards nuclear holocaust.24.	At this new session we can again state that the detente between the East and the West has continued to grow in even more favourable conditions. The end of the war in Viet-Nam  the treaties on the normalization of relations among European States  the agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of strategic weapons  and the holding of the first phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe are just so many more encouraging symptoms of an improved atmosphere for world peace. Never have we been so close to putting into effect President Nixon's idea that the era of negotiation must replace the era of confrontation.25.	But the truth of the matter is that while tension between the East and West has been considerably reduced  the underlying tension between the North and the South is emerging and becoming more acute. While the great Powers seem to find a balance of coexistence in the administration of their own welfare  there is growing dissatisfaction on the- part of the under-developed nations with the exploitation of which  consciously or unconsciously  the industrialized  capitalistic or socialistic nations have made them the victims.26.	At the sessions of the United Nations Conferences on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] the paradox-albeit an understandable one — has become evident that there is an association among the governments in the north of the northern hemisphere  which have achieved a high degree of development  vis-à-vis the just claims of the nations in the south  which are beginning to be aware of the fact that their lack of union is a main cause of their backwardness.27.	The northern nations  regardless of their political ideology  represent conservatism in the struggle for world development. But this should be no surprise. The wealthy States always tend to be conservative. They have too much personal well-being to safeguard. On the other hand  the countries of the south-where  geographically  all the countries of the third world are located-tend to be revolutionary. Since they are poor and backward they feel compelled to liquidate the national and international structures that hinder their development. Confronted by the inequity of world trade and the lack of true  multinational economic co-operation  the winds of revolution blow increasingly stronger from the south to the north.28.	It is for those reasons that I repeat that this new process of the convergence of forces is rapidly changing the axis of international tensions. Until a short time ago  primarily for ideological and sometimes for dogmatic reasons  the axis ran from east to west. But because of the struggle against under-development  the axis of world tensions has switched and now goes from south to north.29.	A short while ago I stated in Mexico that the greatest threat to peace was no longer nuclear weapons  which seem to have found in the balance of terror their own form of coexistence. The greatest threat to international peace and security — a threat which is far more explosive than even nuclear fusion itself — is the extreme poverty suffered by the great masses living in the southern hemisphere of the globe.30.	The despair of more than 2 000 million inhabitants living miserably in the under-developed nations composing the third world constitutes the greatest challenge to the new system of peaceful coexistence advocated by the great Powers.31.	But to maintain that peaceful coexistence — one we all desire — it. is imperative that we increase international co-operation for development  without ties  and establish a truly equitable foreign trade. Otherwise  the frustration of the peoples of the third world will become so acute that the tensions between the south and the north will grow  and very soon the world will find itself radically divided into two camps of a new ""cold war"" with much more fatal consequences than those suffered by mankind because of the already reduced tensions that existed in the previous ""cold war"" between east and west.32.	We are confronted now by a new session of the General Assembly and yet  unfortunately  no progress has been made in the establishment of peace in the Middle East. Despite the efforts made by our Organization  Security Council resolution 242(1967) still has not been implemented.33.	We must repeat to this Assembly our conviction that any solution sought to overcome the crisis of the Middle East must fit fully within the terms of reference of resolution 242(1967). That resolution combines in a balanced fashion three basic principles for peace in the Levant. Those are: (a) the principle of non-recognition of the acquisition of territory occupied by force; (b) the need to respect the sovereignty of all States of the region within recognized and secure boundaries; and (c) the just solution of the problem of the displaced Palestinians.34.	We believe that until a final solution is found  efforts should be redoubled to open the Suez Canal. The closing of the Canal has caused great economic losses not only to the countries concerned in the controversy of the Middle East  but also to the entire international community.35.	This year  as every year  we raise our voices in favour of general and complete disarmament under international control. By such an achievement not only would we safeguard mankind from the shadow of terror projected by war potential  but it would be possible for part of the $200 billion a year devoted to the purchase of weaponry to be devoted to international assistance  which — and this bears repetition — constitutes a duty and not philanthropy. It is a duty because  by such assistance  the industrialized nations  which are the ones that spend the most on weaponry  would be in a position to give back to the developing countries part of what they have extracted from them in order to help build their own development and power.36.	We regret the fact that despite the progressive detente to which we have referred with great encouragement  it has not progressed to the point of making disarmament possible. Costa Rica has supported and will continue to support the idea of holding a world disarmament conference. We do not lose hope at the misgivings that are expressed by some of the great Powers concerning the convening of such a conference. But realistically speaking  we do not expect it to be held without the necessary preparation. It is lamentable that the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference  appointed by the President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly  has not progressed in the task entrusted to it  particularly because of the refusal of four of the five nuclear Powers to participate in its deliberations  namely  the United States  China  France and the United Kingdom.37.	As a Latin American nation  Costa Rica is proud to be an active party to the 1967 Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco)  which has established in our region the only zone free of nuclear weapons. My delegation is gratified that in the course of the last year France and the People's Republic of China have joined the United States of America and the United Kingdom in signing Additional Protocol II: to the Treaty of Tlatelolco. We regret the fact that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has not as yet seen fit to do so.38.	Since the end of the Second World War  more than 70 nations which had been under the colonial yoke have achieved their independence and are today Members of the United Nations. But that triumph of the principle of self-determination of peoples cannot fully satisfy us until the process of decolonization which was set in motion by the United Nations has been completed. My delegation will continue to give its whole-hearted support to the nations that struggle to achieve their complete independence.39.	True to its tradition and being a determined partisan of the right of all peoples to choose their own future without outside pressure  Costa Rica repeats its support for the resolutions of the Security Council condemning all types of colonial policies. We also reaffirm our respect for the sanctions decreed against the illegal regime of Southern Rhodesia and also for the validity and purpose of the resolutions approved by this Assembly  which has repeatedly repudiated any form of racial discrimination and apartheid.40.	I cannot pass over in silence the existence of the problem of Gibraltar  the last of the colonies on European soil. It is our duty to ask for the application to Gibraltar of the United Nations doctrine on decolonization in order to restore the territorial integrity of Spain. Thus  we hope that as promptly as possible the United Kingdom will declare itself ready to resume the negotiations with Spain called for in the resolutions of the General Assembly  in order to put and end to the colonial situation  a remnant of an anachronistic past  which continues to exist in Gibraltar.41.	This year we celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Surely this would be an appropriate moment to ponder the great principles contained in that valuable document as well as the way it has been either applied or set aside by some.42.	History shows that ethical codes have always preceded ethical conduct  because societies need time to be educated and to assimilate more noble norms. And even after that  perfection is never achieved. Therefore  we should not be discouraged by the differences that we note in many nations  differences between the principles that were solemnly proclaimed a quarter of a century ago and the respect shown or not shown for those norms of conduct today.43.	The shadow of the totalitarian oppression unleashed by nazism and fascism led to the unanimous adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That document was intended to sum up the separation between freedom and slavery  peace and violence  justice and injustice  full development of the human personality and its mutilation.44.	The Declaration  in admirably precise language  defined the minimum framework of rights within which human dignity can develop. The minimum includes the right to equality  freedom  economic well being and to receive fraternal treatment from other members of the human family.45.	Article 1  paragraph 3 of the Charter of the United Nations sets out as one of the main goals of the United Nations the following principle:""To achieve international co-operation... in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race  sex  language  or religion"".46.	But since the Charter itself does not specify which are those human rights and fundamental freedoms which it is a basic responsibility of the Organization to promote and respect  Costa Rica believes that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights interprets the meaning of those terms  and thus it is incorporated in the Charter.47.	Although the Declaration itself is not a binding series of rules for Members of the United Nations  as an interpretive document of the norms of the Charter that are binding it does share that binding character which calls for its observance.48.	States Members cannot claim ignorance of human rights and fundamental freedoms which they themselves promised to encourage when they adopted the Charter. When agreeing to the Declaration  they approved the list of rights and freedoms included among the terms of Article 1  paragraph 3 of the Charter that I have mentioned  and they therefore accepted the obligation of ensuring their recognition and universal and effective application through progressive national and international measures. It is in this way that Costa Rica interprets the situation and  at least as far as we are concerned  the ethical norms included in the Declaration of Human Rights are juridical mandates that cannot be shirked.49.	It is obvious that the dignity of man cannot be fully achieved merely by stating classic civil or political rights  or even by applying them. Human freedom is incomplete and may be spurned by others unless the individual enjoys a decent standard of living. We can also state that in the international field a country is not sufficiently respected  although it may be politically independent  unless  through its work and by its trade with other countries  it is able worthily to maintain the life of its citizens.50.	Furthermore  it is also an obvious fact that to achieve a standard of living that is adequate for all members of society  a high degree of economic development is required. Thus we can echo the words of the late President Kennedy that development is another name for freedom. Human rights in their economic and social aspects can be achieved only if high production is combined with just distribution.51.	President Figueres of Costa Rica has quite correctly stated:""Before the industrial revolution it was inconceivable that there would be sufficient goods and services. Tacitly it was accepted by all except a few reformers that the work of the community could not produce more than was necessary for the welfare of a privileged minority. But today  for the first time in human history  some countries are producing enough for all their citizens. The poor nations  which still constitute the majority of mankind  wish to do the same. They  too  wish to develop.""It is in the common interest of all peoples and for the harmony of the human family that these backward nations should be allowed to develop. Economic and social rights cannot be universally exercised until the co-ordinated work of mankind produces sufficient goods and services to meet the needs of all peoples.""52.	For these economic and social rights to be fully implemented by States  they must possess the enormous financial and technical resources that only development can provide. That is why the under-developed nations cannot make human rights fully effective and why the developing nations must be assisted internationally so that  by accelerating their economic and social growth  they will be in a position to comply with the covenants that they have signed.53.	Costa Rica regrets that the International Covenants on Human Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI)  annex J have not yet been ratified by a sufficient number of countries for them to enter into force. We take advantage of this opportunity respectfully to call on the States that have not yet ratified the Covenants to try to do so as soon as possible.54.	Eloquently to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  Costa Rica — which sponsored the draft resolution proposing the creation of the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights2 -urges this Assembly and its Third Committee not to continue to postpone the study of this matter and to decide once and for all to give final approval to an important instrument for ensuring co-operation in bringing about respect for human rights.55.	Costa Rica hopes that the United Nations will soon make a reality of the charter on economic rights and duties3.of States. This initiative  taken by President Echeverrfa of Mexico at the third session of UNCTAD  has the wholehearted support of my delegation because  as the distinguished proponent stated  a just order and a stable world are not possible until obligations and duties are established to protect economically weak States.56.	Such a charter must include the duty of the industrialized States to give more equitable treatment to the under-developed nations in their trade relations  because trade among the wealthy and the poor nations should be the best instrument for uniform world development. If economic and social rights were universally implemented  one hour of human work done in one country could be exchanged for one hour of human work done in another. This rule — which  we recognize  is a far-distant target- could nevertheless give many economically backward countries all the income necessary for development.57.	But against that thesis it will be argued that  in the majority of activities  the yield of one hour of work largely depends on the capital invested in the worker and also on the amount of technology utilized. For example  a good operator with an automatic shovel moves a hundred times Imore earth than a poor worker with a hand shovel; and  therefore  the same payment cannot be given to the skilled worker as to the unskilled labourer.58.	However  in the advanced societies salary levels rise without taking the individual yield specifically into account. There are activities in which the man-hour yield has multiplied  such as in the steel industry. But there are other activities in which there has been no increase in man-hour productivity  as in the case of barbers  teachers  or musicians. But the salaries of all have grown more or less uniformly. Obviously  salaries and fees have been related to the increase in the productivity of the economy as a whole. The barber who shaves the mechanic is indirectly producing steel. This is in keeping with the aspirations of States to economic and social rights.59.	If mankind were integrated the same principle should apply internationally  and although it might appear to be a pipe-dream today  there is no moral reason why the Costa Rican peasant who produces coffee — on which the mechanic in Detroit breakfasts and then goes to build a truck to transport grain-should earn less — up to 20 times less — than his American colleague. The just role should be ""equal pay for equal effort"".60.	President Figueres has pointed out repeatedly that the advanced societies hate even the least vestiges of slave labour  and the minimum wage laws prevent employers from buying cheap labour  even when foreign workers are in abundance. But they do not apply this idea to foreign trade. President Figueres has stated:""The efforts of a vast number of workers receiving subsistence payment are purchased by the wealthy nations in the form of raw materials  and particularlyagricultural materials. Free trade is allowed between private importers who negotiate from a position of strength in a wealthy economy and private exporters who reflect the weakness of a poor nation. Private exporters in a poor country do not feel responsible for the welfare of their people. Their main interest is to maintain the highest possible margin between what they pay national producers or workers and the price they obtain from the foreign importers. As far as they are concerned  exporting is good business at any level of price or salary; and thus  unintentionally  they delay economic development and social improvement"".61.	As long as international trade accentuates the impoverishment of the under-developed nations  it is indispensable that we continue to compensate for the imbalance by means of so-called foreign aid. Even if the terms of trade were to improve  it would still be necessary to give financial assistance to the developing countries to compensate them for the drain on their wealth during centuries of commercial exploitation.62.	In the First United Nations Development Decade this foreign aid was assessed at about 1 per cent of the gross national product of the industrialized nations; but that target was not reached. Now it has been assessed at 0.70 per cent; and yet not even 0.35 per cent has been reached. It should be much higher if we truly wish to bridge the increasing gap between the poor and the wealthy countries.63.	What chances are there of increasing foreign aid? That depends on the way in which world peace is strengthened. In point of fact  the national product of a developed country is used to pay three types of expenditure: those required to maintain the rate of development of domestic life; military expenses; and those amounts needed to encourage international development.64.	In order to increase the amount of any of those categories in any appreciable form  one or both of the others would have to be reduced. What has thus far beensacrificed is international development  because  politically  it is the least important. For obvious domestic reasons it is very difficult to reduce expenditures intended to maintain the growth of the standard of living; and for international reasons it has been considered a risk to reduce military expenditures.65.	Nevertheless  even though the expectation is not at all realistic  what will have to be reduced some day is  precisely  expenditure on warfare. Now that we -are enjoying the results of a great detente among the superpowers it should be less difficult to reduce military expenditure.66.	As President Figueres has pointed out 'The arithmetic of this affair is almost childish. If we could reduce by one-half the present expenditure on war  there would be a budget left over sufficient to maintain order and to continue the exploration of space  the atom  the sea-bed and the very heart of the earth.""If we could cut expenditure on warfare by half  the most developed nations  without sacrificing their standard of living or their rate of growth  could devote the resources thus saved to development abroad. If all nations did likewise  as they should  perhaps in less than a half-century our planet could glory in the flowering of the Great Human Society.""67.	Although there remains a long road to travel  the greatness of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights sheds its light along the road to progress in this last quarter of the century.68.	The enjoyment of human rights makes economic and social development an absolute necessity. Development forces us not only to correct the internal causes of poverty in nations  but also to review the entire gamut of economic relationships between the rich countries and the underdeveloped ones.69.	Since it is difficult to change some of those relationships  it becomes necessary  as a substitute therefore  to offer some general compensation over a long period of time in the form of foreign aid. And as President Figueres of Costa Rica has said:""Any great increase in foreign aid depends in large measure on the possibility of reducing expenditure for war. This is not at all surprising. Human rights and world peace dwell together in the hearts of men. Together they represent the great goal of the United Nations. Peace helps development. Development engenders peace. Each is a cause and each an effect. They reinforce each other. Their common destiny is the rule of human rights."""
"26",1679,"CSK",28,1973,"﻿135.	 We frequently hear the question  What can be done in order that mankind may live in peace and security without fear for the future  and so that all its efforts may be concentrated on providing a better life for each country and for every individual? There is certainly no easy answer to this question. But experience in the past has shown that whenever peace-loving peoples have been able to achieve solidarity and unity  this has benefited peace and international security and has helped to solve all the most burning issues. Fortunately  recent examples give us hope that most peoples now understand the significance of the solidarity and unity of all peace-loving forces in order to strengthen peace and universal security.136.	I refer to a number of events which have occurred in the last few months of 1973. Of these I would single out first and foremost the exceptional significance of the July meeting in the Crimea of the leaders of the Communist and workers' parties of the countries of the socialist commonwealth  of which the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is an integral part.137.	The Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries — a very important factor in present international relations — which took place at the beginning of September 1973 in Algiers  was also of undoubtedly great significance.138.	At both these forums it was emphasized how important it was for peace and social progress throughout the11world that all anti-imperialist forces should work together. And the general debate at the present session has shown that the overwhelming majority of States and peoples of the world realize the need for joint action and determined efforts to achieve the peace and security of nations  and the need for peaceful and constructive co-operation between all countries in the interests of social progress and development.139.	The successes recently won by the peace-loving section of humanity in its struggle for peace and peaceful co-operation between countries with differing social systems are undeniable. The continuing process of international detente is of prime importance for all mankind. The United Nations is therefore faced with the immediate task of becoming fully involved in this process  the purpose of which is to reach a fundamental turning point in international relations — by casting off the remaining traces of the cold war and turning towards peaceful co-operation. The United Nations can help in this process by its efforts to clear up conflicts and crises and to work out fundamental postulates to guarantee international peace and security. If we want good multilateral relations in the world  and if we want our Organization to fulfil its duty to mankind  then it must necessarily rely on good bilateral relations between countries.140.	The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic attaches particular significance to this highly important principle. We want to have friendly good-neighbourly relations with all our neighbours. A great deal has been done recently to bring about this fundamental change in international relations  whether bilateral or multilateral. In this respect we particularly welcomed the results of the talks between the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Leonid Brezhnev  and the leaders of the Federal Republic of Germany  the United States and France. We value highly the signing of the Soviet-American Agreements  which are not only a valuable contribution to the development of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States  but are also helping to improve the international atmosphere as a whole and to strengthen the foundations of international security.141.	An historic event  in our view  is the progress made as a result of the convening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic was one of those socialist States which  as early as 1966  took the initiative of proposing that steps be taken in Europe to ensure the security of all States in that area  whatever their social system  and to provide an opportunity for comprehensive and mutually advantageous cooperation. 142.	Czechoslovakia's interest in these developments stems not only from the sad experience of our people during the first half of the century  when the continent of Europe became the theatre of two catastrophic world wars; it also stems from the fact that we consider the preservation of peace  the prevention of war and the creation of peaceful conditions to be a fundamental task which will make it possible to develop fully peaceful co-operation between the nations of Europe and thereby also to develop and apply the principles of peaceful coexistence between States with differing social systems.143.	A successful start has already been made in Helsinki on discussing the creation of a system of security and cooperation in Europe. We regard this not merely as something that would benefit the peoples of Europe  but as an important first step  one that will help to make this development serve as an encouragement to nations in other parts of the world.144.	We subscribe to the view that it would be extremely useful if developments analogous to those observed in Europe were also to occur in Asia. The creation of a system of collective security in that area would  we believe  be a first step towards solving contentious issues  removing negative factors in Asia  and guaranteeing the vital interests of the peoples of that part of the world.145.	One major contribution to the creation of conditions that will reinforce the system of collective security in Asia is the ending of the war in Viet-Nam  which has brought peace  after so many years of suffering  to the heroic VietNamese people  who have been fighting imperialist aggression for more than a generation.146.	We welcome the achievement of the Agreement on Restoring Peace and Achieving National Concord in Laos  and the progress made in putting that Agreement into effect. We believe that throughout the region of Indo-China genuine peace will triumph sc n and that the peoples of all countries of that area will be  able to settle their own affairs without outside interference. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  like all peace-loving nations of the world  will continue to give resolute support to the Viet-Namese people.147.	Scrupulous observance of the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam  signed at Paris on 27 January 1973 and the joint communique on the Paris Agreement on Viet-Nam of 13 June 1971 is essential if peace is to be preserved in that area.148.	It is most heartening to see that conditions are gradually emerging for the normalization of relations also in the area of the Indian subcontinent. We believe that the People's Republic of Bangladesh will shortly take its place among us. Another factor that would  we believe  be of particular significance for the creation of favourable conditions for strengthening peace and security in the Asian region is a normalization of the situation in the Korean peninsula  where fresh signs of constructive developments hold out hope that  thanks to the important initiatives taken by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  normalization can be achieved.149.	We support these initiatives because their aim is to bring about a democratic reunification of the country by peaceful means  without any external interference. We believe that it is essential for the United Nations to encourage these aspirations by endorsing unreservedly the justified proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.150.	The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic also has made its contribution to the process of improving the international situation  particularly on the continent of Europe. We have taken steps to normalize our relations with our western neighbours  particularly the Federal Republic of Germany. Essentially  everything was settled in our bilateral relations  and it is to be regretted that by the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Munich Agreement  which marked the beginning of untold sufferings for the Czechoslovak people  we have been unable to close this unfortunate chapter in the new history of mankind honourably. We hope  therefore —  as the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia  Mr. Husak  said recently — that the goodwill of the Czechoslovak Government will  sooner or later  be met with clear understanding on the part of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany and that the process of normalization will be completed successfully.151.	This was referred to recently by the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany  Mr. Brandt [2128th meeting]. Like him  we hope that the treaty  which has already been agreed upon  will be signed shortly.152.	The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has traditionally maintained good relations with the developing countries of Africa  Asia and Latin America. Moreover  it is extending those relations and giving those countries every possible assistance with their economic and social development. It is also developing  and is prepared to continue developing  relations with the western capitalist countries on the basis of equitable and mutually advantageous cooperation. More decisive and more active efforts by the United Nations to carry out its fundamental mission —  to strengthen peace and international security — would undoubtedly be of great significance in speeding up developments towards further international detente.153.	It is gratifying that at the opening of the present session we had an opportunity to welcome the admission of the fraternal German Democratic Republic  and of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to membership in the United Nations. That will not only help to extend the universality of the United Nations; it is also a symbolic expression and confirmation of the changes that have occurred in the world. All the peace-loving countries brought together in the United Nation's ought to bear in mind constantly that efforts to establish durable peace and security require that systematic  deliberate and timely steps be taken that will increase mutual trust between nations. We are referring  for example  to the fact that the Security Council must take steps to put a very important decision into effect speedily: resolution .2936 (XXVII) on the non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons  which was solemnly adopted at the twenty- seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. It is also essential that progress should be made in convening a world disarmament conference [resolution 2930 (XXVII)]. We feel we must stress the constructive part that has been played by all those who have made efforts in the meanwhile to bring this about  but it is astonishing that a number of countries — including some which  according to the Charter of the United Nations  bear particular responsibility to mankind — have not displayed sufficient interest in the work of the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference set up at the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Consequently  steps should be taken at the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly to satisfy all legitimate interests  taking into consideration any constructive proposals that would speed up progress in the Special Committee's practical preparations for convening a world disarmament conference.154.	Complete disarmament has been man's age-old dream. We are aware that to achieve this aim is an extremely complex and difficult undertaking. We must therefore welcome any step forward that we may take. One such step would undoubtedly be the implementation of the Soviet proposal made at this session [2126th meeting] by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  Mr. Gromyko  that the military budgets of the permanent members of the Security Council should be reduced by 10 per cent  and that part of the funds thus saved should be utilized to provide assistance to the developing countries. We sincerely welcome the inclusion of that item in the agenda of the General Assembly. We hope that discussion on it will be fruitful  and that the implementation of the action proposed will serve as an example to all other countries  particularly those with considerable military potential. In this way  it would be possible to accelerate the present trend towards detente in the world  and the nations of the world would reap definite material benefits. There are still many serious obstacles on the road to universal peace and security for all nations. There still exist forces hostile to peace which ignite and preserve centres of tension and war  and which see advantage for themselves in thus working against the interests of peace-loving peoples. Those forces are trying to extract some benefit from the inertia of the cold war. They try to make others believe that detente in the world and an improvement of relations between peoples that until recently were hostilely disposed towards one another is not in their interest.155.	But who would benefit from a deterioration in the international atmosphere? After all  if we do  not solve the basic problems of international security and disarmament  we cannot improve  as we should like to  standards of living throughout the world  including those of the developing countries.156.	The forces of aggression  imperialism and colonialism are the instigators of a tension which  despite the general tendency to international detente  still exists in certain parts of the world  causing untold suffering to the peoples of those areas and threatening universal peace and the security of nations. It is deplorable that the efforts of the peace-loving nations and of the United Nations have not yet produced satisfactory results everywhere. It is therefore essential that those efforts be continued with even greater determination and that everything be done to ensure that the existing centres of war and tension  particularly those in the Middle East and in southern Africa  be eliminated.157.	The situation in the Middle East is particularly dangerous and alarming. It is the result of the aggressive and expansionist policy of Israel  which has refused for many years to heed the well-known resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly  which are the basis for a just settlement of the conflict in the MiddleEast. Israel  in defiance of those resolutions  is intensifying its aggressive activities against neighbouring Arab States  is deliberately taking steps to annex occupied Arab territories and is flagrantly trampling on the rights of the Arab people of Palestine.158.	It is quite clear that Israel and all those who support it are becoming increasingly isolated  and that Israel  because of its illegal  terrorist and aggressive actions  finds itself resolutely rebuffed by all those who respect international law  as is demonstrated by the work of the Security Council this year and by its resolution 337 (1973).159.	The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has consistently subscribed to the view that the situation in the Middle East should be settled on the basis of a withdrawal of all Israeli troops from occupied Arab territory  and on respect for the independence and the legitimate rights of the States and peoples of that region  including the Arab people of Palestine.160.	No less a danger to the freedom of nations and to universal peace and security is the existence of colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism and apartheid  which are particularly strongly entrenched in southern Africa. Contrary to resolutions by United Nations organs  and in particular to the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]  adopted on the initiative by the Soviet Union  the South African and Southern Rhodesian racists and the Portuguese colonialists continued to commit criminal acts against the African people  not even stopping short of genocide  and committing crimes that will never be forgotten by mankind.161.	The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic \7ill continue  as before  its resolute support for the national liberation movements in southern Africa and in the Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique  and also in Guinea-Bissau  whose heroic people has achieved in its struggle a resounding victory as a result of the proclamation of the independence of that country. As before  we shall continue to support efforts to eliminate the vestiges of colonialism throughout the world; in the forum of the United Nations we shall do everything necessary to achieve that goal.162.	The struggle of nations for national and social liberation and for democracy is being resisted by all the reactionary forces  which do not hesitate to employ any means to reverse the course of history  as has been demonstrated by the violent putsch by a military junta against the legitimate Government of the Republic of Chile. One of the first victims was Mr. Salvador Allende  a great scion of the Chilean people. The Czechoslovak people unreservedly condemns the violation of constitutional freedoms and democratic rights  and the bloody repressions and atrocities unleashed by Chilean reaction  supported from outside and acting against the progressive and patriotic forces in Chile. The Government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic could not remain indifferent to this  and decided to break off diplomatic relations with the military junta in Chile.163.	It would be an unforgivable anachronism if the present trend towards detente and the development of cooperation between countries with different social systems that we are witnessing were not to have an appropriate influence on international  economic and trade relations in general  and on the activities of the various bodies of the United Nations system in particular. The principled viewpoint of the socialist countries regarding the development of international relations was clearly expressed in a communique at the twenty-seventh session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance in Prague  which said:""The active peace-loving policy of the countries members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance designed to assert in international relations the Leninist principles of peaceful coexistence and the relaxation of international tension in the world provides conditions for a further extension of mutually advantageous economic  scientific and technical ties between States with different social and economic systems  especially in Europe.""164.	Particularly noteworthy in this connexion is the proposal to adopt a charter of the economic rights and duties of States [see A/9142]  the text of which has already been drafted in United Nations bodies. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has supported that proposal from the very beginning and is convinced that the charter can become a key document that will ensure progressive principles governing international economic relations and thereby serve as a dynamic instrument for developing those relations on a basis of equality  mutual advantage and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States.165.	The United Nations is a significant and important organization. It has a position in the world which places great responsibility on it. The United Nations will maintain that position and its significance only if it does not mark time  and if it does not hesitate to become completely involved in the fight to ensure that the shift towards detente and co-operation between States with different social systems becomes a constant feature of contemporary world development."
"27",1702,"CUB",28,1973,"﻿177.	 Mr. President  I am extremely happy to congratulate you on your election to preside over the twenty-eighth regular session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. This is  doubtless  just recognition of your long and fruitful activities in our Organization. It is superfluous to add that the Cuban delegation will offer you whatever co-operation you require in discharging your task.178.	Barely a year ago  in this same hall  we heard true  energetic and hopeful words from a man who has just given his life for the sake of the democratic will of his people  the cause of socialism and human decorum  a man whose proud  enlightening and moving voice still resounds  and doubly so after having been silenced in a titanic struggle. As everyone knows  I am speaking of Salvador Allende  the constitutional President of Chile. That man and that name  now gathered into an immortality which he shares with the greatest heroes and martyrs of our America  cannot be overlooked in this Assembly. For what they symbolize in human decency  in loyalty to principles  in nobility of purpose  in service to country and faith in mankind  that man and that name lay claim on us for a tribute of silence  a bowing of our spirits to the greatness of his  which at the supreme moment rose to immeasurable heights.179.	I would not wish to proceed without first expressing Cuba's great satisfaction at the admission to the United Nations of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. That event is of great significance. On the one hand it is proof of the growing universality of the United Nations and on the other hand it is a sign of the changes that are taking place in the world today. We in the Cuban delegation are very happy to offer our fraternal welcome to the representatives of the German Democratic Republic  a socialist country  a peace-loving nation  which has succeeded in overcoming all the harassments  aggressions and intrigues of imperialism until it achieved recognition of its international personality.180.	With the warmth and friendship of neighbours we welcome the achievement of independence by the Commonwealth of the Bahamas and its admission to the United Nations.181.	With our flags flying  Cuba greets the establishment of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. That historic event irreversibly speeds up the triumph of the anti-colonialist struggle being carried on by the peoples of Angola  Mozambique and Cape Verde and further weakens the position of colonialism  imperialism and neo-colonialism in Africa. The people and the Government of revolutionary Cuba  who have already given full diplomatic recognition to the new State  rejoice at the victorious process of liberation of the people of Guinea-Bissau as though it were our own. The Cuban delegation pays a heartfelt tribute to Amilcar Cabral  the inspirer and guide of that memorable undertaking  vilely murdered by henchmen of imperialism a short while ago.182.	Cuba fully and militantly identifies itself with the legitimate liberating struggle being carried on with unshakeable determination by the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Syrian Arab Republic for the reconquest of their land usurped by Israel and for the recognition of the national rights of the intrepid and suffering Palestinian people. The cause of the Arab peoples is our own cause. In the Sinai peninsula and in the Golan Heights today a battle is also being waged for the liberation of the subjected peoples  the exploited peoples of Africa  Asia and Latin America. Egypt and Syria are in the vanguard of the so-called third world. If necessary  let us give them everything  even our own blood.183.	This dramatic situation  imposed on us by Zionism wedded to imperialism and reaction   fraught with risks forinternational peace and security  is attracting the attention of the whole world and  therefore  of this Assembly.184.	The indiscriminate bombing of Damascus  where the buildings of a number of embassies have been wiped out and a number of diplomatic officials have been killed  testifies to the hatred and savagery inherent in the Zionist policy. The non-aligned nations have made a statement this afternoon in which they reaffirmed their total and active solidarity with the Arab countries suffering aggression  and offering all their co-operation and support.185.	The Revolutionary Government of Cuba has made a statement on this matter which I shall refer to later.186.	An over-all glance at the international panorama allows us to see that  although the prospects for the struggle for peace seem clearer and more promising  as well as those for security  progress and social and economic development  there is still a long way to go.187.	Although the process that is now beginning is subject to the inherent fluctuations of the class struggle and ideological contradictions between the capitalist and socialist systems  and to the very aggressive and bellicose nature of imperialism  Cuba is proud of that constructive progress and the concrete manifestations of international detente.188.	For many centuries Europe was the cockpit of history  but the face that the old continent is now turning to us is very different from the one it showed a few years ago. And this is a point we must bring out: the transformation of the climate of tension and hostilities that prevailed in Europe from the end of the Second World War was the result of the dedicated efforts and the policy of principle of the Soviet Union  the main force behind the struggle for peace.189.	But this is no miracle. The Soviet Union was able to plough the furrow of peace  security and co-operation among nations possessing different social regimes by means of the convergence of certain changes and new conditioning factors at the very heart of European society and in the world  which in turn led to the creation of conditions conducive to peaceful coexistence in that part of our planet.190.	The clearing of the atmosphere in Europe  which was the result of that interreaction of factors reflected in the presence in the United Nations of two German States  the agreements signed between those States and between the  Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union  Poland and Czechoslovakia  and the opening of the second phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  will be enhanced by the documents signed during the conversations between the Soviet Union and the United States. The genuine vocation for peace of the Soviet Union obtained agreements and compromises that laid the objective basis for avoiding a nuclear conflict and saving us from the catastrophic risk of a new war of world-wide proportions. This significant victory is the culmination of a tenacious struggle for peace that began with the establishment of the first State of workers and peasants. It is not the result ofa policy of positions of strength but of the strength of positions. The stifling stench of Watergate has sapped even _ further the already diminished right of North American imperialism to dictate its policy in global terms.191.	It is obvious that the process of detente  timed and circumscribed by the facts and documents I have mentioned  is beset by shoals and dangers.192.	As long as imperialism survives  the frontiers of detente  peace  security  and co-operation will be precarious. But it is no less obvious that the concrete conditions created by that process favour the struggle of the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America for their liberation  social progress and economic development and increase their influence on the evolution of the international situation. It is for these reasons that the countries still belonging to the under-developed world must  if they wish to take part in history and in the forging of the new scientific and technical revolution and the conquest of outer space  join their efforts with those of the socialist countries to widen  strengthen and assure the roads of peace and to choose the most suitable ways and means to overthrow colonial and neo- colonial domination. It is in that direction that the horizon of lasting peace is brightening.193.	The contribution of the indomitable and dedicated people of Viet-Nam to the achievement of that objective has been decisive. Never has a people  confronted by an enemy a thousand times more powerful and cruel beyond conception  done so much for peace  for liberation and for the dignity of man. That people preferred to die rather than bow  and it won. The Paris agreements set forth the ignominious defeat of North American imperialism  but from that day to the present time the puppet regime of Saigon has violated those agreements with unparalleled cynicism. Kissinger initialled the agreements  but Thieu ignores them with the complacency and blessing of Kissinger. And from that day to this  also violating them  the North American Government has constantly sent arms and resources of all sorts to Thieu.194.	On the occasion of his recent visit to the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam  where he was received by that heroic people and its admirable leaders with overwhelming expressions of fraternal friendship  the Premier of the Revolutionary Government of Cuba  Commander Fidel Castro  at the invitation of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam  visited the zones that had been liberated by the Viet-Namese people. On that historic visit — the first made-by a head of Government to that part of that territory artificially divided from the glorious country of Ho Chi Minh — he spoke the following words in the town of Dong Hon:""It is impossible to carry out a visit to Viet-Nam without including a tour of the south and through this province of Quang Binh  which is the vanguard of the North and the rearguard of the South.""195.	He continued saying that very soon the Cuban engineers and architects would start work on the reconstruction of the region and planning of a new capital for the province  which had been so ruthlessly devastated  and added:As far as we are concerned  co-operating with VietNam is a great honour. It is not you who should thank us; it is we who owe you thanks — you  the people of Viet-Nam.""196.	The position of Cuba regarding the struggle for international peace and security is crystal-clear. From experience  my country knows the direct onslaughts and the whole arsenal of the ruses of imperialism  and we are always therefore on the alert. We have never yielded one iota of our sovereignty  our self-determination or our dignity. We have been isolated. We have been attacked. We have been blockaded  illegally and criminally  for the sole reason that we shook off the imperialist yoke and we chose the socialist road to development. We were even on the verge of being blasted by a North American nuclear attack. From experience also  Cuba knows what it means to have the cooperation and the assistance of the Soviet Union- and the socialist countries and the solidarity of peoples behind us.197.	Because of a community of destiny and in accordance with our international duty  Cuba has supported and will continue to support all the movements of national liberation in Africa  Asia and Latin America  just as we have supported and will support all the peoples and Governments that fight to defend or regain their full independence and their sovereign right to enjoy their natural resources. It is for that reason precisely that Cuba has advocated and continues to support all acts of this Organization tending to strengthen international peace and security. Peace and security wrested from the imperialists objectively become a reduction of their overweening power.198.	Cuba therefore fully supports the initiatives of the Soviet Union for the prohibition of nuclear weapons and of the use of force in international relations  as well as the convening of a world disarmament conference with the participation of all States. The Revolutionary Government of Cuba  because of its socialist nature and foreign policy of principle  is in agreement with measures that will alleviate international tensions. For the same reasons  we shall continue our struggles against colonialism  imperialism and neo-colonialism in all their forms and manifestations as antagonistic to international peace and security. Those activities complement one another. They flow from the different structures and ends of the socialist and capitalist societies and from the real division of the greater part of the world into oppressed and oppressor countries. The complex dynamics of international life and its shocking contrasts call for a new approach and consistent action.199.	One of the most acute problems confronting mankind today is the arms race  with its enormous risks and overwhelming economic burden on the peoples. It is known that in the course of the last few years some steps have been taken towards reducing methods of mass destruction. The use of bacteriological weapons has even been prohibited and they have been abolished.200.	But this problem has given rise to many deliberations  proposals and agreements in the United Nations. However  the difficulties are great  and it is logical to doubt that the matter can be settled by one stroke of the pen. There is therefore no alternative other than to continue the constant struggle and guarantee the holding of a world disarmament conference. It is imperative to stress that among the main items of its agenda should be included that of the dismantling of the military bases scattered by imperialism over almost all continents  which in themselves constitute spearheads of a policy of expansion  subversion  domination and aggression. Suffice it  as examples in Latin America  to mention the bases established in Panama and Puerto Rico and the Guatanamo naval base in Cuba.201.	Among the international events of the period that I have tried to analyse  an outstanding position is occupied by the fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973. More than half the members of the international community participated  and they represent the majority of the population of the globe — and many of their heads of State and Government. As observers or as guests a number of other countries  movements and organizations participated. The clamour of the hungry  oppressed  subjected or outlawed people of Africa  Asia and Latin America shook our deliberations. These deliberations concentrated on the great political  economic  social and cultural problems of the under-developed nations within the context of the international situation and of the joint process of the currents of national and social emancipation that in one way or another are upsetting the archaic structures that engender dependency  backwardness  poverty  servitude  deprivation  exploitation and racism.202.	In its review of the international situation  the Conference agreed that the process of detente in Europe was a plausible event but  at the same time  it found that the confrontation of peoples with colonialism  racial discrimination  apartheid  domination and foreign occupation  as well as neo-colonialism  imperialism and Zionism  continued to be unchallengeable realities of our day  and today we are proving it in the Middle East. I have already referred to this duality and I have stressed its causes. There can be no doubt or argument that peace and security are far from prevailing in the Indo-Chinese peninsula and elsewhere in the world. The under-developed nations of Africa  Asia and Latin America are still under the gunsight of the enemies of peace and security.203.	The most outstanding features of the Algiers Conference were its anti-colonialist  anti-imperialist and anti-neo- colonialist stand; its vigorous condemnation of Israel; its open support for the struggle of the peoples of Africa  Asia and Latin America to reaffirm their sovereignty  to recover their natural resources and to make the necessary structural changes to foster and guarantee their liberation and development; its severe criticism of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade; and its request that the monetary crisis  which has now become more acute as a result of the new devaluation of the dollar  should be discussed at the international level; its denunciation of the seditious role of the multinational corporations and its readiness to co-operate with the socialist side. It is these features which shape the results and the prospects which are open for all to see.204.	At that Conference  the Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government of Cuba and the Chairman of the Cuban delegation  Commander Fidel Castro  expressed views that should be repeated here. He said:""Any attempt to confront the non-aligned countries with the socialist countries is completely counterrevolutionary and benefits only the interests of the imperialists. To alienate the friendship of the socialist countries is to weaken us and leave us at the mercy of the still powerful imperialist forces. It would be clumsy strategy and colossal political short-sightedness. The success and future of the non-aligned movement must lie in the course of not allowing ourselves to be infiltrated  confused or deceived by imperialist ideology. Only the closest alliance of the progressive forces of the world will give us the necessary strength to overcome the still powerful imperialists  colonialists  neo-colonialists and racists and struggle to achieve the aspirations for justice and peace of the peoples of the world.""205.	With respect to the main problems raised at the Algiers Conference — almost all of which were submitted to our consideration this year as last year — the Cuban delegation expressed its views on the struggle for international peace and security and related questions  including the significance and the present stage of the Paris agreements on Viet-Nam.206.	Suffice it to add now that  with respect to Viet-Nam  Cuba calls for strict compliance with those agreements by the Government of the United States and the puppet regime of Saigon. But that would not be sufficient for peace to be restored in the Indo-China peninsula. It is also imperative for North American intrigue in Laos and aggression in Cambodia to end — the latter being carried out through Thieu. The promise of peace in Laos and the immediate implementation of the Vientiane Agreement must depend on the establishment of a government of national coalition. The only true Government of Cambodia is the Royal Government of National Union  recognized by the majority of the countries represented here. The restoration of its usurped seat in the United Nations can brook no further delay. The puppets occupying that seat at the moment must be expelled.207.	The arbitrary division of Korea continues to be a great source of tension in the Far East. We agree with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that conditions should be made favourable for the peaceful reunification  and independence of the Korean people. Cuba reiterates its demand to the Assembly that there be an immediate withdrawal of all North American troops from South Korea  that the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea be immediately dissolved and that an end be put to any interference in the domestic affairs of the Korean peninsula.208.	The prolonged and explosive crisis in the Middle East has now broken out. We must not forget that imperialist greed to take over the rich oil reserves in the Arab countries is one of the underlying factors of the aggressive  expansionist  annexationist and predatory policy of Israel. It is not by chance that the Sixth Fleet is in the area.209.	I shall now read out the Declaration of our Government:""The Revolutionary Government of Cuba repudiates the policy of aggression of the Government of Israel  which has once again led to a situation of war in the Middle East.""It is a known fact that the Government of Israel has rejected all forms of settlement of the situation in the Middle East created by its own illegitimate occupation of Arab territories and by its brutal denial of the rights of the Palestinian people.""Instead of bowing to the universal clamour for a return of the occupied territories  the restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people and the political discussion of the problems of the area  the Israeli Government has maintained an aggressive position against the Arab States.""In recent days the concentration of Israeli armed forces on the armistice lines with Syria and the Arab Republic of Egypt and the mobilization of reserves clearly showed the intentions of the Israeli Government  which ultimately unleashed in the area the military situation which today constitutes a grave concern for the peoples of the region and is a serious threat to peace beyond the territories involved.""The Revolutionary Government of Cuba expresses its support for the just positions of the Arab Republic of Egypt and of Syria  its solidarity in the face of the Israeli attacks  and joins in the universal condemnation of the actions of the Government of Israel.""210.	Despite the stubborn resistance and the obtuse approach of the colonialists and neo-colonialists  the national liberation movements in Africa continue to deliver destructive body blows at them. The emancipation of the people of Guinea-Bissau clears the road for the peoples of Angola  Mozambique and Cape Verde. The peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa valiantly rebel against colonial fascism and its repugnant methods  among which apartheid has a zoological physiognomy. Simultaneously  the manoeuvres  threats and conspiracies of the imperialists have increased against the People's Republic of the Congo  the United Republic of Tanzania  Zambia and the Republic of Guinea  to the point where aggression was committed against them by international mercenary bands organized and supplied by Portugal and NATO. Cuba actively supported the complaint by the Republic of Guinea in the Security Council on this question. 211.	In the struggle against colonialism and neo-colonialism in Africa  we are now entering a decisive stage. If the United Nations is unable to take effective measures to ensure the implementation of resolution 1514 (XV) and to break the resistance of the reactionary forces of imperialism and racism that oppose such implementation  it will assume responsibilities that will gravely weaken its authority and prestige.212.	The deteriorated and shattered alliances and self-styled Truman and Eisenhower doctrines have been shattered because they are useless. Formerly  they contended that they would play the role of the international gendarme of reaction  and now they turn to the expedient of encouraging Fascist coups d'etat and economically support and supply with more effective and numerous weapons puppet Governments and praetorian armies and assign to them the foul task of enslaving and brutally repressing their own peoples in order to permit more profitable and safer exploitation. Through their new alliances  you may find their present strategy and tactics in the following areas: South Korea  Saigon  Thailand and Lon Nol in Asia; Portugal  South Africa and Rhodesia in Africa; Israel and Iran in the Middle East; Brazil  Bolivia  Uruguay  Paraguay and now the Fascist junta of Chile in Latin America.   213.	Their frantic despair at the mess in which they find themselves is obvious  but so too is their contumacy in trying to maintain and extend their tottering domination. That duality to which they were pushed by their growing decomposition  the rebellion of the peoples and the resistance of many Governments prove their perfidious plans and have exposed their two-facedness. An obvious example of that is the Pharisaic torrent of rhetoric poured out on us by the grey eminence of the waning system.214.	At these moments Latin America is confronting a crucial situation. The rising progressive and anti-imperialist movement in our continent has been a fundamental element in the decline of the capacity of the Government of the United States to continue a global imperialist policy. It was precisely in the Caribbean that at the beginning of the now-dying century it started its neo-colonial politics  and it was in that region too that the process of defeat of that policy started. The Cuban revolution  the radiant apex of the radiant undertakings that today celebrate their one hundred and fifth anniversary  started the victorious march of the second independence called for by Jose Marti.215.	In the year that followed we were clearly able to see the antagonisms and the differences between Yankee imperialism and the Latin American peoples  which were growing and becoming more obvious. If at the beginning of 1960 efforts were made to propagate the fraud of representative democracy and to gild the lie of the Alliance for Progress confronting a socialist Cuba  at the beginning of the present decade there were already some Governments that had taken positions to defend their independence  their sovereignty and their natural resources.216.	In Peru the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces strengthened its nationalist positions. The Government of Popular Unity of Chile was trying to carry out  despite the Fascist escalation of reaction and imperialism  its singular purpose of strengthening the bases of the socialist road to development within constitutional machinery created by the dominating classes to safeguard their own interests. In Panama the people and the Government joined to call for full recognition of their sovereignty  jurisdiction and rights over the Canal and the Zone  strengthened by the almost unanimous support of the Security Council.217.	With their revolutionary acts and their votes the people of Argentina overthrew the dictatorship. The countries of the Andean Pact adopted restrictive measures on foreign investment. The challenge to the illegal diplomatic blockade of Cuba grew. The injections of camphor oil and plastic surgery were empty resources to revive the moribund and rotten OAS. At the fifteenth session of the Economic Commission for Latin America [ECLA]  held in Quito in March  the United States stood alone. It saw the aggressive pact of Rio de Janeiro buffeted by criticism and the incompatibility of socialism with the Latin American continent was suddenly challenged. Puerto Rico more and more took up the cudgels for its shattered national rights assumed by North American imperialism in 1898 and its inalienable sovereignty and right to independence and self-determination were recognized by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in the United Nations.218.	The imperialists' strategy of isolating Argentina  Chile and Peru or subjecting them to their policy through the conversion of Brazil into a dependent imperialist State and their strengthening of reaction in Uruguay  Paraguay and Bolivia  satellites of colonial fascism  seemed to face almost insuperable obstacles. The course of the development of this growing polarization of the progressive and anti-imperialist forces  which irremediably undermined their dire domination of the years of the past  led North American imperialism to concentrate its efforts on the overthrow of the Government of Popular Unity  inciting the armed forces to treason and giving all their help to the dominating classes  to the reactionary parties and the Fascist groups of Chile.219.	I shall now  if you will allow me  cast a somewhat brutal light of truth on what occurred in Chile and what is still taking place. It is a duty that I am fulfilling as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Cuba  as a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary  as a comrade of Salvador Allende and as a simple human being. I stress this last  because I wish radically to differentiate myself from those who here represent the bestiary and the forest.220.	The henchmen of colonial fascism and of imperialist propaganda have tried to cast a curtain of pretences  fallacies  calumnies  scurrility  adulterations and vile accusations to disguise their machinations  their felonies  their knavery  their infamy  their crimes and their responsibility. That was also the clumsy intention behind the ridiculous  lying  petulant  cowardly and low so-called ""I accuse"" of the ex-Minister of the Government of Popular Unity and rented Vice-Admiral  who dishonours this Assembly  bearing the stigma of traitor on his brow and his bloody garments after the murder of thousands of Chileans. The hired hand of Enrique Bernstein  ex-Director of International Relations of the Government of President Allende and confessed Christian Democrat  is not unscathed in that filthy  low  primitive and repulsive libel.221.	But it is the facts that will seat the presumptuous accuser in the dock of the accused.222.	Salvador Allende assumed the presidency of the Republic of Chile by will of the people expressed in elections on 4 November 1970. Between the elections in which he triumphed and that act were many plots hatched by the United States Embassy as well as by transnational corporations like the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation [777]  which tried to stop him from acceding to the presidency through an explosion of blind  exasperated and savage violence. The Fascist escalation of reaction and imperialism culminated with his heroic fall on II September. The unleashing of the most unbridled terror began the day after the elections. The murder of the head of the Army  General Rene Schneider  because of his true and consistent position was the tragic signal that triggered theFascist war against the Government  the Popular Unity Party  the leftist movements  the working classes and the progressive levels of the population — something similar to the burning of the Reichstag by the Nazis  which unleashed a manhunt for Communists  socialists  anti-Fascists  Jews and foreigners that today is being exceeded in its unbelievable ferocity by the junta.223.	This criminal madness of the desperate  as President Allende called them  was clear proof of the appearance of fascism in Chile  although they still hypocritically mouthed democratic slogans. Their main centres were the brutal National Party and the Lombrosian group ""Patria y Libertad""  seconded  with their own aims and ambitions in view  by the rightist leaders of the so-called Christian Democratic Party and above all by their main leader  ex-President Eduardo Frei  who  as Machiavelli might have said  combines the cunning of the fox  the treachery of the panther and the appetite of the hyena. Sometimes disguised  sometimes openly barefaced  we see the manifestations of that disgraceful plotting  the North Americans pulling the strings. The armed forces  under the then leadership of a man who was true to his constitutional obligations  apparently remained in their barracks and their highest officers never missed an opportunity of showing their loyalty  professionalism and non-political stand. And among the most obsequious and garrulous was the head of the junta  General Augusto Pinochet  a convicted Nazi and gloating murderer of the workers  for example during the Government of Frei.224.	In that adverse situation  President Allende began his democratic renewing of socialist efforts  sincerely convinced that he would be able to fulfil his programme ancl lay the groundwork for a more just and humane society in Chile  as he stressed in his first statement to the people after assuming the presidency.225.	The election of a Marxist leader to preside over a bourgeois Republic in a country which was dependent and under-developed was an exceptional event in history  and at the same time fraught with unknown quantities. President Allende was also aware of the other dimension of the process that he was leading. He knew this at all times. But  until the Fascist uprising took place  he constantly resorted to all constitutional and legal ways and means to travel the road that he had drawn for himself. To all lights  it was an extraordinarily important experiment he was carrying out. to benefit all people; and it was for this reason that from the very outset that undertaking earned the sympathy and support of all the progressive anti-imperialist and revolutionary forces of the world.226.	The heritage handed to President Allende was a gigantic hurdle that he had to surmount in order to fulfil his programme: a poor country; high unemployment; a society plagued by inequalities; the dominating classes safe behind their privileges; unbridled inflation; a bankrupt economy; and a State indebted to the level of $4 000 million  the heavy burden of the ostentatious policies of Frei  with his subservience to foreign interests. There was also a parliament whose voting power lay with the dominating classes; a judiciary which owed its existence to the interests of the status quo; a bureaucracy undermined by reaction  and armed forces which called themselves constitutional. This series of realities and facts  furthermore  coincided with a reduction of the price paid for copper  the main export of Chile  from 75 cents a pound to 40 cents.227.	It was as urgent as it was necessary to meet the burning needs of the people and therefore to undertake the structural transformations that could contribute to that end. But he had hardly effectively put into implementation agrarian reform when the monopolizing of goods and the sabotage of agricultural production took place. Hardly had the nationalization of the great copper industry  then in the hands of North American enterprises  been approved  when the United States Government froze all the international credits that the Chilean Government had a right to call on  and organized a large-scale operation designed to ruin the economy and provoke a coup d'etat. The bourgeois parties and the Fascist groups would co-ordinate their activities to the same end and the mass communications media  in the hands of magnates and foreigners  started the most slanderous  violent and cowardly campaign that can be recalled. One would have to have been in Chile justly to assess the abject magnitude of this convergence of interests  closely yoked.228.	From propaganda they went quickly to action  both within and outside parliament — through the reactionary laws  seditious strikes on the part of the management  attacks against the leaders of the Popular Unity Party  street demonstrations in the aristocratic neighbourhoods  calls to the armed forces to overthrow the constitutional Government  and conspiracies in which  under the leadership of the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency]  the high leaders of the Christian Democratic Party participated  as well as the National Party  the Group ""Patria y Libertad""  and the big bosses of the dominating classes  the high-salaried professionals  the newspaper El Mercurio  and the officers advocating a coup d'etat  particularly in the navy and air force.229.	In those complex and hostile circumstances  the Government of Popular Unity struggled for three desperate years to fulfil its programme. They did what they could —  and even more — to help the Chilean people. But  as the Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government of Cuba said in the statement he made at the enormous tribute paid in our country to President Salvador Allende  and as a gesture of solidarity to the Chilean people:""At least in these three years he and his workers and peasants understood that in the presidency of the Republic there was not a representative of the oligarchs  of the landowners and the bourgeois  but a representative of the humble  of the workers  a true representative of the people  who worked for the people despite the enormous difficulties confronting him. President Allende fully understood the difficulties and understood the dangers  but he saw fascism being reborn; he saw the conspiracies falling one upon the heels of the other. And  confronted by that combination of forces fed by imperialism  he had only one decision to make  and that was to defend the process even at the cost of his own life.""230.	Let us listen to what he said in Santiago on 4 December 1971. It was a statement of farewell to the PrimeMinister  Commander Fidel Castro  and it was a statement that his generous blood consecrated a few days ago:""I tell you quite calmly  with complete serenity  I am not made to be an apostle  nor to be a Messiah. I do not possess the qualities for martyrdom. I u a social fighter who is fulfilling a task  a task that was entrusted to me by the people. But let those who try to turn back history and ignore the majority will of the people of Chile understand that  without being a martyr  I shall not go back. Let them know that I shall leave the palace of La Moneda when I have fulfilled the mandate entrusted to me by the people. Let them know. Let them hear. Let them understand it deeply. I shall defend the Chilean revolution and I shall defend the Government because this is the mandate entrusted to me by the people. I have no other alternative. Only by riddling me with bullets will they end my will to fulfil the programme of the people.""And it was those self-same words that he repeated to others  and even to me  when he was speaking in the presence of his ex-rival for the presidency  Radomiro Tomic  and our Ambassador to Chile  Mario Garcia Inchaustegui.231.	The President of Chile fell fighting. He did not stop shooting his rifle until bullets cut off his life. The last hours of this brave fighter are known because of the unchallengeable eyewitness report of his daughter  Beatriz  who was with him until she was ordered to leave  with other heroic women who were with him  because their lives were thought to be precious for the future struggle  and the testimony of some survivors  recently mentioned by the Prime Minister of Cuba. While they tried to hide it  the Fascist henchmen know full well that President Allende fell fighting against the uniformed pack of common criminals.232.	But before rapidly going over those shattering and shattered hours  I feel it necessary  even briefly  to refer to the background preceding 11 September.233.	Lies are knowingly spoken when it is said — and you heard it yesterday — in a shameful effort to justify the overthrow of the constitutional regime and the nightmare of slaughter  murder  torture  destruction  raids and persecutions being lived through by Chile  that the Government of Popular Unity was preparing to exterminate the officers of the armed forces. What was being plotted was precisely the opposite: the Dantesque spectacle that has shaken the world.234.	The armed forces were never given much attention as regards their institutional development before the Government which was overthrown; nor were they ever called  as President Allende called them  to join in the national efforts at development and to share the responsibilities of government. Three high-ranking officers of the armed forces were in the Council of Ministers from October 1972 to May 1973. Even when Salvador Allende visited the United Nations he designated as Vice-President of the Republic the Commander-in-Chief of the Army  General Carlos Prats. This trust and co-operation between the Government of Popular Unity and the armed forces rested on the understanding between the Government and the constitutionalist faction of the army and  significantly  occurred simultaneously with the efforts to overthrow the Government by the Fascist sectors of the army  the navy and the air force.235.	That sector  openly or clandestinely  conspired since Allende took over the presidency. But it did not do so alone; it conspired with the reactionary parties and North American imperialism  the true leader and ideologist of the Fascist coup. It organized — and I want to stress this — eight special operations of intelligence  subversion and counter-intelligence  under the direction of the Pentagon  the State Department  the CIA and the transnational corporations acting together with  among other Chilean capitalists  ' Matte  Alessandri  Bulnes and Edward  and with the reactionary parties and the Fascist groups. We have irrefutable proof of what I am saying and of the fact that the leaders of the Christian Democratic Party nominated a representative to these anti-national activities  a man called Felipe Amunategui  as well as Andres Donoso. To prove this I shall give the code names of three of those seditious operations: Centauro  Yellow Star and Marty.236.	The military institutes  moreover  maintained excellent relations with the Pentagon. While the Government of Popular Unity found its international credit frozen  the institutes received from the Government of the United States millions of dollars and military equipment.237.	According to reliable testimony  the aims of the CIA in overthrowing Allende were the following: to restore the economic and political domination of the United States in Chile; to liquidate the relations of friendship and cooperation with Cuba and the socialist countries; to provoke the economic and financial collapse of the country in order to create conditions conducive to a Fascist coup; to jeopardize the participation of the armed forces; to ensure the overthrow of President Allende before 13 November; and to establish a dependent Government which would adopt the imperialist economic philosophy and serve the economic objectives of the United States in that country.238.	The abortive military coups of March and September 1972 showed the internal struggle in the armed forces between the sector that wanted the coup and those who respected the law  led by General Prats  General Pickering and General Sepulveda. But it was clearly seen that the strength of the armed forces was deteriorating when an armoured unit made an unsuccessful attack against the Moneda Palace on 27 June 1973. The Generals mentioned  leading their troops  put down that coup. As of that moment  it became obvious to the constitutionalist sector of the armed forces that its capacity to maintain internal unity and to contain the Fascist officers was being seriously challenged.239.	What came after was a multipronged political  military and popular action by President Allende to preserve the constitutional regime and avoid an armed confrontation  although he was ready to fight. Surrounded by increasing rumours of imminent army uprisings  in August there occurred — financed  organized and directed by American imperialism — the insurrectional strike of the truck-drivers which started in 1972 as an essay  to be joined by the professionals and an increasing number of tradesmen. The desire for the coup grew and became more forceful. The reactionary parties  with the Christian Democrats in the vanguard  broke off the dialogue proposed by President Allende and the Chamber of Deputies  by a mechanical vote of the majority  urged the Fascist military group toestablish a coup with a statement to the effect that the Government of Popular Unity had shattered constitutional order.240. The terrorist attacks on persons and public services continued. Buildings in Santiago — and I have seen this with my own eyes — were covered with this sinister slogan: ""Djakarta is near."" But the armed forces  those same armed forces that yesterday slaughtered the unarmed population of Lima  that later massacred the workers and today  in the name of law and order  commit crimes and tortures  did nothing then to stop the seditious escalation.241. President Allende called the Popular Unity leaders and the leaders of the Central Unica de Trabajadores (Labour Union) and told them that  in the light of the serious military situation  he had decided  in accordance with the will of the army leaders  to retire the Generals implicated in the projected Fascist coup. Among others  President Allende spoke with General Pinochet  who was at that moment interim Chief of the Army  and prepared an anti-insurrectionist plan.242.	More than half the high-ranking officers refused to condemn the ill-treatment of General Prats. Suddenly  among the Generals who supported the Minister of Defence was found Pinochet.243.	General Prats presented his irrevocable resignation to the President and Pinochet  like a witch in Macbeth  advised the President to agree to the resignation to appease the high-ranking officers of the navy and the air force  then committed himself to assume leadership of the army and to retire the other conspirators. But the only retirements he signed were those of Prats  Pickering and Sepulveda — all loyal to the troops and to the Government.244.	On 24 August the main officers of the navy met at Valparaiso and when their Commander-in-Chief  Admiral Montero  a true man of honour  arrived he was confronted with a request for his resignation. He replied that he could do so only to the President of the Republic  President Allende. While the Vice-Admiral who represents dishonour  crime and fascism is here with impunity  demonstrating his foolishness with his bloodstained hands  on that same 11 September Admiral Montero was arrested and replaced by a raging gorilla  a member of the Fascist group. Officers and other ranks opposed to the coup were detained or murdered. Generals Guillermo Pickering  German Sepulveda  Alberto Bachelet and Jose Maria Sepulveda  the leaders of the carabineros up to 11 September  were arrested also.245.	The American Ambassador  Nathaniel P. Davis  in charge of Soviet affairs during the cold-war years and closely linked to Howard Hunt — who is involved in the filth of Watergate — travelled to Washington a week before the coup and returned on the eve of the coup. The State Department will later admit without blushing or without scruples that it knew of the planned date.246.	These facts are clear. They may be twisted or they may be denied  but the facts still stand.247.	At dawn on 11 September  the navy rebelled in Valparaiso. Their ships had sailed the night before  allegedly toparticipate in the so-called ""UNITAS"" operation  but they came back  they crawled back into port like foreigners  escorted by North American ships on combat alert. President Allende  as soon as he knew of it  went to his office after providing for the protection of his home where his wife was. The Palace also heard that Pinochet was false  a disgrace and a traitor. The army and the air force had joined the Fascist coup. The moment of armed confrontation had struck.248.	But President Allende  with a small number of ministers  collaborators and comrades and friends decided to resist. That man  who did not tire of advocating tolerance  respect for the law and peaceful settlement as well as the respect for the Constitution  grew until he achieved the stature of a hero. He replied to bullets with bullets. He held at bay the aggressors for a number of hours. He put a tank out of commission with a bazooka shot. He courageously resisted the fire of artillery  the attacks of the tanks  the bombing by planes and danger from fire. A number of times he was urged to surrender. He was offered a plane to take him to any other country with his family and those he might choose. His answer was unshaken: ""The traitorous generals do not know what a man of honour is."" He remained calm  determined  courageous  at his battle-station and he would say later with lapidary sobriety: ""This is the way we write the first page of this story. My people and America will write the rest."" He saw many of his comrades fall before his very eyes  and among them his very close friend  the news correspondent Augusto Olivares  who stood out in those epic hours. While this was taking place  his private residence  his home  was being attacked by the armed forces with the brutality common to the bloodthirsty cowards. His home was destroyed  sacked  gutted. His wife's life was saved by chance.249.	And so the Fascists took over the ground floor of the Palace and  after a hard fight  occupied part of the upper floor. In the red room  surrounded by a handful of courageous men  the President was waiting for them with a smoking rifle. He advanced resolutely on the Fascists  and a shot tore open his stomach  but he continued to fire on the murderers  leaning against a piece of furniture  until a second shot shattered his chest and sent him to the floor. Falling  his bloody body was riddled with bullets.250.	Those who survived this almost legendary scene regrouped  counter-attacked and threw out the Fascists  from the upper floors. Members of his personal guard carried the corpse of Salvador Allende to his office. They sat him in the presidential seat  they placed across his chest his presidential sash  and they shrouded him in the Chilean flag.251.	As Prime Minister Commander Fidel Castro has said:""Seldom in history was a similar page of heroism written. Never in this continent has any president played such a dramatic role. Salvador Allende showed more dignity  more honour  more courage and more heroism than all those Fascist officers together. His gesture of - incomparable greatness sank forever in ignominy Pinochet and his accomplices. His exemplary conduct morally destroyed fascism in Chile. Very often the unarmed thought has been overcome by brute force  but now wecan say that never has brute force met such resistance carried out in the military field by a man of ideas whose weapons were always the word and the pen.""252.	For more than 24 hours  the Fascists were silent and did not make known the death of President Allende. He was buried in secret. Neither his wife nor his sister  who accompanied his pine coffin in a plane of the armed forces among stolid and insensible officers  was allowed to see his body.253.	But his last words will continue to vibrate in the air as an unchallengeable mandate:""Workers of my country  I have faith in Chile and its destiny. Other men may overcome this bitter and grey moment  when treason is trying to impose itself. But you must know that  much sooner than later  the great road will open through which the free man can go in his effort to build a better society. Long live Chile! Long live the people! Long live the workers! These are my last words  being sure that the sacrifice will not be in vain. I am convinced"" — listen carefully — ""that there will be at least a moral sanction that will punish crime  cowardice and treason.""254.	The Fascists also attacked our embassy  flouting the Vienna Convention  international law and the Charter of the United Nations. They wounded our Ambassador  who is present here  and an official of the embassy. But to their bravado and threats we always answered  ""We shall defend the embassy  which is Cuban territory  until the last man falls."" The complaint of Cuba on the matter is still before the Security Council. 255.	Furthermore  the Fascists did not stop at harassing diplomats and technicians of socialist countries and diplomatic officials of capitalist countries. In a word  they gave proof of their barbarous contempt for civilization.256.	The first act of the Fascist foreign ministry was to break off diplomatic relations with Cuba  and we are proud: it is comforting and strengthening to us; with murderers  torturers and anthropoids we want no ties of any sort.257.	When the Cuban diplomatic personnel left the country  the Government of Sweden took over the representation of our interests. The Swedish Ambassador  Harald Edelstam  has in these dark and dangerous days behaved with a zeal and a solicitude which do honour to Swedish diplomacy and the Swedish Government.258.	Four of the very few Cubans who were still in Chile were able to get into Argentina after they had been abandoned in the Andes without adequate food or clothing in a temperature of 20 degrees below zero. An Argentine patrol found them and took them to their barracks  giving them help and food  as was to be expected. We do not know what happened to the other two  who were arrested. Anything could have happened to them.259.	A Cuban merchant vessel  the Playa Larga  was also treacherously shelled and bombed in international waters. The captain decided to leave Valparaiso since he lackedsafeguards for his ship and its crew. One of the crew members had been arrested and ill-treated on land by the mutinous Fascists. The Playa Larga was followed and shelled by the destroyer  the Blanco Encalada  and bombed by planes and helicopters. It was so seriously damaged that it was about to sink. Called upon a number of times to surrender and return to Valparaiso  the answer of the captain and the crew was that they preferred to scuttle the ship rather than hand themselves over to the Fascist authorities. I The Playa Larga was finally able to escape the criminal persecution and set sail for El Callao  where it arrived escorted by the Cuban merchant vessel Marble Island  which  for the same reasons  did not continue its trip to Chile. This gross violation of freedom of navigation and international law is already also before the Security Council. 260.	The unscrupulous support of North American imperialism to the Fascist junta is brought out even more by its cynical complicity in the harassment and provocations against Cuban merchant vessels beyond Chilean frontiers. When preparing to cross the Panama Canal on its way to Havana  the merchant vessel Marble Island  flying under the Somali flag but under charter to the Mambisa Steamship Company  presented a request to pass through the Canal. The captain and crew were Cubans and they were told that the official in charge of the Canal had been told to arrest the ship because of an action in rem by a Chilean sugar company which demanded a payment of $4 235 298. This conspiracy on the part of the North American authorities of the Canal and the Chilean enterprise are political reprisals that violate the rights of free navigation through that international waterway. The captain and the crew of the Marble Island rejected the order of arrest  refused to land  raised anchor and left for the Pacific Ocean.261.	A few days ago the Cuban merchant vessel Imias coming from Japan to our country was also arrested in the Canal  in the Gatun Lake area  and is virtually isolated by the North American authorities in connivance with the Fascist junta of Chile.262.	The arresting of a ship owned by the Cuban State is an illegal act which has grave implications  even for third parties. Violations of the norms of international law which recognize and safeguard the sovereign immunity of ships belonging to States constitute a serious threat to those using the Panama Canal  subject as they are to the same decisions by those who  according to the international regime agreed to  are required to guarantee freedom of navigation  security and neutrality of their waters. The captain and crew of the Imias are ready  in keeping with the heroic traditions of our merchant marine  to resist any attempt to confiscate the ship by force.263.	The statement by the Panamanian Foreign Office on this situation fraught with serious risks for international peace and security describes the matter very clearly and very precisely.264.	We denounce before the General Assembly this new act of piracy on the part of North American imperialism and we warn the Assembly that  if the Imias is not freed bythose who have seized it  the Revolutionary Government of Cuba will take the necessary measures and steps to do so  both within and outside the United Nations. 265.	The insatiable and bloodthirsty repression unleashed by the Fascist junta can only be compared to that of the Nazis in the occupied countries: summary executions  organized massacres  destruction of settlements  bombing of universities  horrifying tortures  concentration camps  the handing over of Latin American exiles to hangmen  night raids  burning of books  outlawing of political parties  banning of trade unions  the closing down of Parliament  aggression against embassies  attacks on merchant vessels  persecution of foreigners  violations of international law  and a state of siege. In one word: the resurrection of the dark and dreary spirit of the Middle Ages in the middle of the twentieth century.266.	This interminable escalation of terror sets the conscience of mankind on edge. From all parts of the world  without distinction for political  social or religious ideologies  voices have been raised in horror at this orgy of blood and calling for an end to repression. ""Slaughterhouse in Santiago"" is the title of an article in Newsweek magazine. But these hardened murderers continue their ghastly tasks  blind and deaf to all human appeals. That was and is fascism.267.	World public opinion must be galvanized to call for respect for the life of the political leaders and the men and women of the country held in improvised gaols or confined in inhospitable islands  their heads against the very edge of the bayonets or their chins resting on a gun barrel. Luis Corvaian  General Secretary of the Communist Party of Chile  is gaoled and subject to court-martial  accused of alleged crimes of treason against the country  a shameless invention of those who have dishonoured their country  those who have opened their country to all sorts of attacks because of their real treason  crimes and thefts. They have not as yet shot him but they can do so at any moment. Have there not been more than 10 000 shot and massacred there * including the aged  women and children? According to the Washington Post  the CIA — which participates in this blood-bath — has assessed at 3 000 the number of those killed in the first days following the coup.268.	The Chilean people will now have to embark on the long and arduous armed struggle against colonial fascism  but they will find echo and support in the officers  non-commissioned officers and soldiers who remain loyal to the Chilean people and to their constitutional promises ""and pledges. By their own experience the peoples of Brazil  Uruguay  Paraguay and Bolivia know what the cost is  as did the countries that were earlier overrun by the Nazis. The Fascists will receive credits  weapons  and advisers from imperialism and its Latin American satellites. I should correct that statement and change the tense and say that they are already receiving them. Considerable North American credit for the purchase of wheat  and the arrival in Santiago of numberless specialists in counter-insurgency  are nothing but the prelude. The CIA with all its resources is  and will be  the centre of repression. But we are convinced that the Chilean people will wage that war until the last consequences are faced. And  at the end  their revolutionary act will bury fascism in its own filth.269.	In this new epic struggle  the Chilean people will not be fighting alone. They will have the solidarity and support of Cuba and the socialist countries  of the non-aligned nations — in accordance with the resolution adopted at the Algiers Conference — and the support of all the revolutionary people and progressive Governments in the world. That solidarity and that support will not fail them.270.	But  over and above all  the Chilean people can count in that decisive battle  as the Prime Minister of Cuba said  on ""the banner  and the immortal person of President Allende. President Allende has given his people the highest example of heroism that can be offered. President Allende has embodied the best of patriotism  of valour  of honour and the combative spirit of the Chilean people"".271.	The Cuban delegation renews its deep faith in the destinies of Chile and for the records of this Assembly we reiterate the last words of the revolutionary panegyric uttered by Comrade Fidel Castro:""Eternal glory for Salvador Allende  together with Che  together with Marti  Bolivar  Sucre  San Martin  O'Higgins  Morelos  Hidalgo  Juarez and all the great men who gave their lives for the freedom of our continent. The Chilean people will squash fascism.""Country or death! We shall win!"
"28",1748,"CYP",28,1973,"﻿237.	It is with particular pleasure that my delegation associates itself with the speakers who have extended congratulations to Ambassador Benites on his unanimous election to the high office of President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. This election marks the crowning point of an outstanding career that has been devoted to the service of world peace and understanding among peoples. The high office of the presidency to which he was so deservedly elected is made more significant this session because of the unique opportunity offered and the challenge involved to derive the most for mankind from the new trend of negotiation  peaceful coexistence and contact  which hopefully appeared on the world scene during the past two sessions of the General Assembly. My delegation is certain that under his wise guidance and leadership our work will be effectively accomplished in a spirit of co-operation that will contribute significantly towards peace and harmony in the world.238.	I should like also to associate myself with the expressions of appreciation which preceding speakers have addressed to the outgoing President of the General Assembly  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  for the able and statesmanlike manner in which he guided the deliberations of this body during the preceding session.239.	As the President has so rightly observed  the outstanding feature of this Assembly session is that it marks the beginning of genuine universality. I take great pleasure in extending a warm welcome to the three new Member States of the United Nations  the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic  the proposals for whose admission Cyprus sponsored as a gesture of friendship and goodwill. We hope and trust that the constructive participation of the two German States in the work of the United Nations and the beneficial influence of the Charter principles will prove conducive to the closer co-operation and unity of the great German nation. Our traditional stand has always been and continues to be for the unity and integrity of all nations and peoples. World experience during the years after the Second World War has amply demonstrated that partition is an ever-bleeding wound in the body of any country.240.	The twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly has convened in an atmosphere of confidence and hope. Not since 1946  when this Assembly held its first session  have there been so many good auguries for peace in the world  and such revival of hope for the emergence of an era of conciliation and relaxation of tensions.241.	In the past year the course of international relations continued to be influenced by the spirit of the Charter  and  further to peaceful coexistence  great efforts were exerted to promote international co-operation among States with different social and political systems.242.	The process of detente  which had commenced among the big Powers  was followed this year by the personal meetings between leading Heads of State. Such meetings are of fundamental importance and are beneficial to the cause of peace  in view of the great responsibilities which their countries bear for the maintenance of international peace and security. When relations among these Powers develop on the basis of mutual accommodation and cooperation  they exert favourable influence on the international situation as a whole. The cessation of hostilities in Viet-Nam and the resulting truce agreement is  we believe  a case in point  and one which the world community has welcomed as a triumph of statesmanship  and as a-good point of departure for achieving durable peace in that part of the world. At the same time  I wish to express the hope and conviction that accommodation among the big Powers will not result in a situation in which the legitimate interests of small countries would be ignored.243.	The constructive results of the recent session of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  held at Helsinki in July  the second phase of which has now commenced in Geneva  of the Commonwealth Heads of State Conference in Ottawa in August  and of the Fourth Conference of the Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries in Algiers in September  all of this year  in which my country participated and made its modest contribution  have helped to bring about a substantial  easing of tensions in international relations  signalling the beginning of an era of positive developments which undoubtedly will facilitate the search for peace in the world.244.	Cyprus shares the fervent hopes of all mankind at this juncture  when there are signs that goodwill is replacing antagonism and mistrust. We would like to restate our belief that  as a natural sequence  the new spirit of bilateral and group co-operation should be channelled into the United Nations so that the much needed unanimity of the permanent members of the Security Council in matters affecting peace and security may be finally achieved. The Charter of the United Nations presupposes  and indeed bases itself upon  a reasonable degree of accord and unity between the big Powers. This accord has many times in the past been lacking  in a manner hampering and even frustrating the task of the United Nations to fulfil its pre-eminent purpose  giving thus rise to grave apprehensions concerning the Organization's effectiveness in the maintenance of peace and security. In the light of the near universality of the United Nations  this new trend will not only render the United Nations more effective  but will also assure the permanence of relaxation of international tensions; moreover  it will ease the concern of many Members about the paralysing effects which the abuse of the veto frequently produces on the United Nations organ bearing the greatest weight of political responsibility. At the same time  the United Nations will become what mankind intended it to be: an effective instrument for securing peace  and not merely a spectator of hopeful signs of easing of tensions brought about by bilateral initiatives and agreements.245.	A stronger Organization need not raise apprehensions in any quarter  for it is through this world body that small States can ensure their security and respect for their independence and territorial integrity  as well as promote their economic and social progress. It is also in this Organization that the true and long-term interests of the big Powers lie.246.	The Government of Cyprus considers the United Nations as the pillar of its foreign policy  and will continue to support unreservedly its strengthening  and work together with all peace-loving nations to enhance the sphere of its activities and the degree of its effectiveness so as to make it the supreme instrument for peace  justice and progress for all mankind. We realize that these are high goals  especially in the light of the fact that the successes so far achieved by the United Nations fall short of the vision of its founding fathers and of the hopes the vast majority of peoples everywhere continue to place in it.247.	Yet it must be pointed out that during the last 28 years the achievements of the United Nations in various fields  and particularly in the socio-economic field and decolonization  have been substantial. It is this quiet  long-term work of the Organization that merits the greatest praise  particularly from the small States  which perhaps derive the greatest benefit from long-term development programmes.248.	The increasing degree of economic  legal  scientific and humanitarian co-operation of nations taking place under the aegis of the United Nations is proof of the fulfilment of the many purposes of the Charter at the basic level of human endeavour. Although such co-operation rarely elicits sensational recognition such as is bestowed upon purely political issues  nevertheless the importance of these developments must be recognized.249.	Although the same cannot be said of the Organization's efforts in handling the major problems which still confront the world community  the role it has played in peace-keeping is surely constructive and it can  if we wish it  become truly the custodian of world peace and security. In this connexion  one basic fact we should bear in mind is that the armed conflicts of the past 28 years have not led to a world war. That does not mean that the armed conflicts of these later years are inconsiderable and that the lives lost and resources wasted should be ignored. However  given the technology of modern warfare we must be thankful that we have not had to face extinction through a nuclear holocaust. The United Nations has played an essential  role in this regard  and if we are willing to strengthen and consolidate its machinery it can yet become the catalyst of differences which arise among nations  the protector of human rights and the promoter of the economic and social well- being of peoples throughout the world  which was the vision of those who created it.250.	In sum  if we have the courage and determination to back this Organization with unselfish support in all its efforts towards the full realization of the aims and principles of the Charter  it can become a dynamic instrument of Governments for collective security  peace and progress.251.	The Secretary-General has significantly posed two vital questions to us all: ""What kind of world organization do we need? And what kind of world organization are Governments prepared in reality to accept?"" [See A/9100/ Add J  p. 8.] The greater effectiveness of the United Nations and the enhancement of its image must ultimately depend on the answers we give to those questions. To my mind  the universality of our Organization  the common need for collective security  peace  justice and equality and the necessity for concerted action to face vital world problems in an effective manner point to the answers to the questions the Secretary-General has posed. The need to develop a new concept of allegiance to the United Nations as an authority representing the world community is obvious and pressing if peace and justice are to prevail in the world.252.	The continued existence of colonialism is not compatible with international peace  much less with freedom and justice. It is a fact that much progress has been made towards decolonization since the adoption of the epoch- making General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples  which gave a new impetus to the application of the concept of self-determination to colonial peoples.253.	However  the decolonization process has encountered several setbacks because of the outmoded policies of two Member States of this Organization — Portugal and South Africa. The recent commendable efforts exerted by the Secretary-General with regard to the granting of self- determination to Namibia have not produced progress. Full implementation of resolution 1514 (XV) thus remains a major challenge to the United Nations.254.	In that respect my delegation is anxious to see progress sharply accelerated. The world has confirmed the undeniable truth that  once a people has expressed a desire to assume the duties and responsibilities of independence  denial of freedom thereafter compels recourse to force  which immediately develops into an active threat to the maintenance of peace and security.255.	Cyprus having itself emerged from colonial rule  it has all along fully supported the struggle for the granting of independence to colonial countries and the ending of the abhorrent practices of apartheid in Southern Rhodesia  Namibia and South Africa. We stand in full solidarity with all peoples still deprived of their inalienable rights to freedom. independence and human dignity and have consistently fully implemented the concerted efforts and sanctions of the international community as stated in the relevant United Nations resolutions.256.	We attach great importance to the upholding and safeguarding of human rights and to the protection of the individual from all forms of discrimination. We cannot therefore but deplore the denial of human rights prevailing* in Southern Rhodesia  Namibia  South Africa and the so- called Portuguese Territories. It is our earnest hope that the colonial Powers will seize upon this new climate of cooperation and negotiation and — on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the launching of the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination — heed public opinion. In so doing they will no doubt contribute to world peace and to their own true national interests and will at the same time observe with deeds this landmark in the quest for human rights.257.	In the same way as colonialism is not compatible with peace  economic deprivation is not conducive to world order  peace and justice. The recent reports with regard to the question of economic development indicate that thestandard of living of millions of people is pitifully low  that conditions of under nourishment and illiteracy are still conspicuously prevalent and that the gap between developed and developing countries has further widened. The First United Nations Development Decade  launched in 1961 by a hopeful world for the creation of conditions of economic stability and well-being ensuring a minimum standard of living for the peoples of the developing countries  fell short of its goals  and a review and appraisal undertaken this year of the Second United Nations Development Decade of the 1970s indicates that the growth rates of the developing countries burdened by debts  scarcity of aid and drought  are well below the average 6 per cent target rate set for the Second Decade and below the average achieved in 1960.258.	Those disappointing reports  coming at a critical time when the economic world is beset by uncertainty of monetary and trade interchanges  present a challenge of the highest magnitude to the efforts of the international community to bring about an equitable distribution of wealth and to secure economic  monetary and social order. We welcome the negotiations now under way regarding the structure and future shape of the international monetary system and on world-wide trading arrangements  which undoubtedly will have a very important bearing upon the future of development in general and of the developing countries in particular. In addition  we agree that the concept of collective economic security should be further advanced. Co-operative international action in the economic field is vital to mankind — as  indeed  is international action in securing peace — and whatever difficulties may be encountered the United Nations remains the instrument best suited for universal economic co-operation and for the solution of outstanding international problems.259.	The growing realization of the international community that many problems facing the world cannot be finally dealt with within national boundaries makes the concept of collective economic security especially timely.260.	The recent monetary crisis and the drought which plagued many countries  including my own  underline the common problems and interdependence of big and small nations  rich and poor alike  and point to the necessity for collective action through the United Nations system for their solution.261.	The effective approach to the problem of the human environment and the consensus reached by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held last year in Stockholm  coupled with the efforts now under way to translate such consensus into concrete action  demonstrate the international community's willingness and ability to act when the will to act exists.262.	The United Nations determination to tackle world problems was demonstrated again on another question of vital international concern  the sea and the sea-bed  a subject marked by diverse national interests but of immense potential benefits to mankind. Marine resources will be needed urgently by a world whose population is expected to double within 30 years.263.	The law of the sea in its various aspects and  more specifically  the equitable distribution of the wealth of the sea and the sea-bed  are a field of vital concern to the United Nations and one to which my Government attaches particular importance. The traditional rules of the law of the sea have to be examined afresh in the light of recent revolutionary technological changes and political developments  and have to be adjusted so as to conform to present-day realities. At the same time  particular care should be taken so as to preserve principles firmly based on law and on equity that have stood the test of time and have for centuries served mankind well.264.	One of those principles is that there should be no artificial distinction at the expense of islands between continental and insular land masses in so far as the delimitation of maritime spaces is concerned. Also  the principle of the median line should continue to be the residual rule to be applied  failing an agreement to the contrary  in matters of delimitation between States which are opposite or adjacent to each other.265.	In general  the over-all approach should be one of balancing in a fair and equitable manner the legitimate rights and expectations of States with those of the international community as a whole. It is our fervent hope  and for our part we will use our best endeavours to see that  despite the obvious complexities  the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea will be successful  and that thus the United Nations will have responded positively to the challenge it faces in this field of vital national and international concern.266.	The outstanding issues of peace and security  colonialism and the problem of economic under-development hamper the creation of the necessary international atmosphere for disarmament and frustrate efforts for the strengthening of peace.267.	Any improvement in international relations  and any progress in solving outstanding international issues  would have a favourable bearing on the solution of the disarmament problem  and vice versa  because of the inherent interdependence of these problems. There is no need to try to find out where to start  as it is obvious that the greatest efforts should be exerted in both directions for the solution of this grave problem.268.	In addition to the perils which the continuing arms race presents to world peace  it deprives mankind of vast human and natural resources urgently needed for more constructive purposes. The interrelation between economic growth and disarmament is clear and direct. In this respect  we welcome as constructive the proposal put forward by the Soviet Union for reduction of the military budgets of the permanent members of the Security Council and the utilization of part of what is thus saved for development assistance [A/9191]  Such a proposal  once given more specific content and if generally accepted  would constitute an important step in the right direction. At the same time  we wish to commend those countries which already are making available substantial sums in development aid.269.	The agreement worked out between the United States and the Soviet Union at the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in Helsinki has given rise to optimistic expectations among the peoples of the world. With the spirit of co-operation now prevalent  it is hoped that a determined effort will be made to stop the arms race  which has already reached unmanageable dimensions.270.	The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction is an example showing that real progress can be made  and it is to be hoped that the international community will soon move towards an effective prohibition of chemical warfare. In a humane world society which is devoting such consistent efforts in the United Nations to helping mankind in combating disease and protecting the environment  the development of enormous quantities of paralysing chemicals for the purpose of using them against people of other nations is a tragic contradiction.271.	The question of nuclear testing is another area in which urgent progress is needed. In addition to the Treaty banning nuclear-weapon tests in the atmosphere  concluded 10 years ago   the time has now come  especially because of the favourable climate resulting from the detente  for a general agreement to stop all nuclear testing.272.	Disarmament will  it may be hoped  open the way towards the creation and development of a permanent world peace force  a force accountable to the United Nations which gradually can become stronger than any national power or coalition of powers  a force whose one and only task will be to preserve world peace against infringement by any nation  great or small. The creation of a permanent peace-keeping force underlines the great importance of defining aggression so that objective criteria and guide-lines may be used by the Security Council for identifying aggression. We welcome the further progress achieved by the Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression  meeting in Geneva last May  in defining aggression  and express our confidence that a consensus will be reached during its next session. The strengthening of the peace-keeping and peace-making functions of the United Nations is an essential requirement and an inducement for disarmament  for the latter cannot be realistically promoted without parallel efforts towards the creation of a world body whose purpose is to ensure international peace and security.273.	Another item offering the possibility of fruitful results at the present session is the draft convention on the prevention and punishment of crimes against diplomatic agents and other internationally protected persons. The speedy adoption of this convention  coupled with its acceptance by the largest possible number of States will  we trust  mark yet another step forward by the international community in the already respectable series of measures taken in the legal field towards the observance of international legal order.274.	We also hope that constructive steps will be taken during this session towards measures to prevent international terrorism and  at the same time  towards understanding and alleviating the causes which bring it about.275.	The crisis that still persists in the Middle East  indirectly affecting all States in the area  is a source of deep concern to us. Along with so many others  we have supported the efforts of the United Nations to secure peace in that part of the world. Those efforts must continue and they must be intensified. The need for them grows greater as the issues become more clouded by suspicion  distrust and fear. We believe that  if success is yet to attend those efforts  a greater willingness must be shown by the parties directly involved for the solution of their problem on the basis of the Charter and the relevant United Nations resolutions  and specifically Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  of 22 November 1967. That resolution contains in a balanced manner all the elements necessary for a just settlement and takes into consideration the legitimate rights and interests of all concerned  including those of the Palestinians. A basic principle in this regard is that the acquisition of territories by force must not and cannot be condoned or recognized.276.	It is not my intention to dwell at any considerable length on the question of Cyprus  a subject which has been before the United Nations for several years. It has been debated at length both before the Security Council — which is still seized of it — and in the General Assembly  which in 1965 adopted resolution 2077 (XX)  reaffirming the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus. I would  however  naturally consider it appropriate to inform the Assembly of how 'he situation is at present.277.	The local talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots  which were resumed last year in an expanded form  as suggested by the Secretary-General of the United Nations  with the participation of the Secretary-General's Special Representative and in the presence of constitutional experts from Greece and Turkey  have continued in an effort to reach a peaceful and agreed solution of the constitutional problem confronting Cyprus. To some extent  progress has been achieved and certain points of disagreement have been bridged.278.	But there is still a serious gap and divergence of views on cardinal points  one of which is the demand of the Turkish Cypriot community for unrestricted local autonomy.279.	While this is not at the present juncture the appropriate forum to enter into the details  I would simply say that in fact we have offered to the Turkish Cypriot community  which forms no more than 18 per cent of the population  far greater degree of local autonomy than has been given by any other State to any section of its population in similar or analogous situations. What the Government cannot do is to go beyond the safety zone necessary for the preservation of the independent and sovereign Republic of Cyprus. It is impossible  therefore  to subscribe to provisions in the Constitution of such abnormal divisiveness and patent unworkability as would inevitably disrupt the State  with all the dire consequences of strife and conflict and with the disaster of partition looming on the horizon.280.	Our stand is for solidarity and co-operation between the two communities in goodwill and mutual respect in a sovereign  independent and unitary State. In this way Cyprus can become a link of unity and not an arena of conflict in the region and in the world. This is our position  which is consistent with the principles of the Charter and the United Nations resolutions on Cyprus and in keeping with the world trends of today. 281.	I wish once again to express our deepest appreciation and thanks to the Secretary-General and his collaborators in New York and Cyprus for their untiring efforts in the cause of peace in Cyprus  as well as to the Commander and the members of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus. We are also grateful to those countries which through their contributions in men and money make possible the continuation of the Force. We sincerely hope that it will not be too long before circumstances will permit the Force to be no longer necessary  thus relieving all concerned of this burden which they have been bearing so nobly.282.	It is becoming increasingly realized that a greater sense of unity and co-operation between all nations and peoples of the world  cutting across ideological or other boundaries  is now a demanding necessity in order to meet the global problems which threaten humanity as a whole in its fragile environment on this planet  for the dangers to all nations are common and so is the concern  calling for common action through an enlivened and activated United Nations.283.	Cyprus  with its very modest means  has always supported any world-unifying effort. In this spirit we salute with hope the present Assembly as the Assembly of transition from cold war antagonism to world cooperation in a dawning new era of positive human endeavour and achievement."
"29",1816,"DDR",28,1973,"﻿1.	The membership of the German Democratic Republic in the United Nations  acquired only a few days ago  provides an opportunity for its Minister for Foreign Affairs to outline for the first time before this world forum the policy of the socialist German State and its position on important current tasks and problems of the United Nations.2.	In the view of the German Democratic Republic its admission to the United Nations is an historic event  for it implies that the post-war period in Europe has come to an end. I ask representatives to remember that the first documents in which the Powers of the anti-Hitler coalition called for the establishment of an Organization of the United Nations were  at the same time  documents of the fight against Fascist German imperialism. Exactly three decades ago  in October 1943  the Allied Powers adopted the Moscow Declaration on General Security  in which they pledged their determination to enforce the unconditional surrender of Hitler fascism. At the same time  they recognized:""... the necessity of establishing... a general international organization based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving States and open to membership by all such States  large or small  for the maintenance of international peace and security.""3.	In the three decades from October 1943 to October 1974  profound changes have taken place on the international scene. To bring them about the necessary conditions had to be created in Europe  and chiefly in the territory of the former German Reich. To this end the Potsdam Agreement  concluded after the end of the Hitler war  made provision for the extirpation of German militarism and nazism  the democratization of social life  the punishment of war and Nazi criminals  and the curbing of the power of monopolies. These measures were designed to guarantee that no war could ever again start from German soil.4.	The German Democratic Republic was established in October 1949 on these sound foundations. Enterprises of war and Nazi criminals had been converted into people's property through a referendum; a democratic agrarian reform had given land to the peasants; Nazi and militarist elements were removed from all public posts; war and Nazi criminals were strictly punished; and the school and education system was remodelled along democratic lines. The evil spirit of racial hatred and chauvinism was thoroughly uprooted.5.	In the face of massive war destruction of production facilities and all sorts of buildings  most essential human rights such as the fundamental social rights of the working people  the right to work and to employment  the right to education and to recreation  the rights of women and of youth  were implemented in the most adverse material circumstances.6.	It was on that anti-Fascist  democratic basis that the German Democratic Republic subsequently developed into a socialist State. Its people have chosen for ever the socialist system of society and have thus exercised their right of self-determination guaranteed in the Charter of the United Nations. The German Democratic Republic owes its rise to their efforts and to its firm and indestructible alliance with the Soviet Union and the other socialist States.7.	Upon his election as our country's first President  the late Wilhelm Pieck  a proven fighter against fascism and war  formally declared before the supreme representative body of the German Democratic Republic on 11 October 1949:""We are well aware of the great responsibility which the German people have to accept because they aided and abetted Hitler's barbarous war  and we are also aware of our obligation for reparation towards the countries afflicted by the Hitler war. We will fulfil in good faith the obligations placed upon us under the Potsdam Agreement  whereby we seek to regain the world's confidence and join the comity of peace-loving democratic nations.""8.	As the State Secretary to the first President of the German Democratic Republic  I am particularly pleased and highly privileged to declare to the General Assembly of the United Nations that the German Democratic Republic has fulfilled that pledge with honour. In compliance with the Potsdam Agreement  it has fulfilled conscientiously its obligation for reparation towards the Soviet Union and the Polish People's Republic. With regard to the Polish  Czech and Slovak peoples  who were so often the first victims of aggression by greater Germany  the German Democratic Republic took decisive steps for a genuine reconciliation. As early as 1950  in the Treaty of Goerlitz  it recognized without reservation the frontier with the Polish People's Republic on the Oder and Neisse rivers. At the same time  in the first Treaty it concluded with the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  it condemned the diktat of Munich with all its consequences  and it pledged to refrain from making any territorial claims or pressing for frontier revision with regard to those two States.9.	Acting in that way more than two decades ago  the German Democratic Republic made contributors to European security which remain effective examples in the light of recent European developments.10.	Since its inception  the German Democratic Republic has practised active solidarity with the Asian  African and Latin American peoples defending themselves against imperialist aggression or resisting colonialist repression. Never has it paid only verbal tribute to the struggle against colonialism and racism  but has always considered it its sacred duty to support that struggle by action.11.	In the German Democratic Republic there are no political or economic groups whose drive for profit and exports would bar a policy aimed at implementing the resolutions and recommendations of the United Nations. Nor are there any motivations for the German Democratic Republic to uphold the aims of those States which are still pursuing colonialist or neo-colonialist policies.12.	Even when it was net a Member of the United Nations  the German Democratic Republic consistently implemented all resolutions and recommendations of the United Nations condemning colonialism and neocolonialism and on the boycotting of racism regimes.13.	To ensure durable peace and security  to support the   peoples fighting for their freedom and independence  to bewilling to establish relations of peaceful coexistence with States of different political and social systems: those are the aims and principles of the foreign policy of the German Democratic Republic  which it has pursued and observed ever since its foundation.14.	The admission of the German Democratic Republic to the United Nations has occurred at a time of international detente  to which the German Democratic Republic  has made essential contributions. At present  European peoples and States are making efforts to ensure that their continent  which was twice in this century the source and scene of world wars  will become at long last a centre of detente and peace in the world.15.	A representative of the socialist peace policy cannot ignore in this context that German imperialism and militarism  pursuing programmes of conquest as it did  was the main aggressor in both World Wars of this century. With their policies of non-recognition of frontiers  of armamentand of revanche  its protagonists were implicated in the failure and break-down of the League of Nations as a peace organization.16.	Having drawn these lessons from history  the German Democratic Republic pursues a foreign policy of peace and international understanding which is in full harmony with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Its membership in the United Nations now offers the German Democratic Republic new opportunities for effectively developing this policy of peaceful coexistence and international peace in the interests of its own people.17.	The current international situation offers good opportunities to settle international issues  however complicated  by negotiation based on the principles of the peaceful coexistence of States with different social and political systems. The Charter of the United Nations and its strict observance are a solid basis for that.18.	Very convincing evidence to this effect is  in the view of the German Democratic Republic  the significant Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War concluded between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America.  The Agreement does not endanger  but increases  the security of every country. It does not impair  but promotes  the process of detente and peaceful coexistence between States  and therefore fully meets the interest of all peoples in peace.19.	The admission of the German Democratic Republic and of the Federal Republic of Germany to the United Nations was preceded by the signing of international treaties in which the inviolability of frontiers and of the territorial status quo in Europe is recognized. The treaties were concluded by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  the Polish People's Republic and the German Democratic Republic with the Federal Republic of Germany. They fix in binding terms of international law the frontiers and territories of the States as they have emerged as a result of the Second World War and of post-war developments.20.	The international relations of States can only serve detente and peaceful co-operation if they rest on the generally binding principles of the United Nations Charter. This applies without restriction also to relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Therefore the Treaty on the Principles of Relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany  commits both States to be guided by the purposes and principles laid down in the Charter of the United Nations  in particular by the principle of the sovereign equality of all States. It is equally important that the inviolability  now and in the future  of the frontier between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany and the obligation of both States to respect fully each other's territorial integrity have been affirmed by international law. The Treaty has no time limit. It contains nothing that could call in question the finality of the provisions agreed upon or could give them a provisional character  such as the character of a so-called modus vivendi    21.	Consequently  the Treaty between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany corresponds to the irreversible historical realities that have emerged on German soil from the Second World War and from post-war development. The German Reich  founded in 1871 in blood and iron  launched two world wars which claimed over 70 million human lives. That imperialist German Reich perished in ashes  blood and ruins in 1945 and its generals signed the unconditional surrender demanded in the Moscow Declaration of the Allied Powers.22.	For a quarter of a century two sovereign German States  independent of each other and having diametrically opposed social systems  have been in existence. The German Democratic Republic is a State of peace  democracy and socialism which has absolutely nothing in common with the imperialist nature of the German Reich. It has broken for ever with the fateful German militarist past. In the German Democratic Republic there is developing a socialist German nation  closely associated with the peoples of the socialist community. From the antagonistic character of the social and political orders  it follows conclusively that between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany a unification will never be possible. But what is possible  and necessary  are good-neighbourly relations of peaceful coexistence between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany in the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. Such durable relations of peaceful coexistence between the two German States will have a beneficial effect not only in Europe but also in world-wide international relations and organizations.23.	There is no doubt that the relaxation of tension in Europe has especially been promoted by the Quadripartite Agreement on West Berlin concluded between the Soviet Union  the United States  the United Kingdom and France. To this Agreement the German Democratic Republic has made its constructive contribution. Any assessment of this contribution will have to take into account that West Berlin is situated about 200 kilometres from the frontier with the Federal Republic of Germany and amid the territory of the German Democratic Republic. All questions of civilian transit traffic to and from West Berlin could therefore be settled only in consultation and agreement with the German Democratic Republic. In each phase of the often complicated negotiation of the West Berlin Agreement the German Democratic Republic displayed an attitude that was first and foremost determined by its interest in a progressing European detente. By submitting proposals and draft treaties and negotiating in a spirit of goodwill  the German Democratic Republic later very much facilitated the conclusion of the Transit Agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany and of arrangements with the Senate of West Berlin.24.	The German Democratic Republic is equally broad- minded in implementing the treaties and agreements. To give members just one example  permit me to bring to your notice that over 14 million citizens of Western countries  including the Federal Republic of Germany and of the Western sectors of Berlin  have visited the German Democratic Republic between 1 January 1972 and 25 September 1973. Nineteen and one half million persons passed in transit to and from West Berlin through the German Democratic Republic's territory in that period. Three and a quarter million citizens of the German Democratic Republic visited Western countries  including the Federal Republic and West Berlin in the same period. And iii the same period again  21.5 million citizens of the German Democratic Republic travelled to socialist countries  while 18.5 million nationals of these socialist countries visited the German Democratic Republic. All in all  the total of journeys across the frontiers of the German Democratic Republic in those 21 months is 76.7 million. I ask members to consider when judging these figures in the millions that the German Democratic Republic itself has only 17 million inhabitants. All these figures in my view are impressive and tell their own tale; they spare my commenting on all sorts of unserious assertions.25.	On the same day on which the twenty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly was opened  the second phase of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe started. It is not too much to say that Europe stands on the threshold of a new era — an era of peaceful coexistence and peaceful co-operation  which is important for the improvement of the international climate  too. In addition to two world wars  many colonial wars originated in Europe. It is therefore in the interest of all States of our globe that  in the wake of constructive policies  peace and co-operation should at last emanate from the European continent. The peoples and States of all continents will undoubtedly benefit when the Conference decides that the indispensable basic principles for security and co-operation should be binding on all participating countries.26.	Detente in Europe will improve chances to contain hotbeds of tension in other parts of the world. It will prove once more that political settlements of long-standing disputes are possible and useful. It will check or hinder those forces that are seeking to fuel tensions for aggressive and annexationist aims. Ensured security and co-operation in Europe will — not least among the results — be of use to the Asian  African and Latin American countries in the solution of the economic  scientific and technological problems they are facing.27.	Precisely for this reason the achievements of the last few years in the direction of detente  security and co-operation must not be relinquished  but firmly consolidated as a basis and model for new gains of peace and understanding among the peoples.28.	The German Democratic Republic views the United Nations as the most important international organ for guaranteeing security and maintaining world peace. The people and Government of the German Democratic Republic whole-heartedly subscribe to the aim set out in the preamble of the Charter of the United Nations  ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war""  and they will employ all the powers and abilities at their command so that this aim will be achieved. To work for this nobleand lofty purpose  what is required is the strict observance  rather than the revision  of the Charter.29.	The evolution of the international situation since the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security was adopted by the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly in 1970 [resolution 2734 (XXV]  has confirmed the programmatic substance and topicality of that basic document. Significant progress has been achieved in the implementation of the principles of the United Nations in international life. Yet much remains to be done.30.	The German Democratic Republic supports the resolution on the non-use of force in international relations and on the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty- seventh session [resolution 2936 (XXVII)} at the initiative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It considers that the Security Council should  pursuant to that resolution  take a decision binding on all States Members of the United Nations. That would be a highly effective step towards ensuring international security  particularly since an obligation to renounce the use of force would be accompanied by a ban on the most threatening form of force  the use of nuclear weapons. In a large number of international instruments and agreements of the recent past  the importance of the renunciation of force has been reaffirmed and underlined. Hence  a decision of the Security Council on the prohibition of the use of force and nuclear weapons for all time would positively meet the requirements of international development.31.	To be durable  political detente needs to be complemented by corresponding agreements on disarmament measures. The arms race is not only a persisting threat to peace  but an immense material burden on the peoples. While huge sums are spent on manufacturing weapons to kill people  many countries have a shortage of social institutions and educational facilities  and millions of human beings suffer want. That is why we welcome the proposal of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations should deal with the reduction by 10 per cent of the military budgets of the permanent members of the Security Council [A/9191]. All States which have major economic and military potentials should follow such an exemplary approach with corresponding cuts in their military budgets. In our view  the proposal of the Soviet Union constitutes a genuine chance to translate the declarations on disarmament into practical disarmament measures directly benefiting the peoples and developing countries. To contain the arms race is therefore an urgent  humanitarian task and an imperative of humanity.32.	We fully share the position of the overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations that the time is ripe for a world disarmament conference. Such a conference could thoroughly discuss international problems and negotiate agreements which promote the basic and primary goal — general and complete disarmament-and provide for effective partial measures of arms limitation. A world disarmament conference would be commensurate with the paramount importance of the problem and make possible a universal and equal participation of all States. Questions of disarmament concern the interests and obligations of all States irrespective of their size or level of economic or other development.33.	The United Nations has successfully carried out a number of important conferences in the fields of international law and environmental protection. So we think that there is no reason to be pessimistic about the eventual course of the world disarmament conference. The conference will surely have difficult and complex problems to consider; but important agreements such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction [see resolution 2826 (XXVI)] have been reached although their subject matters were complicated. These examples allow us to expect a successful course for the disarmament conference if all participating Governments heed the wish of their peoples for peace and security.34.	The elimination of sources of conflict is an indispensable condition for the recovery of the international situation. Paragraph 5 of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security stipulates that the territory of a State must not be occupied illegally by use of force. Contrary to this stipulation and in violation of resolution 242 (1967) adopted by the Security Council  Israel still holds Arab territory under occupation and is thus responsible for the fact that this dangerous source of war still exists.35.	The withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the occupied Arab territories and respect for the independence and legitimate rights of the States and peoples of the area  including the Arab people of Palestine — only a political arrangement including these conditions will lead to the settlement of the Middle East conflict in conformity with the Security Council resolution.36.	The German Democratic Republic  together with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and other States of the socialist community  is convinced that it is necessary and possible to extend the zone of detente to cover the whole world. For this reason we sincerely support the aspirations of the peoples of Asia for a system of collective security in the region  and we note with satisfaction that circumstances for achieving this aim have essentially improved of late.37.	The war in Indo-China for many years darkened the international situation and permanently threatened to engulf mankind in a world-wide conflict. Despite much resistance  the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam  signed at Paris on 27 January 1973  has now been achieved. Those who were putting up resistance to the Agreement on Viet-Nam until the last minute are also those who continue to violate it and to launch military actions. In our view  it is now of the utmost importance to ensure strict observance of the Agreement on restoring peace in Viet-Nam.38.	As it did in the hard days of fighting  the German Democratic Republic continues to side in firm solidarity with the Viet-Namese people now that the tasks of reconstruction of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam have to be tackled.39.	The German Democratic Republic stands consistently for the recognition of the right of the peoples of Indochina to determine their destinies themselves and to restore a just peace to Indo-China as a whole.40.	The German Democratic Republic supports the just demand of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Reconstruction of Korea be dissolved immediately. The United Nations flag should no longer be used by foreign troops stationed in South Korea. The so-called United Nations Command should be abolished. All foreign troops-should be withdrawn from South Korea.41.	An event important for the normalization of the situation on the Indian subcontinent and for the establishment of relations of peaceful coexistence between the States in Asia is  in the opinion of the German Democratic Republic  the recent agreement between India and Pakistan. In this context I wish to record the hope that the overdue admission of the People's Republic of Bangladesh to the United Nations can now take place.42.	The Government of the German Democratic Republic is highly interested in international co-operation in the fields of economics  science and technology and in other areas. It believes  however  that a secure peace is the most vital prerequisite to solving the problems the peoples are facing in building their social and cultural life. Here we think  in particular  of the economic and social problems of the developing countries.43.	Different circumstances prevailing in the various regions must  of course  not be left out of account in endeavours to assist in the extension of the process of detente to all continents. In Africa  detente cannot mean tolerating Portuguese colonial rule or accepting the policy of apartheid in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia — quite the contrary. To eliminate colonialism and racism is an indispensable element of detente on the African continent. Detente will be furthered as it becomes possible to enforce the principles of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems in international life. Observance of the generally accepted rules of international law in relations between socialist and capitalist States will make it m6re difficult for forces pursuing colonialist  racist or social oppression to keep foreign peoples under their yoke.44.	In keeping with decisions of the General Assembly and of the Security Council  the German Democratic Republic has for many years practised active solidarity with the African peoples fighting for their liberation. News about massacres by Portuguese mercenaries in Mozambique underlines more than ever the urgent need to overcome all forms of colonial suppression. Both in the United Nations and through other solidarity activities in support of international solidarity  the German Democratic Republic will advocate the right to self-determination of all African peoples.45.	The fact that the boycott measures decided on by the United Nations are not being complied with by some States cannot be passed over in silence. Not only is their trade with South Africa not decreasing  it is even growing. Their investments  and thus their participation  in the exploitation of the racially suppressed indigenous populations have grown enormously. Multinational monopolies are expanding their influence in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. For the sake of their profits they assist the racist regimes in repressing the indigenous populations. This practice of monopoly capitalism grossly conflicts with the demand of the African peoples to have their own natural resources and mineral riches under their own control. This demand is fully justified and should be supported in every respect by decisions and measures of the United Nations.46.	It is consistent with our views with regard to the implementation of the right of peoples to self- determination and the world-wide enforcement of human rights as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations of December 1948 that the German Democratic Republic firmly sides with the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America and supports their struggle for political and economic independence.47.	In Chile  a constitutional government  elected by the people  was ousted by a military coup d'etat. President Salvador Allende  held in high esteem all over the world  was assassinated. Bloody violence and terror have been unleashed to destroy the social progress achieved. We are convinced  however  that the Chilean people will repulse these attacks on their vital rights and finally succeed in their struggle for the right to choose their own way of development. We feel that humaneness and self- determination call for all-round support and assistance for the people of Chile in their courageous resistance. In breach of international law  acts of reprisal and violence were committed against citizens and premises of the German Democratic Republic; therefore  the Government of the German Democratic Republic was compelled to suspend diplomatic relations with Chile.48.	The German Democratic Republic has followed with the greatest attention and sympathy the Fourth Conference of Heads of State and Government of Non-Aligned Countries held in Algiers. It supports the decisions taken at that Conference with regard to the settlement of conflicts caused by imperialist aggression. It takes the same stand on the decisions of the Conference concerning the consolidation of national independence  the unrestricted control of peoples over their natural resources  the economic interests of developing countries  and respect for the sovereign equality of all States. The German Democratic Republic associates itself with the struggle of non-aligned countries against all forms of colonialist or neo-colonialist exploitation and suppression.49.	Upon being admitted to the United Nations  the German Democratic Republic formally undertook at all times to respect and observe the Charter of the United Nations  whose unchanged validity it accepts without reservation.50.	Assuming this obligation  we feel called upon to make a contribution  in keeping with our possibilities and capabilities  to the fulfilment of those great tasks which the United Nations is facing. The German Democratic Republic has always thought that the exercise of State sovereignty in our times must include readiness to engage in peaceful international co-operation. Along these lines it will assist in the implementation of the lofty humanist concepts and principles of international law enshrined in the Charter. The representatives of the German Democratic Republic are ready and determined constructively to co-operate with all representatives for the noble cause of peace  international understanding and co-operation."
"30",1834,"DEU",28,1973,"﻿Mr. President  let me begin by congratulating you most warmly on your election to this internationally very important post.3.	I speak to you as a German and a European. To be more exact  my people live in two States  but they have not ceased to regard themselves as one nation. At the same time our part of Europe is as yet not much more than an economic community  but before the end of this decade it will grow into a European union.4.	We-the representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany-are no strangers here. We have long participated in the work of the specialized agencies. We maintain good relations with nearly all Member States. Here  at United Nations Headquarters in New York  we have been shown much understanding in past years.5.	I wish to take this opportunity to thank our friends who have spoken up for us in this forum when we were not in a position to speak for ourselves. We shall not forget on whom we were able to rely.6.	But I would add immediately that we have not come here to use the United Nations as a wailing-wall for the German problems or to make claims we know cannot be met here in any case. Rather have we come to assume ourshare in the responsibility for world affairs on the basis of our convictions and within the framework of our possibilities.7.	The foundation of the United Nations and the most incisive break in German history were events which coincided in a dismal  though at the same time encouraging  manner. The recent history of my people is truly closely linked with the genesis of this world Organization.8.	Since 1945  my people and the two German States have put a considerable distance behind them. And yet our gratification over the fact that we have been given a friendly welcome here is mitigated by the division of Europe  which is glaringly manifest in Germany and which  almost three decades after the end of the war  still claims its victims.9.	Certainly  starting from that part of Europe which has been the source of so many tensions  we have initiated and developed a policy of understanding which was  and still is  to fill in the rifts left behind by the cold war.10.	We have  I feel  seen in the meantime that not only tensions but also detente can be contagious.11.	As the Federal Republic of Germany we shall-as our Foreign Minister emphasized here last week in internationally binding terms [2119th meeting] -seek to create a state of peace in Europe in which the German people also can regain their unity in free self-determination. I say this knowing very well-with all respect — that the United Nations cannot really help us in this matter.12.	The two German States  belonging as they do to different political groupings and facing the problems resulting there from  have learned that their interrelationship is today of greater importance than what is known as the ""national question"". This applies to Europe in general.13.	In spite of their different social and political systems  bound by treaty and conviction to different alliances  the two German States have resolved to embark on a policy of peaceful neighbourliness  coexistence and  we hope  cooperation. We shall therefore try to spell out peaceful coexistence German-style. But in view of the thoroughness which is said to be a German characteristic  I cannot promise that this will always be easy.14.	More importantly  the consistent renunciation of force as a means of achieving aims  of furthering one's interests  and of settling differences  was the decisive factor needed to sow the seed of detente in the heart of Europe. TheTreaties of Moscow  and Warsaw   the Treaty on the basis of our relations with the German Democratic Republic  the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin' of 3 September 1971  and soon  I hope  the treaty with Czechoslovakia  which has already been negotiated  are based on the renunciation of force.15.	Berlin  in particular  displays constructive opportunities. It no longer needs to be a source of tension in the heart of Europe. West Berlin can bank on its interests being looked after by the Federal Republic of Germany and on its protection being ensured by the three Powers that  being the supreme authority  remain directly responsible for the city's security and status. If there is anyone to appreciate what this change means  it is most certainly the one who carried responsibility as Governing Mayor of Berlin during a critical phase of its history.16.	Renunciation of force was one element of our peace policy; acceptance of the realities the other. Accepting things as they are has been a bitter pill f6r some  but it was necessary for the sake of peace. For the renunciation of force and the right attitude to reality are the two basic elements of concrete efforts to safeguard peace.17.	This prepared the way for the next step. A new foundation is to be laid for security and co-operation in Europe.18.	The bilateral renunciation of force encourages us to enter a second  multilateral phase of European diplomacy  the purpose of which will be to produce a real change in the relationship between the European States on the basis of what has come about. It will do so through growing security from military threat  through intensive economic and technological exchanges  through human contacts  through better knowledge of each other-in other words  through a state of everyday peace.19.	It would indeed be a good thing if the work done in Helsinki and now being continued in Geneva could soon end with a conference convened at a level that is commensurate with the results achieved.20.	What I am talking about here will one day be understood as a significant experiment: how States can learn to master conflicts and eliminate the use of force.21.	And if we even succeed  by means of confidence- building measures  in reducing the tremendous wastage that has been the outcome of mistrust between antagonistic systems  we should then have set a historic example.22.	Security cannot ensue from trust alone. This  too  is a reality. The reverse is also true. Confidence ensues from security.23.	A distinguished American spoke in this city of the-as he called it-impending ""nuclear death-dance"". Well  the two super-Powers  which have in their hands by far the most powerful means of destruction  recently signed an agreement which some are still trying to fathom but which is quite certainly intended to obviate the death-dance. That agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union is oriented to the principle of renunciation of force and the recognition of realities. It is  as I understand it<a piece of active coexistence and surely also a response to the demands made by the non-nuclear-weapon States at the Conference of Non-Nuclear-Weapon States  held at Geneva in 1968. On that occasion  five years ago  the nuclear- weapon States were called upon to assume concrete obligations of their own. I still hold the view today that those who have power  particularly nuclear power  do not on that account have morality  or wisdom  on their side. Big dangers to mankind emanate from the big Powers  not from the small.24.	A code of responsibilities should be defined to which the nuclear Powers should subject themselves.25.	But if the two super-Powers do not guarantee peace  who could do so in their place? The responsibility of neither of the two I have mentioned can today be assumed by anyone else  and neither of them can relinquish that responsibility.26.	Thus our world today finds its balance. But it cannot achieve that delicate balance without the specific weight of the People's Republic of China  of Japan and of the European Community. In such a system the specific role of Latin America  of the African countries  of the Asian subcontinent and the other partners in Asia becomes effective.27.	Power  I feel  cannot be quantified at will. There is a limit to its expansion-a limit where power becomes transformed into impotence. But detente is not synonymous with disengagement  and it must by no means turn into disinterest if fresh tensions are not to be created.28.	At the end of the cold war there can  in my view  be neither conquerors nor conquered. Truly  peace  if it is to be secured  must not call for victory of the one and defeat of the other  but only for the one victory of reason and moderation.29.	Incidentally  the use or threat of force should be renounced by all States-regardless of whether they possess nuclear weapons or not. If we have the determination  and the luck  this can be achieved by means of an appropriate system of international agreements.30.	The only legitimate exception would remain the right to individual and collective self-defence as embodied in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.31.	My Government is willing -- and I wish to state this clearly — to help bring about an agreement which is being prepared in the Atlantic Alliance in order to make possible a balanced reduction of forces and weapons systems. This will not be possible overnight  but we must get down to the job seriously and consistently.32.	It is not only a question of giving Europe an opportunity. It is a question of giving the world an opportunity to create conditions which will permit us to turn our attention  and to devote our national energies  to the massive problems of tomorrow. If I may pose the question  If the world does not succeed in quelling force and violence and effectively proscribing it  how will it then be capable of resolving the problems of peace which — free and remote from force — will demand the employment of all our energies?33.	In a world in which we are all increasingly dependent on each other  a policy for peace must not stop on our own doorstep. Small steps can  as experience has shown  take us quite a long way.34.	To mediation and conciliation in disputes we attach special importance. The strengthening of international jurisdiction  the consolidation and further development of international law  require  in our opinion  the active attention of this Assembly.35.	Our world is going through a process of rapid change. Many of its explosive problems and conflicts spread like epidemics  owing to the increasing proximity of States and continents. Conflicts can  as shown by the terrorism of the present time which either does not want to use or is incapable of using political means  have unforeseeable consequences owing to the vulnerability of highly developed societies.36.	The catch phrase ""preventive conflict research""  the prerequisite to ""preventive diplomacy"" as it is called  is born of the realization that it is no longer sufficient to investigate the so-called classical motives of disputes — and here I mean motives such as territorial claims  ideological domination  nationalistic ambitions  the temptations of imperialist dominance  the flaws in security systems  disturbances of the balance of power.37.	I am not preaching an existence free from conflict and free from tension. That would be an anaemic illusion. What I have in mind is the fruitless and negative conflicts which confirm to us every day that man  afraid of man  is capable of destroying himself. This opens up new and deeper areas of responsibility for conflict research.38.	I wish to state with all due clarity that human distress is conflict. Where hunger prevails  there can be no peace in the long run. Where bitter poverty prevails  there can be no justice. Where a man's very existence is threatened for want of basic daily needs  it is not permissible to speak of security. There must not be resignation in the face of destitution.39.	""Non-violence"" is a concept we owe to the man who awakened a great Member country in this Assembly; the force of that doctrine has not diminished. But the realities of today require it to be complemented by an opposite statement of fact  namely  that there is violence through tolerance  intimidation through indolence  threat through passiveness  manslaughter through immobility. We must not stop on this threshold  for it may be the threshold between survival and decline.40.	I did not make the personal acquaintance of that President of a Latin American country who lost his life through the recent coup. But I wish to emphasize most strongly that this type of solution is not the answer. Or  if you like  unfortunately it can be. But then one day it will be said that reform could only come from revolution because changes were not otherwise accepted.41.	We are becoming more and more conscious of the limits of the globe. We must not ruthlessly exhaust its resources lest we condemn ourselves to slow suicide. We must not allow the globe's biological cycles to be poisoned any further.42.	It is surely no coincidence that man today  having seen his planet from out of the depths of space  is becoming conscious of the material and biological dependence of the inhabitants of this so very small spaceship  Earth. Not only within individual countries but also on a world basis we shall — if we want to live in freedom and security-in future have to go without some things which  though economically profitable  are of questionable social value. And some of the things which appear to be economically unprofitable have become indispensable to the existence of a modern society.43.	I know that there is a tendency in some developing countries to regard the dearth of raw materials as a special kind of political opportunity  for it may here and there swing the pendulum in highly industrialized countries from surplus to shortage. But I say this: this is no ground for satisfaction. These are problems which concern us all  and not just those who come after us.44.	We must soberly appreciate that the resources of this world will suffice to give posterity an existence worthy of the modern concept of the quality of life only if we keep population growth within responsible limits and only if we achieve a larger measure of social justice in the world.45.	The depressing food situation in many parts of the world requires us to draft a world food plan so that  if in any way possible  catastrophes can be prevented by means of an integrating strategy for the production of food and its distribution.46.	Let me emphasize that we must not only establish  and very quickly  what food is needed to keep large sections of mankind from hunger  but also whether States are prepared to accept the rules required to that end.47.	On the other hand  and at the same time  we must establish what raw materials we need in order to guarantee the quality of our civilization and to improve it where possible.48.	Let me say quite frankly that  morally  it makes no difference whether a man is killed in war or is condemned to starve to death by the indifference of others. I repeat: it makes no difference morally. We shall have to decide to break with the ritualistic traditions; who proscribes war also has to proscribe hunger.49.	The United Nations  built in response to the challenge of an almost total world war  is the mirror of an age-old dream of mankind. That dream closely matches the hopes of eternal peace cherished by the nations.50.	But the Members having some 30 years of United Nations training here know at least as well as we newcomers that 1945 did not see the start of the millennium. Unfortunately  the United Nations has not-at least not yet-crystallized into the nucleus of a world government.51.	And yet mankind has brought into this Assembly of nations not only its goodwill but also many of its problems. There is not a single Member nation that left its history at home when it came here  indeed did not find its identity confirmed to some extent in this unwieldy design for a republic of nations.52.	I perceive here a convergence of the perspectives of all continents. To comprehend and to respect the diversity of life and its systems  to enable it to present itself freely  to set up standards to that end which are binding for all — this seems to me to be the mandate of the United Nations for civilization  also in future. That is our hope  at any rate.53.	It is this very diversity which gives us the right to speak of a world society. This diversity is bound up in the tension between equal sovereignty and mutual dependence in this one  troubled world.54.	Some of the criticism directed at the United Nations sounds bitter and cynical  is filled with an almost jubilant pessimism  as if it stemmed from a secret hope that the weaknesses of the Organization would refute the idea of it and its purpose. But setbacks in pursuit of an ideal do not necessarily prove that that ideal is wrong  but often merely that the road to it could be better.55.	In this respect many of the goals which the Organization has set itself have not been achieved — the goals set in the Second World War and in 1945.1 want to say that in all frankness. But we also know that this Organization has been able to prevent a great deal of misery  misfortune and death.56.	Here in this institution arguments of reason and morality have time and again and untiringly been proclaimed  arguments which have prohibited this step into the abyss. The United Nations is not a clinic where our peoples can be cured of their neuroses by patient world doctors. Yet it can help to create more solidarity among nations.57.	That solidarity is the fundamental requirement of a world society  and it is the prerequisite to its survival. That is my deep conviction. I am not speaking of the Utopian realm of the equality of all nations and of all men. But anyone who has never dreamt this dream of equality knows little of the will for justice which  beyond all barriers of continents  race and religion  is perhaps the true binding power among us human beings.58.	There is solidarity  but not enough of it. I ask for more sympathy for the victims of armed conflicts that threaten to break out anew in this or that corner of the world. But neither should we forget the victims of non-war which sometimes can be just as brutal. On the road to world citizenship we must practice solidarity. We shall not be able to speak of a humane world order until the principle of justice is universally understood.59.	Permit me to say on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany that we shall support United Nations resolutions aimed at liquidating the anachronistic remnants of colonialism. This applies not least to our neighbouring continent of Africa. Without any addition and without any reservation I declare that we condemn racism as inhuman and as the cause of the most terrible crimes. Our own history has been a bitter experience on that score.60.	Moreover  those who take their place in this Assembly must also adopt a position on the moral aspects of international coexistence even when their own national interests are not directly affected. In this process they come face to face with two recognized principles both of which serve the cause of peace: the first is the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of others; the other is the principle of the universality of human rights. Not only States but also individual citizens can invoke the fundamental rights embodied in the United Nations Charter. It is peace that benefits if people and information can move as freely as possible across boundaries.61.	I would add that if we speak our mind on violations of individual human rights  on the suppression of the freedom to express critical opinions  on artificial barriers at national frontiers to the exchange of people and information  the decisive criterion for that attitude will not be whether the offender is an ally or one with whom we have friendly contractual ties  or whether it is a less friendly Power. What matters is that we do not remain indifferent on these questions — even if some details should at first sight or in general be hard to assess 62.	A policy of peace  solidarity and renunciation of force is indivisible. The conflict in South-East Asia has not yet burnt itself out and the smouldering conflict in the Middle East has not yet been defused. In both cases the main thing is that those concerned should talk  not shoot.63.	I wish to stress our interest in a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the Middle East. That is the interest of the Federal Republic of Germany. My Government shares the hope that the international community will not relinquish the possibilities of mediation. My Government also feels that it is primarily direct peace talks between the Arab countries concerned and Israel that v will  best secure a balance of the elementary interests of both sides.64.	The struggle for peace and the fight against misery require us to recognize that in the one world we live in our fate is  after all  indivisible. Here  too  mankind is therefore under the compulsion to establish solidarity. Where else than in this United Nations should we be able to discuss freely new forms of vital co-operation?65.	No nation should live at the expense of another. Anyone who refuses to accept this principle may be the instrument of our having to pay dearly for. it. National egoism is no shield. On the contrary  it is an obstacle to that very solidarity which  in the last report  is the best guardian of natural and legitimate national interests as well.66.	We should not speak of ""young"" and ""old"" nations. It is more realistic to distinguish between young and old nationalisms. Ours  in Europe  are old  although a century or two are only a couple of short breaths in history. But believe me  the wild dream that the destiny of a nation can be fulfilled only in unbridled nationalism has in our case completely faded away. We learned from painful experience that there have to be more rational  more reliable forms for the lives* of nations-and that such forms actually exist  namely  good neighbourliness.67.	The countries of Western Europe have resolved to establish the first regional community that is more than a classical alliance and at the same time does not imply that its members subject themselves to a ideological rules. Our aim is to achieve if possible in this decade the union of our economies  our currencies  our social systems and our foreign policies  and - as dictated to us by the signs of our time -- our security.68.	The membership of the Federal Republic which I represent  also strengthens the presence of Europe in the United Nations. We are sure it will also be of benefit to others.69.	The European Community  we hope  can become an example of economic achievement and social balance. It establishes itself as a power without imperial pretensions. The European union will be a power of peace and will be outward-looking.70.	The Federal Republic of Germany has declared in its Constitution its willingness to transfer sovereign rights to supranational organizations and it has placed international law above national law and made it directly applicable. This expresses the realization that the sovereignty of the individual and of nations can be secured only in larger communities  that the meaning and fulfilment of history can no longer be attributed to the nation-State.71.	Thus I end my speech with a plea: let us all together be on our guard against making sacred a concept which I regard as perhaps the most dubious legacy of European history: nationalism  which has claimed millions and millions of human lives and under whose banner fertile country has been devastated  thriving cities destroyed  peoples exterminated  and a whole civilization — our own- nearly swept away.72.	Europe has ceased to pretend that it is the measure of things for the rest of the world. But it has occasion to warn the nations of the world about the great error which almost brought about its destruction: negative nationalism. And I believe we have to a large extent shaken off that hypnosis.73.	The nation no longer finds its security in isolated sovereignty. In actual fact  isolation creates dependencies which have ceased to have anything to do with enlightened sovereignty. We need the larger community which gives us peace  security and  hence  freedom.74.	There is  perhaps  not yet ""the world free from war"" nor ""the world-wide rule of reason"" enunciated by the President of the United States on 26 June 1945 after the proclamation of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco's opera house. But mankind must not allow itself to become paralysed in the face of gigantic  seemingly insoluble problems. What we need now is a programme of new confidence in man's abilities.75.	Therefore  I make this plea.76.	Let us courageously and jointly venture forth on a new road to the great goals of eliminating conflicts  bringing armaments under control  making peace safer.77.	Let us courageously and jointly fight for universal recognition of the renunciation of force as a principle for the solution of political problems.78.	Let us courageously and jointly-and I hope we will be many-work untiringly to ensure that human rights and fundamental freedoms are respected and may be exercised all over the world.79.	Let us courageously and jointly-and I hope we will be many-fight to defend the right of nations freely to decide their own destiny and to ensure that the remnants of colonialism are removed and that all forms of racism are banned.80.	Let us courageously and jointly promote the further development of international law  in particular by an effective convention against terrorism.81.	Let us courageously and jointly do what is necessary to sustain the viability of the world we live in by protecting the natural environment and-partly by intensifying and widening scientific exchanges — securing for mankind conditions of a quality that will make life worth living.82.	And let us courageously and jointly  in addition to our endeavours to foster the further development of world trade  make fresh efforts to intensify economic cooperation and development; and  above all  let us in this way combine all our energies and declare war irrevocably on hunger around the world.83.	Man's ability to apply his faculty of reason has made the United Nations possible. Man's propensity for being irrational makes it necessary. Reason will have won the field if one day all States and regions come to live and work together as world neighbours in accordance with the principles of the United Nations.84.	That will not happen in my lifetime  but I want to do what I can to make it possible. And I exhort us all to give every assistance we can  progressing step by step  to ease the task of future generations."
"31",1938,"DNK",28,1973,"﻿86.	Mr. President  I am happy to extend to you my warm congratulations on your election to the Presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We rejoice in the honour thus bestowed on you personally and on your country  Ecuador. We are fully confident that you will guide the affairs of this Assembly with impartiality  and we assure you of our full co-operation.87.	In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General presents a penetrating analysis of the situation  objectives and potentialities of the United Nations. We would be well advised to study closely his important observations and to consider carefully the entire range of problems raised by the Secretary-General.88.	Over the years we have become accustomed to hearing much criticism of the work of the United Nations. Our Organization and the tangible results we achieve are often looked upon with impatience and disappointment. To mention but a few of the shortcomings pointed out to us: our results fall short of expectations; we speak too much and act too little; the provisions of the Charter are inadequate; our activities should be expanded or reduced  or new organs should be created.89.	This impatience is understandable; it reflects the uneasiness or even insecurity  but also the hopes  prevalent in a time marked by new departures.90.	The United Nations was founded 28 years ago. The world Organization was the fruit of the aspirations and resolve of a horrified mankind to create  by reason and humanity  a world of peaceful and ordered coexistence of States and nations. The purposes and principles of the Charter have proved to be of durable value. The international machinery which has since evolved will continue to be an indispensable framework and an essential precondition for genuine international solidarity. However  it is not enough to support the United Nations in words. And it is not beneficial to misuse the vast potentialities of the Organization for campaigns in pursuit of narrow and nationalistic aims. If we were to take stock of the situation  we should learn that the constant and considerate application of the United Nations machinery is the best way in which to enrich our heritage.91.	At the same time  we must remain responsive to constructive criticism and steadily prove able to adapt our Organization to the ever changing challenges. Since the Charter was signed  many years ago  the world has changed more than in any other period of the same length. The relatively static social pattern has been replaced almost everywhere by mobility and new departures  often in the  face of considerable opposition from the established society. A new generation has grown up which questions our very objectives — a generation to which the machinery we have provided is a matter of course; a generation which measures our performance principally in the light of the capability of the United Nations to offer the individual equitable conditions  freedom  security and dignity; a generation which insists upon our Organization being able to add to international relations a human dimension consonant with the ideals which all human civilizations have evolved.92.	We are facing a dual challenge: to safeguard and further develop a harmonious co-operation within the family of nations  while linking to our aspirations and our decisions the human dimension which alone can enhance the quality of life of the individual.93.	If we attempted to evaluate the present situation we could perhaps say that it is characterized by a growing recognition of the need for well-balanced efforts-at the global  regional and bilateral levels-to tackle fundamental problems which in reality affect us all and whose solution is a key to safeguarding and humanizing our existence. We must also realize that at the same time the situation is characterized by the lack of resolve with which we transform our recognition into practical action.94.	In the political field  positive features which previously were just traceable have become much more distinct. The favourable development in relations between the major Powers is continuing. And in my part of the world  in Europe  further efforts towards detente have led to the gratifying result that we were able a few days ago to welcome the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic as Members of the United Nations. The importance of the process which paved the way to the admission of the two German States cannot be overrated. The mainspring has been the initiatives taken and persistently pursued by the great statesman who has just addressed this Assembly  Chancellor Willy Brandt  and by the Federal Government.95.	In Europe  a noteworthy event since our last General Assembly session has been the enlargement of the European Community by three new countries: Ireland  the United Kingdom and my own country. The developments manifested in this enlargement are of vital concern to the individual human being in a part of the world which twice in one generation has been embroiled in devastating wars. This dynamic evolution results from a recognition of our identity and oar responsibility towards ourselves and towards the world at large. In accentuating community coherence  the very foundation of which is our democratic institutions  we do not forget our relations with and responsibilities towards the outside world. We welcome this  as it has consistently been the policy of Denmark to promote and develop open-mindedness in our relations with the entire world.96.	Particularly in relation to the United States  the European Community is engaged in a dialogue in which we have great hopes. I am confident that a positive outcome will prove of benefit to the world community at large. We welcome the fact that this dialogue was given added impetus at the meeting in Copenhagen on 10 and 11 September of the Foreign Ministers in the family of the nine members of the Community.97.	After thorough and successfully completed preparations  the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has entered its second phase. On the basis of recent trends towards detente the primary aim of the Conference must now be to create the conditions for a new forward thrust in the process of detente and co-operation. If we succeed  we shall have attained a result that again will be of importance not only to the countries directly involved. All the way through it remains important to aim not only at peaceful and correct relations among States  but to further the quality of life of the individual  which is the basis on which all efforts should be measured and judged. It is important that we arrive at a point where the implications of detente are translated into palpable reality for the peoples of the European countries in the form of concrete and well defined measures.98.	As I said a while ago  there seems to be a growing recognition of the need for common solutions to major problems facing us  but that recognition is not always translated into action. In the field of disarmament  the world Organization has made strenuous efforts for a long time without achieving much progress. Over a number of years we have witnessed certain advances through the adoption of some limited disarmament and arms-control measures. But realistically we must admit that deplorable stagnation-has occurred. We are still waiting for the progress that could reduce the risks inherent in continued armament and the resultant senseless waste of resources. To put it in more specific terms  I think the time is now ripe for a comprehensive test-ban treaty and a treaty prohibiting the development  production and stockpiling of all kinds of chemical weapons and providing for the destruction of existing stocks of such weapons.99.	In the Middle East  energetic efforts have been made  not least by this Organization  its Secretary-General and his personal representative. And yet the situation remains deadlocked  and we are regularly witnessing tragic events. World opinion on this question is marked by growing and understandable impatience  which is also felt in my country. I call upon all parties to make a whole-hearted effort to find a solution in conformity with the guidelines which the Security Council established in its now almost six-year-old-I repeat  six-year-old-resolution 242(1967). My Government will welcome initiatives suitable to break the present deadlock and lead to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.100.	Once again we must note that in southern Africa there has been no progress in the cause of reason and humanity. On the contrary  we receive reports of acts of violence  encroachments and bloodshed in that distressed area. I appeal to those responsible to wake up to the reality of the situation before the sands run out. My Government is ready to take an active part in efforts under the provisions of the Charter to find a peaceful solution securing for the African peoples the right of self-determination. The Secretary-General has made commendable efforts. We hope he will be enabled to continue his endeavours.101.	In the South Asian subcontinent  responsible statesmen are striving to overcome the controversies of the recent past  and expectations have been raised that a solution satisfactory to all may soon be worked out. I hope that the three Governments may succeed in this endeavour of reconciliation and so be allowed to turn their full attention to the future.102.	The situation in Indo-China as a whole  although still marked by human suffering and instability  has improved over the last few months. But much restraint will be required of the parties to exploit the opportunities that have been opened for a final and peaceful solution to the protracted and bitter conflicts.103.	The difficult bilateral talks aimed at normalizing relations between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have been continued. Decisive for our Organization? is the maintenance of peace and stability on the Korean peninsula in order that the conciliation of the two Korean States may take place in the best possible climate and in order that they may be enabled to play their proper role in the world community.104.	The twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights will be commemorated during this session. For a quarter-century the Declaration has represented a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations in their efforts to ensure respect for the dignity of man.105.	In spite of the progress made in this field we must deplore the fact that fundamental rights as set forth in the Declaration are still being disregarded and that freedom of thought and freedom of speech are far from always respected in the Member countries.106.	We are alarmed by the many reports of torture or other cruel or degrading treatment of human beings  and thus we understand and respect the many endeavours aimed at condemnation and elimination of the use of torture.107.	Disregard for the individual becomes particularly acute in armed conflicts  where in modern times the civilian population is exposed to severe risks. It is therefore imperative that as many States as possible participate in the work which the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross have started in order to develop the rules of humanitarian international law in armed conflicts. We must endeavour to attain universal adherence to those new rules.108.	The Danish Government is gravely concerned about the frequent acts of international terrorism victimizing innocent persons. Concerted international efforts are required to break the vicious circle of terror and counter- terror. All nations must recognize their responsibilities by taking concrete steps in this direction.109.	Denmark attaches great importance to the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. What is at stake is not only the law of the sea in the classical sense but the ability of our Organization to find suitable solutions for the distribution of the wealth of the seas and the sea-bed.110.	Coastal States should be accorded more extensive rights to the living resources of the sea. In particular  there is a need to give such rights to coastal States among the developing countries and to States or regions whose populations are heavily dependent on fisheries for their livelihood and without alternative employment possibilities. The legitimate interests of other nations and of the international community as a whole must be taken into consideration.111.	The work of the United Nations in the economic and social fields is this year marked by the first review and appraisal of the implementation of the International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)].112.	Although statistics may yet be incomplete  it is evident that the balance-sheet of the first two years of theSecond United Nations Development Decade does not give grounds for complacency. On the whole  the expectations of progress in the developing countries were not met. Nevertheless there are signs that may augur well for the future.113.	The multilateral trade negotiations which have now been initiated under the auspices of the General Agreement on' Tariffs and Trade should  together with an early agreement on a durable and equitable reform of the international monetary system  help create optimum conditions for world trade and  in turn  for economic growth  to the benefit of developing as well as developed countries.114.	However  economic growth is regarded no longer as an end in itself but rather as a means to improve the quality of life of the individual. It is therefore gratifying to note that within a wide range of areas this conception is gradually being translated into action on a global scale. In endeavours to ensure the quality of life of our own and future generations the questions of environment and population also loom large. We welcome the efforts now under way to follow up the consensus of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  and we are looking forward to seeing the World Population Conference next year lay the foundation of realistic and far-sighted population policies.115.	The United Nations has a unique role to play in promoting international co-operation for economic and social progress in the less fortunate countries of the world. The growing sense of solidarity should inspire us-the better-off countries-steadily to improve our contribution to this global development effort. My country for one is resolved to follow such a course.116.	I have tried to draw attention to a number of factors  problems and trends of prime importance. We must promote co-operation and detente. We must realize the need for genuine disarmament. Goodwill must be shown to settle the Middle East conflict. In southern Africa the law of justice and humanity must be obeyed. The promising progress towards an over-all solution to the conflict in the South Asian subcontinent must be continued. A satisfactory solution must be found to the Korean question. The existing possibilities of a final and peaceful solution to the conflict in Indo-China must be exploited. Economic co-operation must be expanded  not least for the benefit of the less fortunate nations. Human rights must be respected in the widest sense.117.	The topics I have touched upon demonstrate the scope of our Organization's activities. They demonstrate also the challenges confronting the world community. I am convinced  however  that we who are responsible for the continued existence and success of the United Nations will be able  by persistence and dedication  to take a step forward on the path of detente and conciliation  peace and co-operation  towards the ultimate goal: an international society committed to the dignity and worth of the individual."
"32",2029,"DZA",28,1973,"﻿121.	Mr. President  since a tradition appears to have been established that Algeria should be the last to speak in the general debate  I avail myself of this opportunity and privilege to add my voice to the congratulations addressed to you from this rostrum by all the speakers who have preceded me and with whom I am particularly happy to associate my delegation. We rejoice in the fact that at last  following the rule of accession to the presidency of the General Assembly  small countries like ours accede to an equality of rights among the members of the international community  an equality that has still to be extended to more fundamental areas of our activity.122.	We are convinced that the compliments addressed to you  Mr. President  are highly deserved because of the qualities you have shown in the course of your long career in this Organization  which are a guarantee that under your wise guidance the current session of the General Assembly will score a success in the history of our Organization.123.	Your election to the presidency is also a tribute paid to the Latin American continent and its increasingly remarkable role in world affairs and  more especially  in the united efforts deployed by the countries of the third world to solve their problems and assume their responsibilities at the international level.124.	It is also for me a pleasant duty to convey to Mr. Trepczynski our gratitude for the able manner in which he conducted the work of the twenty-seventh session and to assure him of our friendship and deep esteem.125.	As we come to the end of our general debate it would appear  as usual  that while some assess optimistically the evolution of the international situation  others express their apprehension as regards the future of our peoples. They have all referred to the present trend towards detente among the great Powers  a detente which appears to ring down the curtain on the cold war and mark the beginning of a new era characterized both by the substitution of cooperation for confrontation among the great Powers and by the emergence of new centres of decision on the international scene. No one would dream of denying the importance of such a phenomenon which is likely to change fundamentally the international environment. But its exact significance and the implications it entails are not assessed in the same terms by all the members of the international community. If we truly find ourselves at a turning-point in our history  then it is more than ever necessary that we understand our mutual intentions  our preoccupations and our aspirations. The change that has begun in international relations may lead to the strengthening of peace and security if henceforward we devote ourselves to the task of defining our long-term objectives and orienting our efforts towards the solution of the real problems threatening mankind.126.	The present situation did not arise spontaneously and if the period of the cold war has come to an end it is certainly not by reason of a sudden manifestation of wisdom among the great Powers in the world. Throughout this period the balance of the power of destruction prevented the unleashing of a confrontation between the superpowers. The impossibility of each of them achieving absolute supremacy over the other finally showed the futility of competition in the field of armaments and encouraged them to accept each other mutually as the first Powers of the world in the exercise of international responsibilities. The establishment of that new situation should naturally go hand in hand with the solution of the problems of the cold war  particularly in Europe and in Asia  and take account of the evolution that has led to the emergence of new Powers that are naturally associated in the management of international affairs.127.	Thus  the threat of a general conflagration and of the unleashing of an atomic war that for so long weighed over mankind has been averted and the trend towards detente is encouraged by an increased sharing in international responsibilities by the more active participation of the People's Republic of China in the management of world affairs and by the efforts of the countries of Europe to achieve their own rapprochement and to establish co-operative links among themselves. It is on such elements that some base their optimistic vision of the future  a future in which relations of understanding must replace relations of force and where an unbridled and ruinous race in the field of armaments will be replaced by peaceful competition for technical and scientific progress and the organization of a better life for all peoples.128.	This euphoric appreciation is somewhat Utopian and unfortunately is not confirmed by the realities of our daily life.129.	The burning events of these past few days show how fragile are the bases of hasty optimism in the assessment of the evolution of the international situation. The resumption of the war in the Middle East  following a new Israeli aggression against. Egypt and Syria  has come to remind us that peace in the world does not rest on peaceful coexistence among the great Powers alone. The persistence of Israel in its refusal to apply the resolutions of the Security Council and to abide by international law  the permanence of the injustice that struck the Palestinian people  are undoubtedly the more immediate causes of the tension that persists in that area of the world and which keeps alive the constant threat against international security. But it would be erroneous to stop at this cursory analysis and to refuse to include the problem of the Middle East in a broader context which would bring in the designs  ambitions and greed aroused both by the strategic advantages and the economic potential of the region. The energy crisis which threatens the industrialized countries has put the Middle East crisis in a new light and perfectly explains the role that appears to be given to Israel and the unfailing support which it receives from the United States of America and certain Western countries.130.	A month ago a very grave crisis broke out in Chile  overthrowing the Government of President Allende. The coup deforce of the military junta intervened on the morrow of the Algiers Conference of non-aligned countries and constituted an open challenge to all the countries of the third world  assuming thus its true significance. In their declaration the Heads of State meeting in Algiers said:""The Conference hails the Government and people of Chile  who in their struggle to consolidate their independence and build a new society are facing the combined aggression of reaction and imperialism. It expresses its solidarity with Chile in its efforts to achieve the economic and social transformations already started  to avoid the civil war and preserve its national unity."" [See A/9330 and Corr.l  para. 56.]131.	The coup d'etat which cost the life of President Allende is the result of that combined aggression of reaction and imperialism and shows once again that the trend towards detente emerging in the relations between the great Powers has not yet made itself manifest in the countries of the third world.132.	The Chilean people at present are undergoing a tragic trial which calls into question not only their own freedoms and threatens the results so painfully acquired by their social and economic revolution  but constitutes also a danger to the freedom and independence of all our peoples. In its present difficult moments we want to assure that country that it has our entire solidarity and the active sympathy of all those who  throughout the world  remain attached to the ideals for which President Allende died. May we avail ourselves of this opportunity to pay a resounding tribute to President Salvador Allende  who  at the sacrifice of his life  has' given the greatest example of fidelity to his principles  devotion to his people and courage in the defence of the sovereignty of his country. Allende will not have died in vain. The movement that he had the merit to start  the social and economic transformations he undertook  the new awareness he aroused among the Chilean people  cannot be overthrown with the use of violence. The Chilean revolution will continue and the Chilean people —  which will find no better guide than the memory of Allende  who showed them the only path that leads to freedom and dignity — will have the last word.133.	Those events would be enough in themselves to justify our scepticism as regards the effects for the countries of the third world of the new climate that characterizes the relations between the great Powers. The removal to a distance of the spectre of a general holocaust does not suffice to eliminate the crises that are developing in the third world-or- the threats that hang over the present and future of our peoples.134.	The Conference of non-aligned countries recently held in Algiers considered the present international situation in depth and assessed its positive aspects  its shortcomings and its future implications. In its final Declaration  the Conference emphasized that:.. the present strengthening of detente between East and West and the progress towards the settlement in Europe of problems inherited from the Second World War represent important achievements by the forces of peace in the world. The fears created by the nuclear threat as well as the determination of peoples increasingly tend to give primacy to dialogue rather than confrontation."" [Ibid.  para. 10.]135. That development of the international situation was for too long demanded by the non-aligned countries for it not to be hailed by them as a first step towards the establishment among all peoples in the world of relations based on understanding and co-operation  free of any mental reservations on the utilization of force or the advantages of might to attack the sovereignty of others. But they cannot press complaisance so far as to ignore the threats that still weigh over their own security. The Declaration of Algiers states in fact  that:""As long as colonial wars  apartheid  imperialist aggression  alien domination and foreign occupation and power politics  economic exploitation and plunder prevail  peace will prove limited in principle and scope. In a world where  besides a minority of rich countries there exists a majority of poor countries  it would be dangerous to increase such division by restricting peace to the prosperous areas of the world while the rest of mankind remained condemned to insecurity and domination by the most powerful. Peace is indivisible: it could not be reduced to a mere shifting of confrontation from one area to another  nor should it condone the continued existence of tension in some areas while endeavouring to eliminate it elsewhere. Detente would remain precarious if it did not take into consideration the interests of other countries."" [Ibid.  para. 16.]136.	This assessment  which reflects the aspirations of the majority of peoples  must not be regarded as ""a thunderclap under clear skies"" or as the tedious repetition of claims that are never satisfied. At a time when the division of the world into East and West blocs appears to be coming to an end  we do not wish to see a new demarcation established between countries enjoying the benefits of peace and security and countries condemned to live at war or under the threat of war — a demarcation which  as if by chance  would embrace the contours of the dividing line between developed and* developing countries. Those who  like us  wish to stop a discrimination so prejudicial to the establishment of a harmonious international order  must not content themselves with stressing its dangers and deploring its trends  but must work to prevent its aggravation by devoting to our preoccupations the attention they deserve.137.	We have never ceased speaking of those preoccupations  both in this Assembly and in other forums  and whenever we have addressed public opinion or other Governments. The sympathy they have met with in general has not been followed up in practice  and the problems they raised were left unsolved. Perhaps they were covered by the broader concern of a possible confrontation between the great Powers. Now that that possibility has been rejected by the establishment of peaceful coexistence  between the super-rowers and by the elimination of the last vestiges of the cold war  can we hope that there will be sufficient goodwill to make it possible to undertake the search for a satisfactory settlement of the crises affecting the third world  and envisage the translation into deeds of the decisions of principle adopted for the solution of those problems? It is in fact on that change in mentality and attitude and on the capacity of the international community to respond to the appeal and expectations of the third world that we shall judge the authenticity of the detente whose reality in the world of today is already being asserted by some.""While considerable progress has been made towards East-West detente  the fact that peoples are in direct confrontation with colonialism  racial discrimination and apartheid  alien domination and foreign occupation  neo-colonialism  imperialism and Zionism  remains an indisputable reality of our age."" [Ibid.  para. 14.]Thus spoke the Heads of State of the non-aligned countries  summing up in this manner their preoccupations.138.	Despite the true progress accomplished in the field of decolonization  the African continent is still afflicted in its southern part by the perpetuation of Portuguese colonialism which  in its stubborn attempt to survive the attacks of the liberation movements and the efforts of international organizations  assumes the most ignoble and hateful forms  as revealed by the latest massacres in Mozambique. The support that Portugal has in this House and — even more condemnable still — in the pursuance of its policy of oppression  responds perhaps to considerations of regional solidarity  which in this case transforms friendship into complicity  a complicity that we denounce once again in the strongest terms.139.	However  the will of peoples in the long run will be stronger than the stubbornness of the Portuguese leaders who seek to maintain their anachronistic domination over the African Territories. The declaration of independence of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau is undeniably a victory in the struggle for liberation  and an encouragement for the patriots who continue to fight in the other Territories under colonial domination.140.	For our part  we hail the birth of a new independent State in Africa  which only naturally finds its rightful place in the great African family  and in assuring it of our solidarity we wish to express our wishes for its success in its struggle against Portuguese aggression and for the building up of a prosperous nation proud of its freedom. We also express the hope that the independent Republic of Guinea-Bissau will soon join the other members of the international community in this Organization.141.	The colonial situation that continues to exist in the part of the Sahara under Spanish domination could not be prolonged without serious risks for the balance of all that area  which encompasses Algeria  Morocco and Mauritania. For many years appeals have been addressed to the Spanish Government to facilitate arid organize a referendum so that the Saharan people may exercise its right to self-determination. The sincerity of the Spanish authorities in their declared desire of respecting the will of the Sahsirans cannot be judged from their assertions — more or less solemn — but from frank and open action which will enable the Saharan population to express its will freely and without delay.142.	The attitude of the international community as regards the apartheid practised by South Africa has again manifested itself unequivocally in this Assembly when the large majority of its members refused to hear the statement of the representative of Pretoria. Here too it is difficult for us to understand and accept the equivocal position of countries which  while condemning apartheid  continue to give their support to a regime such as this to which apartheid is an article of faith. The solidarity of race and the community of interests are not enough to explain that they condemn the crime while fraternizing with the criminals. Apartheid constitutes a denial of all human values and an infamous affront against the dignity of Africans. One cannot at the same time proclaim one's friendship for Africa and give the champions of apartheid a support that enables them to consolidate their regime.143.	But it is not only by its obstinacy in the practice of apartheid that South Africa challenges the whole of the international community. The perpetuation of its domination over Namibia and its refusal to submit to the decisions of the Security Council and the International Court of Justice are more than mere violations of international law; they represent an insolent defiance of the resolutions of our Organization and an arrogant contempt for international opinion. South Africa finds in Namibia not only favourable ground for the extension of its policy of apartheid  but also a source of enrichment through the exploitation of the resources of that Territory. The countries that are associated with these economic interests bear a good part of the responsibility for the intransigent attitude of South Africa  which is encouraged by their complicity. By entrusting to its Secretary-General the task of contacting the Government of Pretoria to inform himself of its intentions and to try to find a solution which would preserve the rights of the Namibian people  the United Nations has shown a spirit of conciliation which in no way served to shake the stubbornness of the South African leaders. We believe  like all African States  that the mission entrusted to the Secretary- General should not be renewed. The intentions of South Africa are now clearer than ever and leave no room for hope of a settlement in a spirit of mutual understanding.144.	Encouraged and supported by South Africa and Portugal  the minority regime of Salisbury maintains in Rhodesia a .situation that represents both colonialism and apartheid in that other Territory of southern Africa. In this case  the direct responsibility of Great Britain is involved  especially after its refusal to respond to the appeal of the African countries to resort to every means  including force  to put an end to the rebellion of the white settlers. The refusal of the African population to accept the settlement negotiated between Ian Smith and Lord Home  clearly expressed in the Pearce report   leaves no doubt as to the will of the Africans to have their rights restored to them through the exercise of their responsibilities in their country. It is for the international community to support their efforts  to give them the necessary help and to strengthen the economic measures with which they intend to break the resistance of the white minority in Rhodesia.145.	The African problems I have invoked do not only affect the rights of peoples to a life of dignity and independence; they represent in themselves a constant threat to peace and security in the whole of the African continent. The General Assembly and the Security Council are already seized of cases of aggression by Portugal  South Africa and I Rhodesia against African independent States. The maintenance of a colonial presence or of a regime of racial discrimination in a part of Africa constitutes a permanent danger felt by all the African countries which compromises all possibilities of extending to the African continent the detente we wish to ensure in international relations.146.	We turn now to the Asian continent  and we must first of all express our satisfaction at the progress achieved in the relations between the countries of the Indian subcontinent  while expressing the hope that those countries  all of which have our sympathy and friendship  will complete the settlement of the problems born of their conflict. The wounds resulting from a fratricidal war are often deep and difficult to heal  but patience and community of feeling and destiny in the long run triumph over hostility and hatred  and it is by looking towards the future that the adversaries of yesterday will find the path to confidence and reconciliation.147.	We all hailed the Paris agreements which put an end to the long and deadly war in Viet-Nam. More than any other  the people of Viet-Nam deserves at long last to live in peace in order to rebuild its devastated country out of its ruins. But the violations of the Paris agreements by the Saigon regime and the countries that support it are likely to destroy this peace that was bought so dearly. The Heads of State of the non-aligned countries  which give their full support to the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam  condemn those violations and undertake to encourage every effort for the realization of a peaceful  independent  neutral and democratic Viet-Nam that would lead to its peaceful reunification.148.	Still in the Indo-Chinese peninsula  the struggle of the people of Cambodia has shown the world the illegitimacy of the Government of Phnom-Penh installed by the United States of America following its aggression in 1970. The progress achieved by the patriots of Cambodia enable the Government of Prince Norodom Sihanouk to present itself as the only authentic representative of Cambodia incarnating the national will of that people. The sovereign rights of that Government must be restored to it in the United Nations  where its seat is unlawfully occupied by the representatives of a regime which owes its survival only to foreign intervention  which merely underlines its usurping character.149.	The problem of Korea this year will be the subject of a debate in the General Assembly [item 41]. We are gratified at this decision  deferred for so long as a result of manoeuvres that we have denounced regularly in the past. The will of the people of Korea to seek to unify their homeland is obvious  and it is quite clear that everything must be done to encourage and facilitate that reunification through peaceful means. True  the discussions that began between the North and the South tend to lead to this end  but they cannot succeed unless they are free of all foreign interference. It is for that reason that first a decision must be taken to dissolve the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea  to suppress the United Nations Command in Korea and to evacuate all foreign troops. We could not envisage the admission to the United Nations of two separate Koreas  which would establish forever a division that we are precisely trying to eliminate. The admission of Korea to our Organization can be more than the last stage in efforts to reunify that country  which was divided almost 30 years ago.150.	At the beginning of my statement I mentioned the new developments in the Middle East situation. The war that has broken out again was ignited by a fire which had not been properly put out  which has been consuming that region for almost a quarter of a century. We must go back to the period of Israel's creation and to the conditions surrounding it to discover the very sources of the constant tension which characterizes the Middle East. The elements of the conflict  its prolongation and implications will become more complex and grave  but under the mass of problems that it creates  the roots of the evil remain the same: the Middle East crisis resides  above all  in the tragedy of the Palestinian people constrained by force of arms to leave their homeland to make way for a foreign population which bases the legitimacy of its installation in Palestine on the mere fact of belonging to the Jewish religion. It is because the perpetration of that monstrosity was accepted and encouraged or because people resigned themselves to the belief that the international community could not find a satisfactory solution to a conflict that today seriously threatens world peace. It is because this situation has been allowed to go on that on three occasions we have seen war break out in the region and lead to the territorial expansion of Israel and the illegal occupation of territories belonging to independent States in the area  while the problem was acquiring ever more disquieting dimensions. It is because of the international community's inability to compel Israel to evacuate the territories conquered following its aggression .that conflict has broken out again  once more engulfing the whole region.151.	Again we see the Middle East bathed in blood  for the fourth time since 1947. Indeed  Israel has accustomed us to its incursions into the neighbouring countries  to its surprise attacks that take no account either of its international obligations or of the sovereignty of countries that have  in no way provoked such acts of piracy. We shall not dwell on the long series of crimes committed by Israel in disregard of international legality  sowing death and terror  because it was assured of immunity by virtue of the element of surprise and its superiority in armaments  not to mention the impunity fostered by the protection of its allies  particularly through the United States veto in the Security Council. Today the struggle is harder  and Israel must face the resolute determination of the Egyptian and Syrian forces. Thus it resorts to ignoble attacks against defenceless populated centres  against civilian populations and targets  following the strict logic of its philosophy which subordinates the principles of morality to the desire for doubtful publicity. Perhaps this time world public opinion will be better informed of the nature of the Zionist regime  to which has imprudently remain complacent at times in the past.152.	Because sanctions against it were not adopted in time  Israeli aggression in the Middle East follows the same course as the imperialist war in Indo-China. By its refusal to withdraw forthwith and unconditionally from the territories it occupied following its aggression against Egypt  Syria and Jordan  and by it systematic practice of a policy of annexation  expansion  terror and constant violation of human rights  Israel has aggravated the threat that it has never ceased to hold over international peace and security.153.	Nor can one doubt that in this perspective the resistance of the Palestinian people acquires its full significance  since it falls within the context of the general struggle of peoples for the exercise of their right to freedom  dignity and national existence.154.	Barely a few months ago the Security Council was seized of this problem by the Arab Republic of Egypt  that recourse having been based on a decision taken at a meeting of Heads of State and Government of O AU. That decision emphasized the need and extreme urgency of finding new prospects for a peaceful solution following Israel's rejection of all such past attempts. But that action was thwarted by the improper use of the right of veto.155.	More recently still  and in a wider framework  the non-aligned countries have tackled the question of the Middle East as one of the primary themes of their common concerns. The decisions adopted to that end by the Fourth Conference in Algiers were  by reason of the resumption of hostilities in the Middle East  communicated immediately to the permanent members of the Security Council by President Boumediene. In his message he stated  inter alia:""The events which are at present taking place in the Middle East and which are the logical consequence of Israeli aggression lead me to emphasize the exceptional character of their gravity. In my capacity as President in Office of the Group of Non-Aligned Countries  I am in duty bound to draw your attention to the decisions taken by this Conference concerning the situation in the Middle East. Those decisions are based in particular on a recognition of the fact that Israel's persistence in its defiant attitude towards the international community and the United Nations will lead non-aligned countries between them and  within the framework of the United I Nations  in conjunction with the Member States of that Organization  to take individual and collective political and economic measures against Israel  in accordance with Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.""Similarly  recalling the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and the need to restore the national rights of the Palestinian people  'the Conference [calls upon] all States  and in particular the United States of America  to abstain from providing Israel with ... any political  economic or financial support which may enable it to continue its aggressive and expansionist policy'. It calls for 'immediate and unconditional withdrawal by Israel from all the occupied territories  and pledges itself to assist Egypt  Syria and Jordan in liberating their occupied territories  by every means'.""156.	That solemn appeal  launched in the name of an assembly that is so representative in terms of both the number and the quality of its participants  an appeal which in the present circumstances rings out so loudly  must be heeded; it must inspire our Organization to take concrete and urgent measures consonant with justice if it is truly to assume its full responsibility for the safeguarding of international peace and security.157.	The new Israeli aggression against Egypt and Syria  probably conceived to test the military potential and the resistance of those brother nations  and certainly to destroy them by. way of prevention  has failed lamentably. Everything  however  seems to indicate that it was very carefully prepared  militarily and politically. Now that the freedom fighters have begun to have their say  it is to be hoped that it will not be necessary to use other arguments  which the Middle East in particular and the Arab nation in general have in good measure.158.	Like all free peoples  the peoples of Egypt and Syria are only opposing the aggressor; they are trying to push out the foreign occupier  defend the integrity of their national territory and recover their inalienable rights. In so doing  they incarnate today the meaning of dignity and honour. Their trials are our trials; their suffering  our suffering. And since we share with them a common destiny  we shall  side by side with them  assume our responsibilities to the end.159.	They do not stand alone: the non-aligned countries  the socialist States and other healthy forces in the world will give them constant support and unfailing solidarity.160.	But perhaps there is little use in emphasizing the responsibility of Israel  which  because of its Zionist and expansionist character  cannot become a part of the Middle East. We must have the courage and clear-mindedness to assess the responsibility of the United Nations and that of certain great Powers  particularly the United States of America  which have always given their support to Israel  providing it with the means for carrying on its aggressive and imperialist policy and assuring it of protection even against the rules of international law. That responsibility was engaged from the very day Israel was created  and it must be invoked when dealing with the present situation of the Palestinian people or with the occupation by Israel of Arab territories. It is therefore incumbent on the United Nations to resolve a problem which the United Nations itself helped to create.161.	The solution to be found must  of course  entail the complete recovery by the Arab countries in that region of the territories occupied by Israel  and the arrangements necessary for their security against the expansionism and aggressiveness of the Zionist regime. But to establish a lasting peace in that sensitive region  any solution must go to the very root of the problem; it must restore the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine and assure them of the means for freeing themselves from the injustice that has afflicted them for so many years  an injustice the lasting scars of which will be borne not only by the present generation but also by generations to come.162.	Mr. President  in applauding your accession to the presidency of our Assembly  I underlined the outstanding part played by Latin America in the joint struggle of the third world. The ever greater participation of the countries of your continent in the non-aligned movement is the most striking and reassuring testimony to this fact.163.	The Conference of our Heads of State in Algiers assigned especial importance to your problems. In the final Declaration of our Conference appears the following:""The Conference considers that the struggle for the liberation of Latin America is an important factor in the struggle of peoples against colonialism  neo-colonialism and imperialism and is a contribution towards achieving and strengthening peace and international security."" [A/9330 and Corr.l  para. 55.]Moreover:""It supports the struggle of the peoples of Latin America for the affirmation of their sovereignty  the restoration of their natural resources and implementation of the structural changes essential for their development  and condemns the imperialistic aggressions and pressures to which these countries are subjected."" [Ibid.  para. 54.]164.	The tragic events in Chile have come all too soon  unfortunately  to confirm the fears expressed in that declaration  and to prove to what degree  in Latin America and everywhere else in the third world  our peoples must remain vigilant and rely on their active solidarity to face the dangers threatening them.165.	The movement that is developing on the Latin American continent for the consolidation of independence and the recovery of national resources must necessarily confront the forces of imperialism  the operations of which are evident in military interventions and the activities of multinational companies. We give our total support to the peoples of Latin America in the courageous struggle they are waging  and particularly to the people of Peru  which has embarked upon an undertaking to reconquer its wealth and transform its economic and social structures; also to the people of Panama  which seeks legitimately to restore its sovereignty over the Canal Zone. The people of Cuba  for its part  knows how great is the sympathy and solidarity with which we have always followed and admired the revolutionary task it has accomplished. And once again we wish to denounce the unjust and unjustified blockade imposed upon Cuba by the United States of America  and the hostile measures directed against it by the new military authorities in Chile.166.	Since I wish to lay before you here the concerns expressed by the non-aligned countries at the Algiers Conference  I must inform you of the profound disquiet aroused by the evolution of the economic and social situation in the developing countries. That evolution is characterized by an aggravation of the inequality already existing in the rate of economic growth as between the developed and the underdeveloped countries. The international economic order continues to function to the detriment of the poorer countries  and all attempts to reverse that disastrous trend have produced no satisfactory results. The principal difficulty resides in the selfishness of the most developed countries  which do not wish to give up their privileges and refuse to change a18system that promotes their prosperity to the disadvantage of the countries that provide their raw materials.167.	We all know how disappointing were the results of the First United Nations Development Decade. The Second Development Decade is already well under way and appears to be no more promising than the first. The imbalances that result from this disparity in the distribution of wealth may have the most tragic effects on the international balance as a whole  and the crises that have already occurred in the field of energy show the depth of the ills that characterize the present world economic situation.168.	The monetary crisis through which we are living strikes a hard blow at the developing countries  while at the same time the responsibility therefore rests exclusively on the industrialized countries  which should be the only ones to bear the consequences.169.	Problems of food and the environment  together with those relating to the organization of world trade  muse occupy the attention of all and can be solved only within the framework of broader international co-operation. It was for this reason that the Algiers Conference suggested the urgent convening of a joint conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and UNCTAD - at the ministerial level  and the convening of a special session of the General Assembly to be devoted exclusively to problems of development.170.	It is not necessary to point out that development problems can easily be tied in with the problem of disarmament  in so far as the resources released through disarmament could find no better use than to be placed at the service of development. We therefore welcome any suggestion along these lines stemming from a sincere effort to promote real  general and complete disarmament  and from a genuine will to reform the whole international economic system with a view to a more equitable distribution of wealth and income.171.	The non-aligned countries have always given proof of their profound attachment to the United Nations and the principles of the Charter. They remain convinced that the Organization can be an effective instrument for promoting international peace and security  for developing co-operation and for safeguarding fundamental rights and freedoms. Its call to universality is further strengthened this year by the simultaneous admission of the German Democratic Republic  the Federal Republic of Germany ' and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. We are indeed happy to welcome these three new Members which will  without doubt  help to strengthen our Organization and guarantee for it an ever greater sphere of action.172.	However  we take note of the pertinent observation of the Secretary-General when  in the introduction to his report  he stressed that""The United Nations and its family of organizations were set up to deal with the problems of a world very different from the one we live in today."" [A/9001/Add. 1  p. 1.]The changes that have marked the life of mankind  together with those that have changed the political  military  economic and social conditions of the world  have upset the order of priority of our concerns and introduced a new balance into the international situation. The Organization cannot play its part and fulfil its mission unless it reflects a faithful image of international society. The most important change stems from the emergence of a large number of countries into international life. The Organization can no longer be moved merely by the impulses given by the great Powers alone  whether conflicting or combined. The voice of the small and medium-sized countries must also be one of the components of that system of forces.173.	All of us have adhered to the Charter  and that was the primary condition for our admission to the United Nations. But we must also say that we then had no choice but to accept the terms of a treaty prepared without our participation and on the basis of considerations that did not necessarily take our preoccupations into account. It will be understood that we find it natural that certain provisions of the Charter which no doubt were justified when it was drawn up no longer appear to suit the present international situation and should be reconsidered in the light of the transformations to which we have referred.174.	That is true in particular of the right of veto enjoyed by the permanent members of the Security Council. We can accept the idea that that privilege is in keeping with the particular responsibility exercised by the great Powers in international affairs  but when that privilege is used so that a great Power may evade the obligations imposed on it by international law  when it serves to divert international law from its true objectives  when it seeks to oppose the opinion of the remainder of the community  we believe it introduces an imbalance dangerous to international harmony. If its immediate abolition does not appear possible  we must at least spell out its usage by giving a restrictive definition of the cases in which it can be used.175.	It is paradoxical to note that the world appears to be further removed from unity now that the cold-war period has ended and there are appearing on the horizon serious indications of a detente in international relations. No doubt that is because the threat of a general war united ail peoples in the same fear of annihilation and in efforts to prevent that catastrophe. As that threat disappears  the concerns of our peoples change and we see a new cleavage in international society.176.	We belong to the world that does not yet enjoy the benefits of that detente  the world whose security is precarious. the world still confronted by the difficult problems of under-development. Most of the countries that find themselves in that situation now belong to the movement of the non-aligned  which was born of the identity of their concerns and the community of their hopes. The solidarity that unites them does not seek to make of them a new bloc which would appear on the horizon when existing blocs are relaxing their unity and dissolving in ever wider cooperation.177.	Non-alignment was born precisely at a time when those blocs confronted each other  and its purpose was to preserve the independence of the small countries while working to establish peaceful coexistence between different social and political systems. The progress achieved along that road is perhaps to some extent due to the unremitting action of the non-aligned countries in favour of peace and international understanding.178.	The transformation of the international order undoubtedly modifies the content of the notion of non- alignment  which  while being attached to the idea of the defence of national independence  now has as its objective the promotion of peaceful coexistence between the great and small Powers. That coexistence  founded on respect and on the equality of rights of States  is based first of all on the concept of non-interference in the affairs of other States and renunciation of external pressure. It must lead to the building of a more equitable world where force will not replace law  which will give all peoples equal access to the benefits of civilization.179.	That is what more than 80 non-aligned countries meeting in Algiers have solemnly sought to reaffirm. The principles on which they have founded their action and their international behaviour are above all an act of faith in the future of mankind which reflects the great hopes of all our peoples. The participation in that conference of more than 60 Heads of State and Government confers on its declarations outstanding authenticity which the international community cannot disregard. The construction of the world of today and determination of the world of tomorrow is of concern to us all  and nothing would be more dangerous than to refuse to pay attention to the appeal of the representatives of two thirds of mankind. It is an appeal for justice for all peoples  an appeal for fraternity among all men. Why should it not be heeded?"
"33",2076,"ECU",28,1973,"﻿133.	I am happy  Mr. President  to greet you cordially on behalf of my Government and to congratulate you on your election to preside over this new session of the General Assembly. For the people of Ecuador it is a matter of rejoicing and pride that a most worthy compatriot such as yourself has been raised to that high post in recognition of outstanding ability and qualifications and experience in theUnited Nations. All of that is a guarantee of the effectiveness with which the General Assembly will be directed.134.	I wish also to greet and pay tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  the distinguished Polish diplomat  who with wisdom and skill fulfilled his noble duties 135.	Having read the news in the paper this morning  I wish to pay a posthumous tribute to a great man of this hemisphere and a great poet of the world  Pablo Neruda.136.	My first words are also words of welcome to the Organization to the three new States which have become Members this year — the German Democratic Republic  the Federal Republic of Germany and the Bahamas. The admission of those peoples to the United Nations will strengthen its bodies and constitute a ratification of the principle of universality foreseen in the Charter  a principle that my country fully supports. The admission of the two German States will also be a great contribution to relieving tension in Europe  with salutary reactions in the entire world  and certainly there will be repercussions entirely favourable to the work being done by the United Nations to fulfil its purposes and principles.137.	I have just spoken of strengthening the United Nations  and on behalf of my Government I must stress that although during the passage of the long years since its foundation the Organization has made undeniable contributions to the cause of peace  its role still is not everything that the peoples expect or hope. We are watching the opening up of a dark  upset and troubled world  where contradictory forces struggle to deprive men and communities of possibilities of progress and social justice which they quite justifiably seek and require.138.	Can we deny that at present there are upheavals and tensions? The complexity of a world becoming more technical although less human  the damage to basic values of the human spirit in all spheres  the irrepressible clamour of the less favoured classes prove to us clearly that the United Nations must give greater pragmatic and concrete assistance in the solution of international problems  for the sake of peoples and of security in general. States must fully comply with the obligations imposed upon them as Members of the United Nations. One of the unchallengeable premises for strengthening peace is the observation of the Charter of the United Nations. But if certain resolutions are not complied with  if they are casuistically or subtly evaded  if they are ignored  then the moral weight of the United Nations is also but meagre and the statements we make here on behalf of our States are of no value.139.	The world Organization is duty bound to ensure that the resolutions and recommendations adopted by common agreement are implemented. My country is fully convinced that the efficacy of the United Nations must hinge upon the political will of its Members to carry out in good faith the fundamental obligations incumbent upon them in accordance with the Charter and their desire to co-operate in the solution of problems of general interest. If we wish to strengthen the Organization and avoid its prestige and authority being sapped  it is imperative that words be accompanied by deeds  so that resolutions will not -be reduced to mere declarations of principles  without concrete results.140.	There can be no doubt that on certain levels positive changes in international life have been achieved. These are intended to improve the political climate  and this has led to the creation of new and excellent possibilities for lessening international tensions. Now it is necessary that dialogue between the parties to a conflict should continue. The end of the war in Viet Nam  while it must please all of us  must serve as a lesson  one that will warn all of us of the dangers  the atrocious calamities that follow upon a state of violence and undeclared war  or what happens when in one way or another peoples are denied the exercise of their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.141.	SatisfieC as we are at the end of the conflict ir. Viet Nam  so  too  my Government and delegation are gratified at the way in which the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic have carried out their dialogue and laid the groundwork for a worthy contribution to detente and European security  which must obviously have repercussions on the security cf the entire world.142.	The admission of the two Germanys to the world Organization  a fruit of that dialogue  is a clear example of the beneficial results to world peace generated by good will and the desire for justice and equity when applied by parties in the solution of their disputes. The results of the multilateral consultations to prepare the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which have also confirmed the relaxation of tension and confrontation in Europe  point now to practical collaboration and prove that when a matter is tackled with a desire for a solution  that has a favourable effect on all other matters which may be the seed of future difficulties and problems in world order and which can also catch the same spirit of understanding and the same desire for solution.143.	We would hope that all these events would serve as an example so that other problems besetting the world will also be successfully solved through negotiation within the framework of the spirit of good will and understanding  for the benefit of all peoples of the world  of peace and of international co-operation.144.	And yet there are still conflicts in the world. The situation in Indochina  particularly in Cambodia  is continuing obscure and tumultuous and is reaching the levels of unbearable anguish and horror experienced in Viet Nam.145.	The situation in the Middle East  too  remains disturbed. My country  peace-loving by conviction and tradition  wants with all the force of its confidence in law to make a warm and urgent appeal to the parties in conflict. My Government feels that a sincere effort on the part of the governments concerned to carry out a dialogue without prior conditions  without prejudice and without imposition could do much for a final and just solution. Thus my delegation considers it equally necessary for all efforts to be made to find a solution to the conflict on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967. That resolution contains the basic tenets of international law as set forth in the Charter. A possible solution must in any case take into account all aspects of the problem of the Middle East and be based indisputably on the principles of equity and justice  without taking'into account hatred or prejudice of any sort. We believe that in any case the solution must be sought within the framework of the United Nations  and I must say it is equally necessary that the activities of the great Powers  that in one way or another support the different parties to the conflict in the Middle East  must be directed to finding solutions for the establishment of constructive peace and not stand in the way of possible formulas of agreement and understanding. The conflict in the Middle East  because of its explosive nature  obliges the United Nations to try unflaggingly to end it.146.	In the light of so important a problem as that of Korea  my delegation considers that the world Organization should enc urage any free pronouncement by the entire Korean people and allow the two Koreas to continue their contacts to find the most just and appropriate road to a solution to the problem.147.	My delegation draws attention to the tact that  despite the many resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council regarding racial or religious discrimination and colonialism  millions of human beings are still suffering the consequences of these illegal and inhuman systems.148.	These resolutions of the world Organization seem to be challenged almost openly by the countries that practice these forms that are so contrary to the purooses and principles of the United Nations. The practice of racial and religious discrimination is retrograde and turns back centuries of civilization and progress. As far as colonialism is concerned  it is the very denial of freedom itself and of the right of peoples to self-determination. It coerces them with political occupation  economic pressures or inadmissible armed threats.149.	Paradoxically enough  while man has shaken off the forces that tied him to earth and has launched himself into the conquest of the stars  there are still subjet peoples whose fate is in foreign hands which resort to violent coercion  and drown in blood their desire for just rebellion  the hunger for freedom that has written the most heroic pages of history.150.	Ecuador can do no less than urge that the agreements arrived at in the General Assembly and the Security Council be implemented. With regard to the legal situation of the territories under Portuguese administration  we continue to argue that this situation is covered by Article 73 of the Chapter of the United Nations.151.	Since international economic co-operation is an obligation instituted in the Charter  we must with determination encourage any steps that will tend to create favourable machinery and conditions so that the industrially advanced countries will supply the developing nations with the necessary effective assistance so that the process of economic and social transformation will become reality. The resolutions r./ust be implemented for that progress to be achieved and for the dangerous gap that divides some counts s from others to be bridged. This calls for an intensifying of economic  technical  scientific and cultural co-operation and also requires that the programmes of financing be fed with 1 per cent of the gross national product. There must also be a liberalization of trade and the removal of all obstacles that have so far stood in the way of the rational opening up of international markets to raw materials  the main source of income for countries of the third world.152.	The Second United Nations Development Decade  for all these reasons  should be supported fully and given all the necessary assistance. Furthermore  it should be strengthened  as the needs have grown in so many poverty- stricken regions of the world. At this time ! should like to stress the fact that the Latin American countries  upon studying  at the fifteenth session of the Economic Commission for Latin America  the results of the first two years of this Decade  adopted the so-called Quito Assessment. The observations in that document are positive and realistic and in keeping with the needs of the region and thus were endorsed by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1817 (LV). Let us now avoid any weak or ambiguous measures. The present moments are difficult enough: there is still lack of food; there is still disease and poverty; the international monetary crisis still produces negative results  particularly in the developing nations; and all this on the very eve of the multilateral trade negotiations to be held within the framework of GATT and whose bases and conditions are not precisely those that are most in keeping with the desires of a great majority of the countries that are facing difficulties in their trade development and therefore have serious problems with their balance of payments — countries that  despite all their efforts  cannot implement their domestic development programmes.153.	In the light of these sombre prospects for the developing nations  we shall continue to press for a new study and analysis of the measures to solve the grave problem of maritime transport. Therefore we wholeheartedly support the spirit of the developing countries when proposing a code of conduct for maritime conferences in order to standardize freights and guarantee a just increase in the national merchant marines. We hope that the plenipotentiary conference"" that is to study that draft in November at Geneva will be as successful as the countries that have been working to this end desire.154.	We hope to achieve the development and welfare of our people  using the wealth of our national resources  whose exploitation must have  in the international field  sufficient guarantees and safeguards. Therefore we consider as a threat to the full exercise of the sovereignty of peoples any measure or action by any other State or transnational corporation that limits or hinders the free exercise of that basic right.155.	In the field of economic security  the action of the United Nations is — and should be — preponderant. The gap between the wealthy and the poor countries is widening instead of narrowing. Can we  then  speak of a future of peace in these circumstances for the peoples of the world? To consider it so would be Utopian and would be almost tragic naivete. There can be no doubt that this state of affairs is a reflection of injustices committed by the wealthy countries in their international trade policies. And voices have been raised in one of the organs of the United Nations to the effect that the concepts of political anc economic security ar: parallel and complement one another. My delegation believes that in the field to which I am referring the action of the United Nations has thus far not been very productive. This being the case  the possibility of the third world's emerging from underdevelopment is bleak indeed.156.	The world is confronting a profound technical and scientific revolution. Man's penetration of outer space and the depths of the ocean  the impressive progress of human knowledge and the rapid evolution of productive forces have wide repercussions on all spheres of the spiritual and material existence of man. All this offers countries fantastic ways of increasing their national wealth  of utilizing the natural resources they possess in order to support their economic and social progress and achieve development. But at fhe same time  this same revolution creates new andtremely complex problems having a bearing on the future of mankind. This creates new fields of co-operation  but at the same time it stresses the need to tackle the problems in ways and fashions that will be in keeping with the new needs of the modern world.157.	To achieve these goals  technology must be placed at the service of mankind; and for this it is imperative that appropriate machinery be set up to allow the developingcountries to enjoy full access to  and benefit from  technology and research. The developed countries with a high degree of technological know-how  with the experience and information they possess concerning outer space  ought to share those benefits with all developing nations  giving them access to such knowledge and know-how. But the technological capacity that allows them to increase their economic development must not be used  like other resources  to consolidate and increase their domination over other nations.158.	In resolution 2934 A and B (XXVII)  the General Assembly appealed to the Powers that possess nuclear weapons to suspend all types of atomic tests  including underground tests  and to adhere without delay to the treaty prohibiting such weapons. But some States have not obeyed this resolution. The appeals of the world Organization have been spurned  and with surprise and sorrow we have seen that nuclear tests have continued  to the detriment of the authority of the United Nations and of efforts to strengthen peace. My delegation must state here that the latest nuclear tests carried out by France certainly have indicated a deterioration in the efforts that the Organization and all peoples have been making to prohibit nuclear weapons and the explosion of such bombs. We must lament the fact that it is France that has done this  but with the sincere and unfettered friendship that my country has always felt for the great French people  we cannot but be surprised at and condemn its contempt for world public opinion and its persistence in carrying out those tests  which further weaken the already fragile basis of security. My delegation will therefore continue to give its full support to the effort to achieve a complete prohibition of all nuclear weapons tests  chemical weapons  and all weapons of any kind that would constitute a cruel means of making war  which is repugnant to the conscience of all peoples.159.	In the field of disarmament an indispensable premise is confidence among States. It alone can create a climate conducive to the solution of a problem that is in itself complex  difficult and full of unknown quantities.160.	To resort to the use of force is to deny the power of reason. To channel nuclear  biological or chemical natural forces to the destruction of men is to allow the dominion of irrational energy over man.161.	On the international level in general  and specifically in the United Nations  there has been a proliferation of agreement! and recommendations to do away with the arms race. Yet mankind is still hoping for this  while still seeing the bombs and the cannons lowering over it. True disarmament cannot emerge merely from the co-ordination of wills on a piece of paper but must be the legal expression of genuine disarmament  which can only be found in the very soul of the peoples. True disarmament means to do away with the spirit of agression  to adopt a desire for peace and understanding and respect for the self-determination of peoples and for the unchallengeable dominion of law and justice.162.	On behalf of the Government and people of Ecuador  my delegation will continue to support fully all efforts tending towards general and complete disarmament under effective and secure international Control. In its resolution 2993 (XXVII) the General Assembly of the United Nations reaffirmed that:""... any measure or pressure directed against any State while exercising its sovereign right freely to dispose of its natural resources constitutes a flagrant violation of the principles of self-determination of peoples and nonintervention  as set forth in the Charter  which  if pursued  could constitute a threat to international peace and security"".163.	Together with other countries of Latin America  my country has been the victim of retaliatory measures because we defended this inherent right of peoples for our own development.164.	It is high time that we attached to international co-operation its real definition and scope. It cannot  as in the past  be placed at the service of unilateral interests and positions which vitiate the goals.165.	Ecuador must denounce to the General Assembly the persistence of the United States of America in turning international economic co-operation into a punitive element and a means of coercion against countries that  in the exercise of their legitimate rights  have captured and  in accordance with law  punished fishing fleets carrying out illicit activities in their jurisdictional waters. Not only does Ecuador reject the so-called application of sanctions  but at the same time we wish to stress that such conduct is unseemly and in no way helps to create an atmosphere conducive to negotiations and friendly understandings. It also ignores the terms of article 19 of the charter of the Organization of American States  as well as Security Council resolution 330 (1973) of 21 March in which the Council  when reaffirming the pertinent resolutions of the General Assembly  particularly resolution 2625 (XXV)  proclaims that:""... no State may use or encourage the use of economic  political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind ""and requests States furthermore:""... with a view to maintaining and strengthening peace and security in Latin America  to refrain from using or encouraging the use of any type of coercive measures against States of the region"".166.	At the present session the General Assembly will have to pronounce itself on matters of outstanding importance to the development of the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  whose decisions will determine the possibility of wide co-operation in keeping with the purposes and principles of the United Nations  if justice reigns and if. the sovereign equality of States is respected. But if  tragically  the sea remains as in the past a shameful means of political and economic domination  and if the exercise of force over reason and law succeeds  then the world will be confronted with a new period of disquiet and conflict incompatible with mutual obligations of creative interdependence and association under the San Francisco Charter.167.	We cannot forget the worthless results of previous conferences which tried to solve the great problems of the sea by ignoring the constitutional elements of balance between what the sovereign State requires in defence of its legitimate inalienable rights and what is required of it as an active and passive subject in a natural regime of interdependence. No decision that affects the fundamental interests of the developing countries or leads to the adoption of formulas of disguised colonialism or tutelage can be accepted by peoples who insist on respect for their freedom and their right to utilize all their natural resources. Among these resources of importance to the feeding and development of the coastal States are those that are in adjacent seas within reasonable limits dictated by geographic  geological  ecological  economic and social factors.168.	Particularly important at present is that the formulas covering the use of the seas as well as the exploitation of the sea-bed beyond the jurisdictional limit must be based on the principle that the regions reserved to the coastal State and coming under its exclusive sovereignty cannot be invaded.169.	But among the new conceptions of international law  some of which must necessarily be included in the reformulation of the law of the sea  sovereignty must be understood also as a factor for positive action in the policies of solidarity that  by bringing nations together in peace and justice  will make their exercise of sovereign rights the most effective means of mutual understanding and co-operation.170.	In keeping with those definitions  Ecuador has contended and continues to contend that it is for the coastal State itself to decide on the width of the sea over which it exercises sovereignty and the resources of which are therefore exclusively within its purview.171.	Together with other countries of our continent  Ecuador has set as the limit of its territorial seas 200 miles  measured from the corresponding base lines  the area over which we exercise sovereignty and  therefore  jurisdiction. We require that our laws be respected  even if that calls for police action when fishing vessels try to ignore the existence of a national law over that area.172.	With the same determination with which we uphold that proclamation  we state our unshakable resolution to participate positively in the development of a wide policy of co-operation by sovereign acts which will daily ensure that the seas are ties of unity and friendship among all peoples and will allow effective achievement of the efforts for conservation and reasonable exploitation of the ichthyolog- ical wealth of the seas  preservation of the marine environment and accelerated progress in scientific research  activities which Ecuador considers to be unavoidable duties of the coastal State.173.	International co-operation in such important fields must be considered as an honest way of acting which satisfies the demands of particular interest to the coastalState and the community  and never as an instrument in the hands of the great fishing Powers for the undue exploitation of the ichthyological wealth to which they have no right. To contend that fishing should be divided up by species according to an apparently scientific criterion  in order to penetrate zones of foreign jurisdiction and take advantage of wealth that certainly is neither res nullius nor to be confused with the common heritage of mankind  bespeaks violation of the rights of States and is a shameful manifestation of the fact that there is still a tendency to ignore the legal equality of States and the identical value of the rights of the great and the small  the economically wealthy and the economically weak. The living resources of the coastal sea  whether it is termed territorial or patrimonial sea or economic zone  whether those resources belong to the coastal State because it exercises sovereignty over the marine area or because sovereign rights over such resources have been recognized  are subject to the legal provisions governing administration and exploitation  and therefore are under the control necessary to ensure their adequate utilization and conservation by the coastal State. It is the coastal State that can reserve unto itself or its nationals the full exploitation of all the resources of the marine zone over which it possesses sovereignty and exercises jurisdiction or can allow nationals of other States to comply with regulations and provisions arising from the sovereignty of the coastal State to carry out the exploitation.174.	My delegation  while frankly and energetically rejecting any type of coercion designed to affect in any way the sovereign will of a State  believes that international co-operation will find its true channel and will fulfil its duty by granting to the least economically and technically developed countries sufficient means to achieve full welfare for their peoples.175.	My country trusts the noble mission of the United Nations. We believe this mission can be accomplished only if all States  all peoples  meet their obligations and each  to the extent of its possibilities  sincerely and without ulterior motives contributes to the solution of the problems afflicting mankind."
"34",2122,"EGY",28,1973,"﻿78.	Because we are determined not to neglect our international duties and responsibilities even while we are engaged in the most sacred of national duties — the fight for our territorial integrity and our liberty — we have decided to appear as scheduled in the general debate of this session of the General Assembly.79.	However  it should be understood that I am going to leave it to the Egyptian delegation to express in the various Committees the points of view of Egypt on all the items on our agenda.80.	First  Mr. President  I take it as a good omen indeed that this Assembly is presided over by you  a man whose record as representative of Ecuador is one of fighting valiantly for all the values for which the United Nations was established and for which Egypt is now fighting.81.	If the United Nations was established so that law might rule supreme over policies of violence and so that the Charter of the United Nations and the findings and resolutions of the United Nations rather than the dictation of power and violence would be the key to settlement  then the fight now being waged by Egypt and Syria is for the United Nations.82.	We still stand respectful of  and bound by  the Charter  by United Nations resolutions and by all its findings. We refuse  however  to be dictated to; we refuse  however  to be subjugated by long occupation; we refuse  however  to remain occupied. We are struggling  not because we guarantee success  but because we have no option but to struggle. That is our national duty. That is the only Diktat we are obeying and going to obey.83.	If this United Nations was established also to uphold human rights  then I think this is a good opportunity to inform the nations here united of the latest vile actions against human rights. This morning I received from my Government the information that as a result of attacks by the Israeli Air Force on Port Said and on other towns in the Nile delta  one of the most densely populated areas of the world  and on the suburbs of Cairo  307 victims were killed or wounded. A few hours later — at 1415 hours precisely —  the toll had risen to 500 persons murdered.84.	As a result  our morale is rising; our anger is rising; our determination to put an end to this policy of brigandry and lawlessness is increased.85.	That is Egypt's contribution to this year's general debate."
"35",2191,"ESP",28,1973,"﻿78.	Mr. President  it is for me a very great honour to speak for the first time from this rostrum  and it is especially gratifying to do so under your presidency at this twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I know  Mr. Benites  your intellectual qualifications  your tact and your warm friendliness  as well as your fame as a fighter for noble causes and your profound historical and legal knowledge that are always expressed with vigour and elegance. I see in you a distinguished representative of the brother nations of Spanish America  so dear to all Spaniards. To the recognition that your qualities as a person and your lofty position merit must be added my sincere thanks for the very kind words you used regarding Spain's ties with Spanish America when you took up your task as President of this General Assembly.79.	This twenty-eighth session of the Assembly has been enriched with the admission of the two States representing the great German nation as well as the Bahamas. To these new Member States Spain extends a very cordial welcome.80.	The words I wish to speak here are words of peace and justice. Words of peace. I say. because Spain's foreign policy is characterized by a constant and firm desire for peace among nations. This is not a rhetorical assertion. Facts bear this out. Neither the strategic value of our geographic position nor the strong pressures to which we were subjected during the two world wars were able ever to destroy our profound desire to maintain peace.81.	Within this tradition the Spanish delegation wishes now to analyse the present situation and the future prospects for peace in the world  a peace torn by conflicts and tensions which threaten the future of mankind.82.	To the bright face offered by ever increasing economic and social growth  by technological advances and the possibility of reaching ever higher levels of well-being and culture and breaking down the barriers separating the rich countries from the poor  there is the paradoxical reverse situation that we confront an ever increasing deterioration of the spiritual condition and the environment in which we live  together with the possible outbreak of social conflicts and wars with irreparable consequences for all.83.	Since 1945 the world has been seeking an optimum balance other than the balance of terror. To replace this apocalyptic equilibrium by an innate equilibrium of peace stemming from the harmonic union of those values and power that culture and technology today place at the service of man is the highest humanistic goal of our age.84.	Today  for the first time in history  social tensions are frequently world-wide in scope and  hence  conflicting national policies can no longer control events.85.	From this fact there are those who have drawn the conclusion that the order of sovereign States is incapable of solving the problems of the human community. And yet it is one thing to admit realistically that many of the great problems of our time require the concerted action of the international community and quite another to think that such problems can be solved only through the disappearance of States as sovereign and independent entities. It is precisely the effective recognition of that sovereignty and independence of States which makes possible the very existence of an international order and with it the possibility of effectively tackling the problems of peace and formulating the great objectives of the community of nations.86.	Undoubtedly  the great revolution in the communications media which has narrowed the gap between cultures and peoples  the supranational transmission of news to the public at large  the broadening of markets to world-wide dimensions  the international confrontation of ideologies  the tendency of conflicts to become global in character and the universal incidence of tension between developed and under-developed nations have created a political arena which is truly universal.87.	But there is a great danger to world peace  namely  that such possibilities of coexistence  communication and exchange on a world scale will be abused by being employed for politically narrow  economically egotistical and even strictly subversive objectives.88.	In the face of those ideas  more or less tainted with imperialism  each country has the right to find its own reply to the challenge of our times. A plurality of options must be allowed to exist; otherwise  there might well arise large-scale intervention and conflict  whose outcome would be a general world confrontation  after which no one would remain to tell the tale.89.	Reciprocal recognition of the sovereignty of each State demands maximum respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of all nations. This respect is the essential postulate governing  without any discrimination whatsoever  the relations of Spain with other nations.90.	Peace  die roots of which spring from justice  is guaranteed by security.91.	In today's world  security can no longer be built upon die counterpoise between opposing blocs. Spain believes that the rigid division of the world into hostile blocs must be replaced by the institutionalisation of large geographical areas of security. The Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe reflects this idea.92.	However  political realism demands that we should not cling to strict geographical considerations. European security  for instance  cannot be divorced from Mediterranean security. It is for that reason that  together with other nations  Spain believes that if security of that sea is not guaranteed  European security will be not only Utopian but also highly dangerous and will reflect hegemonistic claims.93.	The structure of security that exists at present in the Mediterranean is based exclusively on the confrontation between great Powers  with the consequent loss of autonomy for the coastal States. Although the system is imperfect  we cannot today conceive of the possibility of demilitarizing or neutralizing the Mediterranean. It would  however  appear possible to combine the imperatives of a global strategy with an agreement between the Mediterranean countries which would enable them to participate in the shaping of their own security. In this connexion several non-European Mediterranean countries have expressed the wish to be heard at the Conference on European Security and Co-operation  and Spain has echoed that legitimate desire by advocating  in July in Helsinki and recently in Geneva  that those countries be heard.94.	Spain also has a vital interest in the drafts for a new definition of the principles that are to govern security and co-operation in the North Atlantic region. My country is a part of that zone for geographic  historical  strategic and economic reasons. Spain  as part of Europe and as a sincere friend of the United States  is ready and determined to play its part in the Atlantic area in favour of peace and security.95.	Spain's European side is one of its most important historical aspects; hence our Government wishes sincerely to contribute to the construction of Europe by contributing its cultural and human values as well as material resources  which in the last decade have developed in an unprecedented manner.96.	Spain views with satisfaction the process of European integration  and understands that the political unity of Europe must be forged on the strength of the recognition of an enriching diversity and the contribution of original and autonomous solutions by the various nations constituting it.97.	For the elementary reason of human solidarity  Europe cannot entrench itself in its own economic well being  but rather must combine and redouble its efforts to help the developing countries. To the extent that this open and generous attitude gains ground  the judgement of history will determine the positive and constructive contribution that is being made to European co-operation.98.	But in this Europe that so ambitiously looks towards the future  there remains  incredible as it may seem  one last vestige of the colonial past — Gibraltar. The case of Gibraltar is a clear example of the fact that security  both in the global and regional sense  is shaken if one nation decides  against all reason  to base its own security on the insecurity of others.99.	The principle of security implies the duty of preventing risks from extending to third parties. Gibraltar  on more than one occasion  has exposed Spain to involvement under all kinds of dire pressures in the great wars of this century. It must therefore cease to constitute for my country such a catastrophic risk.100.	Gibraltar is an English colony maintained as a military base. It is a strategic point which places Spain's security in jeopardy vis-à-vis other Powers and prevents us from contributing more effectively to security in the Mediterranean  when in fact our desire is to convert a point of friction into an area of co-operation for the benefit of security in general.101.	The United Nations has been considering the question of Gibraltar for 10 years. As a European statesman recently said  it is a big problem on a small bit of land-less than five square kilometres of rock. The territory is out of all proportion to the United Kingdom's defiance of the United Nations and its affront to Spain by refusing to decolonize this small area of land.102.	Why will Great Britain not apply to Gibraltar the principle of decolonization which  after serious upheavals  violent repressions and countless victims  it has put into effect in more than 20 territories vital to its imperial strategy and economic hegemony? Great Britain has sequestered an integral part of Spanish soil of no economic or military value without Spain's co-operation  continually has recourse to intrusions into Spanish air and sea space to prolong an indefensible legal and physical situation  and abuses the often expressed desires for peace of my Government.103.	Ever since the eleventh session of the General Assembly  we have repeated our just claims to Gibraltar. Ever since the United Nations Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples approved on 16 October 1964 the consensus on Gibraltar  up to resolution 2429 (XXIII) .of 18 December 1968  the General Assembly set the date  long past  of 1 October 1969 for decolonization  while at the same time the United Nations has established a doctrine on Gibraltar  the basic points of which are the following: (a) the question of Gibraltar is of a colonial nature; (b) an end should be put to it through negotiations between Spain and Great Britain; (c) resolution 1514 (XV) on decolonization applies in this case  specifically its paragraph 6  which regards as essential the principles of national unity and territorial integrity; (d) the interests of the inhabitants of Gibraltar must be protected on termination of the colonial status. That is the United Nations doctrine on Gibraltar.104.	On the basis of this doctrine  in May of 1966 the Spanish Government initiated negotiations which had .to be broken off in March 1968 due to the evident lack of willingness to negotiate on the part of Great Britain as demonstrated  among others  by the following facts.105.	First  the United Kingdom declared on 12 July 1966 that the territory on which it had installed a military airport was also under British sovereignty. This area was between the wall arbitrarily put up by the English in 1909  despite Spanish protests  and the confines of the ""city and castle of Gibraltar  together with its port  defences and fortresses""  which is all that was ceded under the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713.106.	The second fact that shows the lack of desire on the part of the United Kingdom Government to negotiate is the following. On 5 January 1967 the British claimed the right to use Spanish air space in connexion with the operation of the military airport at Gibraltar.107.	Thirdly  although disapproved by the Special Committee  a referendum was held on 10 September 1967-10 days after the Committee's condemnation. The referendum was also repudiated three months later by the General Assembly in resolution 2353 (XXII) of 19 December 1967.108.	Despite these serious unilateral British actions  and as a manifestation of goodwill and in order to facilitate a solution of the problem  the Spanish Government has  since November 1969  been attempting by every means to create an appropriate climate for dialogue and understanding with Great Britain. That has resulted in 10 meetings between the Foreign Ministers of both countries  at all of which the problem of Gibraltar has been dealt with at length.109.	During the course of almost four years  therefore  Spain has attempted to open the way to negotiations with a view to achieving the decolonization of Gibraltar  at all tunes bearing in mind the interests of the inhabitants of Gibraltar — some 20 000 people-while searching for an understanding with the United Kingdom likely to serve Spanish-British common interests of both nations which hold out such great prospects for friendly co-operation.110.	Unfortunately  the only results of all those talks has been the proof that Great Britain continues to be unwilling to negotiate  inasmuch as it has rejected outright the generous Spanish proposals  alleging that they imply a transfer of sovereignty  a concept that is inadmissible to the British Government in spite of the fact that  in the case of Gibraltar  decolonization  according to United Nations doctrine  consists of ceding sovereignty over that colony or military base and reincorporating it into Spanish territory.111.	To conceal its stubborn attitude  the United Kingdom Government has attempted to use die people of Gibraltar as a screen and to disregard the fact that the 1967 referendum was  as I have said  was rejected by the United Nations in its resolution 2353 (XXII).112.	This is a key point that must be kept very much in mind because that referendum was ludicrous. How can a military base seek self-determination? But the farce is even more obvious if we remember that  when the British occupied the Gibraltar fortress  the original Spanish population was forced to leave. That vacuum was filled over the course of the years by people of different origins  arriving at various times. The United Kingdom never allowed my people to return to Gibraltar. Even those Spaniards whom it used as an effective labour force for many years were compelled to return every night to their homes in towns outside the confines of the fortress-colony.113.	With regard to Gibraltar  Great Britain has always tried to protect itself behind third parties  using them as a cover. Thus  it occupied the fortress militarily in the name of Archduke Charles of Austria  a pretender to the Spanish throne during the War of the Spanish Succession. The Archduke lost the war  but the British remained in Gibraltar. On taking it they invoked the specious argument that they were defending the cause of the Archduke. Now that the time has come for decolonization they use the inhabitants of Gibraltar.114.	United Nations resolutions are addressed to the United Kingdom but it disregards them and in this forum claims and seeks to make us believe that if there is anyone that must abide by them it is the Gibraltarians and not the colonial Power. At other times it claims full competence in the matter. Thus  for example  we find the following in the British commentaries of 21 July 1966  in reply to the Spanish claim:""The Spanish supposition that Her Majesty's Government believes the people of Gibraltar can dispose of the territory of Gibraltar according to their wishes is in error. It has stated on many occasions  specifically in White Paper 2632  that sovereignty over Gibraltar lies with the British Crown.""115.	Again  the United Kingdom Government  through an Order-in-Council  inserted in the preamble to the so-called 1969 Constitution of Gibraltar certain clauses according to which  in the final analysis  it could not return sovereignty to Spain without the consent of the inhabitants  thus ignoring both the Treaty of Utrecht and United Nations resolutions.116.	All of this shows that the British attitude could not be more contradictory. In its way of dealing-or rather  of not dealing-with the Gibraltar problem  it is acting like the Sun King: ""1 am Gibraltar"". However  when urged to decolonize the fortress  it washes its hands of the affair  as if Gibraltar came under a sovereignty other than its own.117.	This manipulation of interests alien to its own ends is shown in the supposed defence of the inhabitants  for whom Spain has offered  and is willing to grant  every kind of legal and economic safeguard.118.	The British Government stubbornly asserts that the Gibraltarians are unanimous in rejecting the Spanish point of view on Gibraltar. That is not true. On many occasions eminent Gibraltarians have spoken out-in fact  even recently  before the British Governor of the fortress himself- calling for a negotiated solution with Spain.119.	The British Government  as the only valid interlocutor  has received from the Spanish Government extremely generous offers for the inhabitants of Gibraltar. But Great Britain has rejected our offers without letting the inhabitants of Gibraltar know of them  and has made no counter-offers or proposals. By adopting that negative and closed attitude  Great Britain is materially strangling the life of the inhabitants and crippling their future development  which would be enormous once they returned to the nation whose language they speak and of which they are geographically and economically a part in view of the enormous rate of growth of the Spanish economy which  according to the reports of international economic organizations  will continue in the coming years.120.	We consider the people of Gibraltar as our brothers. Spain pledges itself solemnly before this General Assembly to guarantee  once the era of colonization ends in Gibraltar  the preservation of the present political  administrative and judicial organization in Gibraltar with only the substitution of the British by the corresponding Spanish authorities  a substitution that is inherent in decolonization and the consequent transfer of sovereignty over the territory.121.	Thus the people of Gibraltar will enjoy a special status' of legislative  judicial  administrative and financial autonomy  which will respect their choice in matters of nationality  their present civic rights and freedoms  their local government and their status as a free port.122.	Similarly  Spain solemnly undertakes to ensure  as a minimum  the per capita income which the inhabitants may have achieved  and their annual growth rate  to maintain the level of income of its active population  social security benefits and other legitimate interests  all of which would be guaranteed by both Spain and the United Nations and not  as they are at present  subjected to a colonial status depending solely upon Great Britain.123.	Our delegation in the debates in the Fourth Committee will elaborate on that offer.124.	Spain reserves the right to take whatever steps are necessary to achieve the decolonization of Gibraltar and once again proclaims that it is sincerely ready to negotiate constructively if and when the British Government shows a true wish to negotiate. Our position cannot be clearer  firmer  nor more generous.125.	I have dwelt on this question of Gibraltar at some length because  however unbelievable it may seem  neither British nor Gibraltarian public opinion knows the true Spanish position. The silence of the British press was thunderous when I addressed the meetings of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe on 4 July last on the question of Gibraltar. I cherish the hope that the words I have spoken before this General Assembly on the Gibraltar question  a matter that is so vital for relations between the two countries  will merit the attention of the British press  radio and television.126.	Spain's position on the Middle East is one of co-operating in the re-establishment of a just and stable peace in that area.127.	Prime determining factors of our policy are the sincere belief that the acquisition of territory by force is unlawful and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.128.	The friendship of Spain with the Arab world is a factor of peace in the Mediterranean area and one of the constant factors in our history. Spain believes that United Nations resolutions on this subject should be applied inasmuch as they offer a useful basis for a just solution to that conflict.129.	Two factors are of special interest to the Spanish Government in connexion with the peaceful settlement of the Middle East question: the situation of the Palestinian people and the future of Jerusalem. Spain will take a realistic stand vis-à-vis any proposals  whatever their origin  designed to guarantee the legitimate rights of that people and to safeguard the universality of the Holy City. For we believe that there can be no definitive solution to the Middle East question without a solution to those two problems.130.	It has been a commonplace to say that the countries of Spanish America have a great future. I would add that that future has already begun  perhaps with the upheavals that sometimes accompany a new birth.131.	The reasons for which Spain feels so closely and fraternally tied to the destinies of the peoples of Spanish America are many. They are the noble ties of a common culture  common traditions and common ancestry. It is for that reason that we have never permitted  and shall never permit  differences of ideology or political systems to interfere with the normal relations between our countries. One does not impose conditions on one's brother to love him.132.	The problems of Spanish America are the problems of the developing countries. We defend the right of nations to find the most appropriate solutions to their problems  in keeping with the temperament  the social conditions  thehistoric destiny of each people  without foreign interference and without the imposition of stereotyped solutions.133.	Spain places at the disposal of those sister nations its own modest but valid experience  experience it has acquired in its own fight for development and its own search for a better quality of life. A network of cooperative agreements involving the furnishing of experts and capital goods and the acceptance of technicians and scholars has been extended across the Atlantic  and links in that network are becoming stronger as time passes.134.	An example of this close and effective co-operation is the Conference of Ministers for Planning and Development  which met in Madrid last May and which now  after its institutionalization  has become a forum for the periodic exchange of views and the adoption of mutual agreements. Spain carries out with pleasure its duty to co-operate in the development of the peoples of Spanish America  and this for elementary reasons of solidarity and profound feelings of brotherhood.135.	It is in that same spirit that I wish to reaffirm the ties that bind Spain to Portugal  a country with which we share the Iberian peninsula in a spirit of brotherly respect that dates back many centuries.136.	The image of that peace which humanity clamours for today requires the renunciation of aggression  even the kind that on the surface does not use force; but it also calls for the creation of minimal co-operative relations  excluding panic and the mistrust under which the younger generation have grown up. Many of them are deserting communal tasks when faced by a world that they regard as badly structured.137.	The principles of mutual respect  equilibrium and security  the idea of peaceful coexistence in its strictest sense of positive co-operation  are necessary but insufficient in themselves to contemporary man because of the many vast problems that beset us. I am referring to the paucity of means to meet the most elementary needs of many peoples when so much is absorbed by the well-labelled ""industry of death"". I am referring also to the energy crisis  to the ever-growing danger of an ecology imbalanced  to the chronic instability of our monetary system-to mention but some of the most important. Because of their intensity  their acceleration and their extensive repercussions  those problems go far beyond mere national interests and require a global strategy if the human race is to survive.138.	Unless we react in time in the face of the hunger of many hundreds of millions of human beings and the slow erosion of the possibilities of life on our planet we expose ourselves to great conflicts  bringing in their wake irreparable damage.139.	The construction of an integrated peace demands today that we search far beyond mere formulas of self-security or peaceful coexistence. It demands the definition of a great policy of co-operation for the future good of the whole of mankind.140.	In short  only the firm and common will to overcome the multiple problems of peace at this universal cross-roads of this our only earth will be the most effective proof of the true unity of the United Nations."
"36",2263,"ETH",28,1973,"﻿106.	 I find it a source of great pleasure to preface my statement this afternoon by expressing to the President my very warm felicitations upon his election to the high office of President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We regard his unanimous and well-deserved election not only as a personal tribute to his eminent qualities as an accomplished diplomat of great skill and experience and as a man of great devotion to the ideals of universal peace and human dignity  but also as a recognition of Ecuador's belief in the unreserved support for the principles that inspire the United Nations. I wish to seize this opportunity to assure him that my delegation stands prepared to place its complete co-operation at his disposal as he endeavours to fulfil the high duties with which this Assembly has entrusted him.107.	His predecessor in the post of President  Mr. Stanislaw Trepzcynski  deserves our gratitude for the competent manner in which he presided over the work of the General Assembly at its last session. Through you  Sir  I am happy to extend to him the appreciation of the Ethiopian delegation.108.	The current session of the General Assembly has  through the: happy enlargement of the United Nations roster  witnessed a further positive development towards the achievement of the principle of universality of membership in our Organization. It is from that perspective  therefore  that my delegation views the admission of the German Democratic Republic  the Federal Republic of Germany and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to the United Nations. To all three  I extend the warm welcome of my delegation and wish to assure them of our co-operation and friendship as they join us here in the United Nations to work together towards the attainment of our common objectives of international peace and co-operation.109.	The admission to membership in the United Nations of the two Germanys  in particular  is not without its historic significance. As we all know  both East and West Germany are not States which acceded to sovereign and independent political existence immediately preceding their admission to membership  as has been the case with the preponderant majority of States which joined the United Nations as Members since the signing of the Charter in San Francisco 28 years ago. Rather  the prolonged exclusion of those States from membership in the United Nations has been a consequence of the rigidities of the polarized cold-war diplomacy that had hitherto characterized the conduct of international political intercourse. The approval without dissent of the application for membership of the two Germanys by the Security Council is therefore an event which we must all applaud and welcome as it not only appreciably contributed towards the strengthening of the United Nations itself but also established a pattern for the future resolution of the yet unsettled questions of membership in the United Nations of the remaining divided States. The significance of the admission of the two Germanys could be viewed as an added evidence of the changing nature of the. international political climate  which is witnessing the steady replacement of the era of confrontation by an era of accommodation based on the perception of mutual self-interest. In this regard  it remains our firm conviction that if the United Nations is to be capable of playing the role of a constructive and effective international Organization  it must be representative and open  and not discriminatory or exclusive in its membership.110.	As in the past  the current session of the Genera! Assembly has afforded Members yet another opportunity not only to review and examine the questions with which the United Nations is currently seized but also to address themselves to some others which  in their respective views  relate  in some manner  to the achievement the overall aims of our Organization. Quite naturally  I feel that such an exercise could commence with some general references to some of the more important developments in the international scene during the past year.111.	At the outset  I am satisfied to note that the trend towards the over-all relaxation of tension in inter-State relations  and  in particular  in relations affecting the major Powers of the world  began only recently and has continued to show steady improvement. My Government attaches great importance to this welcome development as we believe that  in the present era of astounding technological refinements which  inter alia  have given man the unprecedented capability for instant self-destruction  every minute step taken in the direction of mutual understanding and accommodation amongst friends and adversaries alike is a positive evolution worth acclaiming. The risk to world peace — a peace whose fortunes are solely based on uncertain hopes and mere assumptions that the worst might somehow be avoided-is  to say the least  enormous. It is therefore such an appreciation  coupled with an awareness of the stark reality of the physical and political interdependence of international life today that prompts my Government to evaluate as positive  and to support  any development on the international scene that contributes towards the establishment of an enduring peace in the world. In this context  I wish to refer to some events that have occurred since we last met here which  in the view of my delegation  can be considered as developments of positive significance to international stability.112.	The effort not long ago initiated to establish a more stable international system increasingly free of the risks of nuclear confrontation was given further impetus by the official visit to Washington last June of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Mr. Leonid Brezhnev. Although it may be premature to evaluate with precision the over-all impact of the various agreements signed by President Nixon and General Secretary Brezhnev subsequent to their summit talks  we can nevertheless venture to assert that the spirit which underlay those accords was a further positive development in strengthening international peace and security. We believe that the code of conduct signed by the two leaders to reduce the risk of nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union and between either party and other countries is  in particular  a major contribution to the preservation of peace in the world.113.	The convening in Helsinki  Finland  of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at the beginning of July this year was another event which we consider to be of significance. Viewed against the background of the seemingly unbridgeable political and economic schism that had characterized Europe after the Second World War  indeed the recent attempt at Helsinki to establish a better foundation for improved and mutually advantageous relations was one that must be commended. Unless for emphasis  the obvious fact that Europe had for over two decades  remained a potential flash-point for war need not be restated here. We hope the desire to reduce tension in this part of the world will find further concrete expressions in the years to come.114.	As we ushered in the new year  an important agreement was signed in Paris which sought to terminate the active hostilities which had raged mercilessly in Indochina for over a decade  causing untold sufferings to the inhabitants of that peninsula. The Paris agreement of last January  which called for a general cease-fire in Viet-Nam  also provided for the withdrawal of foreign troops  thus paving the way for the people of Viet-Nam to exercise their inalienable right to determine for themselves  without any outside interference  the future of their political destiny. My Government I is satisfied that it has at last become possible for the parties in the Viet-Nam conflict to resolve their differences by negotiation and mutual agreement rather than through recourse to destructive violence.  the continuation and escalation of which had posed a serious and dangerous threat to international peace and harmony. We are all the more pleased at the outcome  as we had  in this and other international forums  repeatedly advocated  as the sine qua non for ending the war in Viet-Nam  the same cardinal elements eventually incorporated in the Paris Agreement. It is the earnest hope of my Government that  with the end of the hostilities  the people of Viet-Nam will begin to enjoy the peace and tranquillity in their land denied them for over a quarter of a century and will now have the unhampered opportunity to channel their energies into the pursuit of their social and economic goals.115.	Similarly  we have taken note of the pact of Vientiane-the agreement signed last February on restoring peace and achieving national concord in Laos. Indeed  it has been gratifying for us to observe that the contagion of peace in Viet-Nam has spilled over into neighbouring Laos. We hope that agreement will continue to be respected so that peace will prevail in the country.116.	The situation in Cambodia  unfortunately  continues to be the anomaly of the trend in the rest of Indo-China. The military conflict  continues unabated and with it the anguish and suffering of the people of Cambodia  It is our hope that the people of Cambodia will be left to themselves to find appropriate solutions to their own-political problems.117.	While it is true that we take satisfaction from witnessing the accelerated tempo in the normalization of relations among the great Powers  as well as from the observation that some of the pressing international problems in some regions of the world  notably those in Europe and in South-East Asia  are being resolved  we cannot nevertheless  hide our dismay and serious concern at the lack of concomitant progress in the search for solutions to such vital issues as decolonization  the Middle East  disarmament  and economic development.118.	That the United Nations efforts to bring freedom and dignity to the millions of Africans still suffering from colonial and racial oppression have not registered any single perceptible success within the past year needs no emphasis. Nor does the sad and well-known fact of the escalation of the brutal repression of the African masses by the colonial- racist regimes of southern Africa require any detailed recitation on the part of my delegation.119.	My Government notes with profound regret that the continued stifling of the legitimate aspirations of the oppressed peoples of southern Africa to freedom and dignity by those who hold their own selfish and misguided interests of surpassing importance has not caused sufficient moral indignation in the international community to compel it to act in concert not only in the defence of the rights of the peoples of southern Africa  but  more importantly  in the supreme interest of the overriding principles that are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. It is the considered view of my delegation that it is this apparent neglect of the anguish and sufferings of the peoples of southern Africa by the international community that has encouraged the colonialists to engage in unconscionable excesses in order to guarantee their position of controlling the lives and destinies of the peoples they remorselessly subjugate and exploit. The incalculable death and destruction that are now being perpetrated by the colonialists in southern Africa as well as in Guinea (Bissau) are the direct consequence of the failure of the international community to which I have just referred.120.	In the face of the regrettable complacency on the part of the allies and trading partners of Portugal regarding the plight of the peoples under Portuguese subjugation  it is indeed no surprise that Portugal has continued to prosecute its colonial wars in Angola  Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau with ever more ferocity. The recent revelation of the massacre of 400 innocent men  women and children at Wiriyamu in Mozambique is but one more example of the depth to which Portugal is prepared to sink in its vain attempt to force the surrender of the liberation struggle  How many horrifying massacres of the type that took place at Wiriyamu are needed before the friends and allies of Portugal realize their responsibilities and begin to deny their support to a country that insists on enslaving millions of Africans and exploiting the resources of their territories?121.	The situation in Zimbabwe continues to deteriorate as the rebel regime  in co-operation with Portuguese and South African forces  increases its military offensive against the liberation struggle  thereby escalating tension in the colony. In an apparent attempt to emulate the policy of apartheid as practised in South Africa  the rebel regime announced  in Salisbury last March  plans for the establishment of ""Bantustans""  which it euphemistically called ""regional authorities""  thus confirming our suspicions that the rebels are determined to impose apartheid on the African masses of Zimbabwe  In spite of such a turn for the worse in the situation in the colony  what we now hear is not of any new resolve on the part of the administering Power to rectify its mishandling of the insurrection in the colony  but rather of further disquieting reports of contacts between Britain and the rebels  the purpose of which could only be to legitimize the rebellion of the racist minority in power and to relegate the overwhelming African majority to perpetual subjugation.122.	As for the sanctions imposed against the Territory by the Security Council  their ineffectiveness continues to be starkly demonstrated by the defiant survival of the Salisbury regime itself as well as by the increase in the number of breaches that are taking place. The recent sale of three Boeing jet aircraft to the regime clearly underscores the urgent need for a critical reappraisal of the sanctions policy if the effort to restore legality in the Territory is to be successful. 123.	The question of Namibia has remained deadlocked as the South African Government continues to manipulate the opportunity provided by the decision of the Security Council in its resolution 309 (1972) that requested the Secretary-General to initiate contacts with it. After repeated and patient attempts to probe the South African intention with respect to the political future of Namibia  the Secretary-General has  in his latest report   confirmed the failure of the South African Government to provide an unambiguous response in regard to the question of granting to the people of Namibia the right of self-determination and independence envisaged under resolution 323 (1972). This South African equivocation comes to us as no surprise since we had nurtured no illusions to begin with about South Africa's true designs and intentions with respect to Namibia. It is our belief that the United Nations must abandon forthwith any false hopes and consider the adoption of other means to extricate the Namibian people from the illegal colonial occupation of South Africa.124.	The armed struggle now under way in southern Africa as well as in Guinea-Bissau between those who are in legitimate pursuit of their freedom and dignity and those who insist on continuing their colonial and racial domination has reached a new and dangerous level. As the liberation forces intensify their armed struggle to dislodge the oppressors  the colonialists in unholy alliance among themselves have stepped up their vicious and indiscriminate wars of oppression. We believe that the United Nations has a responsibility to assist those who  by fighting for their rights to self-determination and independence  are also fighting for the respect of the principles that are embodied in the Charter of the United Nations. The recognition by the United Nations of the legitimacy of the struggle of colonial peoples must be coupled with the resolve to render not only moral but also material assistance to the liberation struggle  We consider the decision adopted at the last session of the General Assembly to grant observer status to African liberation movements recognized by the Organization of African Unity [OAU] to be of great political importance to the anti-colonial struggle. In this regard we also consider the convening of a conference in Oslo  Norway  last April in support of the oppressed peoples of southern Africa to be of significance particularly from the point of view of its advantage in creating international public awareness regarding the gravity of the problem prevailing in southern Africa.125.	That colonialism and racialism have denied Africa peace and tranquillity has now become too obvious a fact. In this connexion I cannot emphasize too much the urgent necessity of effective pressures being exercised on the culprits of southern Africa  particularly by those States Members of this Organization which  by virtue of their close friendship  have the leverage to persuade and prevail upon them to put an end to the wanton killings and mass destruction they are perpetrating in that part of the world.126.	Since the founding of OAU 10 years ago last May  African States have co-ordinated their efforts in the unremitting struggle against the colonialist-racialist alliance. As a concrete harmonization of African policies to combat effectively the oppressions and injustices which are being perpetrated on African soil  the positive role which is being played by OAU has indeed been significant. The consolidation of the freedom struggle in Africa owes as much to OAU as it does to the sacrifices which the various African national liberation movements themselves are making to liberate their land from ruthless subjugators. To this extent it will be no exaggeration to say that OAU has been complementing United Nations efforts in the sphere of decolonization.127.	All men of good conscience must realize that the liberation struggle in Africa is essentially a struggle for human rights. As States Members of the United Nations prepare to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  I wonder how much thought will be given to the plight of the peoples of southern Africa who have for long been denied the most rudimentary individual liberties which many of us take for granted.128.	We note that no progress has been achieved in the past year in the effort to bring peace to another area of potential danger to international stability. I am  of course  referring to the situation in the Middle East  where the task of finding a just and lasting solution to the problem continues to be stalemated. A hazardous state of suspended hostilities has characterized the area ever since the cease-fire agreement went into effect in August 1970. In the meantime  violence and retribution continue to be perpetrated  as what has come to be described as ""the Arab- Israeli secret war"" assumes new scope and dimensions with its inevitable hazards to those innocent bystanders who are unrelated in any way to the conflict in the Middle East.129.	On the diplomatic front  the recent broad review conducted by the Security Council of the situation in the Middle East has failed to yield any new direction which might have been pursued in the important search for an acceptable and durable peace in the Middle East.130.	Because of our close proximity to the area of hostilities  I cannot help but declare our most profound distress at the fact that the quest for peace has become as elusive as ever. Our support for Security Council resolution 242(1967) was prompted by our strong desire to ensure that an acceptable formula was established as a framework for resolving the central issues that have remained at the root of the Arab-Israeli problem. In this context  I wish to refer to the statement made by my august Sovereign  His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I  at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries:""The peoples of that region require a just and lasting peace to realize their human potential and develop the natural resources of the area for the betterment of their lives. As a condition to a lasting solution  we ""must call upon Israel to withdraw from the Arab territories she occupied six years ago.""131. Let me now turn briefly to another important issue which  because of its increasingly enormous bearing on world peace  has been of great concern to our Organization ever since its inception. It is universally agreed that among the means of ensuring international peace  one of exceptional importance is that of disarmament. Yet  in spite of this recognition  progress over the years towards the goal of both conventional and nuclear disarmament has become painfully slow. Nevertheless  we note with satisfaction the agreements signed last June between the United States and the USSR on the prevention of nuclear war and the limitation of strategic armaments. The expressed intention of achieving agreement from the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks within 18 months is also encouraging.132.	The hope we expressed last year for an early conclusion of an agreement to ban chemical weapons has not  regrettably  been realized. My Government would like to urge once again that no effort should be spared to reach agreement not only on a comprehensive prohibition of all chemical weapons  but also on a provision to ensure the destruction of the existing arsenal of chemical weapons.133.	Last August marked the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Moscow11 — a treaty which banned the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere  on the surface of the ground and under water. It would have been most appropriate if during this anniversary year  it had been possible to eliminate the two defects of the Treaty-firstly  its implicit legitimization of underground nuclear tests and  secondly  the absence of the other nuclear Powers from the roster of the signatories of the Treaty. In this regard  we wish to emphasize the extreme importance of making every effort to prevent any further radioactive defilement of the atmosphere.134.	The armaments race has proved to be not only a drain on vital resources which could have been employed to improve the quality of life for mankind  but also a paramount reason for the erosion of mutual trust and confidence among States. It has often been stated that it is the balance of terror that has somehow reduced the possibility of a nuclear confrontation among the great Powers. For our part  we should like to see peace assured  not by virtue of a hazardous balance of terror  but by positive and effective measures of disarmament. And  in this regard  no doubt a carefully prepared and properly convened world disarmament conference could be a useful exercise. But  as the experience of the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference has so far shown  the understanding and co-operation of all nuclear weapon States becomes indispensable if any progress is to be registered in the effort to halt and reverse the armaments race.135.	Among the problems which continue to tax the energy and imagination of our Organization is the area of international economic and social development. The recent review and appraisal of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade has shown that even the modest and agreed targets we had set out to achieve are proving to be extremely difficult if not altogether impossible to attain. The statistics in this regard are  at the very least  discouraging. While of all the developing countries of the world only one third exceeded the over-all target of a 6 per cent annual growth rate in 1972  one half of them could not even register a growth rate of 5 per cent. Indeed  to make matters worse  in about one fifth of the developing countries a decline in per capita income was evident.136.	The gap between the developed and the developing nations is thus increasing rather than decreasing as had hopefully been anticipated with the launching of the Second Development Decade. That there is a direct correlation between both economic and social development  on the one hand  and international stability  on the other  is a fact which has now become accepted. In view of this  it therefore becomes incumbent upon all members of the international community to renew their solemn commitments to the struggle against the basic economic and social ills impeding the achievement of an improved quality of life for all mankind. In the interdependent world of today we simply cannot afford to falter in our courage to rise up to meet such rudimentary challenges affecting the daily lives and over-all welfare of the human family.137.	The United Nations  as an international institution dedicated to the service of all mankind  has  over the years  evolved in response to the demand of changing times. We thus see it today grappling increasingly not only with issues of international peace and security — to which it accords high priority-but also with problems of trade  development  outer space  the sea-bed  population  environment and human rights. Many of these are staggering problems whose effects transcend the confines of geography and political ideology. They are problems with wider and  in some instances  global implications. And  as such  they can only be tackled effectively within an integrated international response. I believe that the United Nations has the basic institutional set-up needed to facilitate such an international co-operative endeavour. Obviously the United Nations can be improved institutionally to better meet the challenges of contemporary times.138.	But it is no use to decry  the United Nations for failing in this or that sphere of endeavour while we ourselves fail to live up to the commitments voluntarily assumed by the fact of our membership in this Organization. If the United Nations has failed to meet many of the expectations of international public opinion it is because its components-the States that comprise its membership- have been unwilling to give it all the support and co-operation it needs in the discharge if the tasks entrusted to it. And if it is at all possible to affix blame to any single factor for the ills of the United Nations  it can perhaps be ascribed to the general paralysis of the political will of the membership.139.	That the world needs an effective and strengthened United Nations is a fact that no one can controvert. Let us therefore make this recognition our point of departure and resolve to rededicate ourselves not only to the letter but also to the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations so that the world will be a secure and better place to live in for present as well as future generations of mankind."
"37",2309,"FIN",28,1973,"﻿42.	 On behalf of my Government I have the great pleasure to extend to the President my sincere congratulations on his election to the office of the President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I welcome him as an eminent representative of  Latin America. I am confident that under his leadership the Assembly will fulfil its task efficiently.43.	For a long time it has been evident that the situation in the Middle East has been serious and explosive. Once again arms have been resorted to as a means for achieving a solution. The situation in that part of the world is now acute and very dangerous. The outbreak of hostilities may constitute a threat to the international political situation as a whole. I must voice the profound and sincere hope of the Finnish Government that resort to force will be terminated forthwith. It is now the responsibility primarily of the parties concerned and the great Powers to bring about  through peaceful means  a solution based on the provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). In this search for a peaceful solution my Government gives its full support to the efforts and good offices of the United Nations  the Secretary-General and his Special Representative. We believe that this is the only way to secure lasting peace in the area. It is also the way to secure and consolidate the general trend of international detente.44.	For some years we have in fact witnessed a positive trend  a detente in the international situation. My Government sees detente not as an end in itself but as a means further to improve relations between independent and sovereign States Members of this Organization. A positive development in the relations between the major Powers is a necessary pre-condition for the improvement of the over-all international situation. But genuine detente  in our view  is possible only if the interests of the medium and small size countries  which form the majority of the voice of the United Nations  are also duly taken into account. This Organization is a forum where the interests of the great  medium and small Powers alike can be harmonized. By giving their full support to the United Nations Member States serve not only the interests of the world Organization but ultimately also those of their own.45.	In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add.l]  the Secretary-General has stated that Member States should make a realistic judgement of the Organization's potential and decide on contemporary and imaginative ways in which it can be used to meet the problems it faces. The time is  indeed  ripe to try to translate detente into concrete action in the political as well as in the economic^ and social activities of the United Nations. As a small country pursuing a neutral foreign policy and fully committed to the Charter  Finland supports this approach. In our view the membership should now undertake concerted self-searching to further improve the capacity of this Organization to fulfil its primary functions.46.	This year we welcome here three new Members  among them both German States. Finland has consistently advocated the application of the principle of universality. The accession of both German States to the United Nations is of vital importance in this respect. In pursuing reconciliation with each other and in committing themselves to the principles of the Charter the two German States have given fresh impetus to our work for peace and security.47.	The accession of the German States to the United Nations became possible thanks to detente and its impact on developments in Europe. We must guide these developments further towards decreasing political tensions and fear. We must work towards increasing co-operation and mutual confidence on the basis of equality and the right to self-determination. Thus we must also show willingness and make determined efforts towards compromise and conciliation.48.	The Finnish Government is happy to note that its initiatives  especially the multilateral preparatory talks in Helsinki for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  have helped to set in motion extensive negotiations covering many sectors. The multiplicity of fields and the working methods applied* which underline the equal rights of all participants  give the Conference depth and strength. They will ensure that detente will not only affect the actions of Governments but will also enrich the lives of individuals. At the same time co-operation in the economic and humanitarian fields will reduce causes for political tension.49.	The serious commitment of the parties concerned show the existence of a political will to achieve concrete results. Finland expects that the Conference as a part — as an important part — of international and European cooperation will lead to a situation where agreed principles guiding international co-operation and their equal application can be made more effective. We consider the idea of elaborating a method for the peaceful settlement of disputes to be of great importance. We support measures to strengthen confidence and to increase stability. The bilateral and multilateral negotiations on disarmament in Europe — the objectives of which are close to those of the Conference on Security and Co-operation — constitute essential elements in the broader process towards peace and stability on the continent. It is natural  therefore  that these negotiations are also followed with great interest by countries not directly connected with them.50.	The Finnish Government holds the view that the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations must also be the main guide-line in the efforts to achieve the objectives of the European Conference. The Conference is not directed against any non-participating State or continent. Europe may now see the beginning of a new era of security and co-operation  but we in Europe cannot afford isolation — to withdraw into a citadel of peace and plenty —  while the greater part of mankind still suffers from underdevelopment and over-population.51.	My Government had hoped that the prevailing international situation would have created favourable conditions for new measures in the field of disarmament. We welcome the recent accord between the Soviet Union and the United States to conclude an early agreement on further limitations of strategic weapons   including qualitative restrictions. But  to our regret  there has been no real progress in completing the treaties on a prohibition of chemical weapons or a comprehensive test ban. I sincerely hope that the remaining difficulties can be surpassed so that these treaties can be finalized in the near future. A World Disarmament Conference  if well prepared and if all nuclear Powers participate  would permit a universalization of the discussion on the subject. From such a Conference new impetus and new ideas could emerge to the benefit of us all.52.	My Government has been encouraged by the fact that the method of dialogue and negotiation has successfully been employed in several areas of unrest and tension. We have welcomed the peace agreement on Viet-Nam and hope that an early political settlement can be reached in the whole area of Indo-China. We also welcome the agreement on humanitarian problems concluded between India and Pakistan at Delhi on 28 August 1973. It is our hope that the positive development in the Korean peninsula can continue and that the dialogue between the Korean States can advance.53.	The Government and the people of Finland have been deeply shocked over the recent developments in Chile. In addition to profound disappointment and sorrow caused by the violent elimination of a legally elected President  we in Finland are seriously concerned at the future of peaceful democratic progress not only in that country but also in a wider context. My Government joins in the appeals of world public opinion addressed to the present regime in Chile that violence should cease. The Government of Finland hopes that a democratic system will be restored in Chile as soon as possible.54.	Some of our most serious problems are in southern Africa. Finland has consistently advocated that the African peoples should be given the right to self-determination in accordance with the Charter. We reject and condemn the policy of apartheid practised by the Government in South Africa. As the sanctions against the illegal Rhodesian regime have not been successful  we support the efforts of the sanctions committee of the Security Council  to work out realistic measures through which the sanctions could be made fully effective. We firmly urge Portugal to abandon her colonial policy so that the peoples in the territories concerned may be granted their inalienable right to self- determination.55.	On the question of the law of the sea  we consider it important that the international area of the sea-bed should be exploited for the common good. Furthermore  it is our opinion that in the field of fisheries certain privileges should be given to those coastal States  such as Iceland  whose economy is overwhelmingly dependent on fishing.56.	International co-operation in the economic  social and human rights fields has reached a scale and intensity unforeseen when our Organization was established. Over the years new problems have emerged  bringing with them the necessity to create corresponding institutions. This development has not always taken place under a systematic or co-ordinated plan. As a result we have today a very complex network of organizations and institutions  without a clearly defined division of responsibilities and work. This does indeed necessitate a reassessment by the membership of how the capacity and potential of the Organization can best be used to meet present and future needs. My delegation believes that the invitation of the Secretary-General for such a reassessment is timely.57.	This becomes all the more urgent today as the world community is embarking on new ventures of global importance. The new round of multilateral trade negotiations  the reform of the international monetary system  our determination to fight against the threats to our environment  the necessity to achieve a minimum of world food security and the World Population Year prove that the United Nations system is well aware of the challenge and of its own responsibilities. But these problems must be dealt with comprehensively and in an integrated manner.58.	Our ultimate objective under the International Development Strategy of the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] must be to improve the condition of man  of the individual. The implementation of the Strategy is at present under review. One cannot but agree that there is cause for frustration and criticism; but there is still time for determined efforts to bring the Decade to a successful conclusion. The responsibility for mobilizing  guiding and co-ordinating action towards that end rests  inside the United Nations system  with the Economic and Social Council. The Council has recently shown an increasing awareness of this responsibility. My Government will continue to give the Council its full support in that task.59.	The responsibility for achieving the goals and objectives of the Strategy lies  however  ultimately with the Member States themselves  developing and developed alike. Although the impact of the contribution of a relatively small country cannot be decisive  Finland also has its share of this global challenge. Thus my Government in submitting its budget proposals for next year  has included appropriations for international development assistance which represent an increase of 36 per cent as compared to 1973. In this connexion I can announce that my Government is ready to participate with an increasing share in the replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association decided upon only a few days ago at the Joint Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Nairobi.60.	A prerequisite for the attainment of the basic goal of the Strategy — the improvement of the conditions of man —  is that no one should be excluded from the benefits of the development process on any discriminatory grounds  be they of race or of religion  or on any other grounds. It is therefore deplorable that today  25 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  one still has to reaffirm from this rostrum the necessity of eliminating racism and racial discrimination. The Continued existence of systematically exercised racial discrimination in southern Africa and other tragic events in that part of the continent unfortunately prove that we are still far away from the goals of the Charter. My delegation will therefore fully support the launching at this session of the international Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination."
"38",2355,"FJI",28,1973,"﻿ Mr. President  on behalf of my delegation may I  like the representatives who have preceded me at this podium during this session  express congratulations to you on your well-deserved elevation to the presidency of the General Assembly and pledge to you our whole-hearted support and co-operation.73. My delegation would also like to take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to the two German States and to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas on joining the United Nations. It is only three years since Fiji  immediately on attaining independence  joined this august body  but from our brief experience we are convinced that the United Nations will be able to discharge its responsibility under the Charter more effectively the more fully representative it is of all mankind.74.	As a small country  we are fully appreciative that the greatest virtue of this world forum is that  despite differences in size  wealth and political systems  all countries can come together freely to discuss and consult on a wide range of problems of common concern and to take appropriate measures to resolve them. We have also learned in the short time of our membership that the collective will and wisdom of this world forum can sometimes be frustrated by self-interest  national pride and other weaknesses among its members. With those weaknesses eliminated  the potential for success of this Organization is incalculable.75.	The demonstration by the United Nations of the advantages of diversity and co-operation is particularly important to Fiji because we have a multiracial society. We believe that differences in race  religion  language and custom can add richness and variety of texture to our composite society. All sections of our multiracial community are accordingly agreed that our future must lie in developing a relationship based on equality  mutual respect  tolerance and understanding. These values are enshrined in our Constitution.76.	Situated in the South Pacific  Fiji seems remote from the international scene. Indeed  we in the South Pacific have sometimes felt that ours is a neglected region of the world. As world leaders travel to and fro on important missions  one does not hear of them visiting the South Pacific  although our problems are just as varied and as complex as those one may find anywhere. External events can and do have disturbing effects on race relations in Fiji. The expulsion of Asians across frontiers  armed conflicts involving Moslem and Hindu religious communities  and racial tensions in predominantly white communities-these threaten and undermine the success of our policy of multiracial harmony. You  Mr. President  and the representatives present this afternoon need not be reminded of the disruptive effects of the economy of a country such as mine of currency devaluation and revaluation decided on by others without consultation with and apparently without concern about other countries which are likely to be adversely affected. So interwoven are our interests and welfare in an ever-shrinking world that the need for devising and observing agreed international standards in all fields of human endeavour is absolutely vital.77.	It is  therefore  a matter of great importance to Fiji to look to this world body not only for sympathy and understanding of its problems but also for its determination to set  and to promote the universal observance of  certain practical standards for the benefit of the international community. Surely these standards must include freedom to decide one's destiny  racial equality and harmony  respect for international law and order and a greater realization of the fact that we are all  large and small  interdependent.78.	Yet it is a sad reflection on the state of world affairs today that  25 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the dignity of man and basic human rights are still being denied in southern Africa. Political domination based on the perpetration of racial injustice and economic exploitation can only heighten tensions and instability in the area.79.	The problems of race relations in southern Africa are complex and not easy to solve. It is my delegation's view that a solution based on dialogue and peaceful change can and should be found. In regard to United Nations work relating to southern Africa  my delegation urges that we do not lose patience in the pursuit of solutions by dialogue and other peaceful means. If the South Africans  the Portuguese and the illegal Smith regime appear to have hearts of stone  we would counsel patience  persistence and perseverance as against threats and the use of force. We would counsel that we watch for and exploit to the full any signs of readiness to talk  of softening of hearts and of the slightest change in known positions. In our view  it would be unproductive  and indeed highly dangerous  if we were to consider the use of force as the only means of achieving self-determination and independence in southern Africa. We believe that the United Nations has made and can continue to make a real contribution towards bringing about this beneficial change. It is  therefore  a matter of serious concern that some responsible Members-while declaring in this forum their support for the principles of the United Nations Charter and for the rights of self-determination and independence of dependent peoples  and their opposition to the policy of apartheid-have not in practice adhered to international measures designed to help the oppressed peoples in the area. They have in fact directly and indirectly encouraged the very Governments the United Nations is trying to persuade to abide by internationally accepted principles which we are all pledged and charged by the Charter to pursue.80.	Another form of injustice which calls for urgent effective and concerted international action is the increasing incidence of acts of politically inspired terrorism against innocent individuals. We refer to the hijacking of commercial aircraft  kidnapping  the use of letter bombs- and other such devices. Fiji will continue to support any internationally agreed preventive measures  and regards this as a matter of the highest priority for the United Nations. However  here again  measures to combat illegal terrorist activities and  indeed  to promote universal respect for international law and order will work only if all nations co-operate in observing them. The sense of urgency and the strong desire to rid the world of terrorist acts should not be permitted to be blunted by the supporters of their perpetrators.81.	Fiji has on numerous occasions voiced in this Assembly and in other international forums its strong opposition to the continuation of all nuclear-weapon tests in any environment  and in particular nuclear testing in I the atmosphere in the South Pacific. With 300 scattered islands and with limited land resources  Fiji regards the sea and its resources as matters of vital importance in its efforts to improve the quality and standard of life of its people. It is for that reason that Fiji is seeking  at the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  the recognition by the international community of the special needs and interests of mid-ocean archipelagic States. But it is for the same reason that the Government and people of Fiji have taken very seriously the resumption by France of atmospheric nuclear testing in the South Pacific.82.	We appreciate that the primary concern of a country must be to safeguard its national security against external aggression  but it must be equally recognized that we are all members of a world community and action taken by one member can impinge on the rights of others. It is  therefore  to be regretted that  as a responsible member of the international community  France has continued to conduct nuclear testing in the atmosphere at a point far removed from its own metropolitan territory  thus endangering the marine resources  health and lives of peoples of the South Pacific region.83.	The international community has shown its strong opposition to nuclear weapons and nuclear testing in numerous resolutions and various international treaties and in the recurring appearance on the agenda of the General Assembly of items dealing with disarmament and the creation of nuclear-free or peace zones. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the partial test-ban Treaty   whose basic aim is to end the nuclear arms race and thus eliminate the need for nuclear weapons and their testing. Yet France has ignored the call of the international community for the halting of all atmospheric nuclear-weapon testing in the Pacific or elsewhere  and its call for all States that have not done so to adhere to the partial test-ban Treaty. It has chosen to disregard the terms of an interim injunction granted by the world Court.  At a time when the world community is actively concerned with the law of the sea  France has cordoned off a large area of the high seas far beyond the boundary of the territorial sea of its testing site. This is a dangerous encroachment of the long-standing principle of freedom of the high seas  and when States continue to show a total disregard for accepted international legal norms  it is the world community as a whole that suffers. Only last week  the South Pacific Conference  meeting in Guam  passed a strongly worded resolution in condemnation of these tests and all other nuclear tests. The Secretary-General of the South Pacific Commission was asked by the Conference to transmit the resolution to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the information of its Members.84.	It follows that Fiji will welcome the opportunity to discuss with our Pacific neighbours the proposal for a nuclear-free zone in the region as mentioned yesterday by the Prime Minister of New Zealand.85.	I have already referred to the forthcoming Conference on the Law of the Sea. The issues to be discussed at that Conference are of immediate concern to my country  as indeed to other States  for the seas not only surround us but also join the component islands of Fiji into one nation. My country  as a member of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction  which is preparing the Conference  is very much aware of the complexity of the issues and the diversity of interests which have dogged the Committee's work. My delegation believes that the Conference can accomplish its complex and difficult task only if all interests groups decide to demonstrate a genuine willingness to resolve the intractable issues facing them. What is necessary on the part of all States is the political will to negotiate and a spirit of co-operation and mutual accommodation. What we look for is not only a sense of realism in the claims to national jurisdiction  but also a willingness on the part of the major maritime Powers to recognize the fact that a new law of the sea is evolving. In our view  the international community must choose to establish a new order of the oceans for the benefit of all  or else risk allowing the present situation to degenerate into a new area of tension  lawlessness and uncontrolled exploitation  from which only the more developed few will benefit.86.	What the Secretary-General has called the ""new balance of prudence""  accompanying the detente between the United States and the Soviet Union and between the United States and China  has raised hopes for a more peaceful world. The successful completion of the first phase of the strategic arms limitation talks  the launching of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and talks on force reductions in Europe  and the presence in our midst of the two German States-these have all borne witness to this new mood. The reduction of fears of survival is an objective which must continue to be pursued.87.	But what has the detente meant to the international community and to this world Organization in particular?Military arms expenditures are still rising. Nuclear-weapon tests are still being conducted. The risk of miscalculation and misconception of motives and intentions remains a constant threat to a detente based on a precarious nuclear balance. Because of continuing disagreements among the nuclear Powers  general and complete disarmament has remained an unattainable objective. Real peace has not come to Viet-Nam despite the official cease-fire. American bombing in Cambodia has now ceased  but war continues in that country. The Middle East remains an area of acute tension  and for decades the inhabitants of the region have not known the normal living which it is their birthright to expect and to enjoy. Dialogue has been established between the two Koreas  but no real progress has been achieved in normalizing relations in order to achieve their peaceful reunification.88.	The recent agreement between India and Pakistan on the future of war prisoners has demonstrated to the world community that a lasting settlement can be brought about only by frank and peaceful dialogue between the parties directly involved. No one can benefit from armed conflicts or confrontations  whatever their outcome; we can all benefit from peace.89.	The United Nations was set up  according to its Charter  to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. It has  on many occasions  helped to reduce tension and risk in a conflict situation and to facilitate the re-establishment of dialogue. But because of continuing disagreements among the major Powers  the United Nations peace-keeping operations have been at best a voluntary exercise  and in fact there may perhaps have been situations where the parties concerned have considered a United Nations presence an excuse to avoid serious dialogue.90.	For countries like my own  the real detente must also embrace increased international co-operation in promoting economic and social development. The existence of widespread conditions of mass poverty  unemployment and underemployment  and of glaring inequalities of income both between and within countries is a potential source of tension in the world today. Permanent peace and stability can  therefore  be achieved only through a new sense of international commitment towards mutual assistance and co-operation.91.	In this connexion  my delegation would like to express the sincere gratitude of the Government and the people of Fiji for the prompt response of the international community  through this Organization and bilaterally  in providing assistance for hurricane and flood victims in Fiji late last year. This was a clear demonstration to us of a joint and deliberate commitment to assist the less fortunate sections of the international community.92.	The present session will be the occasion for the first biennial review of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade  which is geared specifically towards assisting the acceleration of social and economic development in the third world. In this regard  the Strategy lays particular emphasis on the need for increased transfer of resources through both development assistance and trade. But we would prefer to regard the creation of favourable trade conditions and trade itself as the best form of aid; for it is only in increased trade that we can hope to realize our aims through our own efforts  without a sense of external obligation or a continuing heavy dependence on special assistance from outside.93.	Like many other developing countries  Fiji has a limited home market and its principal exports are two primary commodities  sugar and copra  which are subject to price fluctuations on the open market. Fiji is therefore heavily reliant on foreign trade as the source of essential foreign exchange. It is thus a matter of vital necessity to us that we find assured outlets and secure stable and remunerative prices for our primary exports. Additionally  because of the continuing deterioration in the terms of trade of commodity exports  it is of utmost importance that there should be some direct relative between primary export prices and the price of goods for which they are traded. The study of some mechanism to provide this relativity should be a priority call upon the research agencies of this great Organization.94.	The current negotiations for the renewal of the international agreement and multilateral trade talks through GATT  and the forthcoming negotiation between the enlarged European Economic Community and the developing associate and associable countries  have a direct bearing on our efforts to improve the quality of life and the economic standards of our people. However  the success of these negotiations will depend ultimately on the attitude taken by the developed countries.95.	The International Development Strategy  to which we all subscribe  comes out clearly in favour of commodity agreements for assuring equitable and remunerative commodity prices. This is the type of aid we most need. We appreciate that where such agreements involve restricting domestic production-as with beet sugar in Europe-the fear of hardship and unemployment can give rise to powerful sectional opposition in the developed countries. This can be true also when other measures to improve the terms of trade of developing countries involve reducing protection on locally produced goods. But the developed countries have the necessary capital  technology and skill to diversify into alternative lines of production and thereby minimize any loss of employment opportunity. The developing countries have not  and must continue to rely heavily on the export of primary commodities and semi-processed agricultural goods.96.	The last decade has been a period of very rapid development in the South Pacific. Many Territories in the area have gained independence: first  Western Samoa and Nauru; then  Tonga and Fiji; and now Papua New Guinea will shortly achieve its independence. The Cook Islands are self-governing and Niue Island will achieve this status next year.97.	Concurrent with this development is the steady growth of a sense of Pacific consciousness among the countries and Territories in the region. It is not so much a birth as a rebirth or rediscovery of old links and ties temporarily broken by the division of the area into metropolitan spheres of influence. This growing spirit .of co-operation has manifested itself both in the establishment of new regional institutions  like the University of theSouth Pacific  and in changes within existing regional bodies  like the South Pacific Commission  whereby the Pacific island members now have a far greater say in controlling the organization  including its budget and work programme.98.	The most exciting recent development is the emergence of the South Pacific Forum  a grouping which grew spontaneously from within the region  bringing together Australia and New Zealand with the independent island countries of the South Pacific in a common endeavour to establish a new free and independent association based on better understanding and more effective co-operation. With this underlying notion the Forum has set up the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation to try to modify the existing pattern of economic relationships between countries in the region and those outside it.99.	These are trends which reveal an increasing awareness of common regional interests. They also show that countries in a region  despite wide disparities in their stages of economic development and differences in their ethnic composition  can come together in a partnership to promote the well-being of their peoples. But the essence of this regional relationship is that it is outward-looking.100.	We believe that peace  security and orderly economic and social progress can be brought about only by all States coming together and pooling their resources for the benefit of mankind. What this requires is not that States should surrender their sovereignty but that they should be outward-looking and that they should regard others on the basis of equality  mutual respect  tolerance and understanding.101.	What is required is that all the Member States should constantly bear in mind that this great Organization can achieve a great deal more in its international peace and security efforts  in economic and social development and in its other aims only if it has the full and continuous support of all its Members. Where we have failed or have not been effective is where this support has been lacking or inadequate. Thus the call to all Members which want a strong United Nations  more especially to the major Powers and the developed countries  is not only to criticize it for its shortcomings from outside but also to advise and empower their representatives within the Organization to remedy its weaknesses and to give the United Nations their wholehearted support which it so fully deserves."
"39",2400,"FRA",28,1973,"﻿1. Mr. President  in these last days of the general debate I should like to pay a tribute to the authority and distinction with which you are presiding over our work.2.	I shall be relatively brief  for I wish to avoid repetition and  besides  I have no taste or desire for making propaganda. But I would prefer that the truth should prevail even if it should emerge as the truth which is obvious on the banks of the Seine  the Loire  the Garonne and the Rhone  the four principal rivers of my country.3.	This debate is drawing to a close without surprises  except those that we have ceaselessly warned against  and without excesses. Everyone is gratified by this  even if  in order to achieve it  one had to keep silent on many questions and take for granted what is merely adumbrated in the same way that a fad secures a grip upon minds before it prevails in the streets.4.	You will no doubt understand what I am referring to. To speak of peace does not call for any great precision. On the other hand  to invoke detente  to believe in it as one would believe in spring when one suddenly comes upon it around the bend after winter  would seem to warrant more assiduity and curiosity. Who does not wish for detente  or could reject it?5.	At the risk of causing irritation  I would remind you that we have had a long experience of detente and the concept thereof. For the last 15 years it has been the concern of our foreign policy. Judge for yourselves: decolonization; the establishment of East-West relations; friendly and active co-operation with the Soviet Union; the fundamental treaty between France and Germany in 1963; the building of a European entity; as early as 1964  understanding of  and respect for  China  to which the President  of the French Republic has  as you know  just completed a trip; unfailing support for the third world  for the independence of nations and for a more equitable distribution of resources  and  to take a current example  for the harmony of the Comoro islands with their destiny. All these things protect us from naivete  but they have shown us that lucidity and generosity should always go hand in hand.6.	Meanwhile  we learn that 1973 is to be primarily the year of detente. And reference is made to this at every turn  as if a single year were sufficient to meet its needs and as if this year promised exceptional developments. To be quite truthful  I see but two such events — much discussed  but the full expression of which is not yet completely manifest and of which the consequences  you will agree  are not yet entirely known.7.	In the first place  I see the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. It is  of course  as we all know  not yet concluded. Its principal merit consists in its having gathered together 33 European countries and the United States and Canada. Apart from this essential fact  the results  if they are good  will be  as it were  thrown into the bargain. They will  furthermore  serve the concept of detente mainly by representing compromises between opposing stands that could not have been developed at leisure. In the long run  the contents will matter less than the way in which they were obtained. For our part  we are doing all we can to ensure the success of the Conference  and I am sure that this is well known.8.	This Conference is therefore an important fact  an unaccustomed event  unusual in recent international practice; it is a development that is comforting to note. For all that  it is not the Eden of detente  it does not represent the alpha and omega of conciliation. It is a joint effort  an arduous effort that is the business of all. It is a state of mind that is being born — a miracle indeed! — among the poisonous flowers of the arms race  which remains  however  fraught with the mistrust and the ambitions to which it gives rise.9.	Let us therefore be reasonable in our appreciation  cautious in our enthusiasm  and realistic in our behaviour. Let us not allow ourselves to be trapped in the all-too-easy syllogism: the Conference serves the idea of detente; detente can serve to nourish all speeches; therefore  he who refers to the Conference is  assuredly  one who practises detente.10.	Furthermore on 22 June last  the United States and the Soviet Union published the news of an agreement they had reached on nuclear strategy. That agreement is but a beginning and is to be followed up  so it is stated  in 1974. Its authors were gratified and they invited the whole world to share in their gratification. Why? Because this undoubtedly is an agreement between two very great Powers and it consequently concerns us all — or rather it affects us all  because it can be clothed in the chaste cloak of detente. Those two reasons are not sufficient to mask the reality that has gradually become apparent to all. In order to avoid bankruptcy  and with political considerations in mind  the two Powers have preferred to limit the development of some of their nuclear armaments while at the same time maintaining a sufficiently strong mutual vulnerability to deter each other from upsetting the balance.11.	Thus  this type of detente would be limited to such an exercise in balancing between the two treaty partners. When children fight  one often notices that the strongest avoid a head-on clash with each other and instead attack the lightest-weight members of the other gang  who can be easily knocked down by a few simple blows. It is the same with nations. And if the light-weight nations are at present worried  how can anyone be surprised? The only surprising thing is that it has taken them so long to become nervous  finding themselves with a mere rifle in their hands while the pressures and presences remain the same at their frontiers. All that one very famous actress wore was perfume. I fear that  so scantily clothed by detente alone  we still run the risk of shivering.12.	My analysis of the recent months would perhaps have been rather less cruel in so far as detente is concerned —  detente is  after all  a French word which we have endowed with its full significance by our actions — had it not been for the fact that certain slanderous campaigns have sought to cast slurs upon our very idea of national independence  shared by so many others.13.	The past and geography have taught us lessons that we are not likely to forget. We are like prey that has been so often hunted that the hunter can no longer approach. Illusions  wars  more illusions and war again: this has been our fate. Henceforth  we rely primarily on ourselves  on our own efforts. I cannot imagine anyone  unless he is under an illusion  who could think of making us renounce this.14.	We have been distressed  I would say hurt  to hear from our friends or from peoples for whom we have affection statements made here or there whose lack of reality in comparison with the facts or the actual situation in the world seems surprising to me. Even more surprising are the steps which have been taken to convince us that the questions at issue are mere figures of speech that we are wrong to feel uneasy about  but merely justified by the domestic considerations of a sovereign State.15.	Can one really deal so lightly with a serious matter of concern to us all? Because it is a matter of national independence for a nation which does not want to be the pawn of world strategy. In its turn  after many others  and left to its own resources France provided itself with nuclear armaments  not in order to indulge in dreams of grandeur  but because its every existence was at stake. Alone  we covered the ground of difficult research  with a considerable time lag. And today some people are indignant that we have dared to tread this path  which is presumably the royal way reserved to those who today hold power; that we have placed our footsteps in their tracks  such deep tracks. And yet what protests did their actions give rise to? I look for them in vain.16.	Nowadays one is less modest  doubtless because one knows that with France  a peaceful Power whose only ambition is to live in harmony with all and not to be taken by surprise  one does not run a great risk. Well  one does in fact.17.	I shall not refer to the risk of ridicule. But a risk one is essentially exposed to is the risk of not understanding that one is being manipulated  used  propelled against one's own interests. And more serious still is the risk of being wholly mistaken in one's analysis of the world situation  to have understood nothing  with gaping mouth and  unfortunately  closed eyes. Finally  there is the risk of opposing the will for independence  which should be that of all peace- loving peoples and which France is convinced it is serving while ensuring its own destiny as a free nation.18.	We shall at least preserve a vivid memory of the moment of collective blindness in which some have foundered  dragging down with them  by means of false evidence  some quarters of public opinion whose irrational fears were nursed at leisure. And we shall therefore abide by our conduct so that our fate cannot be settled except by ourselves  since from now on everyone can realize that we cannot disappear without damage to others.19.	And again  we are convinced  we are sure  that by so doing we are strengthening the ground on which Europe must be built by affirming our steadfastness  our independence  our determination not to slacken our defence efforts.20.	How could I avoid  after all  referring to Europe? Everyone quite rightly wonders  does Europe already exist  and particularly in the consciousness of others rather than in the consciousness of Europe itself? Is it something that is really going to exist? I refer to it only as a citizen of one of the States that go to make it up  attached like so many others to those landscapes and those shores which have borne witness to such diverse activity and been the scene of so much meditation. I speak about Europe only from a certain memory of the past and with the reasonable hope of a more just  more secure and fuller life.21.	I am sure that this is the deep aspiration of all those European peoples who live on an exiguous territory  densely populated  closely partitioned  the internal boundaries of which are crumbling a little more each day  yielding to the thrust of time — a universal phenomenon.22.	There is no collective will or power here; only the certainty that in joining forces everything will eventually become simpler  even if the path towards it is not entirely mapped out. This effort might perhaps also warrant the fair name of detente  the effort that nine States  often so different  pursue tirelessly in order to bury antagonisms  adjust their policies  and ensure their well-being. It would warrant being hailed often from this rostrum  and even better to be encouraged from the bottom of people's hearts. It would warrant an organization such as the United Nations showing it henceforth less indifference. Finally  it would warrant an appreciation of the extent to which Europe undoubtedly would be useful to the international order because  besides the virtues of its own joining of forces  Europe would become a pole of peace in a world drifting from one spell of vertigo to another.23.	Recently in Copenhagen  ""the Nine"" — as they have become known these days — agreed to define their common identity among themselves and to express with one voice their opinion on an important matter — their relationship with the United States — as they have already done in other cases  for example the Conference on European security. There is nothing unwonted in such behaviour nor is there in the approaches which are to follow  because some State or other will also have wished to establish such a dialogue. There is nothing unwonted either if  in the weeks to come  a common view is expressed within the framework of the Atlantic alliance  where thinking is going on in the light of world developments.24.	Perhaps even  but I do not want to dream too much  the latter will have to take into account this common will which may animate European countries so that a more equitable and better shared universal order may prevail.25.	A more equitable and better shared universal order: it is there that genuine detente will truly be able to flourish.26.	As long as the independence of everyone is not fully recognized and respected  as long as the living conditions of every country are not made more secure  where indeed is detente?27.	Does it not lie in the restoration of international monetary regulations  which would give equal opportunities to all  and in a stability without which the weaker will be trampled underfoot?28.	Does it not lie in the establishment of normal trade practices that would limit emergency measures which have an unexpected effect on markets?29.	Does it not lie in a rational  generous and far-reaching concept of production and trade  which would share major commodities equally between producers and consumers?30.	Does it not lie in the establishment of an international code defining the rights and obligations of each State in the world commercial order?31.	There is nothing new left to be said about these topics. Should one be irritated at the fact that nothing can yet be put down to the credit of international co-operation? Should one be irritated that the monetary organization has been smashed to smithereens under the pressure of its own deficiencies? Should we be irritated that the selfishness of nations hinders any progress towards agreements on primary commodities? Should we be irritated at the fact that shortage is replacing affluence  that the forecasts of technicians are not borne out by the facts and that humble and innumerable lives  often wrecked by hurricanes and droughts  are also suffering from unforeseen vicissitudes  the origin of which they do not know  and that even squander the slender resources of days of starvation?32.	Should one allow onself to become disheartened enough to accept the false pretences  the abortive texts  the proposals which aim at politics and not at the well-being of our fellow men?33.	For our part  we shall continue crying out certain truths  perhaps in the wilderness of some meetings which are too densely packed with words. We shall continue  by our national action  and also in Europe with our partners   and everywhere in the world where we are bound by ties of history and friendship  we shall continue to affirm that stability  generosity  responsibility  respect for others are concepts without which there can be no monetary or commercial future for the world  without which there would be just one single prospect: that of bitterness and violence.34.	In this year of 1973  it would have been easy  had one wished  to restore equanimity to the whole world. Away from dialectics which cause one to lose sight of realities and which deflect the deep inclination for peace of peoples  could not those who claim to bear the highest responsibilities have found the path to true glory?35.	However  only interested motives  too well-understood and thoroughly weighed  seem to have guided their thoughts and actions. Take South-East Asia — where the fighting is taking so long to be extinguished after having been endless — and on other frontiers where it is still the eve of battle  with sudden outbursts.36.	There is the Middle East where the situation  one had been told  was under control. And so why should it change? And being so sure of tomorrow one had left until tomorrow what should have been done today. And the results are there for all to see. Did not so much certainty  such assurance  warrant the present being dealt with before the irreparable occurred?37.	Let us hope that those conflicts of another era —  anachronistic to the point that they last without causing inconvenience except  unfortunately  for the suffering populations — will cease. Let us hope that the collective conscience will be heeded before they go astray who  in keeping with their tremendous present responsibilities  must quickly understand the friendly and urgent message that we put to friends that they be inspired by tolerance and prompted by the will to concerted action not only in their own meetings  but also in their relations with all peoples who  in their powerlessness  follow the progress of such merciless games.38.	On the subject of those absurd  ruthless  unfair wars  my country has long since  over and over again  voiced its views and stated its policies. Therefore I shall not dwell on that.39.	In this assembly of nations we have many friends. We feel a community of thought with many peoples  many States  young or old  which  like us  are seeking their way in order to assert their dignity by themselves assuming the responsibility for their destinies.40.	We believe with them that this rostrum  this international gathering  this periodic and organized pooling of world preoccupations are indispensable so that peoples souls may sometimes throb and that some cries may be uttered here and there; and these  heard by the multitude  may so animate them that nothing will ever be as before; so that falsehood may lose its assurance  that indifference may finally come to be tinged with concern; and that those who make demands and claims may also heed the voice of responsibility; that friendship may cease to be a matter of subservience and influence cease to be burdensome; that the veiled but ever-present threat may no longer weigh on people's minds and hearts  and that from now on  nobody may dare to give expression to it.41.	I myself  prepared this speech several days ago. Before coming here today I changed nothing except the tenses of two verbs  from the present to the past  and inserted two phrases quite spontaneously.42.	This address is a statement of our policy  a statement of its concepts  duration and determination. I delete nothing. I add nothing to it.43.	But since last Saturday  fighting has been resumed and all the evidence indicates that it is particularly bloody. I offer the assistance of my country so that the war may quickly subside and not flare up again. We could make suggestions to contribute to a peaceful settlement on condition that everyone wants this and really wants a just and lasting peace. I am convinced that our European friends share this wish. I hope that these sincere wishes are not offered in vain"
"40",2471,"GAB",28,1973,"﻿It should not be surprising that  for a citizen of the third world like me  it is difficult to speak once again before this Assembly-difficult because I cannot forgo accomplishing my duty to express here the point of view of my Government on the important problems which preoccupy us collectively.2.	I cannot be pleased at having to denounce here once again  in the same circumstances  exactly the same evils-in spite of the rather fragile hopes that have appeared in the South-East Asian region. Members must understand that I am concerned over all the factors that have been created and maintained to aggravate and perpetuate underdevelopment in the third world.3.	I rise up against retrograde selfishness on the part of all those who-while our common destiny depends upon universal solidarity-are still hesitating about co-operating frankly in keeping the weakest and the most destitute among us from achieving social well-being. I rise up against the constant threat of weapons of destruction which is weighing upon mankind. Lastly and especially I rise up against the abject conditions of colonialism  apartheid and occupation which still hold Africa in bondage  in spite of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and contrary to the spirit of our Charter.4.	I am therefore obliged to re-examine with members the same problems that have been debated at such length- problems of economic and social development  problems of international co-operation  problems of universal peace and  of course  problems of the sacred right of all peoples on earth  and in particular the Africans  to decide upon their own future.5. All those preoccupations would  of course  have made me pessimistic if we had not had a man of the dimension of Mr. Benites to preside over our Assembly. An erudite jurist  a politician well informed about  and fully acquainted with  this house and all the problems that we shall have to debate here  he is certainly the President that we were awaiting in order to find together the solutions that our apprehensions call for. On his election  which was so brilliant because it was well deserved and justified  I offer him the heartfelt congratulations of my delegation.6.	With Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our Secretary-General  who is always between two aeroplane flights in his aim of getting first-hand knowledge of the various problems with which our Organization is confronted  Mr. Benites forms a team of distinguished men whose competence and dedication to the service of the world make it possible for us not to have doubts about the United Nations and to look forward to the future. My delegation assures the President  and all his colleagues in the General Committee and in the Secretariat  of our gratitude.7.	The same feelings guide my memories of the President and the General Committee of the twenty-seventh session.8.	In rushing to the United Nations as soon as they had acceded to political independence  we  the small countries  thought first and foremost that we would be part of a great human collectivity within which mutual understanding could engender greater justice. In our view  that justice necessarily had to begin with a better considered distribution of riches and consumer goods and all the other means which make it possible to struggle effectively against ignorance  disease and poverty.9.	Our attachment to that ideal was all the deeper as we had total confidence in the industrialized countries  which  following one of the greatest conflagrations they had inflicted upon the world  had succeeded in placing before our eyes the new charter of a better future based upon a thousand altruistic obligations.10.	But  after 28 years and in spite of a better-organized and more profitable exploitation of our riches  our purchasing power is decreasing  whereas the industrialized nations are selling their products at higher and higher prices; so we grow poorer for the benefit of those very nations which are becoming richer and richer.11.	So  I repeat  after 28 years three quarters of mankind suffers from famine while a minority has surplus in its agriculture  and enormous sums continue to be sacrificed to sterile purposes while millions of children grow up illiterate because it is not possible for us to give them teachers  classrooms  books-in a word  all that is necessary for them to become citizens worthy of our society.12.	As it now stands  the economic and social situation of the world must preoccupy the United Nations and lead its specialized agencies to restructure themselves in order better to help our States tackle the various aspects of the problems of underdevelopment that weigh upon us. It is an absurdity to try to deal with world peace before attempting to eliminate from the world the fundamental causes of social inequality which lead men to destroy each other through violence.13.	Only when those causes have been eliminated will our faith in international co-operation as an indispensable means in the service of development be justified. There is no doubt at all that the Central African Customs and Economic Union  the European Common Market  the Group of 77 and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ  to which Gabon is making its modest contribution  are not in our view exclusive clubs for this co-operation.14.	My country is prepared to co-operate with the whole world and  repeating the statement of His Excellency Mr. Albert Bernard Bongo  President of the Gabonese Republic  I would say that our only policy is to continue to give our peoples the means of emerging from underdevelopment.15.	We agree that other efforts should be joined to ours  provided that those who want to help us in this noble task by offering their co-operation to us respect our sovereignty. And it is not through any accident that our President  Albert Bernard Bongo  upon his accession to power  signed an ""investment code"" for all those who sincerely wish to help us; that code recognizes that businessmen who come to our country have a right to make a fair profit.16.	In regard to our sovereignty  I wish to go beyond the strict framework of the political situation exclusively and to speak of the full enjoyment of the riches which a generous and bountiful nature has placed upon our soil and buried within our subsoil and under our waters. Such a sovereignty can suffer no restriction. We intend to remain  in spite of our limited means and possibilities  the only masters of our soil  of which our territorial sea to a limit of 100 miles is an integral part.17.	This affirmation is in no way inconsistent With our universalist orientation. It is simply an explanation of the reality that we Gabonese  while prepared to co-operate for our economic development  do not intend to have any of our national wealth exploited to the detriment of our people. And if naturally we are in favour of the exploitation of the sea-bed for peaceful purposes  we reject its spoliation.18.	But how can we prepare and develop this cooperation  how can we improve the  standard of living of our peoples in a world which is uncertain of its own future  a world replete with weapons of destruction  a world in which those who have more than others are spending more for war than for the general well-being?19.	Of course  the Powers responsible for our collective peace have been able to avoid the worst by opening treaties for our signature; of course  an important document has been drafted and signed prohibiting the proliferation of nuclear weapons."" All these measures  including the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  are so much evidence of a genuine desire to achieve peace.20.	But the Government of Gabon is still asking itself  What is the purpose of the bombs that were already stored before the publication and entry into force of the text to which I have referred?21.	To set our fears to rest for all time and to provide a satisfactory reply to all the small countries which are only dreaming of peace  there is a solution: formally to prohibit the manufacture of new nuclear weapons and immediately to establish international commissions for the systematic destruction of existing stockpiles. Not to accept that would mean purely and simply  as far as we are concerned  to shirk the sincere search for peace.22.	The Powers concerned which adopted our point of view would emerge ennobled by their decision. As for our world  enjoying the resources thus liberated and delivered from its anguish  it would at last know true happiness.23.	It is because of our faith in the principles of our Organization that I come to set forth here the thinking of my Government.24.	However  for every African  for every citizen of the third world  as well as for all peoples imbued with lofty moral values  there is very little hope of achieving this world that we all desire as long as colonialism and apartheid are still the rule in Africa and one of the greatest peoples of our continent is still under military occupation.25.	And yet  following the signature of the Charter at San Francisco  the African peoples  which had seen scores of thousands of their people die in order to help others reconquer their freedom  had seriously hoped that  because of the new international code  the day had at last come when they could enjoy independence.26.	Indeed their hope was well founded; the freedom of peoples being inalienable  the France of Charles de Gaulle and the British Crown had decided in favour of honour  greatness and the future by substituting for the basically fragile ties of domination the almost indestructible relations of friendship  confidence and co-operation. The evidence is there that people who can have the most confidence in their common destiny are those who have forgotten their relations of the past in order to build a future through mutual consent.27.	It is unthinkable to observe that in Guinea-Bissau  the Cape Verde Islands  Angola  Mozambique  Cabinda and the Sao Tome and Principe islands genocide still goes on  punctuated by unjustified massacres of the aged  of pregnant women and of children  who are daily burned with napalm. An entire village of 200 inhabitants has justbeen stricken from the map of Mozambique. And  as if it were living in a dream world  Portugal continues to believe that its country is part of Central Africa.28.	To complete this anachronistic picture  racism of the most humiliating and repugnant kind is still prevalent in South Africa  Namibia and Rhodesia. The African populations  on the soil of their ancestors  live in conditions so well known that it appears superfluous to us to refer to them here once again.29.	Indeed  the allied regimes of Portugal and South Africa  having remained deaf to the voice of reason  the African peoples concerned have risen up in the armed struggle which has been imposed upon them by the colonial systems. Blood is flowing and the United Nations is neutralized through the intrigues of the settlers.30.	But everyone knows ""hat this situation could not last were the Portuguese Government alone and if the white minorities of Southern Africa did not have outside support  making it possible for them to defy world public opinion with impunity.31.	As for the Middle East problem  it is the responsibility of the great Powers to restore the Jarring mission in order to find agreement within the framework of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  The recent refusal of Egypt and Israel to have this resolution amended makes it possible to think that each of the parties finds it acceptable.32.	While we are pleased to see among us the qualified representatives of the German people  we should not lose sight of the other divided States-the two Viet-Nams and the two Koreas. It is high time for all inhabitants of the world to be represented in this Assembly.33.	In the case of Korea in particular  the non-aligned countries have advocated at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Algiers  what might be considered as a basis for the settlement of the problem [see A/9330 and Corr.]  p. 49]; but the fear of permanent insecurity which is making the southern part of the country hesitate to the point where it is attempting to modify this solution is such that we must seriously consider the statement made on 23 June by the South Korean President  a statement which we think lays down the essential bases for finding a just solution to the problem.34.	The two parties have arrived at a point where hope is possible. They should not fall back on misunderstandings  hesitations and errors  which have until now complicated the solution of their problem.35.	delegation has no magic formula for a perfect settlement of all the problems on the agenda of the present session. But it has the firm desire to make its modest contribution to the collective effort to find  with all men of goodwill  the majority of those data which might simplify examination of what unfortunately divides us  and thus attain the unity of thought which is our only salvation.36.	May I therefore be permitted to make a solemn appeal to all those who are particularly responsible for the weal and woe of the international community to give our world  at last  more justice  more progress and more peace."
"41",2515,"GBR",28,1973,"﻿118.	Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to join with my colleagues in congratulating you on your high office. Ecuador will rightly feel a reflected glory.119.	Sir  I have spoken on many occasions in this Assembly and have usually felt it right to deal with the main topical and urgent issues in the field of international affairs. I do not intend to do this today. Many of them  it is true  remain as difficult and contentious as ever  but they will feature on the agenda of the various Committees of this Assembly and the views of the British Government will be explained when they come up for discussion. All of them should be soluble by patient bilateral diplomacy  assisted as the need arises — and it arises more often day by day-by the conciliation machinery of this United Nations organization for conciliation. This must be the order of the day in the middle of this twentieth century. Now  however  I wish to concentrate only on two major long-term problems in the world  both profound and in the long run decisive in terms of what I shall call in shorthand the problems between East and West and North and South.120.	The first duty laid upon the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security. We have had a deeply troubled century. Twenty-one years after the First World War the world was just beginning to recover from the appalling carnage when it all started all over again. It is now 28 years since the ending of the Second World War. So far we have avoided a global holocaust  although at all times the situation has been saved only by knife-edge diplomacy. But there are signs at long last that we are just starting to learn. Whether peace has been forced upon us by the realization of the ultimate horror of the nuclear weapon  or whether the miseries of two world wars have taught us the bitter lesson that war solves nothing  unless it is that in the main the innocent pay the penalty  or whether the United Nations  if it has not preserved peace  has helped men to talk themselves into a more sober mood in which they realize that there are no slick answers to the modern problems of this world. Perhaps it is in fact a mixture of all three. But the hope must be that one way or another at this moment of time-late  it is true  but better late than never-the lesson of the futility of violence is being learned.121.	Herr Brandt just now said that we should talk  not shoot  and as a European I stand here to say that it was that failure in Europe which very nearly led to the destruction of our continent; and that  surely  should be a lesson for all.122.	In his thoughtful introduction to his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General rightly reminds us that while it is easy to criticize the limitations of the United Nations in matters affecting peace and security  the Organization  and particularly the Security Council  does have to its credit real achievements in defusing disputes. Of that at least we should remind ourselves lest we lose heart. But he would be a bold man who would say that an era of universal peace is within our grasp. War  although contained  is still with us. Man has not solved his basic needs for security  for food and for shelter. At this time of the twentieth century I think we ought to remind ourselves that there is no excuse for these shortcomings apart from prejudice  fear and suspicion  for we have all the technical means that we need to provide for man's very modest needs.123.	Since 1945 the international scene has been dominated by the problems arising from the totally different social  economic and political systems of the East and West and from the aftermath of rapid decolonization. In East- West relations there have been periods of comparative calm and moments of acute peril. Coexistence has been preached. But it has meant different things to different people and the shock waves of tension between the Communists and the rest have spread  and the impact has been felt world-wide. Those who have wished to avoid the contagion of the rivalry of the great Powers have not always been able to do so. The rigid confrontation of the major Powers and the continuing escalation of force and counter- force was not only a source of grave danger in itself to the countries in the Northern Hemisphere but  worse perhaps  also paralysed the use of common resources and stultified the economic development of nations much further afield - nations that otherwise would have been able to do something to bridge the gap between the developed and the developing countries.124. Now  at long last  these preoccupations seem to be yielding to a wider perspective. It is not  of course  easy for Communists and the rest to live together and work together when philosophy and practice are so different  but  at long last  at least there are signs of flexibility. The United States has established a relationship with China. The Soviet Union and the United States have softened the edges of their bilateral relations. It became possible for serious negotiations to begin between the Western Allies and the East over the future of Berlin. The two German States have made real progress in their joint discussions and are now both Members of this Organization-a historic step  which my Government welcomes-and if it is followed up with tolerance and with generosity this will undoubtedly have beneficial effects in Europe. The European Community  now enlarged  is finding its own identity and looks outward to fruitful contacts with the rest of the world; and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has met and defined an agenda for work leading towards detente. Up till now it is no more than that  but lest we are to despair  we must recognize it as a start in reconciliation and try to build further upon it. That being said  I must make it clear that detente must be real and not an illusion. Lip service to detente which evaporates at the first test is a trap. Like so much in life it is the will to work together for the highest common factor that counts and certainly as far as my Government is concerned the will is there. Our strong desire is that  however difficult it may be  the two political systems should live together not only without enmity but in broad accord. We will therefore take risks for peace  but at the same time we will not be duped by empty declarations into jeopardizing our security and our chosen way of life which goes with it. I would echo the words of Mr. Kissinger a few days ago [2124th meeting]: my country  like his  seeks true peace  not an armistice. Let us  therefore  share our ideas  share our resources and share our cultures. Let us resolve not to undermine but to understand  not to confront but to reconcile. We-that is  the East and the West-will have the chance to put these sentiments to the test in phase two of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. I trust that the Communist countries will be able to prove that they care for the basic freedoms of people everywhere; for  I say with great respect  it is people  not bits of paper  that politics  national and international  are about. We will try to respond in a constructive spirit in phase two of thatConference  remembering always that  as Mr. Andersen has just reminded us-and I think it is too often forgotten-that politics are also about the quality of life.125.	The other division in the world-the division between the rich and the poor countries-is just as profound and just as likely to breed tension. This is essentially an economic rather than an ideological division. Even if there was no conflict between East and West  and even if this conflict had not sometimes spread to the third world  we would still face the great human problems caused by the vast difference between the living standards of the developing and the developed countries because of the accidents of time. I understand the emotions which break out from time to time in the wake of the colonial era. But we have a situation now in this modern world which requires not slogans  however tempting  but cool  rational analysis and a realistic assessment of what can be done under a number of headings: investment  credit  commodity arrangements  debt  aid and trade. They are all relevant to the relationship between the rich and the poor countries and during this session of the General Assembly we shall be discussing the first review and appraisal of the progress of the Second United Nations Development Decade  and I hope it is these things-and I will repeat them: investment  credit  commodity arrangements  debt  aid and trade-which will be the subjects of analysis and  if possible  of agreement. We shall not agree on every aspect of these and of other subjects. Important interests of both developing and developed countries are involved and prima facie at times they seem to diverge but  again  if one looks at each one separately under those headings that I have listed  it will almost always be proved by careful analysis that the interests of the developed and the developing are complementary and not antagonistic. Our common deliberations  therefore  will be fruitful only in so far as we make a deliberate attempt to find the common interest and act on it to a point where we all can see that we can gain as well as give. We must simply not allow politics to intervene to hamper or cripple the fine economic prospects for ordinary people in developing and developed countries. I conclude from this that the key word for the future of economic development is ""partnership"". Let us recognize the situation for what it is and work together to put it right. In short  the less emotion there is  the quicker we shall get on. For partnership to work it is necessary that each understand the realities which limit the possibilities for action of the other.126.	We are-and again I make no apology for reminding the Assembly of this-we are dealing with human beings  not with units on the economist's slide rule. So the developed countries must understand the right of the newly emerging countries to be master of their own fate  to control their economic  political and social destinies. What else is nationhood about? And in turn it should be clear that politicians in countries like my own which are governed by a parliamentary democracy have to satisfy their electors that the money which is deliberately being diverted from them is not only being well spent for the benefit of the recipients but to the long-term advantage for all. We in the Western countries-and here I can speak especially for the enlarged European Community-are tackling these questions with energy. The European summit conference last autumn gave to the outside world a high place in its programme. But we can be really successful only if we can move forward with the developing countries in a spirit and practice of partnership and create an atmosphere of mutual purpose and of mutual trust. So I repeat  partnership in this age and day is the key word to success.127.	We also have undertaken to transfer economic resources and expertise to developing countries and are doing so on an expanding scale. But the word ""transfer"" means just what it says  at least in the short term. Money and resources  in other words  which would otherwise be available to the donor country are transferred for the benefit of another and I would invite the developing countries to recognize the problems of presentation which  for example  we in the United Kingdom have when we are speaking to our own electors. We could do a lot ourselves with the £300 million or so which we agree to transfer to others. We are willing to forgo these advantages for ourselves  but the transfer of resources must be seen to be directly related to the achievement of general prosperity all round. That is the only condition we make  but I think it is reasonable.128.	My country continues to attach high importance to aid. Our official aid flow has steadily increased. In the two years between 1970 and 1972 it rose by nearly half &s much again and it is our intention that it should continue to grow. I was interested  in this context of aid and investment  in what Mr. Gromyko had to say yesterday [2126th meeting]  and in particular in his proposal for a 10 per cent reduction in the military expenditure of the leading Powers [A/9191]. My recollections in this Assembly go back some way  and I thought I had recollected having heard this before. I was right. In 1958 the Soviet spokesman stated:""The Soviet Government's proposal is to reduce the military budgets of the Soviet Union  the United States  the United Kingdom and France by 10 to 15 per cent and use part of the savings so effected for assistance to the under-developed countries.""That was debated. It did not at that time find favour  for reasons which I think were then valid — how do you measure  for example  military budgets?  — and which may still be valid now but I am not concerned in prejudging what the decision on this proposal may be not in 1958  but in 1973. But I would not like it to be thought that in other countries things have stood still on this front of aid and investment. For example  in terms of international aid our contribution in the United Kingdom is many times greater than that of the Soviet Union and  incidentally  it so happens that our total aid is already about 10 per cent of our expenditure of defence. In other words  as far as the United Kingdom is concerned  this is a field in which we should welcome more competition from the Soviet Union and from other countries.129.	There is  of course  the question of how much of the total flow of resources could be met by official aid and how much by private investment. Whatever the proportions achieved  it will remain true that the private investment will play a significant role in development and I would remind this Assembly of the Pearson report  which says as follows and I quote:""There can be no doubt about the contribution which private capital can render to economic development. Indeed  dollar for dollar  it may be more effective than official aid . .. .""It is of course important that private investment should be properly integrated into the development plans and priorities of the host country. Investors should involve the nationals of the recipient State to the maximum  strive for maximum participation of local capital and reinvest a fair proportion of the profits in the enterprises of the country's enterprise which is concerned. But there is a reverse side to any coin and  as the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade put it  developing countries should bear in mind the importance of the attraction of foreign capital of conditions conducive to sustained investment. The plain fact is that private investment will not flow to the countries which do not provide the conditions in which it can bear fruit. It is therefore necessary once again to underline and emphasize that it is necessary to create an atmosphere of partnership if enough resources are to be transferred from those who have them to those who have not to make any real impact at all on the gap between the developed and the developing countries; and this applies both to official aid and to private investment.130.	A pre-condition  therefore  of success is that we must get away from the concept of conflict  whether ideological or racial. We have a common and a material interest in this and it is our joint responsibility as leaders of opinion to see to it that our peoples understand the destructive implications of actions and words which are designed to fuel the fires of intolerance and  by contrast  realize the benefits which flow from partnership which is open and trustful.131.	I cannot accept that the greater East-West detente must somehow be at the expense of the developing world. The reverse should be the case. If detente means anything  it must entail a liberation of resources from both East and West  —  a liberation of resources for more constructive ends. In a sense  the problems of the relationship between East and West and between the developing and the developed countries are linked  and success in dealing with the one will ease the anxieties of the other. When problems exist they can either be approached in an atmosphere of tension and conflict  as if a solution can be reached only by the victory of one side and the defeat of the other  or they can be faced in the belief that reconciliation and partnership is possible and should be pursued with relentless purpose and vigour. This Organization-I believe we ought to remind ourselves - was founded on the latter premise. That was the basis and the inspiration of the Charter. Until now it hasbeen confounded by political distrust and  for the reasons of which I have spoken  we have left undone much that ought to have been done together. It is in the basic belief that man has the capacity to reject his baser instincts and accept the disciplines inherent in reconciliation that we in this Assembly should formulate our policies and lead our peoples."
"42",2586,"GHA",28,1973,"﻿29.	 Permit me  Sir  on behalf of the Government and the people of Ghana  to congratulate you on your election as President of the twenty- eighth session of this august Assembly. We are particularly happy to see you preside over the deliberations of this session because both your country and mine are dedicated to world peace; both realize that it is only under conditions of peace that our cherished aspiration of improving the living standards and the general welfare of our people can be achieved.30.	This session has on its agenda a number of items of great significance  not only to the countries that we have been accustomed to describe as the third world — of which your country and mine are a part — but to the world community as a whole. I have no doubt that your qualities as a statesman and your varied and rich experience as a diplomat will assist you in steering the course of this session to a successful and fruitful end. My delegation wishes you every success in the discharge of the great responsibility entrusted to you.31.	I should also like to take this opportunity to express the appreciation of my delegation for the able manner in which your predecessor conducted the affairs of the twenty-seventh session of the Assembly. His performance was net lacking in patience  tact and diplomacy  without which this Assembly could not hope to conduct a successful business.32.	My delegation also wishes to express its appreciation of the work of the Secretary-General. His report to this session on the work of the Organization [A/9001] reflects a readiness and a capacity to further the interests of the world community. We are confident that he willcontinue to bring to his task the resourcefulness and diligence which he has demonstrated already.33.	We welcome the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to membership in this Organization. This event not only strengthens this body but also furthers the course of detente in a region which has for many years been regarded as a major area of world conflict. It is our hope that the experience of these two States will enrich the capacity of this Organization in its efforts to make the world a better place for us all. In the same spirit  we extend a warm welcome to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  whose presence here should remind us again that  for the purposes and aims of this Organization  no country is too small or too weak  no contribution by any Member State is too insignificant.34.	I should like to express the appreciation of the Government and the people of Ghana for the Cocoa Agreement which provisionally came into effect on 30 June 1973. It is hoped that the signatories to the Agreement that have not yet ratified it will do so soon and that those who missed the opportunity of signing it will accede to it in due course. The difficult course through which this Agreement has passed is a symptom of a cancerous growth that continues to plague our world community: narrow national interests constantly blind us to over-all global interests. It is the hope of my delegation that the Cocoa Agreement will not be the last commodity agreement to be concluded and that it will be followed by other commodity agreements. It is only when such agreements to stabilize the prices of commodities on which the economies of developing countries largely depend have been concluded that those countries can hope for a planned and sustained economic growth.35.	This century has seen a very significant change in the complexion of the world. Territories that were mere colonial appendages have acquired identities of their own and are endeavouring to shape their own economic destinies. They want now to establish their own economic identity within a world economic system. The question is not whether they will be able to do this  but whether they will be enabled to do so.36.	Twenty-eight years after the Second World War we are still struggling with the problems that war left behind. The national economies of countries on both sides of the war were shattered. Years of economic effort to raise living standards to decent levels were destroyed in five years of vendetta  vindictiveness  callousness and complete disregard for the human person and  indeed  for the survival of our planet. This same war brought in its wake an event which  though salutary and justifiable in its moral significance  none the less compounded the economic problems which faced the world and which continue to do so. This event was the emergence of independent sovereign countries  expected and willing to play their part in the general effort to reconstruct the economy of our planet.37.	What is interesting in this general effort at reconstruction is the manner in which countries capable of doing the most in this exercise have viewed the problem. Immediately after the Second World War  the Marshall Plan was established. Under that Plan  countries which were involved in the war  no matter on which side they fought  received economic assistance to reconstruct their economies. Some of the loans received under that Plan have yet to be paid back. Nevertheless  with the assistance granted  those countries have been able not only to develop booming economies but also to create a capacity to pay back loans. Countries like my own  which as colonies fought alongside the colonial Powers and their allies to preserve what we were made to believe was the dignity of the human person  have not been treated with an equal degree of concern.38.	If I have made reference to these historical events  it is not because it is my wish to subject this august Assembly to a lecture on a subject which representatives perhaps know better than I. My intention is merely to draw attention to a difference in the performance c f the world community in two situations which my delegation considers identical in all their aspects  except in their incidence.39.	Every year from this rostrum we are told of the ever- widening gap of relative economic growth between the developing and the developed countries; every year this Assembly is warned that this situation is inherently dangerous to world peace. It is relevant to ask  What has the world community as a whole  and particularly the rich  done to avert the inherent danger which we all  year in and year out  have foreseen and have stressed so often?40.	In assessing our performance in this regard  one cannot help but mention a number of factors that seem to my delegation to be clear pointers to the inadequate concern which the countries with the capacity to help arrest the situation have so far shown.41.	In the first place  almost every developing country is in debt — debt that has come about often from the so-called foreign aid  a conversion of part of the resources which have been taken from our lands and which are now reluctantly returned to us at unbelievably high rates of interest with a number of subtle strings. The huge interest on these debts has accumulated over the years  and in some cases has exceeded the principal. How can debtor countries service these debts when their economic growth falls far short of what the United Nations itself considers acceptable and desirable? How can the under-equipped world — to borrow the phrase from President Mobutu — free itself from factors not inherent in the economies of the developing countries  as some people would want us to believe  but in the nature of the world economic system dictated by the developed countries.42.	The burden of the developing countries is not debt  stifling to economic growth though this might be; these debts are more symptoms of a sick world economic system. Developing countries take loans to improve their economies  but what do they find? The past decades have witnessed a steady rise in the price of industrial goods; against this  the prices of the primary products on which they depend for the modernization of their economies have been fluctuating downwards. In this situation it is not surprising that most developing countries are becoming perpetual debtors to developed countries with little hope of achieving economic viability. President Mobutu called on the world community to cancel the debts of theSahelian countries affected by the drought. I would go one step further and suggest that serious consideration should be given to suspending indefinitely or cancelling altogether debts that constitute a barrier to and hinder a reasonable and accepted rate of economic growth.43.	This situation has been made even more complex by the present trend in the organization of the world economy into powerful economic groupings. My Government has no grudge against any decision of any group of countries to concert their economic efforts in their mutual interest. It is  however  the view of my Government that if such a group of countries  by reason of historical antecedents or by any other factors  occupies a dominant position in the world economic structure  its actions should not fail to take into consideration the general economic well-being of the entire world community. This  in the view of my delegation  should be the guiding principle of an organization such as the European Economic Community or any other economic group. It is with this understanding that we African countries have decided to enter into negotiations with the European Economic Community.44.	In our effort to create a more equitable economic system we launched the first international United Nations Development Decade. Our stock-taking at the end of that Decade  however  showed that we were far from achieving our targets. Nevertheless  we launched the Second United Nations Development Decade. Statements made by various countries at the launching of the Decade gave rise to some optimism regarding the performance of the international community. Regrettably this hope has not been justified. The United Nations World Economic Survey  19721 presents ""a picture of unusual contrasts"". While the economies of developed countries have been marked by a continued buoyancy  those of a majority of the developing countries continue to lag substantially behind targets set for the decade of the 1970s. On present performance the indications convince us that the Second Development Decade will end with its targets still unachieved.45.	In the face of this grim reality  it is only natural that developing countries should begin to attach less and less credibility to declarations of intent by developed countries. It is for that reason that my Government advocates and pursues a policy of self-reliance.46.	As stated in the charter of the National Redemption Council  the principle of self-reliance implies a recognition that our national regeneration depends on our own efforts  and that it is only through honest and hard work on the part of every citizen that Ghana can develop and prosper. Thus  while we welcome assistance from external sources  we are committed not to rely on foreign aid for the solution of our problems but instead to protect the wealth of the nation by active State participation aimed at capturing the commanding heights of the economy for our people.47.	During the year world currency problems  which had been developing over a number of years  reached a high- water mark. The American dollar was devalued on two occasions and the currencies of European countries as well as that of Japan were either revalued or floated. In spite of1 United Nations publication  Sales No. E.73.II.C.1.the existence of international machinery for consultations on monetary matters  developed countries met to consult on a solution to the problem as though the economies of the developing countries did not form part of the international economy.48.	In the view of my delegation  all issues  whether economic  scientific or political  have international repercussions; their solution therefore demands international consultations. These problems cannot be effectively considered for the entire world community by a group of countries  however affluent or powerful they may be. Their consideration must not exclude any country  however poor or weak.49.	The degree of interdependence reached by our present world has internationalized almost every issue to a smaller or larger extent. Until we have recognized this reality solutions to the many problems which face the world community today will continue to elude us. If we seize the opportunity now we may yet usher in the world of plenty which we all seek.50.	My Government would like to express its sincere appreciation to all those countries which have responded to the call to come to the assistance of countries within the Sudano-Sahelian region. We also welcome the efforts being made by the Food and Agriculture Organization and other United Nations agencies in this regard. We would however be failing in our duty if we did not point out the fact that the problem of drought  resulting in crop failures and decimation of the livestock population in the area  is not a recent one. Yet no serious effort was made to overcome it. When we consider that all the countries in the area were for many years under the colonial rule of one country or another  the manner in which the colonialist bore his ""burden"" in Africa becomes clearer to us. It is the view of my delegation that it would not be enough to combat the present crisis in the area. We should  and we must  formulate and execute plans which will eventually eliminate the problem altogether.51.	In our statement from this rostrum at the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly   we pledged our co-operation in any efforts that would be made to ensure that humanity not only would rid itself of hunger  poverty and disease  but would live in a clean and healthy environment. In fact  we believe that efforts to eradicate hunger  poverty and disease on the one hand  and to ensure a healthy environment on the other  are supplementary to each other. We do not believe that environmental protection and industrialization are necessarily mutually exclusive.52.	We are happy that as a result of discussions at the last session of the General Assembly the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme was elected. That Council  of which my country has the privilege to be a member  has already had its first session in Geneva. My delegation wishes the Governing Council and its secretariat every success in their efforts to find a solution to a problem which is gradually becoming an issue fundamental to human existence.53.	My Government has been following with keen interest the discussions which have been proceeding on the peaceful uses of the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. This is an issue of universal concern to all of us. We subscribe to the basic principle guiding the discussions on this issue  namely  that the area should be exploited for the benefit of mankind as a whole. It is the view of my delegation that this principle should be used as a measure for all provisions we write into any convention governing the use of the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. Our discussions on the issue should recognize the disparities in national endowments of scientific and technological know-how  availability of development capital and the structure of national economies. It is the hope of my delegation that the results of the work of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction will contribute in no small way to our work at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  scheduled to be held next year. There are problems  such as the limit of territorial waters and the question of land-locked and shelf-locked countries  to be solved. In the view of my delegation those problems are not insurmountable  given a willingness to accommodate and recognize each other's concerns.54.	There is a link between the equitable economic world order that my delegation advocates and the completely free community of nations which the twentieth century demands. Peace and harmony must  however  exist in the world if freedom and justice are to be secured and maintained for all.55.	Closer consultations among the major Powers have strengthened the atmosphere of detente and further lessened the chances of an atomic war. The end of the war in South-East Asia  coupled with the withdrawal of foreign troops from the region  has prepared the way for peace and reconstruction in an area which for over two decades has endured so much human suffering and witnessed such great material destruction. The conclusion of the treaty of accord between the two Germanys not only will widen the scope for reuniting separated families but also will  we believe  substantially lead to the relaxation of tension in Europe and foster the experiment of coexistence within the framework of different social systems.56.	Although these developments are welcome  we cannot but feel concerned and certain trends which could have a far-reaching effect on the aims and purposes of this Organization. There has been in recent years a tendency for the big and powerful nations to seek accommodation outside the forum of this Organization. Perhaps that is because there is a growing lack of interest in the United Nations on the part of some of these big and powerful nations.57.	The United Nations was established to ensure that the world would be saved from human suffering and senseless devastation. We have a collective responsibility to ensure this; this responsibility we can neither shirk  abdicate nor delegate. The more this forum is used  the more effective it will be in the discharge of its functions.58.	Notwithstanding progress in decolonization  the continued existence of colonialism and racism in certain parts of the world  particularly in Africa  remains a challenge to our demand for universal freedom and justice and constitutes a potential threat to international peace and security. Freedom and the related self-assertion of human dignity are some of the most priceless human rights. No wonder that national histories abound in examples of supreme sacrifices in pursuit of these rights. Such sacrifices continue to be made in our contemporary world and will continue to be made in the cause of human dignity. We in Ghana recognize the Tightness of this cause. It is in the light of this that we are resolutely pledged to the material and moral support of the gallant freedom fighters in Africa who are still struggling to free themselves from colonialism and racism  be they under Portuguese colonial rule or under that of the racist regime of South Africa. If peaceful means were possible we would advocate them  but since the racists and the colonialists leave us with no other choice we have come to the conclusion that armed struggle is the only effective means left to us to liberate our brothers in bondage. The Chairman of the National Redemption Council and Head of State of Ghana made this commitment clear when he said at the opening ceremony of the Committee of Liberation of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] in Accra in January of this year:""We must begin with a reaffirmation of armed struggle as the only means of liberating South Africa. This reaffirmation is important for the purposes of mobilizing all our resources for the common struggle  —  We do not accept the so-called contradiction between commitment to world peace and commitment to armed struggle for freedom in Africa. The liberation struggle is a just struggle for peace and human dignity  for there can only be a lasting peace in the world when all men are free  — ""59.	This leads me to the Portuguese Territories in Africa. At this juncture I should like to pay a tribute in this forum to Amilcar Cabral  a victim of the pernicious system he sought to eradicate. Ghana deeply mourns him  particularly because it was shortly after the twenty-first session of the Committee of Liberation in Accra that he met his death at the hands of a cruel assassin. Amilcar is dead  but the spirit that motivated his dedication still lives on. He has become a martyr  not only in the cause of his own country but in that of the entire African continent. There may be many like him who may fall in the course of the struggle; but neither torture nor death shall deter us. We shall fight on till victory is won.60.	The Government and people of Ghana rejoice at the independence of Guinea-Bissau. We wish that independent State every success and look forward to co-operating with it in OAU and  we hope  in the very near future in this Organization.61.	My delegation now urges this Organization to address itself urgently to the question of the illegal occupation by Portugal of part of the territory of Guinea-Bissau  in the light of the threat to international peace which that illegal situation poses.62.	Portugal has sought to justify its oppression of other human beings by legal arguments and by arguing the efficiency of its administration. It has sometimes pointed a deriding finger at independent African countries. I should like to point out with emphasis that the peoples of Africa are not necessarily claiming a superior ability to order their own affairs. What they are demanding is a right to be human beings and to be respected as such. We no longer wish to be fed and nurtured by benevolent foster mothers; we demand the right to order our own destiny  make our own mistakes  suffer their consequences and learn from them. This is Africa's case. In our struggle to achieve our objective there will be no compromises; there will be no limit to the sacrifices we are prepared to make.63.	In this regard I should like us to remember those 400 men  women and children who were brutally murdered in the villages of Wiriyamu and Chawola by Portuguese troops. Africa will always remember them among its sons who laid down their lives that the peoples of the continent of Africa might live in freedom and dignity. If there are any among us who seek evidence of Portuguese brutality in the Territories under Portuguese domination  this should be sufficient.64.	In the face of such brutalities  we cannot but express our grief and deep regret that the NATO allies that are Members of our Organization continue to supply arms to Portugal. It should now be obvious to them that the arms supplied are the very ones which Portugal has used  and continues to use  to perpetrate unspeakable atrocities against humanity. We appeal to these allies  in the name of humanity  to cease forthwith supplying arms to Portugal.65.	We appeal for more than that. We call on all the Members of this Organization to demonstrate their abhorrence of the inhuman policies of Portugal by limiting or severing contact with the Portuguese authorities. We call for this isolation because it could well be that it would be only through such universal disapproval that Portugal would come to realize the folly of its actions.66.	In 1972 Portugal announced constitutional changes in the Portuguese African colonial Territories. While taking note of these changes  my delegation would like to make it clear to Portugal that what-4he peoples still under its domination demand is not a sham constitution gratuitously conferring a measure of internal self-government; what they demand  with the backing of the rest of Africa  is that Portugal should recognize their right to self-determination and sovereignty. On this there will be no compromise.67.	The situation in Zimbabwe  where illegality has been enthroned  continues to cause a great deal of concern to my Government. This is particularly so having regard to the frustration caused by the violations of the sanctions imposed by this Organization.68.	We were saddened and disappointed when a Member of this Organization  who with others was charged with the primary responsibility for ensuring world peace  passed a law legalizing the importation of chrome which this Assembly  with the consent of that same country  had outlawed. We are happy to note that a repeal of that law now appears imminent. My delegation would go further and suggest that that Government should go a step further by closing down the propaganda office that it now permits the usurpers of Zimbabwe to maintain under its protection.69.	Sanctions need to be strengthened and made all- embracing  and no breaches of any kind should be allowed. The excuse often given for breaches of sanctions is that they have not worked. In the view of my delegation  if they have not worked  it is because certain Members of this Organization have ensured that they should not and will not work.70.	In recent times there have been certain developments in Zimbabwe which should give cause for even greater concern. I refer to secret trials  imprisonments and executions of African nationalists and others  under the so-called Southern Rhodesian Terrorist Act. How many such secret trials  unknown to the outside world  may have ended in the execution of Zimbabwe Africans  and perhaps other nationalists  as well. What my delegation wishes to ask is  What does the United Kingdom Government intend to do to stop these illegal and arbitrary acts in a Territory that still remains its primary responsibility? Secondly  what does this Organization intend to do  if only on grounds of concern for human rights? The United Kingdom Government as the administering Power has the duty to intervene to prevent further illegalities  and this Organization has a responsibility to bring all its resources and authority to bear on the matter in order to ensure that African lives are not sacrificed in the consolidation of illegality.71.	A Canadian YMCA document entitled ""Investment in Oppression: southern Africa today bears the seed of the next decades' Viet-Nam"" states:""Racial wars are already in progress in the Portuguese colonies. The Rhodesian regime faces growing African hostility. The unequivocal rejection by the African population of the attempted British-Rhodesian settlement has demonstrated to the world the intensity of the Africans' rejection of the white minority regime. An eventual eruption of violence there seems evermore likely. The status of Namibia is far from being settled. The potential for a violent upheaval in southern Africa is undeniable although the strength of the regime suggests that any struggle would be a long and bloody one  if there were no international intervention or mediation.""72.	For more than a decade  this Assembly has adopted resolutions condemning apartheid  racial discrimination and colonialism which Portugal and South Africa and the racist regime of Southern Rhodesia have resolutely defied. These three countries have placed themselves outside the pale of civilized behaviour and the time has come for the international community to show its deep displeasure by ostracizing them. We consider it appropriate that NATO members show their commitment to the self-determination of all African peoples by excluding Portugal from their military and defence alliance. Portugal needs NATO more than NATO needs Portugal  and there is no doubt that meaningful action to exclude Portugal would have a telling effect on its attitude.73.	Furthermore  sanctions should not only be intensified against Rhodesia; they should also be extended to South Africa and Portugal. If we believe in the United Nations as a forum that brings together all races and creeds to work together to improve living conditions on this planet  we are in honour bound to exclude countries which despise the basic principles of the United Nations from economic  social  cultural and political fellowship.74.	Never in the history of the United Nations have so many Member States walked out of a General Assembly debate as they did last Friday [2141st meeting]  as a mark of their total rejection of the racist policies of the Vorster regime of South Africa. South Africa cannot fail to see the utter contempt in which the rest of the world holds its policies. In its own interest  it is called upon to change those policies forthwith. It should be forcefully reminded that those who make peaceful evolution impossible  make violent revolution inevitable.75.	By the decision of this Assembly  South Africa has been isolated from international sports because of the operation of apartheid even in sports [resolution 2775 D (XXVI)]. In an attempt to break that isolation  South Africa announced reforms in sports which it told the world were aimed at removing apartheid in sports. South Africa's intention  however  was to throw dust into the eyes of the rest of the world. That intention becomes clear when we read a report in the issue of The Times of Wednesday  30 May  to the effect that the Government of South Africa had ""confirmed that it had stopped multiracial football matches which were being played without fuss between factory and schoolboy teams at Newcastle in Natal"". In its issue of 20 June  The Times carried a report from Michael Knipe  disclosing that the African members of a multiracial team that had played in London ""had to act as porters for the team"".76.	That is the extent to which South Africa is prepared to go in its deception of the rest of the world community. From this rostrum  my delegation urges this world body not to allow South Africa to take international public opinion for a ride.77.	When this obnoxious system produces a reaction from South Africans and non-Africans who still have a conscience  South Africa takes refuge behind its laws  ironically described as ""terrorist laws"".78.	The whole world was shocked when in September it was rudely awakened by news of the cold and ruthless murder of 11 Africans at Carletonville. Sharpeville  and the helplessness and the agony it stands for  was painfully recalled. South Africa lost no time in shedding crocodile tears of phoney regret  while giving notice that it would resist any effort by the international community to reach at the truth of those senseless murders  which have become the hallmark of the apartheid regime. Surely  the next of kin of the helpless victims reject any expressions of sympathy from those who secretly organized and are a party to the murders. My Government will never be satisfied with any inquiry conducted solely by the racist regime to justify the actions of the murderers. My Government will be satisfied only with an inquiry internationally conducted  or conducted under United Nations auspices  that will have the objective of bringing the murderers to a speedy trial and that will indicate measures to avoid such murders in future.79.	At its 1682nd meeting the Security Council authorized the Secretary-General  —  in paragraph 5 of its resolution 323 (1972) — to continue his consultations on the status of Namibia. At the time that resolution was adopted some of us were sceptical about the value of such consultations. Now the Secretary-General's report to the Security Council on his consultations has justified that scepticism. It has supported our contention that the conditions for dialogue with South Africa do not exist. That is why my delegation supports the consensus reached by the United Nations Council for Namibia at its 167th meeting  held on 27 March this year  opposing further contacts with South Africa on the grounds that: ""To maintain contacts with the South African regime would mean an acceptance of its policy on the part of the United Nations.. ."". 80.	It is time to remind the South African regime  without mincing words  that it is the inhabitants of Namibia themselves who must decide their future  and certainly not South Africa; that the people of Namibia have so decided on that future; and that they have decided on independence. If South Africa claims that it does not wish to impose a settlement on Namibia  let it accede to the clear wishes of the people and withdraw from the Territory now  today.81.	The Namibian problem is not an intractable one. It is intractable only in South African eyes. It is not a complicated issue. It is an issue similar to that which faced any of the Second World War Mandated Territories. Mandatory Powers have withdrawn and conceded independence to the indigenous peoples. South Africa is called upon to follow that example and grant independence to the people of Namibia. We do not accept that protracted discussions should be held in a situation where the solution is clear: independence for the people of Namibia  now. If South Africa has no designs whatsoever with respect to any part of Namibia's territory  let it back that assertion by withdrawing from Namibia forthwith. The people of Namibia do not want to appear to be subsidized by apartheid money  made bloodier by the death of the martyrs of Sharpeville and Carletonville. They demand independence to enable them to exploit their own natural resources for the benefit of their own people. South Africa has no duty in Namibia other than to pack up and quit that Territory.82.	The real representatives of Namibia do not want a dialogue with Vorster. They reject murderous hands and the deadly gifts they carry. The only discussion permissible is one with Sam Nujoma  leader of the South West African People's Organization  and his colleagues about the immediate transfer of power. That is South Africa's only duty in Namibia  and if it had any honour South Africa would perform that duty right away.83.	The world community continues to express concern over the arms race; yet the report of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly [A/9141-DC/236]  like its predecessors  does not indicate any prospect of a break-through. In the meantime  the stockpiling of armaments  particularly nuclear and biological weapons  continues  and that in spite of the significant relaxation in the international situation which all of us have noted. Agreement on a nuclear test ban in the atmosphere and in outer space  was reached 10 years ago. Since then there has been no progress towards an agreement on a complete test ban. In fact  the partial-test ban Treaty has not yet gained universal accession. France  for example  continues to plan to carry out atmospheric tests in the Pacific  in the face of vigorous opposition from all the countries in the area  which stand in great danger of being affected by the radiation from such tests  and against the ruling of the International Court of Justice. 84.	The view of my Government is that the issue of disarmament  like many issues facing our present international community  is of universal concern. It is of concern both for the militarily powerful and for the militarily weak. That is why my delegation supported the decision to hold a world disarmament conference  adopted at the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly [resolution 2930 (XXVII)].85.	It is the hope of my delegation that the militarily powerful nations  which as permanent members of the Security Council have the primary responsibility for safeguarding world security  will recognize the general obligation of the world community as a whole to ensure world peace. It is hoped that they will  in recognition of the general world concern over the disarmament issue  co-operate with the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference set up by the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly [resolution 2930 (XXVII)] to make the envisaged Conference a success. Even if such a conference achieved nothing at all — and in the view of my delegation there is much that it could achieve — it would serve to emphasize the general world concern over the issue of disarmament.86.	My Government views the outbreak of fresh fighting in the Middle East with a great deal of concern. It is our view that in this situation the question of who attacked first is less relevant than the lesson which the new development emphasizes.87.	Since 1967 Arab lands have been occupied by Israeli forces. For an even longer period the Palestinians have remained refugees  dependent on international charity  with no hope that their plight will be relieved. Hurt national pride and human suffering have combined to give rise to the situation which we are now witnessing in the Middle East. Until the Israeli forces have withdrawn from the Arab territories occupied by Israel during the 1967 war  and until the plight of the Palestinian has been relieved and the security of all States in the area has been assured  the Middle East will continue to be a hotbed of threats to peace in the area  as well as to international peace. My delegation urges this Organization to redouble its efforts to reach a settlement in the area which will restore national pride  human dignity and security to all concerned. The Government of Ghana would be willing to lend its assistance to any initiatives to that end.88.	If this Assembly were to commit itself to the goals that we have enumerated  if the membership were to pledge support to the realization of those goals  then we might yet live to see a world not only of sovereign States in which there was an equitable sharing of economic resources but also a world of plenty and a world of freedom and justice.89.	I wish the twenty-eighth session of the Assembly success."
"43",2633,"GIN",28,1973,"﻿272.	Mr. President  allow me  on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of my country  who is unable to be present  to convey to you  over and above the traditional congratulations  the satisfaction of the delegation of the Republic of Guinea on the occasion of your unanimous election to the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of our General Assembly. These congratulations are extended also to each of the members of the General Committee  who have made themselves worthy of the confidence of our august Assembly.273.	I should like also to discharge a pleasant duty  namely  to pay a deserved tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  Deputy-Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Polish People's Republic  and to tell him how greatly we appreciated the tact  courtesy and competence with which he conducted the work of the twenty-seventh session  of the General Assembly.274.	Your election to the presidency of this twenty-eighth session appears to us like a definite guarantee of the lucid conduct of our work towards the adoption of decisions in favour of the liberation of peoples  towards justice and equality among all peoples  that are the necessary conditions for peace and security.275.	You are a Latin American. It is  therefore  obvious that your love of the rights of peoples cannot be questioned. Child of the third world  you are inevitably sensitive  for more than one reason  to the many ills afflicting countries that are victims of the manoeuvres of the rich States. Thanks to the enormous experience you have acquired in the course of your diplomatic career  you are perfectly aware of the problems which paralyse our Organization  thus making peace and security precarious.276.	The readiness of States to subscribe to the principles of mutual understanding is an important element if we are to ensure international security and durable peace on our planet. The task that devolves on us is therefore that of uniting our efforts so as to work for the advent of a world in which the negative forces of hatred and domination will yield to those of entente and fraternity among peoples.277.	The fortunate changes that have taken place in the concept of relations between States indicate that we have reached a turning point  a concrete turning point  represented by a series of treaties and agreements one of whose most tangible results is the recent decision of the General Assembly to receive into our Organization the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. We avail ourselves of this opportunity to extend a welcome to these friendly States which  we are convinced  will make an important and valuable contribution to the cause of peace.278.	The problem of international peace and security  the defence of national sovereignties  decolonialization and the struggle against imperialism continue to be the focus of both bilateral and multilateral meetings. The dialogue between the great Powers appears to forecast the triumph of freedom  justice and equality among peoples  the essential basis for peace on our earth. The Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held recently in Algiers  has shown without the slightest doubt the resolute will affirmed by 2 000 million underprivileged men to upset the scale of accepted values and to give our universe greater social balance and its people greater hope and certainty.279.	Unfortunately  international peace and security have but a partial meaning for some members of our universal community. In fact  the peace of which they speak is rather that of the hateful order that they impose on other peoples  and security to them is the security of the illegitimate privileges they enjoy at the expense of other nations.280.	Is it possible for a single moment to bring an era of total peace and security throughout the world without first eradicating the causes of tension that beset Africa  the Middle East  Asia and Latin America? It is no longer a secret to anyone that the number one enemy of the order that our Organization has undertaken to create is still imperialism and all its present manifestations  such as colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism  Zionism  etc.281.	As everyone is aware  the Republic of Guinea  my country  has suffered and still suffers from the effects of imperialism which  since 28 September 1958  has hounded us for the simple reason that we have chosen the path of full responsibility. Imperialism does everything to jeopardize the sovereignty of our country. To achieve its regrettable objectives  it has allied itself with Portuguese colonial fascism  the most abject colonialism. And we understand that the fascist Government of Caetano  despite his ringing defeat on 22 December 1970 by the brave and proud people of Guinea and his condemnation by the Security Council  does not cease to indulge in acts of provocation against the peaceful Guinean population.282.	Portuguese military aircraft constantly violate our air space. Every time the Portuguese troops suffer severe setbacks at the hands of freedom fighters in Guinea-Bissau  they bomb our frontier villages on the fallacious pretext of reprisals or the right of hot pursuit. Mercenaries of all kinds  paid killers trained and released by Portugal  infiltrate regularly across our frontiers for purposes of aggression.283.	In its implacable determination to destroy the revolutionary regime that the proud people of Guinea has chosen freely for itself  Portugal and its allies intensify the training of mercenaries in the occupied Territories of the new independent State of Guinea-Bissau and in some of the neighbouring Slates  thus preparing a new armed aggression against our people. But  regardless of the means used by international imperialism  the people of Guinea  more than ever determined and united behind its great President  Ahmed Sekou Toure  will triumph  as it did .on 22 November 1970  over the forces of domination and will continue to defend its gains and to give unreserved support to the liberation movements in order to speed up the emancipation of the African fatherland and thus to contribute to ensuring the reign of international peace and security.284.	I should like  moreover  to emphasize that — like all the independent States of Africa and  generally speaking  all the countries in the world — the people of Guinea aspire profoundly to peace so that they can effectively devote themselves to the exalting task of building up their country. It is for this reason that they demand of international imperialism and its allies and  in particular  some of the neighbouring States of the Republic of Guinea that they recognize this sacred and inalienable right to peace and tranquillity — indispensable factors of peaceful coexistence.285.	My delegation wishes to emphasize the ludicrousness of the claim of the Lisbon authorities that the African Territories of Angola and Mozambique are provinces and a prolongation of Portugal. In those African Territories  there still waves the flag of that country which is not linked to Africa either by geography or by culture  or less still by a common history.286.	Throughout his intervention during the present session of the General Assembly the ""worthy representative""  ""the accredited spokesman of Portugal""  Mr. Patricio  was so bold  with the audacity of which he alone is capable  as to uphold theories of assimilation  such as ""the legitimacy of Portugal as an African nation"" [2138th meeting  para. 146) and many other absurdities as well.287.	No living person can accept that grotesque assertion  and  if Bissau is called Conakry 2  Lisbon  built up thanks to the wealth of Bissau  will soon be called Conakry.288.	In his confusion  Mr. Patricio attacks the socialist countries  the Scandinavian countries  OAU and how manymore? We must agree that the world shrinks dangerously under the paltry views of Portugal.289.	Illustrating the full dimension of the imperialist- colonialist-fascist hysteria of Portugal  Mario Soares writes:""... In fact  the only specific feature of Portuguese colonialism in comparison with other European colonialisms derives essentially from the financial and mental poverty of the settlers and the economic underdevelopment of the metropolitan country  which itself is a colony of the great Powers."" 290.	In fact  the decisive element of Portugal  its chemical property  is extra-Lusitanian. One need not be an expert in political affairs to realize that that unfortunate country  because of the mediocrity of its economic and military potential  stubbornly clings to its policy only because it knows it enjoys the complicity of NATO  whose member countries flout and disdain the resolutions adopted in favour of the African peoples.291.	Convinced that the cause it pursues is irreparably doomed  the Government of criminal Caetano pursues a policy of systematic destruction  of Fascist genocide  against the peaceful civilian populations of Guinea-Bissau  the Cape Verde Islands  Angola and Mozambique. Is there any need to recall in this connexion the savage massacre of over 400 Africans in the village of Wiriyamu in the Mozambican province of Tete  which aroused profound indignation and the condemnation of world public opinion.292.	Defeated everywhere in the field by the revolutionary forces  the regime in Lisbon resorts at present to the physical liquidation of the authentic representatives of the African peoples. As if to qualify itself in that hateful undertaking and believing it can put an end definitely to the heroic resistance of the nationalists in Guinea-Bissau  Portuguese imperialism  on 20 January 1973  in Conakry  had our comrade Amilcar Cabral  the great freedom fighter and founder and Secretary-General of PAIGC   cowardly   assassinated by mercenaries who had infiltrated into the area.293.	The courageous people of Guinea-Bissau gave to that insolent challenge the resounding and obvious reply by proclaiming victoriously on 24 September 1973 the People's Democratic Republic of Guinea-Bissau. Our delegation applauds that historic decision enthusiastically and rejoices at the fact that our Government was the first to recognize the young independent and sovereign State. The independence of Guinea-Bissau is the triumph of reason over brute force  the victory of freedom over colonialism  the prelude to a process that will infallibly lead to the liquidation of colonialism in Africa.294.	In the liberated areas of Guinea-Bissau  the people  guided by PAIGC under the enlightened leadership of its founder and No. 1 militant  Amilcar Cabral  has  in the course of 17 years of political and armed struggle  constructed a new life and now possesses a constantly evolving administrative organization  social and cultural services  ajudicial system  a steadily developing economy and national armed forces.295.	The visit of a United Nations Special Mission to the liberated areas of Guinea-Bissau from 2 to 8 April 1972 served to confirm to the international community what has been attested to by dozens of impartial  honest observers from every continent: the self-determination of our people and the de facto existence of an efficiently functioning State structure.296.	In flagrant violation of modern international law  the Portuguese colonialists are still encroaching upon some portions of our national territory. The United Nations has repeatedly recognized the illegality of the Portuguese presence  the inalienable right of our people to freedom and sovereignty  and the legitimacy of its struggle against Portuguese colonialism.297.	On the basis of the historic resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 concerning the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples  the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council have reaffirmed the inalienable right of our people to self- determination and independence  particularly in General Assembly resolution 2918 (XXVII) of 14 November 1972 and Security Council resolution 322 (1972) of 22 November 1972. Furthermore  on the proposal of the Special Committee on decolonization  the Fourth Committee of the United Nations General Assembly at its twenty-seventh session recognized PAIGC  the liberation movement of Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands  as the only and authentic representative of the people of that Territory.298.	The People's National Assembly  which is the result of PAIGC's successes in the fight against Portuguese colonialism  was constituted on the basis of the principle that power derives from the people and should serve the people. The Assembly is composed of representatives elected by universal and direct suffrage by secret ballot  being the expression of the sovereign will of the people of Guinea-Bissau.299.	At its meeting of 24 September 1973 in the Boe region  the People's National Assembly  expressing the sovereign will of the people  solemnly proclaimed the State of Guinea-Bissau. In that proclamation  the People's National Assembly declared  inter alia:""The State of Guinea-Bissau is a sovereign  republican  democratic  anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist State whose primary objectives are the complete liberation of the people of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde and the forging of a union between those two territories for the purpose of building a strong African homeland dedicated to progress. The arrangements for this union will be determined  after these two territories are liberated  in accordance with the will of the people.""The State of Guinea-Bissau assumes the sacred duty of taking action to expedite  by every means  the expulsion of the forces of aggression of Portuguese colonialism from that part of the territory of Guinea- Bissau which they still occupy and to intensify the struggle in the Cape Verde Islands  which form anintegral and inalienable part of the national territory of the people of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde.""The State of Guinea-Bissau regards the strengthening of the links of solidarity and soldierly brotherhood between our people and all peoples of the Portuguese colonies as one of the fundamental principles of its foreign policy; it stands in solidarity with the peoples struggling for their freedom and independence in Africa  Asia and Latin America and with all Arab peoples fighting against zionism.""The State of Guinea-Bissau is an integral part of Africa and strives for the unity of the African peoples  respecting the freedom of those peoples  their dignity and their right to political  economic  social and cultural progress.""As regards international relations  the State of Guinea-Bissau wishes to maintain and develop ties of friendship  co-operation and solidarity with its neighbours — the Republic of Guinea and the Republic of Senegal — with all independent African States and with all States throughout the world which recognize its sovereignty and support the national liberation struggle of our people. These relations shall be based on the principles of peaceful coexistence  mutual respect for national sovereignty  non-aggression  non-interference in internal affairs and mutual advantage.""The State of Guinea-Bissau assumes responsibility for promoting the economic advancement of the country  thereby creating the material basis for the development of culture  science and technology  with a view to the continuing improvement of the social and economic living standards of our population and with the ultimate aim of achieving a life of peace  well-being and progress for all our country's children.""Having as a foundation our heroic People's National Liberation Army  the State of Guinea-Bissau will provide our national armed forces with all necessary means to accomplish the task of bringing about the complete liberation of our country  and defending the achievements of our people and the integrity of our national territory.""From the historic moment of the proclamation of the State of Guinea-Bissau  authorities and organs of the Portuguese colonial State which exercise any political  military or administrative authority in our territory are illegal  and their acts are null and void. Consequently  from that moment on  the Portuguese State has no right to assume any obligations or commitments in relation to our country. All treaties  conventions  agreements  alliances and concessions involving our country which were entered into in the past by the Portuguese colonialists will be submitted to the People's National Assembly  the supreme embodiment of State power  which will proceed to review them in accordance with the interests of our peoples.""The State of Guinea-Bissau affirms the principle that it is fighting against Portuguese colonialism and not against the Portuguese people  with which our people wishes to maintain a friendly and co-operative relationship.""The State of Guinea-Bissau adheres to the principles of non-alignment. It supports the settlement of international disputes by negotiation and  to that effect and in accordance with the resolutions of the highest international organs  it declares its willingness to negotiate a solution which will put an end to the aggression of the Portuguese colonial Government that is illegally occupying part of our national territory and committing acts of genocide against our populations.""300.	We are happy to see the great sympathy with which most of the delegations attending this twenty-eighth session have welcomed the proclamation of independence by Guinea-Bissau  and we address a pressing appeal to all Governments to recognize the new State and to grant it effective and unreserved support  thus enabling it shortly to occupy its rightful place in the international community and in the specialized agencies of the United Nations.301.	Despite the strong reaction of independent Africa  supported by its friends  against the appropriation by certain imperialist Powers of the enormous natural resources of the Territories under Portuguese domination  the Cabora Bassa and Cunene projects continue to receive Western capital which the criminal protagonists describe fallaciously as beneficial investments.302.	My delegation believes that we must draw other conclusions from the recognition of the liberation movements by our Organization as the true representatives of their territories  conclusions that must be more in keeping with the will and aspirations of the peoples concerned  who are fighting so courageously for their freedom  independence and the sovereignty of their countries. In this context the presence of Portugal in these Territories is an unbearable aggression  a criminal aggression that must be punished as such. For this reason my delegation requests the inclusion of a new item on the agenda  to be entitled ""Criminal aggression by Portugal against the sovereign State of Guinea-Bissau and the illegal occupation of certain parts of its national territory"".303.	For us  independence means the exercise of national sovereignty by the people. It is also  and above all  a protest against injustices and all the causes of injustice and insecurity that daily endanger peace and human lives. It is the inauguration of a world of peace and happiness that our people cry out for with all their strength.304.	In southern Africa the illegal regime of Ian Smith is joining in a common cause with the racists of Pretoria and Portugal to exacerbate to the point of paroxism  racial hatred and methods of repression. Threats  brutalities  arbitrary imprisonments  murder in cold blood have become the lot of the freedom fighters in that part of the world. In the face of this tragedy  which is reminiscent of the age of primitive hordes  my delegation continues to maintain that so long as Great Britain  the administering Power  does not satisfy the just claims of the people of Zimbabwe  who ask for the convening of a constitutional conference based on the principle ""one man  one vote""  that country remains fully responsible.305.	I should like on behalf of my delegation at this point to pay a solemn tribute to the heroism of the militant people of the sister Republic of Zambia in the face of the numerous provocations of the imperialist oligarchies that are interlinked in southern Africa. The colonialist and racist regimes of southern Africa  powerless to stem the flow of the struggle for liberation  are now compelled to resort to other means. It is within that context that we must place the aggression and economic blackmail of the rebel Ian Smith against Zambia  which so victoriously took up the challenge.306.	Independent Africa  through its continental organization  OAU  has sufficiently highlighted and stigmatized the strengthening of the aggressiveness of the colonialists and racists by reason of the assistance they receive from their allies in the Western camp. Despite the determined sanctions of the international community  the economy of the partisans of segregation prospers still further and the armaments of the oppressors become more and more modern.307.	The Government of South Africa  despite the general condemnation of conscious and responsible mankind  continues to maintain our brothers under the heinous system of apartheid. The policy of the creation of ""Bantustans"" and the various forms of segregation remain the daily practice in South Africa. For Vorster and his clique the black man —  unfortunately  we must say this — is no different from an animal  since according to that backward and insolent philosophy all those belonging to that race have no soul and no conscience and deserve none of the rights required for the happiness and dignity of our fellow men.308.	The almost unanimous position taken by the members of the General Assembly against the right to speak of the delegation of the white minority of South Africa was an eloquent manifestation of the condemnation of Vorster's policy of apartheid. In our view  that manifestation is but one stage in the struggle embarked upon by Africa  whoseobjective is the occupation of the seat of South Africa by the authentic representatives of that part of the world.309.	On 4 February 1972  at its memorable meetings in Addis Ababa  the Security Council adopted its resolution 309 (1972)  relating to Namibia. The events that have taken place since then have in no way changed the reactionary position of South Africa in Namibia. With obdurate cynicism they have opposed the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General to find an equitable and peaceful solution. After the failure of the mission of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  after the unanimous rejection by the tenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  and in the light of the results of the recent referendum held in that Territory  my delegation believes that the United Nations should envisage the possibility of taking other concrete steps in order that the people of Namibia may as soon as possible accede to independence and national sovereignty.310.	Although the explosive situation obtaining in southern Africa is of the highest concern to us  we cannot pass over in silence the existence of other equally important. colonialist bastions in the continent: so-called FrenchSomaliland  the Comoro islands  so-called Spanish Sahara  the Seychelles islands  and so forth.311.	The period of colonial domination is finished forever. All peoples without distinction must unconditionally enjoy their freedom.312.	My delegation feels that  if our Organization is to live up to the commitments proclaimed and accepted since San Francisco  it must use all the means at its disposal to defeat the forces that oppose the realization of its noble ideals.313.	I should like now to turn to another problem which remains one of the constant preoccupations of our Organization — the Zionist aggression in the Middle East.314.	By creating out of nowhere the State of Israel  the United Nations has fanned the flames of a vast fire which it can no longer contain and which has acquired disquieting proportions.315.	Israel arbitrarily occupies by mere virtue of military power the territory of the brave Palestinian people  and this situation has lasted for 25 years. For 25 years  the Palestinian people chased from their fatherland have lived the errant life imposed on them by the Zionists.316.	Despite repeated condemnation from the forces of peace throughout the world and the many resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly  Israel has since June 1967 been occupying the territory of the Arab republics of Egypt and Syria.317.	Supported by a most powerful ally  it arrogantly defied the whole of the international community. To the peace efforts of Africa and the Arab States it has always responded with contempt and arrogance.318.	Inevitably  that state of affairs led to the events of 6 October. Thus  with rarely equalled violence  there broke out the vast conflict latent since June 1967.319.	Once again the Middle East is at war. On 9 October  with indignation and consternation  the world learned of the bombing of Damascus  which led to the deaths of many civilian victims  among them diplomats and United Nations officials.320. The Arab Republic of Egypt and Syria must recover their usurped territory. Peace in the Middle East must be achieved at that price.321.	On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Guinea  I wish to reiterate to the peoples and Governments of the Arab States  and in particular to Egypt and Syria  the complete solidarity and unreserved support of the people and Government of my country for their just struggle against the Israeli invader.322.	International imperialism has created other hotbeds of tension which it continues to maintain despite international disapproval.323.	The peace efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the reunification of its country still encounter numerous obstacles and a climate of continued tension maintained by the presence in South Korea of foreign troops.324.	Thus it is essential to hold as soon as possible a conference which would bring together representatives of all the population of the two Koreas to discuss problems concerning the future of the Korean fatherland. That is why my delegation opposes the premature admission of the two Koreas to the United Nations  which would sanction the definitive division of that country.325.	By withdrawing its armed forces and by ensuring scrupulous respect for the sovereignty of those States  the United Nations must help Korea recover its national unity.326.	The Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held from 5 to 9 September in Algiers  symbolized the resistance of oppressed peoples and was extremely well attended. The success of its work opened a new era in the history of the third world.327.	But  although we carefully follow those positive changes in the international situation  especially in the relations between the great Powers  the struggle of all the peaceful forces for the implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence and co-operation still meets with the active resistance of those that are in favour of war. Some of the great Powers  in order to create zones of influence for themselves  trample underfoot the elementary rights of peoples. The case of the Indo-Chinese peninsula is a typical example of this.328.	My delegation expresses its sincere concern at the recrudescence of military action in that region and invites the international community to use its good offices so that a just peace may be established in that part of South-East Asia.329.	The Republic of Guinea  which from the very first hours recognized the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia  headed by His Majesty Prince Norodom Sihanouk  sincerely hopes that the United Nations will understand the legitimate aspirations of the Khmer people to manage their own affairs.330.	In Algiers the large majority of non-aligned countries gave their firm support to the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam in its struggle for true independence.331.	The universality of the United Nations  which is one of the essential prerequisites for the achievement of the purposes and objectives of the San Francisco Charter  demands that all peoples make their contribution to the solution of the problems affecting mankind. Yet we note with regret the absence of the representatives of Viet-Nam  Korea  Palestine  the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia and of all the liberation movements which we recognized in 1972 as being the only legitimate representatives of their territories. The presence here of certain men who represent only themselves  of usurpers of power  of oppressors of peoples  is an affront and causes us indignation.332.	Among the Powers that arrogate to themselves the right unilaterally to discuss serious questions affecting mankind  we find precisely those that are responsible for the problems besetting world security. This is a paradox! It is inconceivable because it is contrary to logic that one should be both the judge and the accused.333.	If our Organization wishes to fulfil its historic and sacred mission  namely  to save present and succeeding- generations from the scourge of war  if our Organization wishes to establish international peace and security that are real and complete  it must eliminate the causes of war and tension  and eradicate from international relations the spirit of political domination and economic injustice. To do so we must break with Byzantine discussions and resolutely search for appropriate ways and means to ensure respect for the spirit of our Charter.334.	We must proclaim as crimes against humanity any acts that run counter to the advent of a just and durable peace and we must all take a stand against acts that are contrary to morality  peace and security in the world. The struggle against imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism  apartheid  zionism and all forms of aggression fall within this context and must be collectively supported by the United Nations because these phenomena are contrary to the principles upheld by our Organization. The internationalization of that struggle would enable our Organization to mobilize all its material  financial and military resources on behalf of the liberation forces. Thus we would show the peoples of the world that the United Nations strives to achieve the realization of their most fundamental and sacred aspirations.335.	We cannot  of course  achieve such results unless we revise the San Francisco Charter and adapt it to the new needs of our peoples. It goes without saying that the revision of the United Nations Charter and the strengthening of the structures of our international Organization demand greater democracy and equality among the Members  and that will be possible only if an end is put to the privileges given exclusively to some Powers. We must abolish the status of permanent member of the Security Council; we must abrogate the right of veto.336.	The main weakness of our Organization is due to the fact that only five of its Members  through the right of veto  hold in their hands the key to the solution of world problems.337.	This state of affairs is no longer in keeping with the realities of our century and constitutes a flagrant violation of the principle of democracy and a grave violation of the dignity of the large majority of the countries represented in this Assembly.338.	Of all the international problems that polarize world public opinion  disarmament is unquestionably both the oldest and the most topical  because it is the one that has achieved the least possible progress. One speaks of it more as hobby than through real conviction. It goes without saying that there is still a game of hide and seek. The medium-sized and small States  when they bring up the question of disarmament  still have in mind the fact that infallibly they will come up against the resistance of the great Powers and thus will not succeed. As for the great Powers themselves  they have always subscribed to resolutions by which they have not felt themselves bound.339.	This year will mark the convening of the first session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  whose second session the General Assembly has scheduled to take place in 1974 [resolution 3029 A (XXVII)]. We attach to that Conference the importance that it deserves. We hope that in its deliberations it will duly take into account the demands of the developing world and its security needs. The need to guarantee the security and territorial integrity of my country  which is one of the main targets of imperialism  has led us to extend the limits of our territorial waters to 200 nautical miles. The importance that we attach to the forthcoming Conference on the Law of the Sea is explained by our constant desire for the speedy codification of certain rules and conditions whose adaptation to present realities is indispensable.340.	The Conference can and should be held as planned. However  by reason of the explosive situation at present prevailing in Chile  it would be desirable for the Conference to be held elsewhere. In that connexion  my delegation suggests that we reconsider paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 3029 A (XXVII)  according to which it was decided to hold the second session of that Conference in Santiago.341.	The people of Guinea has followed with deep emotion the painful events which last month brought sorrow to the friendly Republic of Chile. Our delegation expresses its deep sympathy to the valiant people of Chile  which has remained faithful to the revolutionary ideals of President Salvador Allende.342.	In the world today  the contradictions that we find in Africa in its relations with the outside world result from the fact that the African economy is still exploited or dependent on outside countries. It is beset by increasing disparities between the prices of our primary commodities and those of the goods sold to us from outside Africa. The terms of trade bring new concern each day to our peoples  whose creative efforts are annihilated by a system that always tends to aggravate the living conditions of the producers in our continent. Therefore we must take a decision as early as possible to lay the foundation of an economic policy that reflects our determination to achieve the decolonization of our continent and ensure effective solidarity for our peoples in this area.343.	It was because of a desire to defend these interests that the tenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and G6vernment of the OAU in Addis Ababa adopted the African declaration on economic co-operation  development and independence.344.	The sincere co-operation that we wish to obtain from the developed countries must  come even more from the United Nations  in which we place our confidence. In fact we note that often the loans it grants through its bodies increase our debts rather than help us. Often over half the sum allocated to projects in our countries is used for endless studies and for the travel expenses of experts. Finally  when the projects have no more funds  they are merely abandoned.345.	I should not wish to end this intervention without saying a few words about the drought that has recently afflicted six States in the Sudano-Sahelian region and which has ravaged in an unprecedented way the population and livestock of that region. My delegation will not dwell on the details of that situation  which has been sufficiently explained by many delegations that have spoken before me and which was the subject of an eloquent statement by General Lamizana  President of the sister Republic of the Upper Volta  under special mandate from the meeting at Ouagadougou of the six countries concerned. [2145th meeting].346.	I shall confine myself to expressing my sincere thanks on behalf of my Government to all those who have responded to the appeal of our brothers in distress. I should like to emphasize  however  that  while the immediate needs of these countries have been met to some extent with the assistance received  much remains to be done to eliminate the sequels of this disaster and to restore normal life to that agro-pastoral region.347.	It is for this reason that we call for the collaboration of the international Organization in order that it may take concrete measures to reconstruct the economy of the States of the Sudano-Sahelian area so that they can face up to these calamities and others of the same kind in the future."
"44",2796,"GRC",28,1973,"﻿153.	Mr. President  on behalf of the Greek delegation and on my own behalf I should like to tell you how much satisfaction we feel in knowing that the General Assembly is meeting this year under your guidance. Your election is a well-deserved tribute to your high moral and intellectual qualities; it is also an affirmation of the positive role your country  with which Greece maintains friendly and cordial relations  is playing in international affairs. Your distinguished career in the United Nations  marked by a strong sense of deep devotion to peace and international co-operation  assures us that your mandate will be exercised in the best possible way.154.	At the same time  I should like to express our deep gratitude to the outgoing President  the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland  Mr. Trepczyriski  for the able and effective way in which he discharged his heavy duties during a session that was difficult and fraught with complicated problems.155.	Lastly  I should like to welcome the admission of three new Members to our Organization: the Federal Republic of Germany  the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. On behalf of my Government I should like to convey to them our warmest congratulations. We hope that they will be able to contribute to the strengthening of our Organization in the interests of world peace and peaceful co-operation among peoples.156.	Before proceeding to express very quickly my Government's views on certain items of the agenda I should like to pay a tribute to the persistent efforts of our Secretary- General for the maintenance of peace and the attainment of the ideals of our Charter. The year that has passed since the last session of the General Assembly has been marked by a relaxation of international tensions and the creation of a climate favourable to the search for peace throughout the world.157.	Greece  a country devoted to peace and firmly devoted to the principles of the Charter  has made it its duty to make a sincere and constructive contribution  either on a bilateral or on a multilateral basis  to any initiatives designed to safeguard peace and strengthen international security.158.	In particular  I should like to refer to the policy inaugurated by my Government a few years ago towards the countries of the region in which Greece is situated. Despite differences in political and social system  and without prejudice to our respective international commitments  and of course with the co-operation of the other countries of our region  we have been able to inaugurate a new period of co-operation in all fields to the mutual benefit of all. What we desire above all is not only development of bilateral relations on a broader and more fruitful basis but also transportation of those relations to a multilateral plane. If I have ventured to refer briefly to these developments in south-eastern Europe  it is because we are convinced that they are in complete harmony with the purposes pursued by our Organization and certainly contribute to their attainment. In this context I should also like to recall that it was Romania  a country of our region  which  with the vigorous support of other countries including Greece  in the General Assembly last year mentioned the need to strengthen the role of the United Nations in matters affecting the safeguarding of world peace  the development of co-operation among all countries and the strengthening of the rules of international law.159.	Turning now to certain items of our agenda  I should like first of all to deal with the question of disarmament under strict and effective international control. We are comforted by the fact that a new period of detente and international co-operation is looming on the horizon. This development could only lead to a process of various types of negotiations on the limitation of armaments. I would first refer to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States and the Soviet Union  which have already had a concrete impact upon the limitation <}f defensive strategic weapons. We all hope that the second phase of those negotiations covering the possibility of limiting offensive strategic weapons  a phase under way at the present time  can achieve the same success. The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament continues its work in Geneva along positive lines  though perhaps not at the desirable pace. Next month in Vienna we shall be resuming negotiations between the countries members of the NATO alliance and the countries signatories of the Warsaw Treaty on possible reductions in the forces of the two alliances on a mutual and balanced basis. Finally  the European countries  as well as the United States and Canada  are hoping that the second phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which has just begun its work in Geneva  will succeed in endorsing military measures which will serve to strengthen confidence between East and West.160.	With respect to the other items on the agenda of that Conference  —  that is  security  economic and trade relations and the freest possible circulation of information  ideas and persons — we shall participate actively in the second phase in order to try -in co-operation with the other participating countries  to find concrete solutions to all those problems at the root of the fundamental issue  which  in our position  is as follows: Will we merely experience a period of detente of a more or less verbal nature  or will we  rather  find the means of setting up real and sincere co-operation between peoples and States?161.	That line of thinking leads us to examine briefly the problem created by the fact that the world is divided into developed countries and developing countries. Some-and rightly so-have called this a problem of the north and south of our planet. First of all  we should consider how the vast resources  both material and intellectual  which are today used in pursuit of the arms race  can rather be devoted to economic and technological support for the developing countries. We firmly believe that all efforts to establish and strengthen a lasting peace cannot succeed if the major portion of the people of our earth continues to live in conditions bordering on famine  poverty and misery.162.	In respect of the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in the peaceful settlement of international problems and the strengthening of peace  there is still a great deal that remains to be done  and I can only agree with the Secretary-General when  in the introduction to his report on the work of the United Nations  he says: ""Some of the mechanism provided in the Charter for achieving these aims  however  has not proved workable . .."" [Aj 9001/Add.l  p. 1].163.	To that I should merely like to add that my Government considers it essential to fill in the lacuna consisting of the lack of practical machinery that would enable our Organization to discharge its primary task-that is  to maintain and strengthen world peace. Thus the time has come to leave improvisations aside and to adopt a general agreement covering all aspects of peace-keeping operations. While not overlooking the socio-economic tasks of our' Organization  we consider that primary attention  with everything that this involves in terms of material contributions  should be devoted to peace-keeping  particularly in those countries bearing a major responsibility for that task. Greece  desiring to see the goals of the Organization achieved  is contributing materially and morally to their success and is ready to do everything it can along those lines. In particular with respect to the United Nations Force in Cyprus  I should like most warmly to thank our Secretary-General for his interest and all those countries that have exerted so much effort to preserve peace on the island.164.	In respect of the problem of Cyprus  which continues to bf a source of deep concern for my Government and the entire Greek people  I should like to add the following comments. We have repeatedly stated-and we firmly adhere to this viewpoint-that this question should be settled by establishments on that island of a truly independent  sovereign and unitary State. That is the position we adopted after several tragic phases of the question which affected the rights and aspirations of the Greek population of Cyprus. Moreover  we consider that that solution can be achieved only through the intercommunal talks under way at this very moment in Cyprus  in which the United Nations representative is participating and which are being followed by constitutional experts of Greece and of Turkey. That is our position of principle  and we lend our full and complete support so that the talks can achieve a successful result. For that matter  success can be achieved only if the participants show a spirit of realism and compromise.165.	The Greek delegation had occasion at previous sessions of the General Assembly to explain its position on the situation in the Middle East. Despite certain hopes expressed last year  we are compelled to observe  to our very deep regret  that no progress has been recorded in the restoration of peace in that part of the world. Indeed  Arab territories are still occupied  the path of negotiation continues to be blocked and the hour of peace apparently is no closer. This immobility  this state of stagnation in which the problem of the Middle East is bogged down  hardly serves to help heal the still open wounds; on the contrary  it opens the door to backsliding  which could have nefarious effects on peace and international security. As the Secretary-General has stated-and I endorse his statement- ""Time is not on our side in this highly explosive situation"" 166.	No one can therefore be complacent or accommodate himself to the present state of ""no war  no peace"". We consider that it is incumbent upon our Organization  and more particularly upon those of its Members that are endowed with exceptional prerogatives by the Charter  to explore and encourage fresh diplomatic initiatives for the application of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which still provides the best basis for a just  viable and equitable settlement of the problem which concerns us. The passage of time is neither to the advantage of the Arab countries nor to the benefit of Israel  but it is certainly detrimental to peace and international security.167.	On the question of bringing peace to Indo-China  I shall confine myself to expressing the fervent hope that the agreements and the communiques ensuring peace will be scrupulously applied by all the parties in order to ensure that the so-sorely-tried peoples of that region of the world can live in peace and in respect for human dignity  and that the political will of those peoples will be freely expressed without any foreign intervention.168.	My delegation attaches particular importance to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. However  I must emphasize that the interests involved are so broad and the difficulties to be overcome so vast that we must envisage the United Nations initiative in this area with very cautious optimism. Greece  which is almost entirely surrounded by the sea  is anxious to safeguard its sovereignty and its territorial integrity from any attacks and  in addition  to respect or  rather  to see respected — the traditional principle of the freedom of the sea. Although we would like to confirm our determination to contribute to the success of that Conference  for obvious reasons we could not depart from certain fundamental principles of international law. Those principles are as follows; First  no discrimination can be accepted between the mainland and the island part of the same national territory; secondly  no discrimination can be accepted between citizens of the same country; thirdly  we must have absolute respect for the fundamental principles which govern the deliberation of maritime frontiers.169.	Any infringements of these principles will certainly lead to complications  the consequences of which cannot be foreseen.170.	I turn now to a question which is dear to the hearts of all of us. Thanks to a long tradition and to the national character of the Greek people  that people has always rejected any form of discrimination  whether it be racial  religious or social  and it has rejected it morally  politically and culturally. It is therefore without any great effort and remaining completely faithful to our traditions that we unreservedly and without hesitation endorse all the efforts that our Organization is making to do away with the racism and intolerance which  unfortunately  exist in certain parts of the world. But just because of this point we have no reservations or prejudice whatsoever  we think that these principles of acceptance and mutual tolerance should be applied reciprocally and without discrimination. We certainly cannot accept the idea that racial discrimination should be condemned in one country and tacitly tolerated in another.171.	By the same token  I should like to refer to what may be considered as another form of racial discrimination  that is to say  the vestiges of colonialism. If the principles of our Charter are to be accepted by all — and they must be-then the principle of self-determination of peoples should be respected in die first instance.172.	The year that has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly has seen a new and terrible wave of terrorism unleashed throughout the world  conducted on an international scale  which constitutes a resounding provocation in the face of international morality. The impunity which most often accompanies those acts  which are as horrible as they are condemnable  should no longer be tolerated by the international community and especially by our Organization  the attitude of which so far has been passive  for such an attitude only serves to increase the number and scope of these base criminal acts. What we are called upon to do is to condemn unequivocally and without reservations acts of terrorism and those who perpetuate them  because any equivocation on this only leads to the impunity of the criminal and consequently to the encouragement of those acts.214. I must add that no national cause  no matter how worthy of respect  can find justification in such acts  which serve only to arouse the indignation of world public opinion. My delegation hopes that this session of the General Assembly will not conclude its work without having obtained: first  the accession of all Member States to the Tokyo Convention of 1963  The Hague Convention of 1970 and the Montreal Convention of 1971 secondly  the adoption of a new convention on such acts of international terrorism  as the aforementioned conventions still have not dealt with  which would establish an international jurisdiction recognized by all Member States and which would provide in detail for the responsibility of those criminals.215.	In conclusion  I should like to add that  in a world which is in a continuous state of evolution and where gigantic transmutations of values are being manifested  the new generation  which is not bound to the past by any mental habits  will not be able to support us so long as we obstinately continue to feed on the past and to model ourselves on the past. The world today knows that it is our refusal to respect the commandments of our Charter — rather than the structural defects of the temple of peace erected on the ruins of the last World War — which discredits our profession of faith in the great ideals on which our Organization was founded.216.	Therefore  let us not expect public opinion to give weight to our proclamations  unless they reflect a change in spirit  a ripening of our common will to prove that the ideals that led us to create the United Nations are still very much alive."
"45",2884,"GTM",28,1973,"﻿197.	Mr. President  the delegation of Guatemala considers that the General Assembly was well advised to appoint you  since this appointment also represents twofold recognition of your standing as a jurist and of the personal qualifications that you have brought to the service of the United Nations  helping to maintain trust and to increase faith in the unchangeable principles and vital objectives of the world Organization. Our admiration and respect bespeak your success and guarantee you the whole-hearted co-operation of the delegations present here.198.	I wish to thank you also for the special tribute that you paid to the memory of the late Guatemalan internationalist  Emilio Arenales Catalan  who preceded you in your high office.199.	I should like also to mention the ties and similar deep historic roots that link Ecuador and Guatemala. And I might refer to the fact that the greatest Latin American writer of fables  Rafael Garcia Goyena  as a child  left his native city of Quito and while in my own country he contributed to the emerging national awareness and served the cause of the political emancipation of Central America through the press that he edited and that supported independence.200.	I must express the concern of my delegation at the exacerbation of the conflict in the Middle East.201.	This regular session of the General Assembly began with the promising prospect that the relaxation of great political differences and ideological controversies all over the world would make the road to the maintenance of international peace and security easier to traverse.202.	Such prospects have been seriously upset by the conflict in the Middle East. Since the United Nations was born out of the need of humanity for peace and for guarantees of the security of peoples  safeguarding mankind from the untold sufferings of war as our basic and primary objective  this conflict once again puts the United Nations on its mettle. It is a challenge to the political will of Member States to achieve a solution to the conflict and to follow up that solution in order to ensure peace throughout the region. We trust that the United Nations will live up to that mission.203.	It would be almost redundant for me to reiterate the adherence of Guatemala to the United Nations or even to try to list the fruitful achievements of the Organization. We should be better advised to consider the balance-sheet and then answer criticisms that have been made — some of them well-founded — which are the result of impatience and eagerness of many to revitalize the United Nations at a time when its purposes and directives have matured sufficiently to require greater achievements.204.	We are gratified that the application of the principle of universality is gaining ground and our international Organization is expanding and becoming stronger. We are happy to welcome cordially the representatives of the beautiful archipelago of the Bahamas and the admission of the two German States  whose renewed contact promises convergence in this climate of political detente  a convergence that Einstein entrusted to time  space and distance; this does not satisfy fully those of us who wish for a world that is united  yet this convergence will help us towards coexistence and human understanding. There are some very promising indications contained in the statements made by a number of Powers in this forum  confirming the fact that the United Nations inspires trust and leads to agreements. Thus  for example  the Soviet Union has revived  in concrete terms  a proposal  which the representative of the United Kingdom recalled here  on the reduction of military budgets in order that the resources thus saved might be diverted to international co-operation and to meeting the priority needs of the developing countries [A/9191].205.	The Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany  Mr. Willy Brandt  agreed in condemning violence in any form and  furthermore  he denounced that defeatism which is confined to a bitter criticism of ""an almost jubilant pessimism"" in the face of the present complex problems  when people are dying of hunger as earlier they died in war [2128th meeting]. Therefore  as we seek peace we must revitalize the instruments of international cooperation and improve the living conditions of many peoples whose backwardness or poverty are the ingredients of domestic upheaval and threats to international security.206.	Surely this new atmosphere will be encouraged and promoted by the United Nations. It may be created by a convergence of fear and the memory of untold sufferings  but it is a climate which might be conducive to a disarmament movement or a change in individual and collective conduct that will turn sterile struggles into useful compromises  and to a search for peace and security through mutual understanding and co-operation.207.	My country does not need to reaffirm its traditional belief in the peaceful settlement of international disputes  which already in 1825 was the principle underlying the instructions that our delegates  Molina and Larrazabal  carried with them to the First Inter-American Conference in Panama  and that contribution to the rule of international law leads us today to advocate disarmament  and to condemn unreservedly the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear tests that might shatter the radiation balance and be a grave danger to mankind. We are proud  in the Western Hemisphere  that the Treaty of Tlatelolco was created and signed by us.208.	In Guatemala our concern for development has been directed towards an over-all plan with a deep humanist underlying condition that calls for better standards of health  training and cultural activity so that  at least the greater number of our inhabitants  if not all  shall participate actively in the social and economic welfare and thus meet the imperative that ""peace is the fruit of justice"". This is a guiding principle that has a deeply rooted tradition in the Guatemalans because in the Popol Vuh  the most important of pre-Columbian books  it was stated as follows: ""Let all rise. Let all be called. Let there be no group  no two groups  among us that is left behind the others.""209.	The search for basic social justice as a means of promoting peace  security and the welfare of the nation is a matter for all of us  and our President  General Carlos Arana Osorio  has made appeals that go beyond party interests and elite groups  that we should all work together devotedly  sharing the sowing and the harvest and the enjoyment of the benefits  under the egalitarian inspiration of the Sacred Book of the Maya-Quiches in Guatemala:""All the tribes climbed the mountain together to see the sun rise. They took with them their idols and their animals  their wives and their children  their chiefs and their servants; and the sun rose. And the tribes were not counted  nor the idols  nor the animals  nor the strong  nor the weak. The sun shone brightly on all.""210.	We have stressed the great responsibility for a national effort to achieve over-all development  but we do not in any way underestimate bilateral  regional and international co-operation freely agreed upon; at the same time  however  we must obey the integrationist mission of the Central American isthmus  which is geographically  historically  ecologically and culturally intended to combine natural and human resources to meet the requirements of a single  common destiny  as provided in the restructuring of the common market and in other aspects of the regional plan  aimed at benefiting the peoples of the region. A number of organs are working along those lines and important programmes are under way. If there were difficulties in the Mercomun —  the common market — if a dispute has endangered the plan  the situation has now improved and the prospects for the coming year are eminently promising.211.	We know that the United Nations will through its specialized agencies give the necessary support  on conditions appropriate to our circumstances  within the framework of our own institutions.212.	With regard to the efforts being made by the Central American Governments to speed up the economic development  we believe it is indispensable for all developing nations to define the economic rights and duties of States in a charter in keeping with present ideas  but flexible enough to be adapted to future situations. The prompt adoption of such a charter by the international community would set the stage for an era of constructive calm.213.	Despite the fact that in 1970 the General Assembly adopted the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade  many policy measures included in the Strategy have not been implemented. Furthermore  the world economy has suffered a series of grave upheavals  with particularly unfavourable repercussions on the developing countries. That situation surely calls for political will on the part of the developed countries to implement new forms of international co-operation that will cover global interests and treat common problems  without distinction  in the light of interdependence.214.	The United Nations and its specialized agencies  without doubt  in specific fields falling within their competence  have done praiseworthy work on the development of the less advanced nations  and yet bureaucratic and administrative problems hinder implementation of the United Nations Development Programme in some regions. In this connexion  it is suggested that international co-operation should make better use of available resources  since the balance-sheet of the first two years of the Second Development Decade shows that many problems persist. Some have become aggravated to the point where they even show signs of retrogression.215.	Trade negotiations started in Tokyo within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade also call for preferential treatment to be given to the developing nations. If this goal is lost sight of  and if multilateral negotiations are to be made subject to the interests of the economic Powers  or if they are limited merely to solving their own problems  then irrecoverable ground will be lost in international relations.216.	Development is also linked closely to the problem of population. At round tables and seminars  in studies and speeches at national and regional levels  a preventive policy regarding the balance between population and natural resources is discussed and examined. We must recall the warnings of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations but must not go back to the simplistic Malthusian theory regarding world supply of food-stuffs. We must rather take into account the complexity of the socio-economic concept in which man is at present developing  since his destiny depends primarily on the family milieu. It is in order to ensure that every man has better and more resources  and can thus more effectively contribute to the collective welfare  that the United Nations has stressed the importance of population problems and has created a specific department to gather and disseminate information and  we might also say  keep its finger on the pulse of each country regarding reactions to the problem.217.	In my own country the demographic problem is not the determining factor governing under-development  nor is it of an alarming nature. Far from it; however  the authorities and society have both taken it into account and thus encouraged study of the problem and discussion of programmes for family planning. We can bring some of our experiences and experiments to the World Population Conference planned by the United Nations for 1974.218.	In a different context  we admit that the United Nations has been more than ready to assist areas affected by natural disasters. Thus  my delegation would be ready to advocate and sponsor the creation of a standing United Nations body  ready to give assistance and help to countries suffering natural catastrophes or calamities  which almost constantly beset one region or another of the world and which call for timely and ample assistance.219.	During 1974 the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is to be held. At that time  difficult problems will be raised  such as the different delimitations of the sea  especially as regards the utilization of natural resources as yet unassessed but whose importance is already known and planned on as vital sources and reserves for the economies of our peoples.220.	Some formula will have to be found that will guarantee the rational exploitation of the sea-bed without disregarding the preferential rights of the coastal States  linking the interests of more than 130 nations whose situations are very different. It will be a challenge to the negotiating capacity of diplomacy  it is true  but scientific precision and technical advice  as well as the new concepts of international law  must prevail. Thus it might be helpful if prior and wide dissemination were made by the United Nations of any information and data that will allow those problems to be placed within the framework of the coastal rights of peoples and nations and in the emerging interests of future generations.221.	Finally  this year the United Nations will celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  with world-wide repercussions. In this matter the Government of Guatemala  whose Constitution includes each and every one of the human rights proclaimed in the Universal Declaration  apart from having presided over the formation and development of our own Republic and being soundly rooted in the people  has adopted measures to ensure the widest publicity in which schools at all levels and many cultural institutions will enthusiastically participate.222.	This General Assembly has before it the problem of devising the programme for the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination. Guatemala agrees openly with the objectives of that Decade and we are ready to support the elimination of any form of discrimination by following a crusade to defend the right which goes hand in hand with the very right to life  and that is life with dignity.223.	We believe that this readiness  which is unanimous in the Assembly  is the best framework in which to celebrate the anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights  and our hopes are that the awareness of those rights and respect for their tenets will not only be set forth in a declaration but will be part of the mentality of future generations and be brought out in their conduct and in their acts."
"46",2930,"GUY",28,1973,"﻿ Every five years  to the pleasure which each of us has of commencing our contributions to this debate with congratulations to the President  there is added a special measure of satisfaction as we pay a tribute to one from our own region who has assumed the high office of the presidency of this Assembly. So is it for me today. The mature wisdom and erudition which characterized his many years of devoted work as Permanent Representative of Ecuador to the United Nations have justly earned Ambassador Benites the respect and indeed the affection of his colleagues both in the Latin American group and in the general councils of this Organization. That respect and affection  no less indeed than the experience which he brings to the presidency  will serve to assure him of the support of the entire Assembly even as they inspire us all with confidence in the success that will attend his term of office.2.	As one of his Vice-Presidents for the twenty-eighth session  may I assure him even more personally of the unswerving support and assistance which he may  with confidence  demand and expect from me and from my delegation.3.	And to his predecessor  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczyriski  the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland  who guided our twenty-seventh session with wisdom and efficiency and whose conduct of the business of the Assembly earned him the respect of the international community  may I extend the gratitude of my delegation and of my country for the service he has given to the furtherance of the objectives of this Organization?4.	For Guyana  as for so many other Member States  the commencement of the twenty-eighth session was overcast by the shadow of developments in the Republic of Chile — a member State of our Latin American community with which we have had close and fraternal relations. I take  therefore  this early opportunity in the work of the Assembly to pay our tribute to the memory of the late Dr. Salvador Allende  whose tragic passing deprived not only Chile but all the developing world of a courageous champion — a champion whose aspirations were the aspirations of the third world and whose valiant struggle the struggle of all within it who demand social and economic justice.5.	Many of the early hours of the session have already been occupied with congratulations to the three new States Members of the Organization-sentiments  of course  with which my delegation has been associated. I hope I may be permitted  however  a special word of welcome to our sister Caribbean State  the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  which joins this Organization as its one hundred and thirty-fifth Member. The Bahamas is linked to the English- speaking States of the Caribbean by those enduring bonds which a shared historical experience has wrought. That experience has moulded of these Caribbean States  including the mainland States of Guyana and Belize  a geopolitical community which accepts a destiny with a Latin American broadened to encompass it and which promises to make its own enriching contribution to the region thus enlarged.6.	The Caribbean Community and the Caribbean Common Market  that were inaugurated on 1 August of this year  embody those perspectives. It is a time of progressive change throughout our subregion and it is in every sense a propitious time for the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to embrace the opportunities of independence and to join the family of the wider international community.7.	The welcome accession of the Bahamas to independence and its admission to this Organization serve to remind us also of those territories of our region that still remain to find fulfilment through self-determination. The impediments that strew their path are not merely the traditional ones; they are both different and various: they range from fear of aggression in one case to concern over viability in others. For these  at least  the impediment is not that of a metropolitan overlordship reluctant to relinquish dominion. In securing the completion of the processes of decolonization in the Caribbean not only the States directly concerned and those of us who share a destiny with them  but also this Organization itself  will need to be mindful of those special problems-will need to be vigilant lest an illusion of decolonization be allowed to displace the reality of self-determination.8.	The Caribbean Sea has been a cradle of imperialism. When we divest the region  as we must  of the last remnants of European colonialism  let us be certain that we have banished colonialism in all its forms  and let us be certain that we have not merely substituted a new hegemony for that which is passing from the scene. My delegation will not hesitate to speak out against any such development which retards rather than advances the march of the peoples of the Caribbean within the integrity of their several societies towards the dignity of nationhood.9.	And let us remember that the admission of a new Member State such as the Bahamas is no less the fulfilment of the principle of universality because it is the result of the process of decolonization; for the principle of universality itself is frustrated when societies that have a right to advance to the status of nationhood in the international community are. for whatever reason  denied' the right to political independence as sovereign States  Correspondingly  the denial of the right of self-determination of peoples must also be recognized as an impairment of the principle of universality and an injury to this Organization itself  whose strength derives from the fulfilment of that principle.10.	In common with the rest of the international community my delegation applauds the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. This Organization is immeasurably strengthened by their membership  and the community of Member States — which is  after all  the community of mankind-is much more real now that they will exercise their not inconsiderable influence and make their important contributions within  and not merely outside  this Organization.11.	But my delegation would like to look upon the admission of these two great European States as symbolic of even more than the advancement of the principle of universality. With their admission  the international community has broken free of that bondage to the past which the realities of a war-time experience imposed upon this Organization-perhaps inevitably imposed-even as  through the Charter  those realities gave the Organization life. With the decisions on the admission of the German States  those articles of bondage have passed into obsolescence and have been denied their capacity to stifle the growth and frustrate the achievement of the objectives of the Organization. This subordination of the past to the principles of the Charter and to the present and future demands of international organization must surely be the real significance of the momentous decision made in that respect.12.	Is it then too much to hope that in thus freeing ourselves from these particular constraints of memory we may have released a greater potential for creativity than has hitherto been manifest? Is it not possible that by this act of realism we may have finally liberated ourselves from the psychological chains of the era  now long past  which moulded tills Organization? The answers are important  for those chains have shackled more than the principle of universality; they have  in important respects  cramped the effectiveness of the United Nations system and stunted the potential of multilateral organization for securing a peaceful  just and habitable planet. There is a pressing need for release from these several restraints as the international community pursues the objectives of the Charter.13.	In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add.l]  the Secretary-General has rendered a notable service to Member States in speaking out with clarity and with courage on these basic issues: on international goals and the effectiveness of the machinery through which we pursue them; on the needs of our human society and the strength and quality of our will to secure them; on the essentiality of reappraisal and the inevitability of fundamental adjustment. We would do well to take heed of the. grave warnings which that report signals. Against the backdrop of widespread public disillusionment and disenchantment with the United Nations  the Secretary- General alerts us to the fact that time is not on our side  that we need action  innovation and determination  no less than thought  criticism and idealism ""if mankind is not to be overtaken once again by the destructive side of human nature"" [A/9001/Add.l  p. I.J He records-and this we all know to be the truth-that some of the mechanism provided in the Charter for achieving the aims of the Organization ""has not proved workable in the rapidly changing world situation""; that in the area of international peace and security ""the United Nations-and especially the Security Council — has often been frustrated""; that on the economic and social side the integrated response required to interrelated contemporary problems ""is often hard to achieve through the international machinery set up for far more limited purposes over a quarter of a century ago""- institutions created in 1945 which ""no longer correspond to current needs""; that these challenges of change will not be met ""through ritual public statements of approval and support"" [ibid.   p. 2} but by a continuous effort of assessment  of adjustment and of development of new machinery and methods; that  above all  there is need for Member States to examine with care and imagination not merely the United Nations system but their own attitudes  their own assumptions  their own goals and their own machinery.14.	These are serious warnings  and this Organization owes it to itself and to the peoples of the world in whose name and for whose welfare it exists to pay them the respect we know they deserve. The Secretary-General has expressed the hope that his observations might provide the basis for constructive debate on the present state of the Organization and some of its problems for future development. My delegation can think of no higher purpose that this general debate could serve than that it should provide a positive response to this invitation and that the dialogue thus begun should carry over into the work of the twenty-eighth session  so that the reality  and not merely the rhetoric  of assessment  of adjustment  of action  of innovation and of constructive development may inform our deliberations and decisions on specific issues.15.	Whether the Assembly will respond thus positively  indeed whether the Assembly will respond at all  to the Secretary-General's call for fundamental reappraisal will depend in large measure on the attitudes of the developed countries-among them many of the founding Members of the Organization-to the basic premise of its existence  namely  the validity of multilateral international organization as the most effective means of ensuring man's survival on a planet that sustains him in an environment of peace. I say ""the developed world""  because it is still the case that for the greater part the developing countries  despite their disappointments with the functioning of the United Nations system  are unequivocal in their commitment both to its objectives and to their attainment through making the Organization more effective.16. But whereas the disillusionment of the third world leads to a resolve to perfect the machinery of the United Nations  the disenchantment of developed Member States- of West and East-tends to lead them away from international organization and in the direction of a world society responsive not to the genuine consensus of mankind but to the dictates of a contemporary  albeit transient  power. There are  indeed  occasions when it is hard to resist the conclusion that some Member States tend to see positive value in a United Nations system that is petrified  quiescent and ineffectual — a facade of international organization  an illusion of international consensus  masking the reality of an operational power structure.1 7. For so long as these tendencies persist  progress along the road which the Secretary-General's report has illumined will be slow and halting. It must  therefore  be a major part of the purpose of the third world to convince the developed States that — although the United Nations is far different today from the organization they envisaged at San Francisco; although international peace and security must now be considered in the context of a world situation far different from that with which they were dealing when the Charter was drawn up; although on the economic and social side such urgent present-day issues as the environment  natural resources  population  outer space and the sea-bed  were but small clouds on the horizon 28 years ago-the realities of contemporary international life do indeed give renewed validity to the concept of international organization.18.	And we must convince them also that it is in the interest of all States — rich and poor  developed and developing  the militarily strong and the defenceless weak  primary producer and industrialized alike-to make the United Nations an effective instrument for reaching by consensus  and implementing by joint resolve  those decisions which are essential for the survival of every State and every man.19.	A General Assembly that has finally consigned to obsolescence the concept of ""enemy States"" must surely be capable-and at what time more propitious than this?  — of an acknowledgement that over a wider area of the structure and working arrangements of the Organization the time has come for a similar accommodation with contemporary reality and for a similar resolve — and for action in implementation of that resolve — not to hamper the effectiveness of the Organization by an attachment to forms and concepts and attitudes that have lost their relevance and validity.20.	What is the alternative to such an accommodation? One consequence of the continued decline of the effectiveness of the Organization must inevitably be an erosion of the support of those who still remain committed to improving its effectiveness in the belief that such improvement is attainable. It is a mistake for any to believe that the United Nations can for long retain credibility and integrity  and . therefore support  while condemned to a state of inertia in important areas of international concern.21.	But  of course  the consequences go well beyond a further decline in support for the Organization. The UnitedNations is the forum  the only forum  in which mankind must seek agreement on the basic arrangements for his continued existence on the planet. Without the United Nations or without a United Nations Organization which is credible and effective — for it amounts to the same thing —  the alternative to international consensus is international confrontation. There are already signs that this is the direction in which we are moving.22.	The developing world can have no a priori interest in a policy of confrontation. That is why at the level of economic justice we kept faith for so long with the International Development Strategy formulated for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] with rolling phrases to redress the several inequities of under-development. That is why we put behind us the disappointment of the First United Nations Development Decade and were ready to renew effort and expectation in the unfolding of the Second. But the developing world cannot live on promises with performance for ever deferred. It must look to its survival.23.	The aspirations and hopes that were centered in the International Development Strategy have been thwarted — in some cases by the plain disinterest  in others by the active pursuit of the vested interests of the developed world. The confrontations of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development have for the third time yielded little. The biennial review of the International Development Strategy now in progress [item-46] has already disclosed that the cause of development has lost momentum  due mainly 10 the failure of the developed countries to honour their commitments under the Strategy. Economic crises  especially in the international monetary system  have reduced still further the limited benefits which have flowed from dwindling aid and shrinking arid uncertain trade. The average rate of economic growth of developing countries has actually declined  and even the modest beginning towards narrowing the gap in living standards between developed and developing countries stipulated in the Strategy is not yet in sight.24.	To what has all this led? It ha:; led  in the first place  to a loss of faith in the International Development Strategy and  because that Strategy is the product of the United Nations system  it has served to diminish the faith of the developing world in. that system itself — certainly in the system as at present organized and operated.25.	Secondly  it has led to the recognition that relation ships between the developed and the developing worlds are not likely to alter significantly within the framework of the present international economic system; that it is not just the case that some nations are rich and others are poor  but that the two conditions are inextricably linked together  that some nations arc rich because others are poor  and that the existing system of economic relations between States serves to perpetuate the imbalance.26.	Thirdly  it has led to an appreciation that an essential mechanism for improving the prospects of real development for the third world is a massive  programme of economic co-operation among developing countries at regional and interregional levels. It was this appreciation that led to the formulation at the Georgetown Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries a year ago of the Action Programme for Economic Co-operation  a programme which has now been further concretized and given a renewed mandate by the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned States recently concluded at Algiers.27.	It will fall to the President of Algeria  President Boumediene  as the Chairman of the Algiers Conference  to convey to this Assembly the over-all results of those consultations. Let me say  however  with respect to this particular matter of economic co-operation between developing countries-since it is one for which Guyana has been entrusted with specific responsibilities by the Algiers Conference-that we will  with the authority of the States members of the movement  be approaching the appropriate institutions of the United Nations system for all necessary assistance in the development of global programmes of action for co-operation between developing countries in the important fields of trade  industry and transport.28.	As this interregional project in its conception and objectives derives from the ideals enshrined in the Charter itself it is clearly right that it should be executed with the support  and within the framework  of the United Nations system  Indeed  given that involvement  its global significance and its potential for improving the conditions of the developing world can help significantly to ensure that this Organization remains relevant and responsive to the needs and aspirations of the greater part of mankind. As the Secretary-General indicated in his remarks to the Algiers Conference  the United Nations has already given assistance in this matter. We look forward  with confidence  to continued support from the Organization in these efforts of collective economic security which have become so necessary a supplement to the faltering International Development Strategy.29.	Finally  the total experience of recent years has brought home to the developing world a lesson which has relevance for all States. It is the lesson of interdependence at two levels: first of all  of interdependence among the various international economic issues-of monetary policy  of trade  of investment  of the environment  of the sea-bed and the ocean floor; and  no less important  the lesson of interdependence among all countries  rich and poor alike  These lessons have been well learned by the developing States  and they have already begun to inform their conduct in the area of international economic relations.30.	If these lessons were to inform also the conduct of the developed States  there is no reason why the United Nations could not become an effective instrument for installing a new and more equitable international economic regime founded on consensus and operated with a perception of man's community of interest.31.	But if these lessons of interdependence  if these concepts of interrelationship  are not acknowledged and respected by the developed world  there is a grave and present danger that we shall move to new levels of confrontation in the area of economic relations  confrontations which will increasingly and inevitably range beyond the scope and competence of the Organization.32.	The world's racial crisis has already advanced to this point not because of a lacuna in the objectives of the United Nations  but because of the failure of Member States  in varying degrees of delinquency  to respect decisions of the Organization and to subordinate a narrow national interest to the more permanent values of human dignity and the self-determination of peoples.33.	The record in the field of disarmament is not dissimilar; and here also concepts of a balance of power  like myths handed on unquestioningly by one generation to another  continue to erode the principles of collective security to which the Charter is wedded  and to contract what should be a dialogue of all men into a dialogue of a self-appointed directorate. Once again  it is in another place  not here in the councils of the world community  that this issue  vital to man's survival  is debated.34.	But as with the cirsis of race and decolonization  so with disarmament. When the debate shifts from the United Nations it enters a no-man's-land where order and legality have no sway and from which there is no return save back to the machinery of international organization. And this is where we are at — if I may use the contemporary idiom to describe the contemporary scene — this is where we are at in the area of international economic relations.35.	It is said that the spirit of detente is at large in the world today. But how pervasive is its presence? How pervasive is its influence? An easing of international tension is always welcome and all mankind is the beneficiary of it. Those who have contrived the present detente have rendered a distinct service to our time. But let us not be unmindful of the reality of its current manifestation. It is not  in fact  little more than a strategic detente which leaves untouched — at this state at any rate — a whole range of festering issues and several levels at which contest and confrontation continue?36.	It is true  also  that within the developed world there is a new thrust towards global consciousness  a sense of the interrelatedness of issues  a perception of the finiteness of the planet  an urgent concern for the preservation of the environment and the world's resources of fuel  of food and of raw materials. But Such insights  alas  are still all too frequently conditioned by the particular interests of the developed world.37.	The result of all this is that the advance of the major Powers to contact and communication has so far issued in only a limited dialogue which excludes the majority of States. Thus the recognition of the interrelatedness of economic issues is reflected in the search for new arrangements for management of the international economic system; but  as in the case of the international monetary system  the new arrangements are devised to operate still in the primary interest of the developed world and pay only token regard to the conditions of other States. Especially significant is the diminished concern for the problems of underdevelopment as the developed world increasingly looks inward. Indeed  it is almost as if the dialogue of detente is crowding the problem of under-development off the agenda of the developed States.38.	The super-Powers must forgive us if we do not seem enthusiastic enough about the detente they have achieved. It is not that we are unmindful of the value of an accord that enables them to speak in unison in this Assembly on those matters that concern them both. It is that we continue to yearn for their support in unison in this Assembly and outside it for those causes that concern our very survival.39.	It is surprising  therefore  that some 60 heads of State or Government were personally assembled in Algiers less than a month before this session of the Assembly commenced  an assemblage never before achieved in the annals of international consultation  including the deliberations of the United Nations itself? And it is to be wondered at that it was to economic issues that these leaders of nearly one half of the world's States gave special attention  and that it was upon action to achieve economic change that they Firmly resolved?40.	The United Nations has no better friends than the States members of the non-aligned movement. To making this Organization more universal and less selective  more democratic and less elitist  more operational and less of an observer  more effective and less frequently frustrated  we are all  and have been always  committed. If this commitment makes us aligned  it is at least an alignment with the deepest purposes of this Organization; it is an alignment with the spirit of the Charter; it is an alignment with the cause of internationalism; it is an alignment that brings strength to the United Nations system  not one which seeks an aggregation of power outside it. That more than one half of the States members of this Organization are so committed should be the occasion for immense satisfaction.41.	If the major Powers are indeed prepared to move from detente among themselves to co-operation among all nations  from coexistence to community  they will be taking a path which the non-aligned have long charted and upon which we have long been waiting to proceed. Our commitment to the goals of co-operation and community is one of the realities with which this journey of all men and all States can begin  and it is one of the best auguries for its success.42.	It is time  therefore  that the developed world should take practical steps to ensure that this commitment is not squandered; and  matching it with a commitment of their own  that it should move with conviction and with a sense of realism and self-interest to enable this Organization to make a reality of co-operation and of community  for this Organization must be the instrument of co-operation and these United Nations must be the embodiment of community.43.	There is  therefore  I submit  no issue before this twenty-eighth session of the Assembly more critical to the future of the United Nations and of international organization generally  or indeed to the survival of the concept of human community  than that which appears on no agenda item but is implicit in each-the issue presented in the Secretary-General's questions: ""What kind of world organization do we need? And what kind of world organization are Governments prepared in reality to accept? "" 44.	These questions are not being asked by the Secretary- General alone. They are being asked outside these walls by the people of the world  who want to see the United Nations the effective instrument of peace  justice and progress that they believed it to be. The demand for a response is every day more clamant. The question can neither be ignored through indifference nor avoided by circumlocution  nor countered by generalities. It is time that within these walls we provide the answers — all of us — in terms that are clear and positive and unequivocal; in terms that are consistent with the spirit  the aims and the mandates of the Charter; above all  in terms 'acceptable to the people of the world — all the world-in whose name this Organization exists.45.	And it is time  within this Assembly  and in the specialized agencies and in our bilateral and multilateral relations generally  that we matched our actions to our answers."
"47",2973,"HND",28,1973,"﻿1.	 On behalf of the people and Government of the Republic of Honduras  I begin my statement by addressing to each of the representatives and those nations they worthily represent a cordial and fraternal greeting. Linked with it is our hope that true success and positive achievements will result from the deliberations of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.2.	Honduras is deeply gratified that a Latin American possessing the competence and ability of Leopoldo Benites has been elected to preside over this world assembly. The great honour conferred on the sister Republic of Ecuador is shared by us  and we promise him the constant co-operation of the delegation of Honduras in his delicate tasks and the heavy duties entrusted to him by the Assembly. We are also glad to express our appreciation to all the representatives of the Governments of the world and in particular of the Latin American group of States for having elected Honduras to one of the vice-presidencies of the General Assembly. This again bespeaks our solidarity with the President of the Assembly in our fraternal commitment to the ideals of the Charter.3.	The formal work of the General Assembly began under the best of auspices. The simultaneous admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic  decided upon at our opening meeting  was an event whose true importance is to enrich and enhance the faith placed in the Organization by all its Members and to nurture the hope of those that are not yet Members that it will perpetuate and increase human welfare and development with universal representation.4.	We are also happy to greet warmly the admission of the independent State of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.5.	May we take this opportunity to stress our good will and our desire that other countries still absent from our midst be admitted soon  and our hope that we shall also very soon see here legitimate representatives of both Koreas  in keeping with their own decisions  as well as of Bangladesh  of the peoples that are fighting in a just struggle for self-determination and recognition as nations and of those that are living the tragedy of domestic division which stands in the way of their occupying the places that Honduras would like to see them occupy. Over and above any ideological differences  we should like to see them here defending their points of view and their ideas as to how we can make the world a better and safer place to live in.6.	My delegation congratulates the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  on the constant dedication and effectiveness with which he has devoted himself to carrying out the heavy responsibilities of his post  as clearly reflected in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add. 1].7.	We are grateful that much progress has been made in the political field through the efforts of the Secretary- General and particularly in the search for peace in areas of conflict. We also take note of the significant progress achieved in the field of human welfare  where a balanced economic development of peoples is sought to serve as an adequate basis for world peace with justice.8.	The United Nations Development Programme has been a most effective instrument of co-operation in our development and planning. Honduras has achieved much thanks to its help  and we place our faith in the future of its action to the benefit of our people. 9.	We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the developed countries which  having become great economic Powers  generously contribute to speeding up the basic programmes that have a bearing on the domestic development of our countries. Our appreciation is all the greater for those countries which  despite their own domestic needs  sacrifice part of their capital to help the peoples which are fighting for their own development. However  we believe that more effective work could be done if the assistance given to achieve the targets were more significant.10.	We in the developing countries depend to a large extent on international co-operation. Yet  our own administration is struggling hard  through effort and sacrifice  to ensure that this circumstance is only temporary.11.	It is no less true that we  the developing countries  are markets that consume large amounts of the industrial output of the developed countries  and at the same time we offer our natural resources as our contribution to their high standard of living.12.	Acceptance of this interdependence  both on the part of the wealthy and on the part of the needy countries  can lead to a just and reasonable understanding that should govern our efforts to achieve an equality that will culminate in the full development of mankind.13.	As far as my nation is concerned  our permanent and dedicated aspiration is to live in peace. We have placed our faith in the constant rule of law and in the action of the international organs of which we are members  primarily the United Nations. And we have done so in the hope that deliberations at the conference tables will increasingly replace confrontations on the battlefield.14.	However  we should recall that in many cases and places the pacifying action of the United Nations  whichis the basic mission of the institution  is limited by factors ranging from the lack of legal instruments of action in the hands of the Organization to simple stubbornness of the parties.15.	Because of these problems  we believe it extremely important to seek the means whereby to strengthen the Organization  to give it more material possibilities of ensuring implementation of its resolutions  to adapt it to the reality of a changing world so that it will continue to be  as it has thus far been  the main beacon of hope of mankind. We believe that this calls imperatively for a revision of the Charter. We understand that such a revision cannot be removed from the realities of the world  and the great Powers should keep their privileges  their actions being so important for mankind in the preservation of peace. However  it is not possible for the Organization to be effective  as we would wish it  unless it is endowed with the powers and instruments to ensure respect for and compliance with its resolutions. We believe this capacity to be extremely important when resolutions are decided by an almost unanimous vote and seek only to ensure the implementation of the principles of the Charter  to which we have all freely subscribed as a norm governing our international conduct  and which at times are hindered by the unilateral decision of a country which breaks its promises. For those reasons  Honduras would support any initiative tending to strengthen the capacity of action of the Organization through a revision of the Charter or through any other adequate machinery.16.	May I inform this Assembly of our views regarding the matter which is uppermost in the minds of our people and Government at this historic moment. I refer to the dispute that since 1969 has existed between Honduras and El Salvador. My delegation is extremely gratified to be able to say that the record of the session held by the Special Commission of the Thirteenth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Latin America  on 20 and 21 August  contained an agreement concerning the procedure for the conclusion of a general peace  friendship and boundary treaty which  taking into account the seven specific resolutions adopted by the Organ of Consultation of the Organization of American States [OAS]  will put an end to all disputes between the two countries.17.	My delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the enlightened Government of Mexico and to our sister Republics of Central America for the continued and devoted attention they have given this problem and for their permanent collaboration in the search for adequate solutions.18.	My delegation reiterates its faith that the negotiations at present taking place in Mexico City will  through the channels of law and justice  be successful and thus return the Central American area to normalcy.19.	From the very beginning of our independent life  our laws have recognized the equality of men irrespective of differences in race  colour or religion. Hence  Honduras offers its support and co-operation to all those who endeavour to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations  particularly those who are dedicated to the eradication of the vile system of apartheid.20.	From the beginning of our independent life  Honduras has also been found among the leaders in the anti-colonialist struggle. It therefore offers its co-operation and support to those peoples which are struggling for their right to govern themselves and to shake off the colonial yoke.21.	My delegation would like very specially to refer to the problem of Gibraltar  a British colony  located on Spanish soil  over which Spain's full sovereignty must be recognized. Honduras entirely shares the arguments adduced by the Minister for External Affairs of Spain  don Laureano Lopez Rodo  when he spoke to this Assembly on the subject [2133rdmeeting]  and we declare our readiness to co-operate in restoring Gibraltar fully to Spanish sovereignty and authority.22.	Of the subjects on the agenda of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly  there are a number which  because of their special importance and the significance which Honduras attaches to them  we feel impelled to mention specifically and make known our views upon them.23.	Mankind is confronted by the fear of extinction if the political forces were  with the instruments of mass destruction available to them  to unleash a new worldwide conflagration. But to this fear is added the fact that we are all victims of the harmful effects of nuclear weapons tests. Therefore  we must add our voice to those of the many countries which have urged the nuclear Powers to find bilateral or multinational understandings likely to end this threat once and for all. With its voice and vote  Honduras will support any initiative to that end. For similar reasons  we shall do likewise with regard to all those initiatives designed to do away with inhuman chemical and bacteriological weapons or to achieve a treaty on general and complete disarmament.24.	As so often before  the General Assembly will continue its examination of the many and complex aspects of the conflict in the Middle East  particularly at this moment when it has become even more acute because of the fresh resort to the use of weapons against man in that region. We believe that this delicate question calls for a clear statement from us to the effect that we are friends of Israel and friends of the Arab countries and that nothing would please us better than to be able to contribute to putting an end to the prolonged conflict. We believe that it is indispensable to strengthen with new instruments the Secretariat so that it can continue its peace-making efforts  and we would be extremely happy if the Security Council itself would hand down an authentic interpretation of the conflicting provisions of its resolution 242 (1967) and thus give new means of action to the Jarring mission.25.	We must clearly and simply state that the policies of Honduras in these matters  both inside and outside the Central American area  are based on principles that we consider inalienable and that we believe should be stressed. Honduras cannot agree to  nor will it ever accept  the acquisition of territory by force or threat. Honduras considers that the dignity of the human person must always be respected  even in cases of belligerency or war. Honduras considers that it is the right of all nations to live in peace  within secure and legally determined borders which accurately mark the limits of it national sovereignty.26.	In this connexion I think I ought to recall that  at the present stage of history  security does not come from mere tactical positions; it might have done so when conventional war defined frontiers  but not when it is the law that must prevail. The security of a frontier  we believe  can flow only from a juridical determination of it and the obligation that all parties respect the existence of such borders.27.	With regard to international terrorism  the entire world is expecting some concrete results from our deliberations. We noted with regret how little was done during the twenty-seventh session on this matter  despite the very obvious concern shown by world public opinion. We understand that it is difficult to reach agreement since there are complex factors hindering a general understanding. To the assessments and definitions of the political terrorism of individuals a counterpart is sought in assessments of the actions of States. But we believe that  while that procedure of analysis is resorted to  little progress can be made. But there are specific aspects on which the views of all Governments are almost unanimous. Cases such as the hijacking of planes  diplomatic security  the unlawful use of the mail and other examples could be tackled outside the context of the general problem and could be the subject of agreement and even lead to treaties that would be a true achievement and a definitive step towards satisfying world aspirations for something to be done by this Organization on these problems that affect us all. The delegation of Honduras would co-operate in the taking of such steps by the Assembly.28.	Finally  my delegation expresses the hope that the deliberations of the General Assembly during the twenty- eighth session  which has begun so successfully under your wise guidance  will  in this delicate historical moment for humanity  lead to concrete steps and resolutions that will stress the lofty principles and postulates of international ethics contained in the Charter  thus giving mankind renewed hopes that man  imbued with the spirit of coexistence and understanding that must always prevail in this hall  will through constant international effort  succeed in making the world a more just and worthy place in which to live."
"48",3044,"HTI",28,1973,"﻿274.	On behalf of the people and the Government of Haiti  it is our privilege to express our sincere congratulations to Mr. Benites on his election to the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are gratified and extremely pleased at the choice by the members of this Assembly because he is not only a statesman who has devoted all the resources of his intelligence to the cause of peace and justice  but also one who is a worthy representative of a sister nation of South America to which the Republic of Haiti is linked by living historical ties dating back to the first quarter of the nineteenth century.275.	We refer to the decisive battle of Pichincha  fought in 1822  in which Haitian volunteers mixed their blood with the blood of the men of Gran Colombia to nourish the tree of liberty on American soil. It is thus a pact of unshakeable friendship and century-old esteem that joins the Haitian people to the people of Ecuador.276.	Is it necessary to recall that it was in the homeland of Eugenio de Santa Cruz y Espejo that the people of Haiti were rewarded for their contribution to the struggles for the emancipation of the American continent? At the time of the historic meeting between Simon Bolivar  the Liberator  and General Jose de San Martin in Guayaquil in 1822  these two heroes exalted the memory of the father of pan-Americanism  Haitian President Alexandre Petion  and awarded to him the title of Precursor of American Liberty.277.	These are all memories dear to the hearts of the Haitian people  who share in the honour paid to the people of Ecuador by your election  Mr. President  to the presidency of this highest international body. All this is a manifestation of the pleasure we feel in wishing you success in guiding the work of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly with the sureness of touch  skill  impartiality and great breadth of spirit that have always marked your actions in directing the foreign policy of your country.278.	The Haitian delegation wishes also to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his tireless devotion to the service of peace. We take this opportunity to repeat to him the trust and esteem of the people and Government of Haiti.279.	May we also welcome into the great family of the United Nations the peoples of the Bahamas and the two Germanys.280.	Relations between Haiti and the Bahamas have always been marked indelibly with the most open friendship — a friendship born of an awareness of the common destiny ofthe brother peoples of the Caribbean region. Thus the Haitian Government enthusiastically welcomed the unanimous decision of the Security Council to recommend to the General Assembly the admission of the Bahamas to the United Nations. The Haitian people pay a tribute to the people of the Bahamas  a people which  thanks to its maturity and lofty sense of its inalienable rights and duties  has succeeded in gaining its independence under the leadership of a man outstanding for his wisdom  his sound judgement and his courage. I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas will be good enough to convey to the people and Government of his country renewed assurances of the' solidarity and fraternity of the people and Government of Haiti.281.	How can we fail with equal warmth and enthusiasm to greet the admission into this Organization of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic  as a symbol of the detente in Europe and throughout the world?282.	The Republic of Haiti is most gratified at the happy outcome of the negotiations conducted by the Federal Republic of Germany for the re-establishment in Central Europe of a system of relationships aimed at reducing antagonisms and opening the way to stability. We are especially pleased at the results obtained  for we ourselves have felt the anguish of a nation divided within itself  within its own borders  a nation at the same time aspiring  beyond all hope  to recover its unity and its place in the concert of nations.283.	The Republic of Haiti and the Federal Republic of Germany in recent years have shown each other an understanding and a mutual sympathy that have been recently reinforced by the signing of agreements on co-operation in technical  economic and financial matters. Thus  as the two States — the Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic — make their entry into the United Nations with a desire to contribute to the Organization the experience of their long history  their science and their technology  the Haitian people is convinced that in a spirit of mutual respect there will be a further strengthening of the ties of friendship that bind us to the German people.284.	Never in the history of the United Nations has a session of the General Assembly begun under more auspicious signs than this twenty-eighth session. The era of acute rivalry between the great Powers and of fierce ideological competition that characterized international relationships is being replaced  it would seem  by an era of progressive convergence of national interests. The discovery that conflict is irrational has been accompanied by a growing awareness of the similarity among productive forces in industrial societies  even those operating under different systems of law. A system of world equilibrium based on economic integration seems to be leading mankind towards the creation of a trans-ideological international community.285.	The trade agreements between Washington and Moscow the direct and frank dialogue between Washington and Peking  the end of the war in Viet-Nam  the establishment of relations between Japan and the People's Republic of China the harmonization of relations among States of Central Europe  new concepts in relations among the American republics together with a strengthening of their economicties — all these mark a decisive turning-point in international relations.286.	We are in fact witnessing a genuine historic change which seems to be bringing to a close a period fraught with human suffering  with crimes beyond measure  with unkept promises  a period in which ideological conflicts darkened the international horizon  spreading anguish and fear; we see a change announcing the gestation of a genuinely planetary policy  the establishment of a community of mankind based on the unity of science  technology and economy.287.	But looking down from this peak  we must not forget the millions of human beings still suffering impoverishment  discrimination and the impossibility of guiding their own destinies  those who are a prey to poverty  hunger  ignorance and disease.288.	It is our fervent hope that this international situation that favours a collaboration making it possible for every country to safeguard its judgement and its faith will extend its beneficial effects to the countries of the third world  which  though only yesterday ideological battlefields  will become the theatre for genuine economic and social development within the context of the unity dictated by the historical destiny of humanity that is finally aware of the solidarity of all men and of all peoples.289.	It is in this context that the Government of His Excellency Mr. Jean-Claude Duvalier  President for Life of the Republic of Haiti  is taking numerous initiatives on the international level and constantly enlarging its activities on the national front to break out of the state of underdevelopment and provide the best possible conditions for the people of Haiti to flourish.290.	In the course of a meeting of the Inter-American Committee of the Alliance for Progress  held in Port-au-Prince during the month of November 1972 and attended by representatives of a number of friendly nations and of international financial institutions such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  the United Nations Development Programme  the Inter-American Development Bank  and others  the national and international experts drew up a five-year plan estimated to cost $US 212 million  divided into annual investments of $US 42 million. The total amount of external financing would reach SUS 154 million  and the Haitian counterpart would be $US 58 million.291.	In accordance with expert forecasts  the Government of Haiti prepared  for the first year of the five-year plan  an investment budget of approximately $37 million. In the budget the Haitian counterpart  which originally was to have been of the order of $11 million  was brought up to $14 million  whereas the annual external financing  which was to have been approximately $30 million  is now only $23 million.292.	Although the capital budget — which was to have been approximately $42 million per year for satisfactory economic development  taking into account demographic growth and the infrastructural work to be carried out  has not yet achieved the desired result  it none the less represents considerable progress in comparison with what wasachieved in the previous year. In point of fact  for the financial year 1972-1973  the investment budget amounted to $29 million and for the present financial year it has gone up to $37 million  that is  a 30 percent increase. The share of external financing grew from $17 million to $23 million  which represents an increase of 34 per cent; and the national effort has increased by 23 per cent  from $11 million to $14 million.293.	Consonant with the philosophy of the Haitian Government  strict austerity measures were promulgated and they have helped to strengthen the investment capacity of the public sector  because the prime objective is and remains to raise continuously the standard of living of the population. The efforts which have been carried out in the economic and financial fields have been accompanied by a number of steps designed to bring about a climate of trust and detente.294.	In order to support and to intensify economic and social development  the President for Life of the Republic has taken a number of judicious political steps. Decrees of clemency and amnesty have brought joy to a number of families and there is a growing climate which favours the return to the country of a number of Haitian experts who were giving their services throughout the world. Furthermore  the Republic of Haiti has once again adhered to the Inter-American Convention of Havana on the Right of Asylum  the Inter-American Convention of Montevideo on Political Asylum  the Inter-American Convention of Caracas on Territorial Asylum and the 1954 Inter-American Convention of Caracas on Diplomatic Asylum.295.	The Duvalier revolution has  we think  now reached a decidedly constructive stage. It calls for patriotism  devotion and intelligence on the part of all the sons of the fatherland to sow the seeds of the new life of Haitian soil  a new life for all  without any sort of distinction.296.	This national effort could not produce the desired results without the active understanding and sympathy of those peoples which have been traditional friends and also of international financial institutions. Hence  President Duvalier has set Haitian diplomacy on the path of dialogue to serve the purposes of an open foreign policy 297.	Together with fruitful contacts with the Governments of the Americas  Western Europe and the Middle East  a new impulse has been given to relations between Haiti and the African States. During May of this year a Haitian goodwill mission visited Senegal  Liberia  the Ivory Coast  the Central African Republic and Chad  Last June  the Republic of Haiti had the privilege of welcoming President William Tolbert of Liberia on an official visit to Port-au-Prince. During those visits the foundation was laid for effective co-operation with those African peoples  to whom the people of Haiti are linked by ethnic and cultural ties and also by the identity of the problems they confront and a common desire for better living conditions.298.	Within the framework of this international policy  based on the ideals of friendship and mutual esteem  we should like particularly to refer to the new agreements which were recently concluded between the Haitian Government and the Government of France. Over and above traditional linguistic and cultural affinities which have taken theform of a language shared in common  the relationships between Haiti and France have taken the concrete form this year of signing two diplomatic instruments of extremely far-reaching consequences  one signed in Paris and the other in Port-au-Prince. Inspired by a feeling of mutual respect  both those instruments are designed to strengthen technical  economic  financial and cultural co-operation between the peoples of Haiti and France  motivated by the same desire for peace and understanding.299.""	Under the general heading of Haitian-American cooperation  a number of infrastructure projects are now being carried out as a result of improved relations between the two oldest republics on the American continent. This co-operation  largely motivated by a policy of good-neighbourliness  is part and parcel of the main priorities of the national economic and social development plan and constitutes considerable support for internal efforts.300.	On the international political scene  a number of problems are still awaiting solutions and require that every member exert himself so that primacy is constantly given to the law and priority is always attached to the well-being of mankind as a whole.301.	At the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm the peoples  through their individual Governments  pledged themselves to carrying out constant supervision of the environment  in order to restrict and to limit any damage to the environment in which man's life goes on. The age-old life cycles of plants  these ""oxygen factories""  and of animals have been gravely disrupted by the development of science  technology and industry. The pollution of the air  the seas and the beaches has created problems which directly affect man's life and his future. The Republic of Haiti has resolved to contribute fully to the new environment body  whose headquarters will be in Nairobi; this shows the desire of the industrialized countries to heed the claims of the third world so that their differing viewpoints can be finally harmonized.302.	The whole world has welcomed the numerous steps taken by the great Powers to create a climate of detente in international relations. However  the slowness of disarmament negotiations still remains one of the major preoccupations of the developing peoples  because control of armaments and general disarmament would be the most telling display of the desire for peace by the Governments concerned and would make available sufficient wealth to guarantee a decent standard of living for all men on earth.303.	At a time when the destructive capacity of nuclear armaments means that any generalized war is tantamount to an act of collective suicide  it is inconceivable that military force can continue to be considered as a factor in foreign policy and that fabulous sums can still be devoted to it.304.	The Haitian Government would like once again to underline the dangers involved in this race for the production of death-dealing weapons and would appeal for common sense among leaders so that a climate of mutual confidence can help to expedite negotiations on disarmament.305.	The situation in Angola  Mozambique  Southern Rhodesia  Namibia and South Africa is an anachronism which could be described  to say the least  as repellent at this time in history when the forces of morality and scientific progress have overturned the age-old myths of racial superiority and exalted human dignity  opening the way to cooperation among all men in a spirit of mutual respect.306.	It is unthinkable that some minorities  swimming against the tide of history  should seek to resuscitate obsolete concepts in order to dominate and exploit others.307.	The Republic of Haiti  forged in the crucible of epic battles in order to proclaim the dignity of man and his inalienable and irrefutable right to liberty  would give a brotherly accolade to the African populations who are struggling for their independence and their dignity  It is our hope that all those oppressed peoples will be heartened and encouraged by the creation of the new independent State of Guinea-Bissau.308.	While in the Middle East a precarious peace prevails which might well at any moment degenerate into armed conflict  despite the efforts and initiatives of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  Mr  Gunnar Jarring  the problem of international terrorism remains one of the most thorny problems at present to be tackled by the General Assembly. The political aspects of the problem  the divergences and the ideological antagonisms make it difficult for a resolution to be adopted which would win the adherence of the vast majority of Member States  but the Government of Haiti considers that efforts should be redoubled. At the same time it should not be forgotten that international terrorism  which destroys innocent human life  is also the fruit of despair  frustration and violations of fundamental human freedoms of men to whom every horizon is closed. The delegation of Haiti is prepared to support any draft resolution covering all these aspects of international terrorism.309.	One of the most important resolutions passed by the twenty-seventh session was probably that by which the General Assembly decided that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea should be convened [resolution 3029 (XXVII)]. That Conference  which will be preceded by preparatory meetings at the end of this year in New York  will provide the countries of the third world with an opportunity to stress the urgent need for a major reformulation of the law of the sea  laying emphasis on the tremendous economic possibilities of the sea-bed. It will also be an opportunity for the littoral countries of the Caribbean to support the wise conclusions reached in the Declaration of Santo Domingo and to stress their rights  as well as the necessity to satisfy those needs which derive from a more fruitful exploitation of the resources of the sea.310.	During the frank and open discussions which have been initiated by the Government of Haiti with other governments in the third world  a single thread can be seen running through the negotiations — that national development efforts can only yield satisfactory results provided that international social justice  effectively respected  gives its indispensable support  International social justice implies that all peoples and nations should be able to exercisepermanent sovereignty over their wealth and their natural resources; that they are entitled to authorize  to restrict or to prohibit prospecting for  exploitation of and disposal of their resources; that they can produce sufficient quantities of the goods and services they need; and that international co-operation  in the form of either public or private investment  exchange of goods or services  of technical assistance or of scientific data should promote the independent national development of the countries of the third world.311.	However  notwithstanding the numerous resolutions adopted by the General Assembly  the Economic and Social Council  UNCTAD and other agencies of the United Nations family  the peoples of the third world continue to have their aspirations to progress frustrated by the growing disparities between the prices for goods and services from the industrialized countries and the prices of natural resources and exports; by tariff barriers and other restrictive trade practices; by the incompatibility of private investment with the goals and priorities of national development plans; by the dangerous intervention of multinational corporations in the political affairs of host countries.312.	Yet the developing countries' claims to international social justice fit within the context of the rules  principles and objectives of the United Nations  to which all Member States have knowingly subscribed and which they have pledged to respect.313.	It would be vain to try to exclude from the main current of history three quarters of mankind so that the super-Powers of the world might conclude among themselves agreements and treaties to bring about international equilibrium in the style of bygone ages. Humanity has irreversibly entered an age when it is essential to take account of the countries of the third world. The economic co-operation now going on between countries with different social and political systems could lead to a satisfactory world order provided that all peoples recognize their humanity and respect fundamental human rights in order to promote the economic and social progress of all nations.314.	Erstwhile subject peoples who have won their independence at the cost of great sacrifice are fully aware that their efforts will only have genuine significance to the extent that their living conditions are improved  that illiteracy is eradicated and other major obstacles which stand in the way of the effective enjoyment of human rights are removed.315.	At the present  the fundamental instruments for development are well known and can be summarized as capital investment of an adequate volume administered by economic and social institutions which have high-quality experts working for them. As long as the United Nations and international financing organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund cannot make these means available to the nations of the third world  they have not yet accomplished their mission.316.	At both the national and the international level  individual successes involve tension and friction. In order that full benefit may be fully drawn from the thaw in international relations which seems to be ushering in a new cycle in history  it is essential  to quote the terms of resolution 2993 (XXVII) adopted by the General Assembly on 15 December 1972: that all armed conflicts involving third parties should be eliminated  along with the final vestiges of colonialism and racism; that all forms of pressure which prevent peoples from exercising their sovereign rights to the free utilization of their natural resources should cease; that there should be an end to all violations of the right of peoples to self-determination; and  finally  that the economic and social rights of nations should become effective.317.	Only under these conditions can international detente lead not to a fresh period of disillusionment  stress  frustration and friction — as it so often did in the past — but rather to an age of international social prosperity. Men will at last be able  in accordance with the spirit of the Charter  to live with one another as good neighbours and to look forward to the future with hope and confidence.318.	The Haitian national revolution  which was based on the ideals of social justice and which has brought the masses out of the age-old isolation to involve them in the affairs of State  has triumphantly stood the test of time. For 16 years  through a policy of austerity and national effort  it has throughout the country carried out important work on the infrastructure  which is so vital to economic growth  while at the same time its social policies have continuously improved the standard of living of the vast majority of the people. An open diplomacy is making it possible for our country daily to strengthen its links of friendship  esteem and co-operation with the peoples and the Governments of the world that  apart from all questions of ideology  share its aspirations to peace and understanding. Now that the question of a review of the Charter of the Organization has arisen  undoubtedly it would be advisable to adapt it better to the changes which have occurred in recent years in international politics  so that it can be more responsive to this deeply-felt aspiration of the peoples of the third world to participate fully in the conquests of science and technology.319.	The Haitian delegation would express the fervent hope that this session of the General Assembly will grasp the meaning of new trends in history in order to bring them into harmony with the requirements of the peoples of the third world and to channel them towards the establishment of true peace in a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among all peoples."
"49",3088,"HUN",28,1973,"﻿1.	I am perfectly aware of the world situation by which we are all deeply impressed in these hours and days of our life. I also know perfectly well that the Security Council of the United Nations is seized of this situation and within a few minutes will hold its meeting.2.	I prepared my speech — if you will excuse me saying so — last week  and when I got the new information regarding the Middle East I wondered whether or not I should change my speech. I decided not to change it because I think that the basic factors of the international situation are the same today as they were a few days ago. But nevertheless I wish to quote Article 51 of the United Nations Charter because the Arab States in the Middle East should be conscious of the measures and of the possibilities contained in that Article:""Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations  until the Security Council has takenmeasures necessary to maintain international peace and security.""3. On the questions and problems of the .Middle East  since 1967 several new decisions have been taken by the Security Council and the General ""Assembly. These resolutions did not make it possible to free the territories occupied by Israeli forces after the 1967 aggression  and since the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council were not strong enough to free the occupied territories and to restore the rights of the Palestinian nation  the Arab States  on the basis of the Charter of the United Nations  and mainly on the basis of Article 51  therefore have every right to make every possible effort to liberate their territories.4.	I am not informed of how the activities in the Middle East were started and what results are being recorded for the time being. But I wanted to emphasize that  under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter  the Arab nations have every right to free their territories by all means at their disposal. And I must add that it is in the records of the United Nations General Assembly that the Hungarian delegation expressed this view several times during previous years. Therefore  it is not the present situation which gave me the idea to quote Article 51 of the Charter.5.	In spite of the present situation  I think that we have the right to speak about the improving international situation. I say ""improving"" because when we speak about improvement in this case we have to compare the actual situation with what could happen — that is to say  against the background of the danger of a thermonuclear war.6.	I think one is justified in saying that in the present world situation there are three main questions that occupy the nations. First  in what sense can we talk about an improvement in the international situation? In what sense are we justified in saying that we are experiencing a detente in the present world situation? Second  are the changes that we are experiencing today in international life lasting changes  or only superficial phenomena? And third  what should we do to make the present world situation more favourable and to secure the good results that we have obtained so far  and what should we do to attain even more favourable results  in the Middle East and all over the world?7.	I have listened very carefully to all the speeches that have been delivered here and have even studied them  and in the knowledge of those speeches I wish to explain the views of the Hungarian Government regarding the present world situation.8.	Hungary is a member of the International Commission of Control and Supervision in Viet-Nam. Therefore I begin with answers to these questions that have arisen through the Viet-Namese situation in particular  and by the situation in Indo-China in general. I do so not only because Hungary is a member of that Commission  but mainly because the situation in Viet-Nam provides the most understandable answer to problems of the world situation that we are experiencing today.9.	What we are now experiencing — and I speak on behalf of a Government that is represented on the Control Commission in Viet-Nam — is a certain illustration of the world situation as a whole  and I think that the statement which was drafted last week was fully justified even by the events in the Middle East today.10.	In co-operation with the other members of the International Commission of Control and Supervision  the Hungarian Government considers it one of the principal tasks of its foreign policy to promote the full enforcement of the cease-fire Agreement  written and signed in Paris on the Viet-Namese question  and its transformation into genuine conditions of peace in Indochina. This is our main task in our international activities and it is no easy one.11.	To that end we have to take into consideration several questions. How was the truce arrived at? What is the function of the International Commission of Control and Supervision and of the participants of the twelve-Power Paris conference? What could be done for a better solution and  finally  what kind of international cooperation  including possible assistance on the part of the United Nations  is necessary to normalize the situation in Viet-Nam and in Indo-China in general?12.	The truce in Viet-Nam was brought about by the four belligerent parties for reasons of their own  and its observance depends on the understanding and cooperation of the four belligerents in the first place.in an illegal state. The full legal conditions of its functioning are still non-existent today. The International Commission of Control and Supervision relies for its existence and functioning upon a single source of law: the Paris Agreement of the four ex-belligerent parties. That is the only source of law  and it provides that the Commission can function only when its four members act together. Owing to the fact that Canada felt justified in withdrawing from the Commission  and that the new member  Iran  was able to replace it only recently  the functioning of the Commission was interrupted for several months.16.	Second  the functioning of the Commission has already been inconsistent with the rules laid down in Paris and  in spite of Iran having taken the place of Canada  this continues to be so for the time being. The fact is that  according to the basic source of law  the Commission can function only together with the Four-Party Joint Military Commission of the signatories to the Paris armistice Agreement  that is to say  in co-operation with the Government of Saigon and the Government of the revolutionary forces of South Viet-Nam. But since  pursuant to the Agreement  the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the United States of America ceased to be members of the Joint Military Commission  the other two signatories  the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam and the Saigon Government of South Viet-Nam  ought to have started co-operating in the framework of a two-party Joint Military Commission. This is a very important point in the situation in South Viet-Nam. This has not yet been done. Consequently  the internal situation in South Vietnam makes impossible the functioning of both the International Commission and its control teams.17.	Third  the failure of the arrival of international assistance is also hampering the realization of the plans of normalization envisaged in the Paris Agreement. That Agreement has three Viet-Namese signatories. It involves three Viet-Nams. One of the three  the Saigon Government  maintains a permanent mission to the United Nations here in New York. But the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam are denied this possibility. This circumstance hampers also the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the normalization of the situation in South Viet-Nam.18.	International assistance is very much needed in Viet-Nam. It is needed in the economic field  of course  but what we have to urge here in the General Assembly of the United Nations is political assistance from international sources for the implementation of the armistice Agreement on Viet-Nam.19.	What are the arrangements of the Paris Agreement that call for international assistance? They are as follows.13.	Both the observance of the truce and its transformation into genuine peace will also in the future depend primarily on the four signatories  but they need international assistance. That is why the four of them together invited the present members of the International Commission of Control and Supervision to take part in the work of the Commission. They invited us. It was for the same reason that  again  the four signatories together proposed the convening of the twelve-Power International Conference on Viet-Nam  held in Paris in January of this year.14.	In the present situation something is wrong both with co-operation among the signatories and with international assistance also. This situation involves serious dangers  and its consequences can be incalculably grave.15.	First  the International Commission of Control and Supervision was paralysed for months; I might say it was1 Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam  signed at Paris on 27 January 1973.20. First  the three Viet-Namese signatories should be given equal treatment internationally. If the Saigon Government is represented here by observers  then the other two signatories should also have such representation here in New York. If for any reason this is not feasible and they cannot obtain the right to be represented here  then in that case the representation of the Saigon Government should be terminated at the Headquarters of the United Nations. I think this is an issue that should be considered also by the International Commission of Control and Supervision in Saigon  and it is the intention of the Hungarian delegation to put some such proposal on the table of the Control Commission. The provisions of the Paris Agreement cannot be enforced in South Viet-Nam if its principles are undermined here in New York in the name of the United Nations.21.	Second  it is clear that for reasons that are well known  the question of Viet-Nam does not fall within the competence of the United Nations because the relations of the Organization with the parties interested in the question of Viet-Nam remain unsettled. The Act of the 12-Power Paris International Conference on Viet-Nam was signed by the participants  as stated in the instrument  ""in the presence of the Secretary-General of the United Nations"". This was preceded by long negotiations in Paris  carried on day and night. Those most directly concerned in this matter saw in this a significant stand in favour of the United Nations. The attitude of the United Nations towards the question of Viet-Nam depends to a great extent on the assistance that Member States of the world Organization can provide in carrying out the plans envisaged in the Paris Agreement. The possibilities for the United Nations depend on this question.22.	Third  we have to insist that the formation of the Two-Party Joint Military Commission in South Vietnam should enable the International Commission of Control and Supervision to function. Taking note of two Governments of South Viet-Nam does not mean creating three Viet-Nams instead of the existing two. Some people think that our proposal has as its end the creation of three Viet-Nams. Our position is as follows. The recognition of two Governments of South Viet-Nam does not mean the setting up of two South Viet-Namese States. The measures necessary for constitutional life will be introduced under the direction of a council which could be created by the two new South Viet-Namese Governments  by the National Council of National Reconciliation and Concord created by the two South Viet-Namese Governments  which will provide the necessary foundation for a genuine constitutional life in South Viet-Nam. The outside help needed for this purpose is to encourage the three Viet-Namese contracting parties to comply with the agreement signed by them in Paris.23.	The world owes much to the Viet-Namese people because in the current international situation  even with knowledge of the news on the Middle East  we are sure that there is a possibility of removing the danger of a new world war. This situation  which is favourable in spite of very threatening news  was prompted and prepared by the victorious activity of the Viet-Namese people. Subsequently  we have to pay a tribute to the VietNamese nation and we have to help the Viet-Namese nation in creating such a situation for itself in which a normal and peaceful life is possible. The Viet-Namese people have made an enormous sacrifice for theattainment of the present world situation. It is now the duty of all peoples and Governments in the world —  whatever their attitude and role may have been during the war in Vie'-Nam — to offer their co-operation in the implementation of the Paris agreements for the sake of the Viet-Namese people and the peace and security of the world at large.24.	As it was by a sharp turn that the possibility of the truce in Viet-Nam became apparent  so did the possibility of detente in Europe arise. In 1969 and in the early part of 1970 it was still inconceivable that representatives of the two German States would sit together in this hall. Later in 1970  on the other hand  the well-known treaties and agreements came about one after another.25.	Since 1969 the countries of Europe have travelled a long  long road towards institutionalizing their peace and co-operation. The second stage of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is now taking place in Geneva. The best advice for its progress is provided by the experience and lessons drawn from the negotiations held thus far. These lessons are the following  culled from the experience of Europe.26.	First  countries of other continents should be kept informed of the state of the European negotiations and intentions concerning international policies. The institutionalizing of European security is in the interests of all other continents in the world. This is so from the economic  political and security points of view alike.27.	Secondly  we in Europe must not forget that there is an interdependence between the problems of Europe and those of other continents. As the settlement of the question of Viet-Nam and the relaxation of tensions in Europe were mutually beneficial  so progress in the work of the European Conference will help to promote the settlement of the Middle East problems and  vice versa  the solution of the Middle East problems will help European States to settle their own problems.28.	Thirdly  persuasion  understanding and compromise have helped us so far to progress in the affairs of detente in Europe. We argued patiently with one another  trying to persuade each other. We came to an understanding wherever it was possible. We accepted compromise solutions where total accord was impossible. Considering the diversity of the participants in the European Conference  their differences in social conditions  historical background  geographical situation and specific interests  there are many questions in Europe to which only compromise solutions will be possible in the future as they were only possible in the past. If some now insist on rigid formulas and wish to force them upon others they will block the way to real progress.29.	Fourthly  progress requires at least a minimum of mutual trust. In the case of such deep-seated contradictions as exist in Europe a minimum of mutual trust there between countries and Governments means mutual realization of the coincidence of essential interests. Any action that disturbs the evolution of such a minimum of confidence can slow down progress. So those who wish toplace talks on the reduction of armaments before political detente are like the peasant who would put the cart before the horse. First we have to proceed with the Conference on co-operation  namely  to lessen political tensions and create a minimum of confidence. Then we can discuss military questions on their merits. Today's balance of military forces in Europe  among other things  explains the state of quiet in Europe. We do not let it be disturbed by ill-considered and ill-conceived actions. Those who perpetuate the remnants of the cold war period — the notorious international radio stations and other propaganda agencies — to serve the purposes of international reactionary organizations while speaking at the European Conference about the free movement of persons and ideas are suspect from the point of view of the creation of mutual trust. The socialist countries took the lead in urging the convening of the European Conference  in stepping up tourism and in pressing for East-West co-operation in the scientific  artistic and cultural fields alike. We think that what is most essential to the strengthening of confidence is to increase industrial co-operation between East and West  in Europe and all over the world. The experience of history shows that commercial ties can go with the wind if international relations become tense and peoples are separated by conflicts. But industrial co-operation — co-operation in production and in general joint production schemes —  can better withstand and resist the adversities of the tensions of the international political situation.30.	It is probably correct to refer to the world situation by saying that either a series of security systems will be created in various continents  or that the life of our generation will be plunged into a thermonuclear catastrophe. The idea of such a plan has emerged recently particularly in connexion with Asia. Taking into consideration all that is now happening in Asia and in the Middle East  including the growth of the international importance of certain nations in Asia and including Siberia  Mongolia  the two Koreas  China  Indo-China and so on  it can be supposed that the coming years will provide an opportunity for the preparation of an Asian security conference.31.	At first there was much opposition to such an idea in Europe also  but finally the situation in Europe became ripe for the idea to be put into practice. The idea may still seem illusory today to many in Asia but the peoples of Asia  singly and collectively  may soon become aware that they can profit by the bilateral and then the multilateral talks on the preparation of an Asian conference on co-operation. There are already favourable signs which appeared after the war in Viet-Nam and the war on the Indian subcontinent. According to all indications  India  Bangladesh and Pakistan are coming near to a solution of their common problems. We hope Bangladesh will soon see the obstacles removed and be free to join in the work of the United Nations. New possibilities can be explored by the negotiations between representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Seoul authorities.32.	Japan can play a very important part especially on the Pacific coast of Asia  in improving international relations. Japan is the only country in the world that hasalready been given a taste of the destructive force of atomic war. With the very fast development of Japanese industry and of the Japanese standard of living  Japan has become extremely sensitive to changes in international relations. Japan is interested in detente and can see that rising tensions are harmful — and may become more so. For this reason there is every justification for looking forward to increasing participation by Japan in international activities.33.	It is the Middle East that gives the least clear evidence of any change for the better in international relations. Nevertheless — and in spite of recent happenings — there are indications that a period of change may be opening up — and perhaps the present series of events in the Middle East may contribute to such a new era. You may remember what we heard last year in the General Assembly regarding Viet-Nam and Europe — in much the same way as we are now hearing what is going on — when by a sudden turn the adversaries came to see the necessity of co-operation. A similar situation may come to pass in the Middle East also within a few weeks or a few years.34.	What are the indications of finding a solution in the Middle East? They include  first  the unity and the cooperation of the Arab Governments are improving — and this is a very important factor in the Middle East; secondly  the unrealistic policy of the Government of Israel becomes more and more isolated and is clashing with world opinion. The Assembly knows how many times warnings have been expressed in this United Nations building asking the Government of Israel to pay heed to Security Council resolution 242 (1967) — but these proposals were never accepted. We hope that that resolution will be accepted by all who are directly interested in the Middle East.35.	In the matter of detente or no detente the United Nations has good reason to devote special attention to the growth of the international importance of the non-aligned countries  particularly now  a few weeks after the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries that was held in Algiers.36.	President Boumediene of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria  as host of the Conference  in his appraisal of that historic event declared: ""The veritable atomic bomb consists of the thousands of millions of the peoples of the third world"". Political declarations like this have to be understood and explained in general as the speaker has meant those expressions. It is clear that President Boumediene has meant to liken the strength of the non-aligned countries not to the destructive and devastating force of the atomic weapon  but to a force effective against the danger of any new war.37.	The role of the non-aligned countries is indeed of immense historical importance from the point of view of international peace and security. As up to now these nations have had a great part to play in changing the international relations  for in the future they will play a still greater role in improving international contacts. The vast majority of the non-aligned countries consists of those nations which  after tens or hundreds of years of colonial oppression and exploitation  have wonindependence in the past 10 to 20 years. The appearance o these countries in international life was of great importance and it was of great help in liquidating the cold war and in improving international understanding. These countries have changed the international atmosphere  among other things  by helping here in the United Nations  and outside it  to divert attention from invented problems of the cold war and to concentrate on really fundamental problems of contemporary humanity.38.	The participants of this large-scale Conference in Algiers dealt with every essential question of international life. The Hungarian Government followed the Conference with great attention. It is reasonable that at this year's session of the General Assembly of the United Nations  this Conference  its purport and importance  should be recalled not only by those who attended it  but also by those who are attentive observers of the manifestations of the Conference and their international repercussions. All burning questions of our day  from the liquidation of the vestiges of colonialism to the new problems of the law of the sea  were under consideration and discussion either in the framework of the general debate of the Conference  or in its commissions  or in its resolutions  or in the interventions of heads of State.39.	There were some who described the Conference as the peoples' coming of age. Those peoples of full age gave forth a sensitive response to the events in Chile. It is very interesting to know what had been said in Algiers regarding the problems of Chile. The Foreign Minister of Chile had taken part in the preparation of the Conference  but President Allende was no longer in a position to leave his country because  conscious of his responsibility  he wanted to meet the impending challenge and attack of the plotters. News of the murderous attempt against Allende in Chile reached Algiers in the closing hours of the Conference. The international reception of the events in Chile was well described by the 12 September issue of the Algiers daily EI Moudjahid  which in its summary of the results of the conference in Algiers wrote this about the Chilean tragedy:""A few days ago 2 000 million people  through their representatives  sent from Algiers their greetings to the Chilean people struggling for its future. The third world  assembled in our capital  in Algiers  welcomed the victories won by that Andean people under President Allende's leadership. At the same time it expressed its anxiety about the intrigues plotted by outside forces against this original experiment aimed at the liberation of man. A few days after this message of solidarity had been issued  bombs were dropped on La Moneda Palace and President Allende is dead.""40.	Since that time we know how much of the tragedy of the nation of Chile has been experienced. I have to salute the President of the present session of the United Nations and the Secretary-General for having felt the need to intervene in Santiago  Chile  concerning the fate of many patriots of the Chilean nation. It is in this international atmosphere that the Chilean people has to suffer from the chaos produced by the assassinations. Since the functioning of its diplomatic mission in Chile had beenmade impossible  the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic decided to suspend Hungarian-Chilean diplomatic relations. For the first time in the history of mankind  the countries of Latin America are now truly taking part in the moulding of international policies concerning the destiny of the whole world. The people of Chile cannot be debarred from this either. Time and the development of international relations work  and will work  for the triumph of Chile's democratic traditions.41.	In Algiers the representatives of the non-aligned countries decided to hold their next conference at Colombo  Sri Lanka  in 1976. It is conceivable that by the time of the Colombo conference considerable progress will have been made  with the assistance of the United Nations  both in the liquidation of the vestiges of colonialism and in the settlement of the economic problems of the world.42.	And we hope that you  Mr. President  will be happy to greet the next conference of the third world in your native land.43.	At the current session of the General Assembly great attention has been aroused by the proposal of the Soviet Union [A/9191]. That proposal is really worthy of considerate attention because  if carried out correctly and with good will  it may give rise to favourable new occurrences in the fields of disarmament  economic development and international political co-operation.44.	I begin with the political effect of the Soviet proposal. The proposed joint action of the five permanent members of the Security Council may create better conditions for the co-operation of the five nuclear States in checking the armaments race. If the five great Powers can come to an agreement on the principles of a collective reduction of their military budgets  the political effect of such a step would be of paramount importance for the handling of the questions of disarmament  the continued improvement of international relations  and the consolidation of truly peaceful conditions in international life.45.	At present  disarmament negotiations take place in three different forms: first  on a bilateral basis between the Soviet Union and the United States; second  at the well-known Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva; third  in the framework of the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. In all three cases it is a serious problem that all five great Powers are not united in understanding the purpose of those negotiations.46.	If it now proves possible to take a step forward  the co-operation of the five nuclear States would not only promote these three kinds of negotiations but also facilitate the convening of a world disarmament conference. A conference of this kind held in earlier years  in which the States then Members of the United Nations participated  gave impetus to a more active handling of the questions of disarmament. That is how the Geneva Committee on Disarmament came into being. Now that great progress has been made in theuniversalization of the United Nations  a disarmament conference of all States Members of the United Nations could bring forth new ideas about more efficient forms of dealing with disarmament problems. Such an agreement between the five great Powers may also greatly promote the improvement of the political atmosphere by increasing the confidence of small States that such cooperation is possible.47.	The economic consequences would  of course  only gradually appear: first  to the extent that the five nuclear States come closer together; then to the extent that other countries follow the example of those five members of the Security Council. But the proposal shows by itself that as international political tensions are lessening  so it becomes possible to contemplate releasing the resources absorbed by armaments  resolving burning international economic problems  and tackling questions involving the very subsistence of the human race.48.	A question of fundamental importance is whether the detente of our days is a lasting one or only temporary. If it is temporary  then it is time to prepare for new conflicts  as is being done in the Middle East. We in the Hungarian Government  mindful of the basic factors underlying the present international situation  and keeping them in the background of all present-day events  are of the opinion that we may prepare for a lasting improvement in the international situation  including the situation in the Middle East. The durability of detente is demonstrated  as a matter of fact  in this debate  and even in the debate regarding Middle East problems. There were only a few statements here that did not reflect the real intention of improving international relations. I wish to mention only one of those speeches  mainly because I think we may draw some very positive conclusions from the content of those negative speeches.49.	As the Chinese proverb goes  ""There is a good side to every bad thing"". The Chairman of the Chinese delegation  in his statement [2137th meeting]  did .not make a single proposal for actually improving the international situation  for the development of cooperation between countries  or for the solution of problems of the developing world. He disparaged everything that can today be called an improvement — for example  if someone looks at the world situation in a human manner. He has extolled everything that is bad in the world situation today; finally  he demanded that the United Nations be made more effective  stating at the same time that the years since the restoration of the rights of China in the United Nations have brought great disappointment to the People's Republic of China.50.	The Hungarian People's Republic is one. of those Member States of the United Nations which for years and years have consistently argued here in this hall and in several committee rooms of the United Nations against enforcement of the unjust resolutions adopted against China by United Nations bodies. We were always with China in this respect. It is strange that now it is that very same China that indiscriminately demands the enforcement of United Nations resolutions. I think that the representative of China should read the resolutionswhich the United Nations passed against China. As a member of the Security Council  the delegation of China  making use of the right of veto  has up to now prevented the admission of Bangladesh to the United Nations. Yet here  in the General Assembly  it advocates the revision of the Charter which also granted the right of veto to China. These last few years have been a disappointment to many  especially because one of the permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations  during the years of its membership  has put forward in this Organization not a single constructive idea or proposal  only intrigues. The United Nations records bear evidence of this fact for anybody to read. They also show that the Hungarian delegation has always joined forces with the countries which made every effort to restore to China its rights in the United Nations. Those efforts have been crowned with success. The delegation of the People s Republic of China is present in the United Nations. Despite bitter experience we do not regret what we did here for the sake of the People's Republic of China. It was justified because we feel sure that the bitter experience of the past few years will prove to have been a passing phenomenon and that China will be a constructive Member of the United Nations.51.	Besides  the current improvement of the general international climate is usually disparaged by those who have contributed nothing towards it and who hold the naive belief that they will benefit by international tensions. Such negative manifestations against the improvement of international relations cannot effectively influence the work of the General Assembly — that is the good side to this bad thing. Hopes for an improvement in the world situation — in the Middle East  in Asia  in Latin America and in Europe — are so strong and overriding that such antiquated ideas are passed over by the General Assembly.52.	There are weighty reasons why I am speaking in such a way. International relations today are such  and the consequences of armed conflicts are so disastrous  that all countries  regardless of their social systems  are equally interested in an amelioration of the situation leading to international co-operation. Of course  this realization can only gradually come about and many obstacles have to be removed beforehand.53.	No doubt the first to come to that realization was the Soviet Union. I could cite also many other examples from the history of the Soviet Union and the socialist countries  but since it was the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1971 that gave the most comprehensive summary of the steps to be taken in the present state of world affairs  I shall refer to that in the first place. Although this reflects the position of a Party Congress  very many countries today  regardless of their social systems  endorse the programme of peace formulated by it. It is clear from that Soviet programme of peace that the Soviet Union  despite all difficulties  wishes consistently to improve its relations with all countries and to. offer its international cooperation in the definitive elimination of the danger of thermonuclear war.54.	With new initiatives in its foreign policy  the United States has accepted also  as a programme point  that after the confrontations it must embark on consultation.55.	France has played an historic role in the realization that after the cold war following the Second World War  a period of co-operation must emerge for independent countries with different systems. The slogan a ""European Europe"" was a French definition  and was the expression of a new historic necessity in Europe.56.	If the United Kingdom could stop raising problems concerning the ""smaller Europe"" and pay attention to European Europe  and to the most important questions in international life today  it would be beneficial not only to the United Kingdom but to all of us.57.	Now for the first time the Chinese people live in a united national State. It is only a matter of time before Taiwan will also find a way to settle its relationship with the mother country. The requirements for the advancement and prosperity of the great masses of the people of China also make the People's Republic of China interested in easier international relations.58.	That is what I wish to say with regard to the five permanent members of the Security Council  on the one hand  because their co-operation is decisive for the future of the United Nations  and on the other  because I spoke earlier about the relevant interests of the two German States  India  Japan and other countries.59.	The Hungarian Government believes that despite all difficulties and obstacles  the current movement for improving international relations will continue. That movement has been brought about by such fundamental causes as will help us to co-operate successfully in making the improvement in the international situation a lasting one.60.	Great tasks lie ahead of the United Nations. Expectation is growing in connexion with the increased efficiency of the United Nations. This hope is encouraged by the admission of new Members  first of all the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. If it proves possible to rectify the mistakes committed earlier in the name of the United Nations  as is expected in the case of Korea and Indo-China  then the United Nations will have greater possibilities in the Far East. There is a growing desire to make better use of the possibilities opened by the existence of the United Nations for the settlement of international issues.61.	Finnish-Hungarian talks were held recently between representatives of two nations having many things in common in their heritage and their history but with different social systems today. At the invitation of President Urho Kekkonen of the Republic of Finland  the First Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party  Janos Kadar  paid a visit to Finland. The joint declaration of the two statesmen on international questions had this to say about the United Nations:""Both sides consider it necessary to promote the fullimplementation of the principles laid down in theUnited Nations Charter and to support the world Organization in the just settlement of international problems.""It is a statement of two representatives of two States Members of the United Nations having different social systems.62.	The Hungarian People's Republic  together with other States Members of the United Nations  is interested in the relaxation of international tensions  in the solution of problems in the Middle East and in the strengthening of peace and security. For those very reasons  we take part  both within and outside the United Nations  in every international action which promises to improve international relations  to make what is called detente a genuine and irreversible relaxation of tensions and a real solution  by negotiation  of controversial issues."
"50",3135,"IDN",28,1973,"﻿31.	It is my privilege and pleasure to extend to you  Sir  on behalf of the Indonesian delegation  our most sincere congratulations on your election as President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are all aware of your competence and vast experience in international affairs  and my delegation is fully confident that under your guidance this Assembly will be able to conclude its work successfully.32.	It is a matter of particular poignancy to me to acclaim the elevation of a distinguished son of Latin America to this high office at a time when turmoil and tragedy have again struck part of the continent he represents. The world has been shocked by the untimely death of President Allende of Chile. While my delegation feels that it should not pass judgement on what is essentially the internal affair of a friendly country  we sincerely hope that the Chilean people may soon see the restoration of national harmony and stability in their country so that they may be enabled to continue efforts to achieve progress  prosperity and social justice.33.	I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on their admission to our Organization. My delegation welcomes their entry into our midst as an event of great significance for the realization of the principle of true universality of membership of the United Nations.34.	This event also symbolizes the success of the process of normalization of relations in Europe  which we hope will further stimulate efforts towards easing international tensions. My delegation would like to pay a tribute to the far-sighted and courageous statesmanship that has succeeded in putting aside past enmity and distrust and opening the way to a new era of dialogue and peaceful co-operation in Europe.35.	The admission of the two German States to the United Nations may set an example for other divided countries  if and when the peoples concerned agree to undertake a similar step.36.	My delegation would  further  like to extend a warm welcome to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  a sister archipelagic State  on its admission to the United Nations. I am confident that the commitment of the Bahamas to peace and peaceful development on the basis of the principles of the Charter will contribute to the efficacy of our Organization. We look forward to fruitful co-operation with the Bahamas in the United Nations and all its bodies.37.	My delegation would like to thank the Secretary- General for the excellent report on the work of our Organization. We wish to underline his statement that ""an institution works and develops only if there exists among its members the political will to make it work and develop"" [A/9001/Add.1  p. 15}. If today we face the sobering reality of the increasing ineffectiveness of the United Nations role in world politics  if the failures of the UnitedNations seem to overshadow its achievements  it is time for us to recognize that it is not so much the failures and shortcomings of the Organization itself that are to be blamed as we ourselves  the constituent sovereign States. It is high time that all of us  all the 135 Members of the United Nations  instead of criticizing the Organization and everyone else  exercised the wisdom of introspection and self-criticism.38.	My delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-General for the reference he has made in the introduction to his report to the importance of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State and Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in' Algiers on the eve of the present session of the Assembly. No one can deny the contributions of the non-aligned movement towards the reduction of international tensions and the establishment of a more peaceful world.39.	My delegation is convinced that in the days to come non-alignment will play an even more significant role than it has in the past  as the movement addresses itself  with growing maturity and sense of purpose  to the realistic solution of the great problems faced by all nations.40.	Like others in this Assembly  Indonesia welcomes the detente. We hope  however  that its blessings will be felt not only in Europe  where the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has started its laudable efforts to end the post-war era of cold-war strife and to organize a new structure of peaceful coexistence and co-operation on the continent; its positive and beneficial influence must spread to other parts of the world also. We hope that detente will usher in a new international climate in which the solution of problems such as the Middle East and Indo-China may become less intractable. We expect that it may accelerate efforts to end the existence of illegal minority regimes and eliminate the remnants of colonialism  eradicate apartheid and racialism and contribute decisively to the success of the Second United Nations Development Decade. We also hope that the atmosphere of detente will not encourage the apparent tendency of big Powers to bypass the United Nations in efforts to find solutions for international problems affecting the entire world community.41.	On the issue of disarmament  my delegation feels that progress has been painfully slow despite the vital interests that are at stake for all mankind. However  prospects for an abatement of the arms race are not entirely without promise. The recent agreements reached between the United States and the USSR on the limitation of strategic arms  although still limited in scope  deserve our commendation.42.	The resolution adopted by the General Assembly in 1971 concerning a future world disarmament conference [resolution 2833 (XXVI)) increases our hopes regarding the prospects of general and complete disarmament. My delegation notes with regret  however  that the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference  set up under General Assembly resolution 2930 (XXVII)  has not been able to start its work because some of the nuclear Powers — whose participation is most important for the success of the Committee's work — are not yet prepared to associate themselves with its activities.43.	Allow me now to deal briefly with the problem of the Middle East  a problem for which the United Nations has shown profound concern and to which it has devoted —  though as yet in vain — considerable time and effort in the search for a just solution  satisfactory to all parties concerned. My delegation wishes to reaffirm its full support for the just struggle of the Palestinian people to secure their inalienable rights and the efforts of the Arab countries to bring about the withdrawal of Israel from all the territories it is now occupying as a result of the 1967 war.44.	While we continue to believe that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) remains the realistic basis for a solution of the Middle East problem  new avenues should be explored in order that continued efforts by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to implement that resolution may have a chance of achieving concrete results. At the same time  my delegation realizes that the search for a solution of the Middle East problem will be enormously facilitated if the big Powers are prepared to co-operate and make their positive contribution.45.	The past year has witnessed further progress in the process of decolonization. As I have noted  the Commonwealth of the Bahamas has attained independence since we last met  while the Territory of Papua-New Guinea will shortly be self-governing  with full independence to be attained not later than in 1975. Though we may rejoice at these advances  the situation elsewhere  particularly in southern Africa  gives us little reason to expect that the provisions of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)] will soon be implemented there. On the contrary  we must in candour admit that the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council condemning the racist and colonialist policies of the Portuguese and South African Governments and the illegal Smith regime have remained largely ignored.46.	Recent events have again demonstrated the stubborn refusal of those regimes to desist from their condemnable policies and practices. Increased repression in the Portuguese-administered Territories of Guinea-Bissau  Cape Verde  Mozambique and Angola  mass reprisals in Rhodesia  dissolution of the territorial integrity of Namibia and the recent killings at Carletonville in South Africa continue to defy the conscience of the world community. The persistent denial to the vast majority of the people in those Territories of their most elementary rights has created a situation fraught with the gravest danger to the peace of the continent and of the world. The United Nations must not slacken its efforts to take effective steps to enable the people of Africa to exercise the right of self-determination and to attain their fundamental rights to independence and human dignity.47.	While on the subject of the struggle for national independence  allow me to touch briefly on the question of national liberation movements and wars of independence. As a nation born out of a war of independence  Indonesia has supported and will continue to support to the maximum of its capacities all national liberation movements against colonial oppressors everywhere in the world. We must  however  never allow the concept of wars ofliberation to be used as a device to instigate or to perpetuate civil war in an independent and sovereign country or  worse  to sanction with it the interference by foreign Powers in the internal affairs of another country. If we were ever to allow this to happen not only would we violate one of the basic principles of the Charter  that of non-interference  but this might also pose a serious threat to the territorial integrity  national unity and sovereignty of the majority of countries gathered here in this Assembly.48.	Although a formal end to war has come to Viet-Nam  actual peace still remains elusive. When we consider the recent developments in Viet-Nam it is important for us to be guided by the overriding objective of creating conditions that would make real peace possible in Viet-Nam. As manifested by the Paris agreements the Viet-Namese parties to the conflict  as well as the big Powers involved  have shown a community of interest in accepting the road of peaceful settlement rather than continuing war. In the actual implementation of the accords  however — which has been far from satisfactory — real peace can come about only if the political will on the part of those directly involved is there.49.	Indonesia's acceptance of membership in the International Commission of Control and Supervision and our formal endorsement of the Paris agreements on Viet-Nam require that we act as impartially as possible in the implementation of the terms of those agreements and in our relations with all parties to the conflict. We cannot  therefore  act in any manner that would appear not to take into account these considerations  or the ongoing process towards finding just and lasting peace in Viet-Nam. To do so would mean prejudging that process and could be interpreted as interference in the internal affairs of others.50.	The tragic events in Cambodia revolve  in our view  primarily around the question of contending national leaderships  further compounded by foreign interference and conflicting major-Power interests. It is hoped that a peaceful solution to the Khmer problem will be brought about through negotiations among the parties concerned. In* the final analysis it is for the Khmer people themselves to decide on the leadership they want and the system of government under which they choose to live. Therefore my delegation is of the view that we should not take any action which might prejudge the decision of the Khmer people themselves and might prolong the tragic suffering and loss of life and property in Cambodia.51.	We welcome the Vientiane Agreement  recently concluded between the Laotian parties. We hope that that agreement will indeed mean an end to the fighting in Laos and that the Laotian people will be able to start rebuilding their country which for so long has been ravaged by war.52.	The Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace was adopted by the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly [resolution 2832 (XXV!}] and in the course of the twenty-seventh session an Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean  consisting of 15 members  was established to consider the implications of the Declaration[resolution 2992 (XXVII)}. Given the differences of interests between the many countries  the littoral and hinterland States  the major maritime and naval Powers  the task of the Committee is undoubtedly difficult. As the successful implementation of the Declaration would strengthen the conditions of peace  security and co-operation in this important region of the world  the Ad Hoc Committee deserves our fullest support and co-operation in the discharge of its task.53.	It is the concern which the countries of South-East Asia have for peace and security in their region that has prompted the Philippines  Thailand  Singapore and Indonesia to support the proposal of Malaysia for the neutralization of South-East Asia. The concept of South-East Asia as a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality  as embodied in the Kuala Lumpur Declaration   recognizes the legitimate interests of all Powers concerned in the region and the necessity to undertake efforts to harmonize those interests in order to enable the peoples of the region to create conditions for peaceful developments.54.	It is increasingly obvious that in the very near future international peace and security will be affected by the manner in which the international community faces and solves the intricate problems of the law of the sea. The forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea will be burdened with the heavy responsibility of trying to accommodate differences and conflicts of national interests created by outdated rules of the law of the sea or by the existence of legal vacuums. It is hoped that the Conference will be able to create new rules of the law of the sea that will not only guarantee the sound management and equitable distribution of the oceans' wealth but also respect the economic interests  national sovereignty  political unity and territorial integrity of coastal States. To realize those expectations it is imperative that in formulating new rules of the law of the sea the Conference should take due regard of the vital and just interests of Member States deriving from their special geographical circumstances. A realistic and pragmatic approach in dealing with the complex problems of the law of the sea is very much needed. Any new rules of the law of the sea will surely lack effectiveness if they do not take into account the physical  economic and political realities faced by Member States.55.	Our preoccupation with the problems I have just mentioned should not prevent us from giving our urgent attention also to a range of other equally important and fundamental problems in the economic  social and humanitarian fields  which may perhaps require even greater concentration and intensity of efforts. The population explosion  mass poverty  the growing threat of world famine  the destruction of human ecology are in my view some of the major issues which will determine man's very capacity to survive in the decades to come.56.	The food crisis that is at present being faced by the world as the result of grain shortages everywhere is becoming an acute problem not only for the developing countries  where food shortages caused by floods  droughts and crop failures are already chronic phenomena  but also for the rich and developed countries. Unless the international community gives this problem the attention commensurate with the seriousness of its implications the world may soon be faced by an unprecedented challenge to its very peace and security.57.	Another problem that has lately assumed alarming proportions  affecting nations in all regions of the world  is that of narcotics and illegal drug trafficking  especially in connexion with the youth of the world. The widespread use of drugs among young people and the related question of juvenile delinquency clearly strike at the very roots of our common efforts at nation-building. Let us therefore join hands in a common cause to eradicate this scourge and lend our full co-operation to all international agencies concerned with the problem.58.	The question of external development assistance and private foreign investments also deserves our thoughtful security. It is undeniably true that the economic development of a nation should remain the primary responsibility of that nation itself and that co-operation with outside interests should respect the principles of national sovereignty  including permanent sovereignty over natural resources. It has also become clear  however  that foreign assistance and investment  in the form of transfer of capital  technology and modern skills from the developed to the developing countries  if handled properly and with the necessary safeguards  can be useful in accelerating the process of national development. For such external assistance and investment to remain effective and to the mutual benefit of all concerned  we must see to it that such assistance only supplements  and in no way supplants  the national effort. Furthermore  the foreign investor must be able to reconcile his interests with the national development goals of the host country.59.	Closely related to the question of foreign investment is the emergence of multinational or transnational corporations as a new dynamic factor in the world economy which poses a dilemma to most developing countries. The relevance here seems to be that their size  flexibility and financial capacities often place multinational corporations in too powerful a bargaining position vis-à-vis the developing country  thus posing a real threat to its national sovereignty. Here again the problem is not simply one of outright rejection but rather of the need for world-wide regulation of rights and responsibilities for the common benefit and justice for all concerned. We look forward to the results of the deliberations of the United Nations Group of Eminent Persons to Study the Impact of Multinational Corporations on Development and on International Relations.60.	Another development which I should like to mention is the growing trend towards larger economic groupings among the developed countries and the concentration of trading strength in a number of agglomerations of economic power. While we can understand the advantages of such greater economic integration  we are equally concerned about the adverse repercussions it might have on the interests of developing countries. Whether or not such groupings and agglomerations will prove on balance to be ""trade creating"" rather than ""trade diverting"" will depend on the interplay of various factors  the net impact of which is difficult to predict.761.	As a response to that development  countries in the developing world  joined together into regional or sub- regional groupings  have taken steps to cope with its negative aspects. In South-East Asia the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] has initially formed associations of producers of primary products to maintain its competitive position in world markets and has lately gone further in strengthening economic interdependence in two directions.62.	First  ASEAN has taken preparatory steps towards the creation of its own regional market. Studies have been undertaken on a number of projects with a view to rationalizing investment decisions within the regional market formed by the member countries. This is a beginning of a common industrialization programme which can be initiated in the region.63.	Secondly  since June of last year ASEAN has established and institutionalized a dialogue on a continuing basis with the European Economic Community. That marked a significant step forward for ASEAN because it was the beginning of the forging of a common position in negotiations with a major trading partner. The Association is of necessity outward-looking by virtue of the economic and social structures of the member countries and  their geographical location. It intends to keep an open mind in maintaining and improving its relations with centres of economic power  but it rejects schemes which would make South-East Asia nothing more than a mere producer and supplier of raw materials operating under conditions of distorted power relationships with the industrialized countries and of continued singular decline in its terms of trade with them.64.	Other recent developments in the economic and monetary fields continue to give us cause for deep concern. The recurrent international monetary crisis indicates that the world economy is still faced with considerable uncertainties which badly affect  in particular  the development efforts of the developing countries. These crises have caused further deterioration in the already precarious position of the developing countries. Despite determined efforts to improve their lot  we continue to witness the ever widening prosperity and welfare gap between the developed and the developing countries.65.	The United Nations proclaimed the 1970s to be the Second Development Decade  and the International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)J was adopted to guide the nations of the world in co-operating in their development efforts. Yet an over-all view of the performance over the first two years of the Strategy clearly indicates that we are nowhere nearer our goal of creating conditions of peaceful well-being that would ensure a standard of living compatible with human dignity for the larger part of mankind living in the developing countries.66.	The key targets of the Strategy  crucial to its goals and objectives  have not been realized. This has led the Committee for Development Planning to conclude that the International Development Strategy remains much more a wish than a policy.67.	It is  however  enlightening to note the growing awareness that continuing inequalities in the international distribution of wealth are morally unacceptable and materially incompatible with world peace and security. The problem which has now assumed urgent relevance is how to evolve the right relationship between developed and developing countries  conducive to the progressive elimination of these inequalities through a more rapid development in the developing countries.68.	It is in the context of evolving such a new international relationship that we have to view the practical significance of two important and interrelated negotiations  namely  the multilateral trade negotiations and the negotiations on international monetary reform. The results of these two negotiations should  in our view  be assessed on the basis of their respective contributions to the building of a better and more equal pattern of international distribution of wealth and to the acceleration of the development process in the developing world.69.	The multilateral trade negotiations will be conducted within the basic framework of the Tokyo Declaration which was recently adopted by the ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Tokyo. While these trade negotiations are rightly aimed  as the Declaration states  at ""the expansion and ever greater liberalization of world trade through the progressive dismantling of obstacles of trade""  I should like to emphasize that our final goal is to raise the standard of living and welfare of the people of the world  particularly the people of the developing countries. It is the living standards in those countries that urgently need to be raised progressively  since most of their people are still living at a very low subsistence level. It is  therefore  imperative that any preferential treatment to be accorded to them be on a non-reciprocal basis.70.	The same is true with the negotiations on international monetary reform. The new international monetary system  to be negotiated on the basis of the work of the International Monetary Fund's Committee on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related Issues  not .only should make possible an expansion of internationaltrade and the smooth operation of international payment settlements  but should also facilitate the development process in the developing countries through providing additional liquidity to them. A link between the special drawing rights and development aid should therefore be established. It is regrettable that major decisions on this important matter have to be postponed until next year  since the recent Nairobi meeting of the Committee could not agree on the key issues for reform.71.	The developing countries have an enormous stake in the outcome of these two negotiations. We earnestly hope  therefore  that the international community can summon the courage and goodwill needed to make these negotiations successful.72.	The process of reordering the international social and economic relationships  now under way  undoubtedly presents the United Nations  particularly the Economic and Social Council  with the challenge to assume more effectively and efficiently the functions entrusted  to it by the United Nations Charter. To meet this challenge it has been the considered opinion of my delegation that the Council should be revitalized and its role strengthened. Efforts which have been made so far include inter alia the enlargement of membership in the Council in order to increase its representative character. The Council should be made fully responsive to the challenges of our time  and the review and appraisal of the Development Strategy should become one of its major tasks.73.	The Economic and Social Council  together with the other operational bodies of the United Nations  must be able to play a decisive role in evolving more effective concepts of international development co-operation. The activities of United Nations operational bodies such as the United Nations Development Programme  the United Nations Fund for Population Activities  the United Nations Environment Programme  the United Nations Children's Fund and the World Food Programme should  in our view  also be strengthened and consolidated. A more dynamic growth in their over-all resources will enable these bodies to respond quickly and adequately to the ever increasing demand for their services.74.	The challenges and problems we face in the coming decades cannot be met by one nation or a particular group of nations  no matter how rich or powerful they may be. The destruction caused by a nuclear war is not going to be limited to the territory of the warring Powers alone. No nation-can be secure as long as another is beset with a sense of insecurity or of injustice. No nation can enjoy the fruits of material abundance or social welfare as long as other nations remain destitute  for the economic fabric of the world is like an indivisible chain that is only as strong as its weakest link. Every nation will suffer when the earth is unable to provide its inhabitants with those basic resources necessary for a life in peace and human dignity for all.75.	In pledging Indonesia's continued dedication to the ideals and aims of the Charter  therefore  we commit ourselves not only to contributing our share in facing up to mankind's immense task of shaping a new and better world of tomorrow  but simultaneously also to enhancing the viability of the United Nations as the best instrument for global co-operation in quest of that goal."
"51",3182,"IND",28,1973,"﻿122.	Mr. President  I bring to you and to all our colleagues assembled here the greetings and good wishes of the Government and the people of India. I extend to you our warmest congratulations on your accession to the high office of President of the General Assembly. In selecting you as its candidate for President  the continent of Latin America has shown its appreciation of your ability and experience and has helped the Assembly in choosing a man whose faith  competence and devoted services to the United Nations can assure us of a successful session. You can always depend on the full co-operation of my delegation in carrying out your tasks as President.123.	I should like to record our appreciation of the outgoing President  Mr. Trepczynski of Poland  for the skill and patience with which he discharged his responsibilities. With his leadership we accomplished much that was valuable in the work of the United Nations.124.	Our distinguished Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  has now been in office for nearly two years. We have admired his dynamism  and the sense of purpose he has brought to his work. We look forward to his wise counsel and assessment on many of the issues we shall deal with during the current session.125.	We deeply mourn the death of the President of Chile  Dr. Allende  in such violent and tragic circumstances. I do not intend to comment on internal developments of a sovereign State. In the wider context  however  I must express profound regret and concern over the setback that the democratic tradition of the people of Chile has suffered as a result of his overthrow  and over the violence  bloodshed and deprivation of human rights and infringement of diplomatic obligations which have recently been reported from that country. We earnestly hope that peace and harmony will be restored soon so that the people of Chile can resume their work of national reconstruction and reconciliation without any outside intervention and without further violence.126.	The Secretary-General  in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/9001 /Add. IJ  has indicated the value of the United Nations in the present-day world  and has emphasized once again that the United Nations can only be what its Member States wish it to be. Few delegations will disagree with that assessment; the universal desire to render the United Nations a more effective instrument for promoting international peace and co-operation will depend on the willingness and ability of the States represented here to appreciate and reconcile different points of view and to arrive at decisions which serve those interests which are shared by most of us. Surely  our effort should be to extend the area of co-operation through identification of those interests. At the same time  in discussing any problems we must look at them in their totality and apply the Charter provisions in all their aspects and not selectively or in a piecemeal fashion.127.	The year that has just passed since we last met has seen important  though uneven  developments  but  on the whole  the world has moved forward  however haltingly and however slightly  towards our goal of peace  justice and progress. The gradual reduction of tension between rival blocs  which many of us had long been urging  is now clearly noticeable. The recent improvement of relations between the great Powers and the increase in contacts between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America  and the United States of America and China  are important in themselves  and also as an indication that the trend that developed last year has maintained its momentum. The Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War  concluded between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in June of this year  and the understandings between them in several other fields are welcome. We are also gratified that this steady search for international peace and security has led to important developments in Europe: in the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin  in the treaties between the two German States and between the Federal Republic of Germany and other countries in Eastern Europe  and in the convening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.128.	We join others in welcoming the process of mutual accommodation and co-operation and the consequent reduction of tension. However  this spirit of detente has yet to extend to all parts of the world and should not be limited to mere coexistence among the major Powers. Regrettably  such concepts as the balance of power  spheres of influence and power vacuum are yet to be discarded. Unfortunately also  the great Power rivalry continues to show itself in many ways and in many areas; this brings severe stress and strain in international relations. The power of the strong is still to be placed at the common service of mankind. Only through genuine co-operation can the peoples of the world move forward towards a better future  in accordance with their own wishes and without any feeling of subordination and dependence  or of imposition or pressure from outside.129.	I was privileged to take part in the Fourth Conference of Heads of State and Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Algiers  where those problems received the most careful and comprehensive examination from the largest gathering of Heads of State or Government ever held. The most significant feature of that great Conference was the confidence it created and the will it generated to work together for realizing our common objectives. Those States are determined to achieve  together with all nations of the world and with a spirit of constructive co-operation  equality among all nations and an equitable exploitation of resources of the world. We shall thus encourage the march forward of man for peace and for a better life. Political understanding and economic co-operation among majorPowers are therefore to be so arranged and channelled that they do not become  even unintentionally  instruments of new forms of domination and dependence.130.	The maintenance of world peace and security will depend to a large extent on the speedy removal of economic and social disparities  both nationally and internationally. The non-aligned countries wish to build  together with other developing States  a collective self- reliance within the framework of international understanding. They are determined to remove all forms and manifestations of injustice and inequality  discrimination and oppression wherever they may exist. Their dedication to this cause should not be mistaken as a confrontation with any particular country or a group of countries. They have reaffirmed their firm resolve to strengthen the United Nations  which remains the best available machinery for world-wide co-operation.131.	The world has changed a great deal since our Charter was signed in San Francisco nearly 30 years ago. The Charter must evolve with the times in order to remain an effective and dynamic force for peace and progress. Thus  there is an understandable desire for a comprehensive review of it. We believe  however  that in the prevailing climate of international politics  it would be premature to do more than examine the Charter in certain fields.132.	We welcome this year three new Members: the German Democratic Republic  the Federal Republic of Germany and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. We have excellent relations with those States and look forward to working with them in the United Nations. The Bahamas joins us as the newest Member State from the Caribbean within a few weeks of attaining freedom. We cannot forget in this connexion that there are still a number of countries which are to be freed from colonial rule.133.	The simultaneous admission of the two German States to the United Nations may well signal the disappearance of tensions and hostilities of the past and the beginning of a new era of understanding and co-operation in Central Europe. We welcome the new pattern of relationship. The two German States  as Members of this Organization  could indeed make a significant contribution to world peace and development.134.	The admission of these States marks an important step in achieving the goal of universality of membership of the United Nations. This makes it all the more regrettable that Bangladesh  a sovereign State recognized by over 100 Members of the United Nations and with a population of over 75 million people  has not yet been able to take its rightful place among us. I should like to emphasize the call made by the Algiers Conference for the admission of Bangladesh into the United Nations. Member States will no doubt recognize that the continuing denial of Bangladesh's right to be in the United Nations injures  if not defeats  the purposes and principles of the Charter of this Organization.135.	India seeks friendship and co-operation with all nations on the basis of equality  reciprocity and mutual respect. With over 75 States of the different continents of the world we share the common ideals of non-alignment. Together with these and many other developing countries we face the common problem of economic development and are working for a better world order.136.	With western Europe our links go back for centuries and the future holds bright prospects for greater exchanges in various fields. Our political and economic relations with the countries of eastern Europe have shown steady and fruitful development. With the Soviet Union we have achieved a close and co-operative friendship  based on mutual trust and understanding  which we greatly cherish. Both the United States and India have a strong faith in democratic systems and we share many common values. Our contacts and associations with Britain have lasted for hundreds of years and now continue to develop on a basis of mutual respect and equality. Our common cultural values and liberal traditions provide a strong base for our growing friendship with France. As close neighbours  India and China have to live in peace and amity  and we hope that our relations will soon move in that direction.137.	Japan's rapid industrial advance is a lesson for us  and we welcome that country's co-operation in various fields. We are glad that Australia  Canada and New Zealand an: sharing  more and more  our values and attitudes and are showing greater awareness of Asian and African aspirations. In Ottawa  we had a successful meeting of the Commonwealth countries about six weeks ago.138.	With our most immediate neighbours-Afghanistan  Bangladesh  Bhutan  Burma  Nepal and Sri Lanka — we maintain and seek the closest friendship and wide-ranging co-operation. We are making all possible efforts to end the era of confrontation with Pakistan.'139.	The most significant development in our subcontinent has been the search through direct negotiations for normalization of relations. The New Delhi Agreement of 28 August 1973 provides for the settlement of the humanitarian problems left over from the conflict of 1971. It represents yet another step in the fulfilment of the Simla Agreement of 2 July 1972  which had set out the framework for the establishment of durable peace in the subcontinent.140.	Ever since independence  India has tried its utmost to live in peace and friendship with Pakistan. In spite of many setbacks and frustrations  this has remained  and will remain  a fundamental objective of our foreign policy.141.	The tragic events in the subcontinent in 1971 were a direct consequence of the short-sighted policies and adventurist actions of the Pakistani military rulers to which the President  now Prime Minister  Mr. Bhutto himself has made repeated references. The military oligarchy  having failed to crush the determination of 75 million Bangalis  involved India in a war by suddenly bombing from the air several places in western India on 3 December 1971.1 state these simple facts only to give a proper perspective  and not with any desire to dwell on the past. Our purpose is to look forward.142.	The war lasted about two weeks and the fighting stopped in Bangladesh on 16 December 1971. From that moment onwards  we took a series of steps to restore normalcy and achieve durable peace in the Indian subcontinent.143.	In the eastern sector  all Indian troops were withdrawn from Bangladesh within a period of 90 days by agreement between the two Governments; all the prisoners taken in Bangladesh were transferred to India as a result of a decision by the joint Indo-Bangladesh command; and all the refugees-nearly 10 million of them — returned from India to Bangladesh in three months' time  by the end of March 1972. In the western sector  the unilateral cease-fire declared by India came into effect on 17 December 1971.144.	Soon after the cease-fire  we sought negotiations with Pakistan. As a result of the initiative taken by Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi a summit meeting was held in Simla. An agreement was arrived at on 2 July 1972  which  among other things  provided for  first  a line of control in Jammu and Kashmir  secondly  evacuation of territories occupied during the conflict; and thirdly  troop withdrawals. All these decisions were implemented in less than six months. An area of over 5 000 square miles occupied during the conflict was vacated and restored to Pakistan. In addition  all the prisoners of war taken by either side in the western sector returned home.145.	Our next initiative was to make a joint declaration with Bangladesh on 17 April 1973 for solving the major humanitarian problems which arose as a result of the 1971 conflict. Three groups of people were affected: (a) hundreds of thousands of Bangalis stranded in Pakistan and prevented from returning to Bangladesh; (b)  hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis in Bangladesh whom Pakistan was refusing to receive; and (c) about 90 000 prisoners of war and civilian internees held in India. Bangladesh showed a spirit of accommodation and statesmanship in delinking the humanitarian problems from the unresolved political issues between Bangladesh and Pakistan.146.	Following negotiations with Pakistan on the basis of this joint declaration  an agreement between India and Bangladesh  with the full concurrence of Bangladesh  was arrived at and signed in Delhi on 28 August 1973. This agreement provides for simultaneous repatriation of all the three groups I have just mentioned.147.	As regards the 195 prisoners of war  all three Governments agreed that they should be kept in India pending a final settlement. The Delhi Agreement further provides  and I quote:""On completion of repatriation of Pakistani prisoners of war and civilian internees in India  Bengalis in Pakistan and Pakistanis in Bangladesh referred to in Clause (v) above  or earlier if they so agree  Bangladesh  India and Pakistan will discuss and settle the question of 195 prisoners of war. Bangladesh has made it clear that it can participate in such a meeting only on the basis of sovereign equality.""148.	We hope that the Delhi Agreement will be fully  speedily and smoothly implemented with goodwill on all sides. The first steps in this direction have already been taken. Simultaneous repatriation of Bengalis from Pakistan  Pakistanis from Bangladesh  and prisoners of war and civilian internees from India has already started.149.	I doubt if there is any comparable instance in modern history where a cease-fire  demarcation  troopwithdrawal  evacuation of occupied territories and repatriation of persons detained or stranded  following an international armed conflict of significant character  has been brought about within such a short period. All this has been achieved through direct negotiations  and as a result of the understanding shown on all sides  after taking into account all aspects of the problems. Therefore  to discuss now piecemeal and in isolation any of these problems from the point of view of any single party would be  to say the least  of little profit.150.	These concrete facts clearly show that our search for normalization of relations and the establishment of a durable peace in the subcontinent has continued and has produced significant results. Our commitment to this goal is unequivocal. If we succeed in making the subcontinent an area of peace and co-operation  it not only will lead to a better life for over 700 millions of its people  but also will have a salutary impact on other areas as well.151.	The Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam was signed in Paris this year. For many years we had repeatedly expressed our conviction that a military solution in this area was not feasible. Therefore  the massive and what seemed to be avoidable destruction of life and property in Indo-China shocked and pained us. The final terms of settlement  including provisions for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Indo-China and for bringing about a workable cease-fire in that area  are not much different from what we have been advocating all these years. The tragic sufferings of the people of Viet-Nam must come to an end and the full implementation of the Paris Agreement offers a challenge as well as an opportunity; every effort should be made to ensure lasting peace and to promote full and speedy reconstruction.152.	As with the people of Viet-Nam  so with the people of Laos and Cambodia  India has always had close historical  cultural and emotional links. They can always depend on our sympathy  understanding and support. In this context  we welcome the recently concluded agreement among the parties in Laos. We hope that the people pf Laos will soon be able to set up a national coalition government in accordance with their legitimate aspirations without any outside interference.153.	The peace in Indo-China will not be complete until the war in Cambodia has also been brought to an end. We are deeply distressed at the suffering which the people of Cambodia are still undergoing and the heavy toll of lives that is still taking place. We would urge that the people of Cambodia should be enabled to determine freely  and without any outside interference  their own future so that peace can return to that unhappy and tortured land. The international community can best assist this process by respecting fully the legitimate right to freedom  sovereignty and territorial integrity of all the States of Indo-China.154.	The comprehensive debate on the situation in the Middle East in the Security Council this summer showed once more  and most convincingly  that there can be no solution to this problem until Israel withdraws from the territories it has occupied by force as a consequence of the 1967 war. Israel's persistent refusal to vacate the occupied Arab lands and its violation of the rights of the inhabitants of the territories occupied by force are the direct causes of tension and conflict in this area. A just solution based on the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and the recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinians can lead to an enduring peace in this region. The Secretary-General's visit to the Middle East must have brought into clearer focus the views of the contestants. His analysis may well help the parties and the Security Council to continue the search for a just and speedy solution to this explosive situation. We  on our part  will be guided by the principles we have always followed in regard to the problem of the Middle East; they are: the non-acquisition of territories by force of arms  the right of all States in the area to exist  and the inalienable rights of the Palestinians.155.	We have noted with satisfaction the direct dialogue established between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea for the intensification of contacts to solve humanitarian problems and the eventual reunification of the Korean people. In these talks  as indeed in the whole of Korea  the less outside interference there is the better will be the chances of the parties leaching agreement. Any proposal before the United Nations on this subject will be examined by us with these considerations in mind.156.	The twin phenomena of colonial domination and racial bigotry in Africa are the greatest burden on the conscience of the contemporary world.157.	The situation of the people under Portuguese domination was tragically highlighted by the disclosures in the international press of the gruesome massacres in Mozambique. We must continue to expose the criminal character of Portuguese colonialism.158.	We welcome the declaration of independence by the people of Guinea-Bissau and extend our support to Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde in its work of national integration and consolidation. We have no doubt that the peoples of Angola and Mozambique will soon succeed in their struggle for independence.159.	The will to be independent must be sustained by the United Nations not only in the areas I have specifically mentioned  but in many others which we shall consider during these three months. We were disappointed  therefore  that when the question of terrorism was discussed in the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism  the refusal by some to admit the possibility of freedom fighters using all means to achieve their objectives  prevented the Committee from coming to any conclusion.160.	In Zimbabwe  the racist regime continues to maintain its illegal administration in defiance of world opinion. We regret that the Security Council has been prevented from taking any .decisive action for applying the existing sanctions. In addition to improving the effectiveness of sanctions  their extension and strengthening is necessary. The breach of sanctions by some countries and trading interests is most regrettable  particularly when we recall that the sanctions were imposed by a unanimous decision of the Security Council.161.	Nowhere are the obligations of trust vested in the United Nations more binding than in Namibia. The peopleof Namibia have demonstrated the greatest courage in asserting their own rights by boycotting the recent so-called elections in Ovamboland. Clearly  the South African Government is not willing to work with the United Nations in bringing about Namibian independence and unity. The efforts made through the United Nations Council for Namibia  its High Commissioner  and the United Nations Educational and Training Programme for Southern Africa could  if their activities are planned and co-ordinated in a well-thought-out manner  contribute effectively to the political independence of the Namibian people as a whole.162.	In this session  the General Assembly will consider the adoption of the Draft Convention for the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid [item 53 (b)/. We shall support all measures to intensify and widen action for outlawing this intolerable and inhuman doctrine which has brought so much suffering to millions of human beings in South Africa. Only recently  the world was shocked with the brutal killing in Carletonville.163.	Today is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi  and I recall that he was the first man to rise and revolt against the cruel practices of the Government of South Africa. He led a movement for improving the lot of the coloured people in that country  even before he launched the civil disobedience movement in India for obtaining our freedom and independence. Since India raised this question in the United Nations in 1946  practically every Member of this Organization  including South Africa's allies  has denounced apartheid. We shall continue to co-operate with all other Member States until South Africa gives up its intolerable policies of racial discrimination.164.	While recent developments on the limitation of nuclear armaments and the prohibition of certain categories of weapons of mass destruction are important  enduring world peace and security can be based only on total disarmament. However  the goal of general and complete disarmament  including  in particular  nuclear disarmament  remains as distant as ever. We have long urged the convening of a world conference on disarmament with the participation of all countries so as to focus attention on this urgent problem. Unfortunately  the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference  set up after the last General Assembly session  could not proceed with any substantive work. Given goodwill on all sides  the difficulties which arose can be removed by the present session of the Assembly so that a world conference on disarmament can be prepared for and convened as early as possible.165.	My delegation has noted with interest the new item proposed by the delegation of the USSR for a reduction in the military budgets [item 102]. The intention seems to be that the permanent members of the Security Council and other militarily significant States should use a part of the savings for providing assistance to developing countries. We have been stressing that savings from disarmament should be diverted to development assistance. We shall therefore co-operate with other delegations in a constructive effort to consider how this proposal  which will no doubt be elaborated in course of discussion  could serve the interest of disarmament and also enhance development assistance.166.	The declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)J was a significant step in our efforts to reduce great Power rivalries and tensions in the different regions of the world and forms a part of our desire to eliminate military alliances and bases. I should take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the statesmanship of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka in mobilizing international opinion for this purpose. Useful work has been initiated by the 15-member Ad Hoc  Committee on the Indian Ocean established by the last session of the Assembly [resolution 2992 (XXVII)] for considering measures for implementing the Declaration. This Declaration cannot be effective unless the great Powers and other major maritime Powers co-operate fully with the littoral and hinterland States.167.	We look forward with utmost interest to the forthcoming plenipotentiary Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The meetings of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction this year have brought out certain difficulties  none of which need prove insurmountable. By working together with all other countries we could achieve a just and equitable law of the sea and sea-bed which would provide for and ensure an orderly exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction and a rational management of its resources  bearing in mind the special needs and interests of the developing countries  whether coastal or land-locked. A fair and viable law of the sea should also provide a framework of regulations for other uses of the sea  including those relating to the exploitation of its living and other resources by establishing an exclusive fishery and economic zone for the coastal States.168.	The concept of world-wide partnership in economic and social development has been accepted. However  the progress towards full implementation of the International Development Strategy for the 1970s [resolution 2626 (XXV)] has been extremely disappointing. Some developed countries  particularly the smaller among them  have responded well  but little success has been achieved in even its most publicized goals. The dismal fact is that the Second Development Decade is going the way of the first  and with far less excuse. The growth of most developing countries is well below the targets set. The growth in the least developed countries has been slower still. The benefits of world economic growth are not being shared equitably and the rich societies are becoming richer and the poor poorer. Full recognition of the interdependence of the world community and adoption of measures conducive to the attainment of a more balanced growth in the world economy is still lacking.169.	Many developing countries have already spoken of a real and imminent danger that  owing to the preoccupation of developed countries with readjustment of their mutual relations  the urgent need to implement policy measures in favour of developing countries may not receive the attention it deserves. The first biennial review and appraisal of the Strategy has so far been inconclusive. If agreed conclusions could be reached during this session  remedial measures to improve performance in the remaining years of the Decade would be easier to take. In the developing countries the struggle for greater equality and justice mustcontinue. Equally  we have to seek wider economic co-operation among the developing countries themselves. The important measures outlined recently at Algiers for this purpose should prove most useful.170.	Contrary to earlier expectations  agreement on international monetary reform has not been reached. Stability in international monetary arrangements is not yet within our grasp. The issues are undoubtedly complex. Non-aligned countries have reiterated that the new international monetary system  in the establishment and working of which the developing countries should participate as equals  should be universal. The system should guarantee the stability of international trade flows and conditions of financing; it has to recognize the specific situation and needs of the developing countries for preferential treatment.171.	The growth of world trade and the rightful share of the developing countries in it will be facilitated by the establishment of special drawing rights as the principal reserve asset  for the phasing out of the monetary role of gold  for an adjustment mechanism which is both efficient and equitable and  above all  for the establishment of a link between the special drawing rights and development finance  in order to provide for the adequate transfer of additional real resources to the developing countries. All these measures will create an orderly arrangement for adequate liquidity.172.	The Declaration adopted a few days ago at Tokyo will soon be followed by a round of multilateral trade negotiations. The trend towards liberalization of world trade is to be welcomed  but the developing countries should not emerge from these negotiations as net losers. Specific measures must be taken to secure additional benefits for the international trade of developing countries. This has indeed been agreed to in Tokyo.173.	To achieve this  the concept of preferential treatment for developing countries in all sectors of the negotiations has to be accepted. Moreover  we must ensure that the enlargement of the preferential arrangements among the developed countries  as well as the reduction of industrial tariffs following the multilateral trade negotiations  do not erode the meagre benefits which the developing countries have secured under the generalized scheme of preferences. To make this scheme fully operational will require its implementation by those who have not yet done so and substantial improvements in the arrangements already in operation.174.	The delicate and precarious balance between-world food supply and demand during the last few years has emphasized the urgent need for a global strategy for food security. Widespread drought in several countries has brought to the forefront the problem of matching world resources and technology for production of food with global needs  in normal as also in abnormal years. We support the initiative of the Food and Agriculture Organization to work out an effective solution to this problem.175.	In stressing the essential link between economic development and environmental improvement we haveconsistently underlined that there is no contradiction between the solution of ecological problems and the interests of developing countries. We have  therefore  spoken against ecological considerations being used to curtail aid  erect trade barriers and prevent the transfer of technology. This could be the result of a short-sighted desire to protect economic advantages: restraints on economic growth must not be adopted to the detriment of the developing world.176.	We are confident  therefore  that the United Nations Environment Programme under Mr. Maurice Strong will keep all these aspects in mind in working out a plan of action for the betterment of mankind as a whole. In this context  the development of human settlements is of particular importance to developing countries.177.	I have followed with great interest the many important views expressed by distinguished ministers and leaders of delegations gathered here. Today  I have taken the time of the Assembly to set forth our ideas on some of the important issues before us. We must ponder over the many valuable ideas presented to us by men of thought  and we must bend our energies to collective effort as men of action. The Charter provides the mechanism for translating these ideas into action. Let us  if we can  gather enough courage and wisdom and seize this opportunity to serve our fellow men."
"52",3228,"IRL",28,1973,"﻿119.	It is an honour for me  Mr. President  as a newcomer to this Assembly to offer the congratulations of the Irish delegation to you  whose long and distinguished career at the United Nations has now culminated in your election as President of the twenty- eighth session of the General Assembly. Your declared loyalty to  and faith in  our Organization will inspire our work. In you too we salute the loyalty to the United Nations of Ecuador and Latin America. As you have so rightly said  Ecuador has been guided in international affairs by ""the ethical and legal principles which form the common cultural heritage of Latin America derived from a thousand years of history"" [2117th meeting  para. 44]  from its own soil and from its blending with the culture of Europe. And perhaps I may be permitted to recall that an Irishman  Florence O'Leary  companion and biographer of the great Bolivar  was privileged to fight for liberty beside Juan Jose' Flores  who became the first president of your country. We in Ireland treasure these links with Ecuador and Latin America and they give us an additional reason for rejoicing in your election to your high office.120.	My delegation also wishes to pay a tribute to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski of Poland  the President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly  who carried out the duties of his high office with outstanding efficiency  distinction and courtesy.121.	Ireland is happy to welcome the Commonwealth of the Bahamas as the one hundred thirty-fifth Member of the United Nations-this first land of the New World seen by Columbus  and a land whose culture unites those of many continents.122.	And we warmly welcome what you  Mr. President  have described as ""historically and politically the transcendent event of this session""  the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany  our partner in the European Economic Community  and of the German Democratic Republic. The achievements of the German people in the realms of literature  philosophy  music  art  science and scholarship have enriched the cultures of all our countries and pervaded our thinking. Gutenberg  Luther  Goethe  Kant  Marx  Beethoven-there is no end of famous men and women of whom we might say  as Goethe did of Kant  ""Even if you have not read him  he has influenced your thinking"". These are the makers of European and world culture  for they are not bounded by any country; these are true citizens of the world who are not so much children of Germany as of humanity.123.	The Federal Republic has long been a Member of the United Nations family and has given loyal and distinguished service to many of its organs. Its presence in the Assembly and that of the German Democratic Republic will bring to our deliberations the great qualities of the German people as a new and active element in the Organization. Perhaps  too  we can hope that their co-operation here  where they sit side by side  will hasten the day when Germany will again be peacefully reunited.124.	In his introduction to the annual report on the work of the United Nations  the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  has told us that this body will not develop through ritual public statements of approval and support which are not backed by inner conviction  realism and whole-hearted participation [A/9001/Add. 1  p. 2]  and he has asked us in his closing words to examine our consciences  to decide just what kind of world organization we need and are prepared in reality to accept [ibid.  p. 8]. Do we want an Organization which is more than a conference machinery and a forum for the pursuit of national policies  one which will develop an impetus of its own?125.	These blunt questions deserve thoughtful and at the same time frank answers. The role of our Organization needs to be reviewed at this time for two quite different reasons: first  and most obviously  because of public disquiet  one might indeed say disillusionment  with its achievements as they are known-incompletely  be it said-to public opinion; but also  and ultimately more importantly  because the last few years have seen the emergence of world problems not previously realized or understood  some indeed quite new. Their resolution will require without question a global approach through an Organization representative of all the peoples of the earth.126.	The last two decades have seen for the first time in the life of this planet the emergence of an almost comprehensive range of organized independent States representing virtually all the peoples of the earth. In the perspective of history it will no doubt be seen as ironical that this should have coincided precisely with a stage in the economic organization and in the economic development of the world that began to render unworkable the very concept of absolute national sovereignty and to demand  with rising urgency  a pooling of sovereignty in certain specific areas of activity in the joint interest of the world's peoples. For some long-established and powerful States this is an unwelcome development  accustomed as they have been to an almost unfettered exercise of sovereignty in the interest of their own peoples-often in the past  be it said  without much regard for the interests of others. Such countries naturally find it hard to accept the constraints on the exercise of their power which this new situation imposes. But this development also poses great psychological problems for States that have come into existence only in recent decades  with an understandable ambition to exercise  within the  limits imposed by their economic power and geographic extent  the attributes of sovereignty  so long and so harshly denied to them. As the representative of one of these newer States  I am very conscious of this aspect of the problem and can sympathize with the many even newer States that have hardly yet had the chance to consider how best to use the sovereignty so recently secured. We in Ireland know just what is entailed in a recognition of the need to pool parts of our national sovereignty; we have faced this choice and our people  in May of last year  by a majority of five-sixths  decided to recognize that it would be counter-productive and contrary to their interests to insist on the preservation  undiluted  of sovereignty in matters where this sovereignty could not effectively be exercised save in co-operation with neighbouring States. The reality that we in Ireland have faced is one that all the Member States of this Organization-even the most powerful and the most-proud-must also recognize as this extraordinary century draws to its close. None of our States is capable of controlling single- handed the environment in which their people live. Pollution is ubiquitous. Technology is universal. The airwaves reach every corner of the globe  and out beyond it to the stars  whose secrets we are starting to probe by voyages into space. No State can by its own laws or its own power safeguard its people's interests from external influences  be they good or bad. We have no choice  therefore  but to seek each other's co-operation in determining which is the pervasive forces of technology   and which manifestations of economic power endanger our peoples unless controlled and in agreeing on how to control them.127.	Our human loyalties start small: first to our families  then to our local communities. For many people even the extension of loyalty beyond the local community to the State is difficult. And so we do not find it easy to widen our loyalties to new and larger entities perhaps lacking in cultural cohesion and comprising other States or peoples with which we have in the past had deep and perhaps bloody differences. Least of all do we find it easy  yet  to see the world as one community of peoples owing loyalty to each other and to the earth which gives them life and sustenance and shelter. That is why the first tentative efforts towards a recognition of the interdependence of States in the modern world has come at the regional level  among peoples who  however diverse their individual cultures  share a common heritage. Western Europe is today the scene of a development which  while yet at this stage unique  may prove a fore-runner of other similar free unions of culturally diverse sovereign States seeking to overcome mutual suspicion in a sharing of their sovereignty over those features of their economic and social affairs which can no longer be controlled at the level of the individual State.128.	Many of these problems  however  today demand global rather than regional solutions. They require  in the words of the distinguished representative of the United .States  Mr. Henry Kissinger  whom we warmly welcomed here this morning  the acceptance of the imperatives of a global society [2124th meeting]. As Mr. Kissinger said  they will not be resolved by a world fragmented into self-contained nation-States or rigid blocs. They will not  indeed  ultimately be resolved until the world's peoples can raise their sights to a level of vision elevated enough to command a wider view of these problems.129.	But we cannot afford to wait-for the growth-of technology and the expansion of economic activity will not delay-until a sense of global loyalty emerges  strong enough to carry the superstructure of common decision making needed to resolve all these problems at one swoop. Instead we must start together to tackle these problems with the very limited means now available' to us-the cumbersome mechanisms of decision-making by unanimity which is all that our peoples  and  be it said  their governments  are ready to concede at this stage. The problems that fall to be tackled in this way-first of all through the existing quite inadequate level of international co-operation  but ultimately by something much more highly-developed and more appropriate to the scale of these problems — are . well known to us all. First there is the problem of the maldistribution of the world's resources in relation to the spread of its people on the surface of the globe. Here we face both the problem of the maldistribution of natural resources  and that of the maldistribution of the capacity to harness them. There are countries with natural resources far exceeding their present ability to develop. There are States with virtually no natural resources at all  which also lack the technological base to import and process such resources. And there are advanced countries which  with or without their own natural resources  have  through their historical development  secured a position of economic power and wealth which places them many levels above States in other parts of the world.130.	Such disparities between people on the one hand and wealth on the other are morally unsustainable. They fly in the face of the conscience of a growing proportion of mankind which is coming to feel that our neighbour is indeed every other human being; that this feeling is most acute amongst the younger generation in our countries is perhaps one of the most hopeful features of the modern world..131.	But that is only one of many problems which must be tackled globally. There is the problem of our environment and the using up of resources some of which we now believe to be within sight of exhaustion within the lives of our children or grandchildren. There is the problem of multinational companies  many of them  be it said  responsible for technological breakthroughs which have benefited mankind but which  nevertheless  escape the control of national governments. Some are operating on a scale controllable in the public interest only by a world authority  exercising at world level the same protective function as that undertaken by our national governments within our own States vis-à-vis purely domestic private interests. And there is also the overflow effect of modern international advertising  operating through pervasive communications media  which may involve abuses that no national government could today control effectively in its own territory without impairing the ability of its own domestic enterprises to hold their own in competition with external concerns free from such constraints.132.	Because these and similar problems can be tackled effectively only at a global level  and because the interests of the world's peoples demand that they be tackled  the United Nations has a future role to play  the importance of which should not be underestimated. It was perhaps with considerations such as these in mind that a working group was established some time ago to prepare a charter of economic rights and duties of States  and it was such considerations also  no doubt  that the President of Mexico had in mind when he some weeks ago addressed a letter to the Secretary-General asking that work on that charter be accelerated [A/9142].133.	But it is not only in areas such as these that the old concept of absolute national sovereignty must start to give way to a wider sense of human solidarity. Human rights transcend national boundaries. In our membership of this body  and in certain of its activities  that fact is partially recognized. But we are still far indeed from the point where throughout the world the basic rights of human beings are protected by a code of legislation universally enforceable on an international basis. There is more lip-service  and less real commitment  in this aspect of our joint activities in the United Nations  than perhaps in any other.134.	In this particular area the member States of the Council of Europe have something to offer. We have accepted a significant measure of derogation of sovereignty in human rights matters-permitting domestic actions in matters involving human rights to be effectively challenged in an international forum. My own country was indeed one of the first to be challenged by this process; happily we were vindicated. I believe that if what we in the Council of Europe have developed were to become generalized  and if States in other parts of the world were to accept the same measure of derogation of sovereignty in this field that we in that Council have accepted  great progress could be made. This is an area where  it must be said  there has been a deterioration rather than an improvement in recent years as  in more and more countries-most recently in Chile- regimes have come to power lacking the consent of their peoples  and many of them hold on to power by repressive measures that undermine human rights.135.	In this year when we commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the Secretary-General has very pertinently said that the credibility of the United Nations is especially at stake [A/9001/Add. 1  p. 5]. That credibility can be restored only if  as the preamble to the Universal Declaration proposes  human rights are protected by the rule of law-the rule of international law-which alone can be effective vis-à-vis domestic repression in Member States.136.	How can we make real progress in this matter? Surely by seeking to create an effective international human rights jurisdiction. Many States will  I believe  accept such a proposal — in Western Europe alone there are more than a dozen that do so already. Others can be embarrassed or shamed into doing so. And those who remain outside — or who  having joined  later renege on their obligations-will have identified themselves as unwilling to give their own citizens the guarantees that only the international rule of law can provide  without which  as the preamble to the Declaration states  the seeds of violence will be sown.137.	This problem of human rights takes on a special dimension in southern Africa. There the deprivation of individual freedom is based on race and colour. No consideration of personal achievement  level of education  or even of loyalty to the regime  influences the treatment meted out to those whose colour is different from that of the ruling minority. From birth  and because of birth  the majority are condemned to unequal treatment  humiliating to the human spirit  degrading those who impose it as much as those on whom it is imposed.138.	We condemn that policy  and believe that its intrinsically evil character makes it ultimately unworkable. Condemnation alone is not enough  however. Indeed condemnation without any attempt to understand the fears that lie behind this evil imposition may be counter-productive. We have to face the fact that because of their history white South Africans have become a dominant but fearful minority in that beautiful land. Their fears  however unreal they may appear to us  are real to them  and one way of helping to bring the curse of apartheid to an earlier demise will be to seek means of reassuring this misguided dominant minority as to its future in a free and democratic South Africa. In the policies which the United Nations adopts in relation to South Africa this consideration should have a part  without our ever for a moment relaxing our abhorrence of the evil itself or ceasing to counter the attempts by reactionary elements in some countries to mitigate or explain away this most degrading of all repressive policies.139.	A separate and special problem is that of Rhodesia  where the illegal regime retains its control and where there appears to be little immediate hope of change but  rather  ominous signs of greater misery ahead. Hopes that the way to a just and peaceful society recognizing the principle of majority rule might be paved by a constitutional conference have not been fulfilled  and the illegal regime seems bent on even more intransigent and suicidal measures to preserve control by the white 5 per cent of the population. The majority have shown great patience and have continued under their chosen political leaders-some imprisoned for many years-to search for peaceful solutions. Ireland will maintain its support of the right of that people to independence  and will continue strictly to adhere to the Security Council's mandatory sanctions against the illegal regime.140.	Elsewhere in southern Africa  there are the problems of Namibia and of the Portuguese Territories. The attitude of the people of Namibia to the illegal South African regime-which persists in exercising authority in the region in defiance of the United Nations  which seven years ago terminated South Africa's mandate for the Territory [resolution 2145 (XXI)]-has been shown by the boycott of elections in one of the so-called ""homelands""  by industrial action  and  indeed  by rebellion against the denial of human rights. We support the United Nations in its efforts to free this country from the illegal South African regime.141.	We also support the calls made by the Security Council and the Assembly to Portugal to recognize the right of the people in the Portuguese African Territories to self-determination and independence. There is no other solution  and in the end that will be the solution. Much misery-not alone for the Africans in those Territories but also for the Portuguese in Africa and at home — could be spared if that reality were to be recognized by the Portuguese Government  which in its present policy is doing an injustice to its people  to their traditions and to their past contributions to human knowledge and culture. The tragedy of this residual colonial situation has been deepened recently by the disturbing reports of massacres in Mozambique  which have not yet been the subject of an independent investigation.142.	The problems of the countries of Africa  Asia and Latin America owe a good deal to past colonialism  but by no means all their problems can fairly be attributed to that cause. In addition to past exploitation  there are also deep underlying causes of poverty in many of those countries which cannot be solved in the foreseeable future without generous recognition by the better-off States of the world of their obligation to share their wealth with countries less fortunate.143.	My country shares with other developed countries this duty and obligation of aiding our economically less fortunate neighbours in the world community. It is a duty which our membership in the United Nations has brought clearly to our attention. It is a duty and obligation which Ireland has accepted in principle but one where to date our performance does not match our duty. In the past our performance operated on an unplanned basis. My Government accepts that there is a need for real and substantial improvement in Ireland's aid to developing countries. In the current year our official financial transfers to developing countries have been doubled. The intention of my Government is to increase thereafter the annual level of this assistance in absolute terms and as a percentage of our gross national product in a planned manner over a period of years. We are developing a comprehensive and coherent programme which will show a balanced growth in its various sectors and will be designed to achieve the greatest benefit for developing countries. That will still not immediately match the generous acceptance of this obligation by some other developed countries  but it is an indication of our will to meet our United Nations obligations in this essential work.144.	In what I have said here today I have hitherto concentrated on problems which concern our Organization outside the field of peace-building  the settlement of disputes and detente. This is not because I underestimate the importance of seeking a de-escalation of tensions between States in many parts of the world; indeed  unless such relations are improved and peace preserved none of the other matters of which I have spoken will have much relevance. But we must face the fact that it is in this area of activity that world public opinion has expected more from the United Nations than it could possibly perform and where at the same time the Organization has at times performed less well than might have been expected even by realistic and reasonable people. This disparity between expectations and performance has damaged the credibility of our Organization  and I have no wish to aggravate this problem by highlighting the unresolved problems that remain in  relations between States. But I think it is right to remark that there is a measure of detente since at last the futility of the cold war and its sterile polemics is recognized. The major Powers do seem to be moving  however slowly  towards a measure of accommodation with each other  although the balance thus created is not yet stable since the world has yet to learn to cope with the more complex interactions between Powers and blocs in this new situation.145.	The most explosive situation remains that of the Middle East. We regret that its solution does not seem to have been brought any nearer  though we realize how grave are the problems involved end the difficulties facing diplomacy. We welcomed the visit of the Secretary-General to the countries of the Middle East  under the aegis of the Security Council. We can but hope that that visit may result in some initiatives which might break the present deadlock and help the process of diplomacy in securing peace between the parties  in finding a peaceful solution to their problems based on acceptance by all countries concerned of Security Council resolution 242(1967). In the meantime the major Powers can help towards a solution by adopting a genuinely neutral attitude towards the contending interestsrather than  as has been the case in the past  aligning themselves with either side  thus converting this tragically divided region into a mini-cockpit of the cold war. They could also help by agreeing amongst themselves to refrain from arming the two sides in a manner that can only make a recurrence of violence more likely and more bloody if it occurs. The intransigence of the parties to this dispute has in the past been intensified rather than eased by the actions of outside States pursuing what they have conceived to be their own interests through involvement with the contending parties. Hopefully  this phase is coming to an end  and with that the chances of peace in the area should be enhanced.146.	Before concluding  I must refer to the tragic situation in Northern Ireland. The conflict that has torn apart that little community of 1.5 million people  costing almost a thousand lives and injuries to many thousands of others while reducing large areas of its urban centres to rubble  has yet to be resolved  but there are signs that a solution may be found in the months ahead. None dare put it more hopefully than that.147.	The divisions that have contributed to this tragedy owe much to history. Fear lies at the root of the situation-the fears of the majority in that area that they might against their will be forced to become a minority within an all-Ireland republic and the fears of the minority in Northern Ireland for their future in a situation dominated by a frightened majority. Those two communities in Northern Ireland  locked into a situation of apparently inevitable and endless conflict  differ somewhat in their origins. But unlike  for example  the more deeply divided communities in the island of Cyprus  they speak the same language  English. In the absence of linguistic differences  the most evident distinction between the two communities happens to be one of religion  and it is this that has given the conflict its anachronistic reputation of being a religious war. Differences on points of dogma between Christian denominations have little to do with the conflict between the two communities  however.148.	The fears of the northern majority are the key to this situation  for it is their actions in response to those fears that pose a threat to the lives and well-being of the minority in Northern Ireland. If those fears  aggravated by the uncertainties and physical distress of the past four years  could be eased  the problem of Northern Ireland would be on the way to solution. My Government has a role to play here. We do not seek to impose or to have imposed on the people of Northern Ireland any solution unacceptable to a majority there.J49. We know that any attempt to impose such a solution could only multiply the bloodshed and the bitterness. It is the people of Ireland we seek to unite; the territory of Ireland is nothing without its people. And this unity of the people of Ireland can be secured only in peace and reconciliation  with the consent of a majority of the inhabitants of Northern Ireland.150. The solution now proposed to this terrible problem is one on which broad agreement exists between my Government and that of the United Kingdom. It entails the establishment of a new executive in Northern Ireland  comprising elected members of the Northern Ireland Assembly  drawn from parties representative of both communities; the reform of the police and civil service in Northern Ireland so that they may be acceptable to the minority community as well as to the majority; and the creation of a Council of Ireland  with equal representation Iat executive level for Northern Ireland-which has half the Republic's population-and functions in relation to economic co-operation between the two parts of Ireland. That Council must have the power to evolve and to undertake new functions  but the pace of any such evolution must be governed by the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland. The desire of the minority to identify with the new institutions should be recognized  and also their concern that justice will be fairly administered.151.	We believe that this policy reconciles the concerns of the majority in Northern Ireland with the legitimate aspirations of the great majority of the Irish people to national unity. It is a policy of reconciliation; it is a policy which we believe we can submit to this Assembly as one in full accord with the principles of the United Nations. And I hope  and I believe  that my Government will enjoy the sympathy and understanding of the States represented here in pursuing such a policy.152.	Should we fail in our efforts  together with the United Kingdom Government  to secure a solution along those lines  the situation could become grave indeed. I hope and pray that we shall not fail  and that I shall not at any time in the future have to come before the General Assembly to seek your assistance in finding a way out of the dangerous and tragic situation that could then arise."
"53",3275,"IRN",28,1973,"﻿164.	The election to the high office of President of this session of the General Assembly of Mr. Benites  the representative of Ecuador  is not only the culmination of his long and distinguished service to the United Nations  but a telling reflection of the esteem in which his country and he are held within the community of nations. It is also a symbolic acknowledgement of the growing voice of Latin America in world affairs. It is most gratifying for me to greet him on behalf of Iran on this auspicious occasion  all the more so as our two countries have just recently agreed to exchange Ambassadors.165.	I deem it my pleasant duty to pay a warm tribute to his distinguished predecessor  Mr. Trepczynski  who guided the work of the General Assembly last year with courage and distinction.166.	We reiterate our admiration and support for Secretary-General Waldheim and wish him to know how deeply we appreciate all that he does to advance the purposes of the Charter and thus the interests of peace.167.	A few days ago  the General Assembly made history by admitting the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic to the membership in the Organization. The significance of this step goes beyond its material value in decisively advancing the goal of universality. This decision has high symbolic value in that it marked the end of an era. The pattern now set may well be followed by countries in a similar position in other regions of the world.168.	I wish also to welcome to our midst the new State of the Bahamas and express our best wishes for the prosperity and well-being of its people.169.	Much good work was done last year to reinforce the fabric of peace. I am thinking primarily of the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam. I am also thinking of the New Delhi Agreement of 28 August 1973 between Pakistan and India; of the conclusion of the Treaty on the Principles of Relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic;  of the fruitful summit talks held last June between President Nixon and Mr. Brezhnev; of further signs of flexibility in the respective positions of North and South Korea; of the long awaited Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and of many other events that have added substance to the process of detente.170.	One can take comfort in the thought that conciliation is now a habit-forming process in our international life. To be sure  there still remains much that mars this process. Peace is not yet in sight in the Middle East  and remains a fragile condition in South-East Asia  in spite of efforts to buttress it. The international community is also plagued by the recurrence of acts of international terrorism by individuals  groups and States alike.171.	It is against the background of this dichotomy that I wish to turn briefly to some of the issues affecting our common interests. A while ago I referred to the Agreement of 27 January ending the war in Viet-Nam. The shaky ground on which this Agreement is being preserved is no reflection on its significance as a basis for viable peace in South-East Asia and on the extraordinary amount of good will and negotiating skill that have gone into its making. The magnitude of this achievement should indeed be measured against the background of 28 years of incessant hostilities and the depth of alienation they had caused.172.	My Government sincerely hopes that those who joined at Paris to end the war in Viet-Nam will continue to co-operate with one another to make the agreement a viable instrument of peace and a vehicle to achieve a peaceful unification of Viet-Nam. The viability of the Agreement  however  can only be preserved through scrupulous adherence   by all sides  to all its provisions.173.	My Government  having recently established diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and being equally friendly with the Republic of South Viet-Nam  will spare no opportunity to contribute to the restoration of peace in Viet-Nam  and in this spirit has agreed to assume responsibility as a member of the International Commission of Control and Supervision.174.	In a wider context  the end of the war in Viet-Nam has eased the process of detente and its soothing effects have been felt in the improved relations among major Powers. One of the happy products of this process  this year  was the United States-Soviet Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War  signed on the occasion of Mr. Brezhnev's visit to the United States.14 Though essentially a joint policy guideline  the agreement can lead to more comprehensive and binding commitments on nuclear weapons and to a more unequivocal denunciation of the use of force in international relations.175.	With regard to the question of disarmament  in our view a disarmament programme should be worked out maintaining a constant link between the partial measures and the final goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control.176.	In the absence of such a programme and until the goal of general and complete disarmament is achieved  countries cannot fail to look after their defence requirements. But efforts aimed at the realization of the goal of general and complete disarmament must be pursued  and I can say  as far as Iran is concerned  that we have not failed to do our part in a constructive spirit.177.	In this connexion  there seems to be no reason which could justify a lukewarm attitude towards effective disarmament measures  especially on the questions of cessation of all nuclear-weapon tests and the prohibition of chemical weapons  areas which are designated by the General Assembly as ""first"" or ""high"" priority.178.	Last year marked another failure in attempts to break the deadlock in the Middle East  but the abortive debate at the Security Council reflected a world-wide disenchantment over the retention of Arab lands. We heard the embittered world opinion  voiced by representatives of so many nations  including my own  clearly rejecting the retention of occupied Arab territories by Israel.179.	Negotiations among the parties can only be undertaken if there is a reasonable guarantee for the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab territories and for the realization of all other provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  including a just solution for the problem of Palestinian-Arab refugees.180.	Iran continues to maintain that that resolution provides the most practicable and viable framework for peace. We sincerely hope that renewed efforts by the Secretary-General will help to form the climate of peace. His recent bid to help break the deadlock in' the Middle East conflict  which took him to the countries directly involved  was as courageous as it was timely. Against the background of six years of frustrated peace-making efforts  no opportunity  no matter how dim its prospects  should be missed without having been fully explored.181.	Terrorism continues to be a source of concern for the international community. Last year I had the opportunity to express from this rostrum1 s our sense of dismay and abhorrence of acts of violence involving threats to or loss of lives of innocent people. On several occasions since  we have elaborated our position  never failing to call for strong  international action. In doing so  we have  of course  been keenly conscious of the complexities involved in this issue and the fact that radical treatment will have to deal necessarily with the source and not merely the manifestation of the evil. But neither this conviction nor the controversy surrounding this issue has lessened our proclivity for action against terrorism parallel with the study of its underlying causes.182.	This conviction is reinforced by the thought that not all terrorist outrages are rooted in injustice  and where such casual relationship exists  not ail its. victims can be implicated in the cause of the grievance. If we make Jaws to regulate the behaviour of States in armed conflicts in order to protect civilians and those unconnected with the war  we cannot concede a free hand to individuals and groups  or for that matter to States  to jeopardize the lives of innocents.183.	In this connexion  a cruel example is aircraft hijacking and other acts of violence directed against civil aviation. Commission of these acts for political purposes has become increasingly counter-productive. We  like many others  cannot refrain from expressing our dismay over the half-hearted reactions to this international plague. If our efforts are to be effective  there should be conceited action by all States  on a world basis  for the prevention as well as the suppression of aircraft hijacking and related offences. In this connexion regional and bilateral arrangements are also of paramount importance; and here I would like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the fact that on 7 August this year  a bilateral agreement on co-operation for the prevention of hijacking aircraft was signed between Iran and the Soviet Union in Moscow. 184.	Iran warmly welcomes the breakthrough achieved on 28 August in negotiations between India and Pakistan which provides for a settlement of a range of issues resulting from the 1971 armed conflict. A victory of reason  the agreement bears a distinct mark of statesmanship displayed by the leaders of all parties directly involved. In voicing our support for this outstanding diplomatic achievement  I wish to express our fervent hope for a quick settlement of the remaining details that will be taken up in the ensuing tripartite talks among Pakistan  India and Bangladesh.185.	A few days ago  in this hall  we listened to the inspiring address of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of Pakistan [2122nd meeting]. We know that the environment of peace now prevailing in the subcontinent is to no little extent a product of his courage and resourcefulness. We wish him well in his pursuit of peace and in overcoming a multitude of other problems.186.	Peace in the subcontinent is an essential ingredient of security in our region  and to preserve it we shall continue to seek the friendship and co-operation of all concerned. It is a source of satisfaction for my delegation to note that this spirit is now fully reflected in our relations with India and is reinforced by strong economic and cultural ties.187.	The principles Iran upholds internationally have enabled us to expand our bonds of friendship and co-operation with countries of diverse social and economic structures and political orientation. With one notable exception  our relations with all our neighbours are close  friendly and productive. Our ties with our great northern neighbour  the Soviet Union  represent a full spectrum of fruitful collaboration. This was further expanded last year through the conclusion of a 15-year economic and technical co-operation treaty  which was signed on the occasion of a State visit to the Soviet. Union by my august Sovereign in October 1972. A visit to Iran last March by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union  Mr. Kosygin and a return visit by our Prime Minister to the Soviet Union are symbolic of a new vision and hope in the relations of the two countries.188.	Our relations with Afghanistan are nurtured by deep-rooted ties  a common cultural heritage  good-neighbourly relations and mutual respect and co-operation.189.	With Turkey and Pakistan we continue to maintain exemplary relations of fraternity.190.	It is only in respect of our western neighbour  Iraq  that our efforts to normalize relations have not yet succeeded. I do not wish to reopen here old grievances. Iran has repeatedly offered to resolve its problems with Iraq in accordance with the accepted norms of international law and practice of States and with due regard to the principles of equity and mutual rights and tire interests of both parties.191.	In the Persian Gulf  from which some 5 million barrels of our oil are shipped daily to the world markets  our policy has been one of vigilance and co-operation. We have insisted that the area should remain free from big-Power rivalries and that the preservation of the security of the waterway should be the duty of the littoral States through co-operation among them all. To ensure the free outflow of oil from the Persian Gulf and the stability of its maritime routes  we seek the co-operation of all the littoral States  all of which have much at stake in this enterprise.192.	To the great continent of Africa we once again pledge our solidarity. We have supported the African cause against colonialism and racism with sustained alacrity at the United Nations and elsewhere. This support will remain a dynamic feature of our policy as we expand our bilateral ties with a growing number of African States. Since early last year Iran has established diplomatic relations with Kenya  Nigeria  Somalia  Sudan  Chad  Zaire and Zambia. It is our hope and our expectation that our relations with all the countries of the third world will continue to multiply and bear fruit in the corning years.193.	The third world is still gripped by the basic problems that have defined its trade relationship with the industrialized nations. Enough has been said of the hazards of a continuation of the present trends in international trade to obviate further exhortations. Here we no longer deal with sacrifices to be expected from one particular group of States to accommodate the needs and the development requirements of another. One of the striking realities of our time is the transformation of our world into an interdependent entity from which there can be no disengagement. This interdependence is particularly discernible on the economic plane. The developed economies  expanded beyond national frontiers  are dependent not only upon shrinking markets abroad but more - and this increasingly so - on the profits accrued from their external investments. The industrialized countries  while having to cope with the problems arising from monetary instability and the trade relationship among themselves  have to meet a growing and better-articulated demand from (he third world for fair play in international trade.194.	Facts surrounding this issue are complex and carry a built-in warning to all those who care to note it While the world consumption of raw material increases in astronomical proportions  mainly as a result of demand by the industrialized nations  the cash value of these resources  mainly in the hands of less developed nations  cannot and should not remain the same. Moreover  the purchasing power of the exporters of these commodities that is to say  the less developed nations-should not be subjected to fluctuations resulting either from monetary instability or unchecked  inflation in the industrialized world.195.	My own country's development efforts am provide a good example. Our current development programme would require us to spend in the next five years tens of billions of dollars on imports  against a Fixed foreign exchange income derived mainly from oil and other raw materials. Obviously  we cannot allow our purchasing power to diminish as a result of events in the shaping of which we have no voice or responsibility.196.	The pursuit of our national goals readied a new climax this year in an agreement  concluded at Teheran on 31 July 1973 with the operating international oil com-"
"54",3322,"IRQ",28,1973,"﻿51.	I should like at the outset of this statement to join those who have preceded me in congratulating you from this rostrum on the occasion of your election as President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly and to reaffirm our confidence in your ability to fulfil the duties of your high office by virtue of your long experience in the international arena and your distinguished qualities of astuteness and high competence. I should not fail to reiterate on this occasion our appreciation for  and satisfaction with  the important part taken by your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Trepczynski  in guiding the deliberations of the previous session.52.	I should also like to express our welcome to the new Members who have joined the ranks of the Organization  thus bringing it closer to being a truly international Organization. The principle of the universality of this Organization is one that Iraq has constantly striven to achieve. It gives me pleasure to extend a special welcome to the German Democratic Republic  h which Iraq has the closest ties of friendship and co-operation. We are confident that the presence of that State within the United Nations will contribute in an effective manner to the strengthening of international security and international co-operation. We also are ready to establish the best relations in all fields with the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.53.	It also gives me pleasure to declare here Iraq's welcome for the independence of Guinea-Bissau. We fully support the Government of Guinea-Bissau and look forward to their representatives occupying their seats in this Organization as soon as possible.54.	The convening of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly provides the international community with an important opportunity to review the international developments that have taken place during the past year and the effects of those developments on the policies of the States Members of the Organization. Iraq  following closely and with interest the developments on the international scene  avails itself of this opportunity  which is characteristic of the United Nations  to present its views on the most important of them.55.	The past year was marked by two outstanding events which  in spite of the differences between them  together constitute two complementary steps towards the fulfilment of the desire of the peoples of the world to establish an international community where peace reigns and where the principles of justice and freedom are realized.56.	The first event was the increase in further steps towards closer ties and co-operation among the great Powers and the establishment of the foundation of new relationships that would decrease international tension and the dangers of a nuclear war. The people of Iraq  who share the expectations of the peoples of the third world in achieving a just peace  welcomes these developments and calls upon the international Organization to play its part and to participate fully in furthering and strengthening this vital development  making international participation a firm base for a new international order.57.	The second event was the convening of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries in Algiers  where for the first time in the history of the non-aligned movement the great majority of the States Members of the United Nations were represented. The non-aligned movement has played an important and effective role in lessening international tension  in advocating the policy of peaceful coexistence  and in reaffirming the right of peoples to participate in the establishment of an international order governed by the principles of justice  freedom and peace  as President Ahmed Hassan Al-Bakr of Iraq has confirmed on numerous occasions. It is for that reason that the convening of the Algiers Conference at this particular juncture was of special significance for the assessment of the non-aligned movement and for outlining its direction within the new international developments. The Conference proved yet again the importance and effectiveness of the non-aligned movement and the part it will play within the United Nations and outside it in the maintenance of international security and in safeguarding the rights of the developing countries of the third world. Under the leadership of the Arab Baath Socialist Party  the policy of non-alignment constitutes a basic principle in the foreign policy of the Republic of Iraq. Having had the honour of participating in the Algiers Conference  Iraq would like to express its pleasure at the important results of the Conference and to confirm its determination to work diligently to implement the decisions taken in Algiers.58.	If the positive trends in international relations arouse feelings of optimism for the future  there are also negative developments and chronic problems that still threaten international security with great dangers. These problems call for firm and urgent measures to prevent a further deterioration of the situation. Perhaps the recent events that took place in Chile are the clearest demonstration of such a tragic deterioration. The words uttered last year before this Assembly [2096th meeting] by the constitutionally elected President of Chile  the late Mr. Salvador Allende  are still alive in our memories. Mr. Allende was describing the plight of many areas of the world when he warned of the dangers of the conspiracies hatched by the forces of colonialism and international monopolies against the freedom of peoples and their independence.59.	In Asia  in spite of the world's glad expectations aroused by the reaching of a peace agreement to end the singularly inhuman war waged by the United States of America against the struggling people of Viet-Nam  we find that the agreement  which was regarded as the beginning of the end of American military intervention in South-East Asia  did not in fact stop the bloodshed in that area  but rather became itself the target of continuous manoeuvres attempting to impose the Saigon regime on the people of South Viet-Nam.60.	In spite of the great victories achieved by the people of Cambodia under the leadership of the Government of National Union  the United States of America continues to prolong the war at the expense of the legitimate interests of the Cambodian people  thereby threatening international peace and security. On this occasion we would like to state our belief that it is the duty of the United Nations  in conformity with its Charter  to see that the true representatives of the Cambodian people are given the opportunity to occupy their seats in this Organization.61.	As for developments in Korea  Iraq has welcomed all the measures taken to enable the Korean people to achieve unity and to banish the American forces of occupation from its territory. Iraq also believes that the duty of the United Nations to put an end to mockery of having its flag hoisted over the barracks of the American forces of occupation  forces which have brought nothing but misery and suffering to whichever land they have trodden in Asia.62.	In the African continent  which has been subjected to the worst kinds of colonialism and exploitation  the Governments of the white minority regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia continue to practise their abhorrent racist policies against the peoples of those lands  in defiance of the denunciation and revulsion of the whole world  as embodied in the resolutions of the United Nations. The Portuguese forces of occupation  whose detestable practices are daily being exposed  persist in defying the United Nations and denying the peoples their right to self- determination. Iraq expresses without reservation its full support for the struggle of the African peoples striving towards freedom and independence and the preservation of their natural wealth  and calls upon the international Organization to exert all its efforts to assist their just struggle.63.	The sufferings of the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America recur most glaringly in the Arab region  an area beset by problems and dangers threatening at any moment an explosion that will confront the world with unimaginable consequences. The continuation of this abnormal state of affairs in the region faces the whole of the international community with a fateful trial  and arouses  doubt and scepticism about all the positive achievements in the field of international relations.64.	Twenty-six years have elapsed since the Zionists launched their aggression against the people of Palestine; seven years have passed since the Zionists attacked three States Members of this international Organization and have continued to occupy parts of their territories. In spite of the fact that the United Nations was and still is a responsible party in the present crisis  it has not achieved any progress towards the elimination of aggression and the implementation of the principles of the Charter in the area. I regret to say that what has taken place is the exact opposite. The dispersion of the people of Palestine  the denial of their legitimate rights in their homeland  continues to be the policy declared and enforced by Israel; a policy that has taken all the dimensions of a campaign of genocide against the exiled people. The air-raids on the refugee camps  the massacre of children  women and the aged  the murder of the Palestinian leaders according to a programme of terrorism  and the continuation of systematic violence and ejection in the occupied territories  are the Zionist policies which violate all the fundamentals of justice and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.65.	In the occupied territories Israel persists in its programme of settler-colonialism by daily establishing new paramilitary settlements in Gaza  Sinai  the Golan Heights and on the occupied bank of the Jordan. The Judaization of Jerusalem  the defacement of that city's historical landmarks  which are part of the heritage of the whole of mankind  continue unabated and undeterred.66.	Israel is no longer abashed or concerned over the exposure of its plans and policies. This indifference is best shown in the election platform adopted by the ruling Israeli Labour Party concerning the colonization of the occupied territories  a policy which was described by a member of that Party as ""creeping annexation"". Furthermore  Israel's repeated aggressions against Syria and Lebanon have become almost daily occurrences  and the matter has gone even further than what has come to be expected of Israeli aggression and lawlessness. Israel has assumed for itself the role of an international policeman in the area  attacking the neighbouring States and abducting its people to try them before Israeli courts  for no crimes committed within Israel and in contravention of all the norms of international law. The Israeli Air Force has been entrusted with a new task  namely  the hijacking or shooting down of civilian airliners and killing their innocent passengers. These crimes  which are prohibited by all international codes  make us pause to inquire  how was it possible that such acts could be committed with such impunity?67.	It is absurd to say that the international community  with the great moral authority at its disposal and the adequate means of deterrence granted to it by the Charter  is yet incapable of putting an end to Israel's crimes. Nor can Israel's arrogance  aggression  its contempt for the United Nations  its resolutions and its Charter  be interpreted as the mere intransigence of a small State which behaves like an international outlaw.68.	To understand this behaviour we have to face an unpalatable fact of international life: Israel is not the only culprit  but a major Power is engaged in practising annexation by proxy. That Power is the United States of America. The arms with which Israel fights are the arms of the United States  the military expertise which Israel deploys in its aggressions is the expertise of the United States  and the funds with which new settlements are implanted on Arab lands are the funds of the United States. And  last but not least  the protective voice which paralyzes the Security Council so that it may not punish Israel  is the veto of the United States. No wonder that this kind of morality in foreign policy has insidiously crept into the very fabric of United States political life to the abhorrence and bewilderment of the people of the United States.69.	Our Arab nation  and most people of the world  are now fully aware of the nature and the objectives of the aggression launched by the Zionists against the Arab people. Our ancient nation  inspired by its history  confident in the future of its struggle  will never submit to any aggressor or accept surrender.70.	Our struggle will be long and arduous; but our cause is just and noble  and it rightly enjoys the support of the peoples of the world. The termination of the Zionist occupation of the Arab lands  and the restoration of the right of self-determination to the people of Palestine in its homeland  will soon become a living reality. The Arab nation  burdened with the struggle to attain a goal which is of the essence of the purposes of the Charter  realizes full well that the international community  too  has its own share of responsibility in that struggle  and awaits expectantly the moment when that community shall rise to the challenge of fulfilling its responsibilities in the matter.71.	There is another crisis whose developments and consequences are bound to affect the future of security in our area  and international security as well. I am referring here to the policy of Iran in the Arabian Gulf region. Recent statements emanating from the highest sources in Iran indicate their inclination to resort to the use of force and to interfere in the internal affairs of the States in the area  on the assumption that Iran will play the role of the great and ""protecting"" Power in the Arabian Gulf. The ominous implications of those statements are confirmed by Iran's embarkation upon huge armament programmes which cannot be justified on the grounds that they are needed for defensive purposes. Iraq's concern in regard to these developments is fully justified by the sad recent history of Iraqi-Iranian and Arab-Iranian relations. Late in 1971 Iran forcefully occupied three Arab islands and  prior to that  in contravention of the Charter  declared its unilateral abrogation of the Iraqi-Iranian Boundary Treaty  signed at Teheran on 4 July 1937.72.	The Foreign Minister of Iran mentioned in his statement before this Assembly on 25 September that Iran's efforts to normalize relations with Iraq had not succeeded. He also claimed that Iran had repeatedly offered to resolve its problems with Iraq in accordance with accepted norms of international law and practice of States  with due regard to the principles of equity and mutual rights and the interests of both parties.73.	I regret to say that the basis of the problems between Iraq and Iran is Iran's violation of those very norms of international law in accordance with which the Foreign Minister of Iran claims that he wishes to solve these problems. The boundaries in Shatt-al-Arab are established on the basis of an existing treaty which should be the first instrument to be implemented in order to resolve any problems concerning those boundaries. Perhaps the Foreign Minister of Iran has forgotten that the foremost rule of international law and the one which is due the highest respect is the principle of the sanctity of treaties  pacta sunt servanda. Iran claims that it can abrogate the Boundary Treaty unilaterally; this claim reveals the extent of Iran's respect for the norms of international law. The very nature of boundary treaties  as confirmed in article 62  paragraph 2 (a) and in article 65 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties   refutes all the claims put forth by Iran to justify its abrogation of the said Treaty.74.	Iraq has repeatedly offered Iran recourse to the International Court of Justice to find out whether Iran had the right to terminate the boundary Treaty. This offer demonstrates our respect for the norms of international law. We expect a positive response from our neighbour Iran if it truly cares about international law and its principles  justice and mutual interests.75.	The considerations which command the special attention of the international community where safeguarding the principles of the Charter in the Middle East is concerned  should have yet another important consideration added to them  namely  the fact that the region contains the major deposits of energy resources in the world.76.	This important fact calls for an objective attitude on the part of all those who are interested in ascertaining that the energy resources shall continue to flow from the producing countries to the consumer States. For decades international monopolies have greedily bled the developing countries of their natural resources regardless of the legitimate interests of the producing countries. The growth of national awareness  however  and closer co-operation among the developing countries have impelled the majority of the countries producing energy resources — Iraq being foremost among them — to assert their sovereignty over their natural resources  the better to serve the objectives of their national development.77.	The increasing demand for energy throughout the world cannot be met by hysterical cries from imperialist sources aimed at imposing their will upon the oil-producing countries. Iraq  itself an oil-producing country  believes that the orderly flow of energy resources demands the establishment of objective relationships between the producing and the consumer State. These relationships must be based on the principles of equality  respect for national aspirations  sovereignty and the inherent right of nations to control their natural resources. We hope it is realized that threats of the use of force and publicized desert-war manoeuvres are the surest way of bringing about a disruption of the flow of oil.78.	In its twenty-eighth year the United Nations can claim many accomplishments that time does not permit me to recount. The peoples of the United Nations and the founding fathers of the Charter envisaged a role for the Organization in keeping peace and security which we have so far failed to attain. Iraq  however  is not despondent nor disdainful. Our faith in the spirit of man  his unrequited quest for justice  liberty and for a world in which  irrespective of colour  race or creed  humanity can join hands in marching towards a better future  is our ideal of the United Nations. That is why we are here."
"55",3369,"ISL",28,1973,"﻿111.	 Mr. President  at the outset permit me to congratulate you on your election as President of this twenty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly. I wish you all success in this high office and pledge you the full confidence and support of my delegation.112.	Allow me also to pay a tribute to the Secretary- General for his tireless efforts in promoting the cause of the United Nations. I recall with pleasure the visit of the Secretary-General to Iceland earlier this year  which my Government and the people of Iceland appreciated highly.113.	I want join my colleagues who have spoken before me in welcoming the new Members of the United Nations —  the Federal Republic of Germany  the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. We look forward to their valued contributions to our Organization.114.	Now I should like to refer briefly to what we think should be the role of the United Nations in the world today and what we see as the main purpose and objectives of the Organization 28 years after its foundation.115.	Iceland is one of the smallest Members of the United Nations and  since we joined in 1946  we have seen our membership of this Organization as a corner-stone of our foreign policy. A small nation has no less than the big Powers a vested interest in solving the political and security-related problems of our times and in maintaining an effective international organization that can successfully deal with the manifold challenges of international society. Our experience has shown that regional arrangements  however desirable  cannot always meet the wishes and interests of the smaller Members  which gain wider support and sympathy in a world body of a truly universal character.116.	There can be no doubt that the necessity for global co-operation in the political  economic and social fields has never been greater than today. The question is  therefore  how we can best make the United Nations an effective instrument for furthering such co-operation. In this respect we should like to emphasize what Secretary-General Waldheim has said in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add. 1/  that the United Nations cannot successfully deal with disputes unless it has the full support and political backing of the international community. From the simple fact that this is not always the case stems much of the disillusion and disappointment frequently expressed when the record of the United Nations is debated. We need a much clearer understanding of the fact that the United Nations is not a supra-national government but an instrument of negotiation and multilateral diplomacy. Assertions that the United Nations has been ineffective in solving conflicts endangering world peace  such as the war in Viet-Nam  and has so far failed to bring peace to the Middle East must be viewed against this background. This does not mean  however  that we should not strive to make the United Nations a more effective organization with much wider powers than it has now  to enable it to act on its own in times of crises.117.	What we want is not a debating club or a forum for pursuing narrow national policies but an organization which can play a strong and active role in finding solutions to the most controversial problems of our times. This might mean restructuring the United Nations machinery  but the gain would be a stronger instrument of world order capable of safeguarding the common interests of mankind. We must remember that the United Nations was created nearly 30 years ago to cope with a world in many respects very different from the one we live in today. While turning the United Nations into a much more effective instrument for world peace  we must adapt to new needs and interests  foremost among them being those of the newly independent countries whose position and voice in the Councils of the United Nations should be strengthened. The concepts of colonial times  with their legal and moral anachronisms  must be eliminated.118.	However  if it is sometimes necessary to focus attention on the shortcomings of the international institutions and their achievements  we can note with satisfaction definite progress on a number of highly problematical international issues since we last met in this Assembly hall.119.	The Korean question has long been one of the difficult and most controversial issues in the United Nations. With the start of direct talks between North Korea and South Korea a welcome change has taken place which has led to the invitation to both Governments to come before this Assembly and state their cases. After 23 years the United Nations Commission on the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea has in its report to the Secretary- General [A/9027] recommended its own liquidation. That will be another positive step in normalizing relations between the two Korean States. There remains  however  the question of the United Nations Command in South Korea. Its future is a question to be resolved by the Security Council  as it has a direct bearing on the maintenance of peace in the area. We hope that the time will soon come when we can welcome the Korean States as new Members of this Organization.120.	A major step forward was the joining of the Organization by both German States. This event represents the pinnacle of the tireless efforts for the normalization of relations on the European scene  crystallizing in the accords between the two German States  and between the FederalRepublic of Germany and the Soviet Union and Poland. These have been among the most hopeful sings of our times and have greatly contributed to the general search for peace in the world.121.	Similarly high hopes are fixed on the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which opened in Helsinki in July this year and is now in its second stage in Geneva.122.	The time has come to eliminate the barriers that have divided the peoples of Europe in spite of their common history and cultural heritage. We must strive not only for a mutual reduction of forces in this area  but also for greatly increased co-operation in the economic field and closer contacts among the common people. The goal is a unified Europe which can contribute greatly towards the establishment of a lasting peace in the world.123.	We see a long list of items of concern to the international community on the agenda of this General Assembly. The question of decolonization merits special mention. We cannot but recognize the fact that millions of people are still living under the yoke of colonialism  deprived of their fundamental human rights. This is so in spite of repeated efforts by the United Nations throughout the years. The major blame must be put on the Governments concerned which have  year after year  consistently ignored the resolutions and directives of the United Nations  in particular with respect to southern Africa.124.	The process of decolonization must be accelerated and every pressure put on those Governments that persist in refusing to grant peoples under their domination basic human rights. As a country that has been under foreign domination for 500 years and that has become only recently independent  we fully appreciate the appeals from those still under foreign domination. Withholding freedom and independence from millions of people  not only in southern Africa but elsewhere  constitutes a major obstacle to the relaxation of international tension and may indeed lead to armed conflict if persisted in. We address an urgent appeal therefore to those nations that still practise oppression and colonialism to adhere to the course charted by the United Nations in these matters.125.	Indeed  the United Nations should strive to persuade Governments to live up to the universal Declaration of Human Rights  which certainly is one of the most important documents created by this Organization. We must also try to make the United Nations a more humane Organization  concerned not only with the problems of States and high-level diplomacy  but also with the hopes and aspirations of the common man  under whatever system of government he may be living.126.	In the field of economic and social affairs the United Nations has a record of long and praiseworthy accomplishments  one of them being the establishment of the United Nations Environment Programme at the last General Assembly [resolution 2997 (XXVII)]. There is an urgent need not only to protect the human environment but also to conserve and wisely husband the world's dwindling natural resources. This can best be done by ensuring effective control by each country over its natural resources  be they found on land  on the sea-bed or in the superjacent waters. Only a few weeks ago the meeting of the non-aligned countries in Algiers proclaimed that any infringement of the right to effective control by each country over its natural resources ""is contrary to the aims and principles of the United Nations Charter and hampers the development of international co-operation as well as the maintenance of international peace and security"". 127.	Indeed  at its last session the General Assembly spoke out with no uncertain voice on this subject. By adopting resolution 3016 (XXVII) with 102 votes against none  the vast majority of the nations of the world reaffirmed the right of States to permanent sovereignty over all their natural resources  including those of the sea-bed and the marine resources of the superjacent waters.128.	This basic principle has since been reaffirmed by two other United Nations bodies  first by the Committee on Natural Resources at its third meeting in New Delhi last February  and then by the Economic and Social Council at its fifty-fourth meeting  last April and May  in resolution 1737 (LIV).129.	There need therefore not exist the slightest doubt that it is the will of the United Nations that nations enjoy full sovereignty over the marine resources of the continental shelf and the sea-bed area far beyond the old 12-mile limit. And it behoves me to draw attention to the fact that such resource jurisdiction is precisely what the Government of Iceland has promulgated through the adoption of our 50-mile fishery limit last year in partial implementation of our 1948 Continental Shelf Law. We have  therefore  acted in complete conformity with the tenets proclaimed by the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly regarding permanent sovereignty of States over their natural resources. Indeed  the adoption of resolution 3016 (XXVII) by over 100 States is an implied recognition by the international community of extended fisheries jurisdiction over the continental shelf waters.130.	In resolution 3016 (XXVII)  it is furthermore declared that all actions by States aimed at coercing other States in the exercise of their sovereign rights over their coastal resources are in violation of the Charter.131.	A year ago  I drew the attention of the General Assembly to the dangerous situation which already then prevailed in the waters around Iceland  where my Government had adopted fishery limits of 50 miles from the coast. It is with great regret that I now must report that the situation not only has not been improved but has greatly deteriorated. It has been intensified through continued British trawling in the area under the protection of British vessels of war. These vessels of war  furthermore  operate in co-operation with British military aircraft surveying the area and reporting to the war vessels the position of Icelandic coast guard vessels. The war vessels have repeatedly ignored international rules of navigation and rammed our coast guard vessels. This constant and hostile behaviour has already led to the loss of human life. And  obviously  such a state of affairs is not only intolerable now  but could easily lead to further serious consequences. My Government has continuously protested against these warlike activities and demanded that the warships be withdrawn immediately. But so far that request has fallen on deaf ears. My Government has informed the British Government that if these activities continue  we will feel ourselves obliged to sever diplomatic relations. In view of our traditional friendship with the British people  I sincerely hope that this measure will not become necessary.132.	I want to emphasize in this connexion that my Government  before the extension of the fishery limits  indicated its willingness to negotiate a practical interim arrangement which would meet the problems of the British trawler industry because of the extension. Negotiations for this end had in fact led to considerable progress in finding a solution when the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom was sent to the area. The British point of view is that this was necessary because the British trawlers fishing within our limits were being harassed by our coast guard. The coast guard was in fact to a very limited extent trying to prevent illegal fishing within our fishery limits  which were respected by all nations other than the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany. I want to make it clear that we are still negotiating with the Federal Republic of Germany for a practical arrangement for their trawlers and it seems that a satisfactory solution is now in sight. We have already concluded agreements with Belgium  Norway and the Faroe Islands for continued fishing for a limited period by a specified number of their vessels under licence. Until we had concluded these agreements  our friends from Belgium  Norway and the Faroe Islands respected our 50-mile limit and stayed outside.133.	In fact  no fishing vessels from any country other than the United Kingdom have continued fishing inside our limits under the protection of vessels of war. Only the British trawlers have done that  and are still doing that. This I have to report to the General Assembly of the United Nations today.134.	This unfortunate state of affairs shows the urgent need for avoiding any unnecessary delay in convening the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Therefore  I want to use this opportunity and this occasion to summarize the views of my Government with regard to that urgent matter.135.	The Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction has devoted much time and effort to the preparation of the Conference and its report will soon be discussed in the First Committee of the Assembly. Under the terms of its resolution 3029 A (XXVII)  the Assembly decided to review at this session the progress of the preparatory work of the Committee and  if necessary  to take measures to facilitate completion of the substantive work for the Conference and any other action it may deem appropriate. In the same resolution  the General Assembly decided to convene the first session of the Conference at New York for a period of approximately two weeks in November and December 1973  for the purpose of dealing with organizational matters. It was also decided to convene the second session of the Conference for the purpose of dealing with substantive work in April and May 1974. My Government attaches great importance to the observance of this schedule or at least to avoiding any unnecessary delay.136.	The argument has been advanced that further preparatory work is required since the sea-bed Committee has not been able to produce draft articles for the Conference. In the view of my Government it must be kept in mind that the sea-bed Committee has worked on the basis of consensus. No voting took place on the various proposals submitted. It was  therefore  never to be expected that uniform draft articles could be produced by the Committee. On the other hand  the Committee has thoroughly discussed all the problems involved and alternatives are available on most issues. Perhaps the number of such alternatives might be reduced through further work  but that work could just as well be performed by the Conference itself. This problem will  of course  be further examined and discussed in the First Committee  but I repeat that  in the view of my Government  it is of the utmost importance to avoid any unnecessary delay in convening the substantive phase of the Conference  although we would not be opposed to a short delay of two or three months for the purpose of further preparation  if that is generally considered useful.137.	Fifteen years have passed since the 1958 United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Neither that Conference nor the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea of 1960 was able to solve the problem of the extent of coastal jurisdiction. Since then the progressive development of international law has been rapid  and it should now be possible for the forthcoming Conference to proceed with its work on the basis of the alternatives and consolidated texts already available. A great deal of work has been done in order to clarify the issues  and certainly the major problems are evident and ripe for treatment at the Conference.138.	The international sea-bed area is the common heritage of mankind and it must be delimited so as to make it a worthwhile concept for the developing nations  and machinery must be established with sufficient powers and functions to ensure the practical implementation of that concept. Valuable texts dealing with these problems are available.139.	The problems of pollution and scientific research must be solved in the light of the valuable work of the sea-bed Committee. The important problems of islands  archipelagos and land-locked States also have been discussed at length. Within the confines of a relatively narrow territorial sea of up to 12 miles  the problems connected with straits used for international navigation should not be insurmountable.140.	The obsolete system of dealing with coastal jurisdiction over resources in terms of a territorial sea designed for military purposes is now replaced by a functional solution in terms of an economic zone  beyond the territorial sea  of up to 200 miles  which already enjoys overwhelming support in all regions of the world. Certainly the concept of the exclusive economic zone is quite compatible with the right of navigation. Freedom of the seas has for a long time been used as an argument to protect the special interests of the powerful maritime nations  including their distant-water fisheries. That idea has now been replaced by the principle of the protection of the vital economic interests of the coastal States in their natural resources. This is clear from the positions of States in the preparatory work for the Conference  in which the representatives of 90 States and observers from 30 States-120 States in all — participated. And after all  it is the practice of States and their policy declarations that are mirrored in customary international law. It is now the task of the Conference to codify that practice.141.	The Icelandic delegations to the sea-bed Committee  on 5 April 1973  submitted a working paper which reads in part as follows:""A coastal State may determine the extent of its exclusive jurisdiction and control over the natural resources of the maritime area adjacent to its territorial sea.""The outer limits of this area shall be reasonable  keeping in view the geographical  geological  ecological  economic and other relevant local considerations  and shall not exceed 200 nautical miles.""142.	Other delegations have made similar proposals and it is now clear that the concept of an economic zone of up to 200 miles enjoys ever-increasing support from all regions of the world  as evidenced by proposals and policy statements from a great number of States in all regions of the world — Africa  Asia  Australia  Canada  Latin America and Europe. This progressive development has reached such proportions that it will not and cannot be stopped.143.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has had its work facilitated by years of tireless preparatory work. Its own work must now start and it must proceed with confidence and courage to ensure the success of the great task entrusted to it."
"56",3416,"ISR",28,1973,"﻿52.	 Mr. President  those of us who know you well take a special pride in your elevation to the presidency of the General Assembly at its twenty-eighth session. The people of Ecuador share the honour which your personal qualities have justly earned.53.	The international climate is charged with confidence and hope. Attitudes of hostility which once seemed to bean organic part of our generation's life are now giving way to patient dialogue. The Viet-Nam cease-fire  the American-Chinese encounter  the summit meetings at Moscow and Washington  the German agreements and the European treaties have been succeeded by a cease-fire in Laos  by talks between North and South Korea  and by contacts between the three States of the Indian subcontinent. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is at work  bringing a tragic era of confrontation to its end.54.	Let us leave the historians to define the precise point at which the international journey took a new direction — and the causes which inspired the change. In the meantime the results are tangible and impressive  although not yet universal. In some discussions — but not in all — the old vocabularies of abuse are being softened by a welcome air of civility. It is generally understood that coexistence must be based on a separation between viewpoints and relationships. Even when Governments differ in their ideas  their viewpoints and their policies  in their social structures and in their international orientations  they can  nevertheless  foster good relations even across the gulf of their divergences. It was the cold-war philosophy that insisted on ideological agreement or political harmony as the condition of good relations between States. The detente accepts and admits no such condition. It respects and transcends diversities of interest and outlook. Indeed  the logical conclusion of the detente is the universality of international relations. Fidelity to detente requires all States to cultivate normal relations with each other  irrespective of differences and even of conflicts in their interests or policies. At a time when States which have real conflicts of ideology  policy and interest are establishing relations with each other  it would be a grotesque paradox if States which have never had any reason to quarrel about anything were induced to weaken or to sunder their mutual ties.55.	But we shall not do service to the spirit of detente if we carry our satisfaction beyond the point of reason and truth. Free dialogue and compromise have prevailed in many disputes  but they are still rejected in others  and the victories of international conciliation in the past few years have all been won outside the United Nations structure. This indicates that the growth of world community is painfully slow  Indeed  our Secretary-General  with admirable realism  has found it necessary  in the introduction to his annualreport o n the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add. 1]  to warn us of some of the shortcomings in the work of the United Nations so far. The truth is that  while quiet  bilateral diplomacy has recorded many triumphs  strident  polemical  public debate has not brought any good result on any issue at any time. The lesson is plain. The central role of this Organization should be to promote agreements between parties to a conflict irrespective of their voting strength  and not to try to adjudicate between conflicting views on the mere basis of numerical weight. The United Nations  in short  should have a diplomatic and not a parliamentary vocation. This point was stated with great precision by the Foreign Minister of Canada. I quote his words:""... we must try to avoid barren and abrasive confrontations  which are frequently the result of formal voting processes. Consensus is another and often surer route —  Consensus does not mean the imposition of the will of the majority on a reluctant minority which feels its vital interests are at issue; it means the shared recognition of what should and can be done."" [2126th meeting  para. 60.156.	Now here  in a few words  is a basic evaluation of what may be wrong with United Nations techniques. The result is not only that successes have come outside these walls; failures have abounded within them. The discussions on international terrorism by our Ad Hoc Committee ended in fiasco  as had the debate in the General Assembly after the Munich outrage last year. In Rome the International Civil Aviation Organization sat for many weeks without being allowed to agree on any amendments to the Hague or Montreal Conventions. All Members of the United Nations are united in their ability to discuss each other's imperfections. There are majorities to be had for selective political judgements against those who do not belong to a large voting bloc. But majorities cannot always be found for objective  temperate statements free of denunciation and invective.57.	The Secretary-General's introduction to the annual report reminds us that the efforts of the United Nations in political conciliation are  in his words  ""complementary"" to ""the normal bilateral dealings of Governments"" [A/9001/ Add. 1  p. 5]. That is true. I also think that it is true that an attempt by all the Arab Governments to escape from the duty of engaging in ""the normal bilateral dealings of Governments"" to a constant reliance on public debate is one of the sources of the continuing deadlock in the Middle East. Indeed  every procedure and attitude that has proved its efficacy in other disputes has so far been ignored or rejected in our region.58.	Would we not do well then to listen to the counsel of two statesmen whose names are pre-eminent in the history of the recent detente. Chancellor Willy Brandt of the Federal Republic of Germany has told this Assembly that"".. . it is primarily direct peace talks between the Arab countries concerned and Israel that will best secure a balance of the elementary interests of both sides."" [2128th meeting  para. 63.]And Mr  Kissinger  Secretary of State of the United States  has reminded us that not even the strongest of great Powers can ""substitute for the efforts of those most directly involved"" [2124th meeting  para. 56] 59.	The absence of negotiation in the Middle East is the gravest obstacle to the termination of regional tension. But it is not the parent cause of the tension. The root of the conflict lies deeper; the root of the conflict lies in the refusal of Arab Governments to come to terms with Israel as a sovereign nation rising from the depths of Middle Eastern history to resume its place in the universal community. Not one of the Arab Governments whose representatives have spoken from this rostrum about withdrawal from territories held since 1967 has said that in order to achieve their territorial claims the Arab States would recognize Israel's rightful place amongst the free nations of the area and establish permanent peace  friendship  commerce and normal relations with Israel similar  for example  to the relations which exist between the States of Western Europe  which only a short time ago were locked in hostility and war. Many Arab spokesmen say the opposite. The Foreign Minister of Egypt  Mr. El Zayyat  has stated in the Security Council and elsewhere that beyond the 1967 armistice lines lie the frontiers proposed in a United Nations recommendation of 1947 [resolution 181 (II)]  which Egypt and other Arab Governments destroyed  as they had promised  ""by blood and fire""  and these in his learned view are the only legal frontiers. Nor would this be the end of Israel's dismantlement. An article in the official Cairo newspaper Al Gum-huriya only several days ago tells us that""The withdrawal of Israel from all the conquered Arab territories is an initial demand of the Arab States presented as a part of the comprehensive programme aimed at putting an end to the Zionist settlement in Palestine.""60.	From such statements it is not hard to deduce the meaning of the phrase about the ""legitimate aspirations of the Palestine Arab people"" when employed by those in whose eyes the sole representatives of that people are the organizations which carry out murder and banditry all over the world but usually at a discreet distance from the Middle East 61.	The plain fact is that the present Arab leadership is not satisfied with the verdict of history which has led to the constitution of 18 Arab States in an area of II million square kilometres with a population of 100 million. Arab leadership seems to be in an excited imperialist mood. It demands the elimination of Israel  a non-Arab nation  older in its roots within the Middle East than any other  more venerable than any other in the lineage of spirit and tongue that ties it to that soil  unexampled in the persistence of its national identity.62.	Israel is the very heart and core of Middle Eastern history; but Israel is a Jewish and not an Arab entity. Therefore  there are Arab leaders who cannot sustain its sovereign presence: it must be either physically eliminated or swallowed up in something else so that its ""Israel hood"" would vanish under some Arab combination or domination. In its philosophy national freedom in the Middle East is an exclusive Arab right — to be monopolized  and not to be shared. There are other expressions of this hegemonistic and exclusive spirit —  in Arab policy in the Persian Gulf and in the posturing of Colonel Qaddafi as he flaunts his opulent purse across the world. But it is in the Israeli context that the tendency to see sovereignty in the Middle East as an Arab monopoly has had its most ominous effects.63.	Now  what I have said is admittedly a stringent view of what Arab Governments seek to achieve. But unfortunately it is sustained by a great array of official statements. It is confirmed by the implacable warfare to which Israel  alone amongst all the States of the world  has been subjected since its birth. It is nourished by outrages such as the shooting in the head of the 11 Israeli athletes  tied hand and foot  on the floor of a helicopter in Munich one year ago. Such acts are possible only if the victims are regarded by the assassins as lying outside and beyond any human context. And  indeed  the Arab hostility towards Israel today joins hands with another and deadlier hatred to which it is akin. For where else  Members of the United Nations  other than in Cairo  can you imagine the publication by writers close to the seat of power of an article which I hold in my hand and from which I read the concluding extract:""In the whole world people have ended by understanding that Hitler was right  for the Jews are vampires which suck the blood of humanity. They wish to destroy the world  but the world vomits them. They have been chased from land to land; they were burned in the ovens of Hitler — 1 million  2 million  6 million. Would that he had accomplished it fully!""That is what Al Akhbar wrote on 19 August this year.64.	""Would that [Hitler] had accomplished it fully!"" This particular extract is only one example of hundreds of Nazi publications that have made Cairo a world centre of anti-Semitic ideology. As we listen to these obscenities on Cairo Radio  as we bury our dead after Munich or Lod  as we recall wars  assaults  boycotts and threats over these 25 years  as we read of the Covenant of the so-called ""Palestine Liberation Organization""  which asserts that only Arabs have sovereign rights in the Middle East  can we be reproached if we see ourselves as the target of a particularly virulent hatred  at variance with all humane values and vastly removed from anything that can be called detente?65.	In short  one of the components of Israel's policy —  and I say this in great frankness —  is a profound scepticism about the basic intention of Arab States to respect Israel's sovereignty  its national identity  its cultural legacy  its place in the Middle East and the world. There is one thing  and one thing alone  that could undermine that scepticism: negotiation.66.	For recent international experience teaches us that negotiation is not simply a procedural method: it is a principle of coexistence. Negotiation does not merely photograph established positions; it leads them towards mutual accommodation. It puts hopes and suspicions to their only viable test. At the negotiating table the discourse between the parties ceases to be rhetorical  abrasive and polemical. It becomes pragmatic  concrete  empirical. A unique kind of solidarity asserts itself between the negotiators  who become subject to the mystique of potential success and put forth their maximal effort to avoid a final break. Precisely because negotiation has such far-reaching effects  the Arab refusal to negotiate without prior conditions arouses far-reaching suspicions.67.	We have long been convinced of the need to undertake a detailed negotiation ranging freely across all the problems at issue. If this aim has not been fulfilled  we share theuniversal regret — but we disclaim culpability. We have accepted Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which calls for the establishment of permanent peace by agreement between Member States in the Middle East  including withdrawal of forces from territories occupied since 1967 to secure and recognized boundaries to be determined in the peace agreement. We proposed detailed agendas for discussion with Egypt and Jordan  We accepted Ambassador Jarring's proposal  rejected by Egypt in March 1968  for convening Israeli and Egyptian representatives in conferences under his auspices to discuss a peace settlement. When four eminent Heads of African States visited our region in 1971  they submitted six proposals in writing  to which my Prime Minister made written and appropriate response on 28 November 1971.5 The African Presidents reported that this reply  together with that of Egypt  constituted a sufficient basis to justify negotiation. We stand by those replies today. In particular  we responded to the suggestion of the African Presidents which reads as follows:""Acceptance by the two parties that 'secure and recognized boundaries' be determined in the peace agreement"".68.	In 1971  when it was pointed out that direct contact might not yet be easily acceptable to Arab Governments  we agreed to the United States procedure for proximity talks. When it was then suggested that it might be difficult to conceive a sudden transition from total deadlock to total peace  we accepted the idea of a Suez agreement involving the opening of the Canal under Egyptian administration  with a limited  agreed withdrawal of Israeli forces  even ahead of a peace settlement. We stipulated that this would not be the final withdrawal  but a phase leading to further negotiations in which the permanent and final line would be agreed upon between the parties.69.	Throughout all this period we abstained — as we still do — from changing the political and juridical status of the administered territories  and have not closed any options for a negotiated peace. We opened the river crossings and cease-fire lines to a free movement of hundreds of thousands of Arabs from areas outside Israeli jurisdiction — and indeed from all over the Arab world. We placed the Holy Places of Christendom and Islam under the administration of Christian and Moslem authorities and proposed that this principle be given appropriate statutory expression in a peace agreement. In October 1972 I suggested a meeting with Foreign Minister Riad in New York ""in order to break out of old deadlocks into a new vision and a new hope"". We utilized the good offices of foreign statesmen and other visitors to convey to Cairo and other Middle Eastern capitals our proposals for contact and dialogue in any form and at any level agreeable to the other side. We welcomed the Secretary-General of the United Nations on his visit to Member States in the Middle East  and appreciated his testimony to the will for peace that  in his words  he found in his contacts with the Government of Israel.70.	That is not an exhaustive list of all the soundings and gestures that we have made in an effort to generate a process of negotiation. Nor have we decided to despair of theprospect. But can anyone seriously believe that all these initiatives  all these responses — none of which was put in ultimative form — offered no opening whatever through which Arab Governments genuinely desiring peace could seek or accept a dialogue with us?71. The Arab reactions to these and other initiatives have always included refusals to negotiate; or refusals to acknowledge Israel's statehood at all; or an insistence that Arab positions be accepted in advance by Israel as a condition of negotiation; or a demand that the situation which preceded and in large measure provoked the war of 1967 be meticulously restored.72.	Now  there is one important thing to be noted about those positions. If all or any of them had been adopted by Governments in America  Europe and East Asia in the past few years  there would be no agreements for the General Assembly to welcome and no detente for anybody anywhere lo celebrate.73.	I turn from the past to the future. It is natural for the Israeli Government to use this opportunity of making a precise definition of the principles which move its policy. That policy is frequently and grossly misrepresented  especially at conferences from which we are excluded while our adversaries command the scene. Our policy is to seek peace and security. If the Israeli mind is intensely preoccupied with the problem of security  it is because of the particular memories that converge upon us. On one level of recollection we come face to face with a recent experience that no other family of the human race has ever undergone. The fires are out in the gas chambers  and the ashes are silent in European fields. But the memory of our 6 million kinsmen  brutally wiped off the slate of life  and the terrible agony of the million Jewish children butchered in the year of martyrdom abide with us  vivid  stark  unforgotten. And on the other level of memory there is the experience of 25 years in which our nation's progress has been secured only at a heavy price of suffering and death 74.	A people that has undergone such affliction and borne such loss is bound by historic duty lo insist on a very precise craftsmanship in the construction of peace. It will not do simply to reproduce the vulnerable and explosive situation which threatened world peace six years ago. Israel's statehood  its Jewish vocation  its name and flag and tongue are a part of the international reality now and for all time. They are axiomatic  and it is our business to maintain them in growing security.75.	We are asked whether we seek peace. The answer is  Yes  that is our central aim  the destination of all our policies and hopes. Peace does not only involve a documentary acknowledgement of rights. It signifies the permanent end of conflict  and the proof of its authenticity must be sought in human terms. Peace means open frontiers across which peoples can seek commerce and contact with each other in mutual accessibility and thus give depth and meaning to formal governmental engagements.76.	Should we not look hard and long at the European example? The aim should be a community of sovereign States in the Middle East  as in Benelux and the European communities. With our eastern neighbour  once the boundary is determined  we should seek a system of relations based on separate sovereignties but with a high measure of social and economic integration. The remarkable ease and cordiality of access between Israelis and the mass of Palestinian Arabs today should be preserved and consolidated in a peace settlement. The squalid conspiracies of Arafat and Habash  with their grenades  daggers  bombs and guns  do not represent the views or interests of the million non-Israeli Arabs west of the Jordan living in peaceful interaction with Israelis today. That is why terrorist violence has no expression there.77.	We are asked if we accept negotiation. The answer is  Yes  by any procedure mutually agreed upon. The negotiation is between the sovereign States of the area. We must be concerned to insulate our region from the rivalries and competitions of the Powers. The Middle East  after generations of servitude  is now free. It should not seek new. hegemonies and new servitudes at the expense of its newly won independence.78.	What about Security Council resolution 242 (1967)? The answer is  Yes  we accept it as the basis for negotiation with Egypt and Jordan  and our memorandum of 4 August 1970 remains in force. It is vital to understand what the resolution says and what it does not say. The resolution rules out withdrawal except in the context of a ""just and lasting peace"". It does not require any unconditional Israeli action without balancing actions on the Arab side. And it specifically makes provision for the establishment of secure and recognized boundaries by agreement between Member States. When Arab Governments persuade international conferences to say that resolution 242(1967) requires immediate and unconditional withdrawal from all the territories  they commit a triple forgery within a single sentence and put our documentary consensus in jeopardy. But as it stands and as it is written it is a documentary basis for negotiation 79.	Do we accept the principle of withdrawal? Yes. In the context of a permanent peace Israeli forces would withdraw to the positions and boundaries determined mutually by the peace agreements. Our policy is not unilateral annexation but the negotiation of agreements on the final boundary. That position is in full accord with the intentions of those who drafted and sponsored Security Council resolution 242 (1967). One of them  Assistant Secretary Sisco  said publicly in 1970:""That resolution did not say withdrawal to the pre-June 5 line  The resolution said the parties must negotiate to achieve agreement on the so-called final  secure and recognized borders. In other words the question of the final borders is a matter of negotiation between the parties.""80.	We are asked about the Palestinian Arabs. If the idea is Palestine instead of Israel  our answer  of course  is  No. There is nothing ""instead"" of Israel either in universal history or in modern political reality. The question whether the Arabs have 18 or 19 States does not stand on an equal plane with Israel's solitary domain of nationhood and existence. But if the issue is Palestine side by side with Israel  the answer is that in peace negotiations with Jordan Israel's permanent boundary would be determined. It is not our governmental consensus to seek such boundary changes as would bring all or most of the Arabs of the West Bank andtheir populated territories under Israeli sovereignty or citizenship. The majority of Jordan's population are Palestinians  and most of the Palestinians are Jordanian citizens. Thus an Israel-Jordan peace settlement would enable most of the Palestine Arabs east and west of the Jordan to affirm their identity and citizenship within an Arab framework. It is for Arabs and not Israelis to determine the precise constitutional structure of our eastern neighbour. In a peace settlement the area of the former Palestine Mandate on both sides of the Jordan between the desert and the sea would have two States — Israel and an Arab State which would be a Palestinian Arab State in its composition whatever its name or constitutional structure. It would be normal for Palestinian Arabs to be included in the Jordanian delegation that would negotiate peace with Israel.81.	The principles I have outlined today would  of course  have to be submitted to negotiation with the other side. Here I seek only to emphasize that our positions are legitimate  normal and conducive to a wide range of peaceful solutions. Indeed  they are identical with the principles adopted by many States which have been praised here for their contribution to the new detente. It is possible to agree with those positions or to differ from them. But we see a moral and intellectual affront in any tendency to portray them as eccentric  as immoderate and  more grotesquely  as intransigent  when they are quite clearly nothing of the kind.82.	Least of all is there any justification for making them the basis for abusive or punitive formulations in obedience to the pressures of Arab States which decline negotiation  refuse peace  encourage international terrorism and seek to impose their own hostilities on other States in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty and dignity of newly emerging nations.83.	Whatever has divided them in the past  the Israeli and Arab nations cannot escape their common destiny. History and geography ensure their proximity. Experience teaches us that there are no irreconcilable conflicts. If the Arab Governments will take example and inspiration from the prevailing spirit of detente  they will find in Israel a willing partner for regional development and co-operation. There would be more benefit and  above all  more honour and dignity for them and for us in the exploration of a peaceful future than in the pursuit of an ineffective and sterile rancour  which has achieved and will achieve none of its objectives but which degrades our region's name and obstructs its better visions.84.	We shall respond affirmatively to any efforts  such as those indicated by the United States  to assist in the search for just solutions and to generate a spirit of accommodation.85.	Israel's relations with the European community will enter a new phase with the conclusion this year of an agreement constituting a free trade area within the Mediterranean context. If the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe succeeds in its task  the Mediterranean and Middle East will benefit from the resultant growth of continental harmony. We welcome the decision of the Conference to invite Israel to present its views on matters inscribed on the Conference agenda 86.	A central theme of the dialogue on detente in Europe  in the European Security Conference and elsewhere is liberty of movement and freedom of intellectual expression. Unless some success is registered here  there will be scepticism about the authenticity and depth of the change in the international climate. Our concern for detente should not lead us to ignore the desperate bid for freedom by men such as Solzhenitsyn  Sakharov  Levich and other scientists and thinkers who fall under governmental harassment and oppression.87.	The saga of Soviet Jewry belongs to this theme 88.	During his visit to the United States this summer  the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Union of Soviet Socialists Republics  Mr. Leonid Brezhnev  made a number of declarations implying that there are almost no rejections of requests by Soviet Jews to be permitted to leave for Israel. To our regret  we cannot confirm such statements at a time when so many Jews in the Soviet Union are held against their will and call out to us daily in despair. They face powerful authorities in a struggle to exercise the right  granted fortunately to many thousands of others  to join their people and their families in Israel. Applicants for emigration have in some instances been dismissed from work and left without any means of livelihood. Media of information have incited against them. Administrative molestation has made their life unbearable. Dozens of Jews  amongst them a young woman  have been condemned to long years of suffering behind barbed wire. The penalties inflicted on these people are especially surprising in view of the fact that the right to leave for Israel has been recognized in principle and that other Jews have exercised it. It is difficult to understand or condone a policy granting exit permits to some Jews while at the same time creating cruel obstacles for many others.89.	Nor can we pass in silence over the anti-Jewish incitement conducted openly or under the cover of propaganda directed against religion or against Zionism. This campaign is still carried on through governmental media of information and by means of propaganda publications and pseudo-scientific literature. In this manner anti-Semitic ideas are disseminated and injected into the masses of the Soviet Union's population.90.	On 26 March this year a tribunal in the French capital determined that information material distributed by the Soviet Embassy contained slanders on the Jewish faith and incitement to racial discrimination  and found those responsible guilty. But the Soviet authorities have not applied the Soviet law against the disseminators of anti-Semitic propaganda 91.	At the same time  the Jews of Syria and the remnant still left in Iraq are living in constant torment. Israel again appeals to world opinion which has already alleviated the plight of these helpless small minorities whose only salvation lies in emigration and the pursuit of a new life.92.	This season of the year was darkened for us in 1972 by the fearful affliction and murder of our sportsmen who went to Munich in the shelter of the Olympic flag. This year the horizon is clouded again. The kidnapping of Jewish refugees by terrorists in Austria is a reproach to international institutions whose sterile discussion of International terrorism must have given more encouragement to terrorists than they would have derived even from the absence of discussion. The decision to close the camp at Schoenau defied our belief. I recall an unforgettable day there a few months ago. In a world convulsed by nihilism and violence  it was moving to see this oasis of humane values  dedicated to the impulses of compassion and solidarity which have so often become submerged in the torrent of twentieth-century life. The very name Schoenau was recited with pride by every Austrian whom I was privileged to encounter. Those who have passed through its gates have known great suffering and torment in the tempests which have shaken Europe in this generation. To abandon such an enterprise in deference to a pair of brutal gangsters has a terrifying meaning  It raises the question where the final human victory belongs. Can law and civility triumph if they are not strongly defended? Can a decent and rational public order take root in the world if indulgence beyond their own expectation is shown to those who put a pistol to the head of unarmed wayfarers? What will be the effect of the constant suspension of European legal systems in favour of early release and impunity for those who come to kill and maim and leave their trail of innocent blood behind?93.	The issue is not only how the safe transit of Jews from the Soviet Union to Israel will be arranged  once the emigration has been authorized and the immigration approved. This is an acutely grave question  but it arises in an even graver context. What is the future of a world in which two pirates and criminals can bring a  proud nation  can bring sovereign governments to the acceptance of their terms? What are the implications of transactions and engagements between civilized governments and violent extortionists? Who is going to rule our world  governments or gunmen?94.	The Council of Europe in its resolution entitled ""Report on the responsibility of the Member States of the Council of Europe regarding the free movement of people in Europe""  adopted on 1 October 1973  rightly expressed the hope that no government will regard itself as bound by a promise secured by extortion to terminate facilities for the transit of emigrants from the Soviet Union. All these human predicaments emerge from the developments in Vienna this week. When the civilized world stands with bowed head  along comes President El-Sadat to celebrate joyfully the triumph of the young gunmen over a few aging  weary Jews and over the sovereignty and law of an enlightened European State.95.	Once it was an international offence to aid pirates. They were defined as humani generis hostis  enemies of the human race. Are we approaching a time when it will be an offence to resist them?96.	Chancellor Brandt called from this platform for an effective convention against terrorism. But experience shows that if in this matter we aim at universality we shall not have the necessary parliamentary success. There is — let us face it — no effective anti-terrorist majority in the United Nations. That is an ominous truth  but nothing is gained by ignoring it.97.	I ask myself therefore whether it would be more effective to follow the general traditions of international law byconvening like-minded interested States to discuss and formulate a convention against terrorism. The law of the seas and other instruments of international law and international co-operation evolved from the common action of a few States to which others came to adhere. Most of the historic international conventions were constructed in this way. Formulated by the few  they became the consensus of the many. The 43 States whose votes indicated their dissatisfaction with the results of last year's debate on terrorism might well consider meeting for common action  which would in the first place engage themselves and later attract a gradual but broad consensus.98.	For it becomes more evident each day that the United Nations  frustrated in its activity in regional disputes  should concentrate more of its efforts on matters of planetary concern which require a unitary framework. Mankind has a long past and an uncertain future. Revolutions in science  in technology  in the use of energy  in industrial productivity  in demographic growth have moved forward at a rhythm too quick for the mind to absorb. Man is not at ease with his environment. The intellectual and spiritual consequences are deep. Our culture is dominated by a sense of fragmentation and instability. It expresses the special pathos of the twentieth century condition — the confidence of power and yet the sharp premonition of vulnerability both living within us  together  side by side.99.	The United Nations may recapture some of its lost prestige and resonance if it gives first priority to those issues which have a planetary dimension. The law of the air and of the seas  the defence of air and water against pollution  the stimulation of economic growth in developing countries  the conservation of resources  the fight against famine  the establishment of a reserve of cereals in years of abundance for use in years of scarcity (following may I say  the thrifty example of our Israeli ancestor Joseph in ancient Egypt)  the response to the call of hunger south of the Sahara  the response to the important initiative of President Echeverria of Mexico calling for a charter of economic rights and duties of States — those are some problems which can only be discussed and solved on a global scale. Too much of the time of the United Nations may have been spent on the regional disputes in which individual Governments have the last say — for the simple reason that they have the ultimate responsibility. In the meantime  problems have collected which because they belong equally to all nations  end up by belonging to none. Each of our national societies has its custodians and spokesmen. The question is who except the United Nations can speak for the City of Man? Who speaks in responsible tutelage of the atmosphere  the soil  the oceans  the unique life-supporting Earth?100.	Perhaps mankind's dilemma is the United Nations opportunity. Let us  therefore  tread this ground firmly but with precision for this is the only planet that we have."
"57",3463,"ITA",28,1973,"﻿44.	 Mr. President  may I be allowed  at the outset  to express the deepest pleasure of the Italian delegation at seeing you preside over this twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly.45.	I am also glad to associate myself with the appreciation extended to your predecessor and with the tribute paid to our Secretary-General  the faithful interpreter of the principles of the Charter and the living symbol of the continuity of this Organization  for the intelligent and successful work that he has accomplished.46.	Confronted by the sad news from the Middle East  I cannot refrain from giving my immediate attention to that tormented geographical area. The sudden renewal of large- scale hostilities in the Middle East at the very moment when the spirit of detente seemed to be spreading throughout the world  and when Europe is engaged in the task of consolidating peace  provides us with a brusque reminder that in an area very close to my own country there remains a deep- rooted and profound crisis which for a long time will threaten our peace-keeping efforts. I venture to recall that the Italian Government  fully aware of the precariousness of any armed truce  had issued repeated warnings  both in this Organization and in our bilateral contacts  about the risk of a further outbreak of hostilities.47.	The Italian Government and Italian public opinion are deeply concerned at the dramatic and tragic events ofthe last few days. Italy urges that every effort be made tostop the bloodshed immediately. The military operations are producing suffering and death. Sadly  they have also caused victims among the civilian population  victims for whom I must express my deepest grief.48.	At the same time we urge that the root-causes of the conflict not be overlooked. It is towards these root-causes that we must turn our attention  at these gravest of moments  with the sincerely expressed wish that our Organization will  as it faces this serious crisis  prove itself capable of discharging its basic task of serving as a centre for harmonizing the actions of States in order to maintain international peace and security. The United Nations must therefore renew its efforts with increased vigour not only to re-establish the truce immediately — this aim  in our opinion  has absolute priority — but also to eradicate the roots of the conflict.49.	I would venture to add that this duty does not collectively weigh on our Organization alone. Each of its Members separately  and in particular those who bear a major responsibility for peace  are in duty bound to do their utmost to bring about a political solution. We must not ignore the danger that the Middle East conflict may lead to repercussions beyond our control.50.	Italy is convinced that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) still constitutes the basis for a just and honourable peace in the Middle East. The experience of these last six years has nevertheless shown that resolution 242 (1967)  while offering the parties concerned the basic foundations for a peace agreement  will remain a dead letter unless the countries involved in the dispute make an open show of goodwill  in co-operation with the United Nations  in order to achieve a unanimously acceptable interpretation of the resolution and its subsequent implementation. The United Nations  and above all those Member States that have close relations with one or all of the interested parties  are in duty bound to invite them and urge them to tackle their problems constructively and to promote an agreement. Italy  for its part  will spare no effort to convince the parties to overcome doubts and misunderstandings and to encourage them to engage in a dialogue as a means of achieving peace. On behalf of the Italian Government  I wish to appeal to all the parties concerned to show restraint and a sense of responsibility so that reason and justice may finally prevail in the Middle East.51.	It has been said in many quarters that 1973 has been the year of detente. And this was certainly true until a few days ago and warranted a certain satisfaction over the tangible and significant developments achieved in 1973. These achievements have been mentioned by many previous speakers: the progress made towards normalization in Viet-Nam; the favourable conclusion of negotiations between India  Pakistan and Bangladesh  which have improved the situation in the Asian subcontinent; the conclusion in Europe of the stage of soundings in preparation for a multilateral negotiation between the West  the East and the neutral countries  and the beginning of the Conference on Security and Co-operation- in Europe which is now taking place in Geneva; the ratification of the treaty between the two Germanys which has resulted in the entry into the United Nations of the two German States; the forthcoming negotiations in Vienna to achieve a balanced reduction of forces in central Europe and the resumption of negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of strategic weapons.52.	A determining factor in these positive developments undoubtedly has been the search for a new kind of relationship among the major centres of world political influence. These centres  after having initiated and experienced balanced relationships which at the beginning of the 1970s constituted a decisive political change  are tending more and more to adopt the method of permanent negotiations in order to check potential conflicts and to bring about the peaceful consolidation of world stability.53.	The new presence of Europe as an entity actively engaged in the search for new relationships between States and peoples and in the building of a peaceful order on the continent and in the world constitutes a striking development in the international situation which  as a European  I certainly cannot ignore.54.	The concerted drive towards European unity no longer reflects merely a desire by the peoples of Western Europe to expand and strengthen the process of integration so far engaged in the European Economic Community; it also reflects a striving for the responsibility which devolves upon the Community as a result of the new international reality.55.	The aim of achieving by 1980 the political unity of the countries of the European Community reflects this desire and this responsibility. And the countries of the Community are moving towards the achievement of this aim by helping both to end the confrontation between East and West and to bridge the gap between industrialized and developing countries.56.	Hence the process of the economic and political unification of the countries and peoples of a large part of Europe  to the extent that it fills a historical gap and provides a new impetus towards co-operation and peace  coincides — as it has indeed so far coincided — with the progress of detente and with the initiation of new relations between the countries of the third world and the industrialized countries. Suffice it to point out that the enlargement of the European Economic Community and the further progress towards political integration have accompanied the preparation and holding of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Suffice it also to think of the treaties of association concluded between the Community and certain African States  the growing network of friendly relations which the Community is building up in the Mediterranean area and in Latin America and the initiatives taken in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development for the development of trade within the framework of a system of generalized preferences. All this means that the European Community not only intends to achieve a model of regional economic and political integration but also is seeking to become a dynamic force and a specific reference point in the new system of relations and balances which is emerging as a more adequate response to the challenges and problems of the world community.57.	The new relationships based on negotiations initiated between the major centres of world influence have certainly helped to settle some potential conflicts. Nevertheless  the need to reaffirm the presence and the essential role of the United Nations in the process of overcoming crises and normalizing relations between States remains more than ever valid. That is because only the United Nations  through its universal and democratic vocation  can represent the aspirations and interests of all States and all peoples; and only the United Nations  created and developed on the basis of a set of principles of international coexistence  can seek a peace which not only conforms to Power relationships but also is founded on equality between States and an understanding of the aspirations of peoples.58.	It is therefore the task of the United Nations to supplement the efforts of the major centres of political influence by action which reflects the need for participation of all States and the democratic awareness of the world. That is action whereby the United Nations  seeking to build peace upon justice and to base that peace on the major principles of the .Charter  must plan for peace and reaffirm it in all fields where it is threatened by delays in the achievement of progress which may bring to all men and all peoples dignified and democratic conditions of life.59.	There still remain some problems and disputes which have not as yet been settled. They can be tackled only by the application of the major principles of the United Nations  such as the self-determination of peoples  respect for human rights  the sovereign equality of States  and the renunciation of the use or threat of force. I refer to the crisis in the Middle East — which I have already dealt with — the remnants of colonialism in Africa  apartheid  racial discrimination  the serious violations of fundamental freedoms of individuals and of peoples which occur also on other continents  and the problems of the normalization of political relations in Asia.60.	Among other problems whose settlement involves the full implementation of the principles of the United Nations I shall mention here those of colonialism and apartheid. And let me say at once that the recent news of violence in southern Africa has had a strong impact on Italian public opinion. The Italian people demand a renewed undertaking on the part of the United Nations to initiate in the areas still under colonial rule constructive negotiations between the administering Powers and the liberation movements in order to bring about a process of peaceful and speedy decolonization. These are problems on which we have repeatedly expressed our views; and we have voiced our full disapproval of the adverse effects which our failure to solve them has had on the peoples concerned and on our progress towards the attainment of subsequent goals of free political coexistence between men.61.	The statement of these principles reminds us that there are still many countries where the right of peoples to choose freely their own political and social institutions and where the rights of the individual to life and liberty are suppressed because of recurring tendencies to impose or maintain political formulas and regimes by underhand coercion and violence of arms.62.	The Italian Government has followed with regret and concern the events which have taken place and are still taking place in Chile  where a coup d'etat led to the overthrow of the constitutional Government  the suppression of democratic institutions and the tragic death of President Allende.63.	Violence in political life  wherever and in whatever form it occurs  leads to the disregard and suppression of human rights. Italy maintains that respect for human rights  set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and proclaimed in the United Nations Charter as the basic objective of co-operation between States  constitutes everywhere the basis for ensuring political coexistence and for guaranteeing  both within States and in international life  the renunciation of the use of force and the free development of the values and aspirations of peoples.64.	On the continent of Asia also there still exist problems whose solution requires the rigorous application of United Nations principles.65.	The Paris agreements on Viet-Nam  the Vientiane Agreement on Laos and the end of the bombing in Cambodia constitute the premises for the gradual restoration of normal relations in Indo-China. Now that the war in VietNam and Laos is over  we must try to defend the peace there; but above all we must place it on more solid and more genuine foundations  namely  full respect for the will of the peoples concerned to establish a freely chosen political and social order and a climate of reconciliation and fruitful progress.66.	On the Korean peninsula also the efforts made by the two Koreas to normalize their relations are encountering difficulties which may become if the delicate balances existing within the region and the desires of the Korean people are respected and if there is no outside interference.67.	The most serious problem now facing the States Members of the United Nations  whether on the regional or the world level  is not so much to reaffirm the major principles already solemnly proclaimed in the Charter as to bring about their practical implementation. That is a task which in Italy's view may be accomplished mainly through a joint effort of political will by the States which are called upon to establish more peaceful and more balanced relationships throughout the world.68.	That co-operation may be achieved at the regional level  as may be proved by the significant test constituted by the convening of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  but that Conference must not limit its scope to another redrafting  in more or less solemn terms  of a code of behaviour which already exists in the universal conscience. On the contrary  it must pursue the aim of equating European reality with the major principles of our Organization and it must remove the divisive factors which have so far prevented their full implementation on the continent. It must create the conditions for the gradual removal of barriers between States and peoples and for the initiation of new relations between them which are more open and dynamic.69.	With regard to the concern with which international public opinion has been following the measures recentlytaken against citizens guilty of having expressed a form of political dissent  I wish to stress that the real success of the Conference will be measured by its ability effectively to enhance the quality of life and the dignity of man. In that sense  the promotion in Europe of broader contacts between individuals and the freer exchanges of information  ideas and scientific and artistic products will increase the political awareness of citizens and together will raise the level of social progress  as measured by the extent to which rights and freedom are enjoyed. The possibilities given to Europeans of understanding and meeting one another beyond national frontiers will signify the progress from a Europe marked by divisions to a Europe of peace  intent on seeking more advanced forms of social coexistence.70.	What I have said so far about Europe is valid  mutatis mutandis  for the other continents also. At the world level  however  the way towards the implementation of the major principles in international relations lies more than ever in the strengthening of the role of the United Nations.71.	The Italian Government has already had the opportunity of expressing its views on the matter. We maintain that full respect for the Charter and the political will of States to apply it correctly represent the necessary premise for restoring effectiveness to United Nations action. We are  however  also convinced that some of its structures must be modified in order to ensure more responsible participation of small and medium-sized States in the decisions and tasks of the Organization.72.	The expansion of the membership of the Economic and Social Council and the strengthening of its operations represents a positive event. We hope that the Security Council  too  may in the not-too-distant future reflect more accurately in its membership the changes that have come about in the world community during the last quarter of a century with the attainment of independence by so many States and with the evolution of influential relationships on the world scene. We also hope that by the establishment of new machinery the Security Council will be able to improve its fact-finding and peace-keeping functions.73.	A strengthening of the procedures for the settlement of international disputes  especially through a review of the role of the International Court of Justice; a further clarification of the powers of the Economic and Social Council to co-ordinate the specialized agencies and the programmes designed to implement the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]\ the search for more coordinated procedures for ascertaining violations of human rights and for struggling against racial discrimination; the replacement of the Trusteeship Council  which has almost concluded its task  by a council for Non-Self-Governing Territories and for decolonization: these are some of the questions which we suggest Member States should ponder in order to bring about a genuine modernization of the structures and capacity for action of the United Nations.74.	Undoubtedly  the United Nations has traversed a long path towards the attainment of universality  which represents important stage in the reaffirmation of its role. The entry into the world Organization of the two States of theGerman nation and of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas brings closer the moment in which the United Nations can achieve real universality. To complete this process we shall have to accelerate the accession to independence by the countries still subject to a colonial regime and normalize relations between the divided States such as Korea and Viet-Nam.75.	Italy  which has always advocated the principle of universality of the United Nations  will continue to work for the attainment of this aim as soon as possible.76.	Precisely because of the ever-growing participation of States  the United Nations has been able in recent years to extend the scope of its action. Today  the United Nations is launching a campaign on all fronts for the liberation of mankind from the major evils which afflict it: the armaments spiral  under-development  hunger and the destruction of the environment. In this context I should like to recall the initiative of the President of Mexico for the adoption of a charter on the economic rights and duties of States  an initiative which we favourably accepted for the reasons which prompted it and in the study of which we are participating with interest.77.	What must be done is to implement the comprehensive and indivisible concept of security that befits the United Nations and is founded on the awareness that  in order to ensure peace the root-causes of tension must be eradicated.78.	In this context I will refer only to the United Nations effort to promote a global development strategy capable of bringing about a more equitable distribution of resources and technology in favour of the less-advanced States  to the major negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the International Monetary Fund  to the noble initiatives — notably the suggested world food conference — undertaken to confront the dramatic challenges of hunger and over-population throughout the world and  last but not least  to the general awareness of the fact that a world environment policy can no longer be postponed.79.	It is against that comprehensive background  in the framework of a global strategy of peace which may confront world problems in their entirety and interrelationship  that we must consider also the disarmament problems.80.	The Soviet-American negotiations on the limitation of strategic weapons and the start of a negotiation on the balanced reduction of forces in central Europe constitute so many positive elements which must be integrated with the efforts of the United Nations itself if we are to move towards the objective of general and complete disarmament. Italy continues on each and every occasion to be actively engaged in the search for progress in disarmament. We are pursuing this search in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament at Geneva which technically still constitutes  in spite of recent difficulties  the body best equipped to negotiate specific and workable measures. Italy also intends to remain active in the efforts deployed to bring about a World Disarmament Conference which  if it is effectively prepared with the participation of all the nuclear Powers  could become the most useful instrument for bringing about general and complete disarmament.81.	The United Nations was created in order to base international relations on peace and law and to guarantee to all peoples the right to decide their own destiny and to be free from all foreign interference and all forms of coercion. Since States and peoples are made up of human beings  today more than ever the enrichment of the quality of life — the quality of life of all men  wherever they live — is essential for ensuring that relations between States will also develop in a framework of security and harmony. The rights of States and peoples may be achieved more fully in a climate of peace and security when the rights of the individual can expand and develop within all regions and within all social systems.82.	It is in that spirit that Italy reaffirms its complete support for the United Nations and the principles set forth in the Charter and its resolve to co-operate in the formulation of a comprehensive policy for peace  which may also promote all the values in which man's desire constantly to overcome himself is embodied."
"58",3509,"JAM",28,1973,"﻿29.	Mr. President  let me begin by expressing on behalf of my delegation our great pleasure at the honour that you have done us and Latin America by accepting the appointment to the most responsible post of President of this Assembly. As a distinguished diplomat  your acceptance of this appointment brings us particular pleasure. We take additional pride in the fact that an eminent Latin American has been chosen for this honourable position.30.	Permit me to express the gratitude of my delegation to the President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski of Poland  for the able and efficient manner in which he guided the deliberations of that session.31.	I should like to add the voice of Jamaica to those who have drawn attention to the cause of universality which has been significantly advanced by the admission of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic  to membership in the United Nations. Mr. President  you will understand the reasons why for me and for my delegation and for the Government and people of Jamaica the entry of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to the United Nations is a matter of particular pride and pleasure. Our two countries are not only neighbours  but a developing relationship over the years has brought us into a very close association. The Bahamas with its hundreds of islands  its exquisitely beautiful seas and beaches and its wonderful people  almost immediately on the emergence of the present political leadership  has joined us as an independent nation. I know that the Bahamian people and their Prime Minister  Mr. Lynden Pindling  along with their delegation to this Assembly  bring to this great Organization their independence of spirit and their determination to contribute to the good of mankind. In this endeavour  they will once more  as they have in so many other ways  join forces with those independent English-speaking countries of the Caribbean  which against the background of a common history and parallel influences have established a tradition of co-operation in many fields  and an undying faith in parliamentary democracy and a particularly strong interest in furthering the cause of developing countries through the United Nations system.32.	It is because my country so strongly feels the importance of this occasion and because of our particular associations including  for me  strong personal ties with the Bahamas  I have been moved to reinforce the earlier statements of congratulations with farther expressions of pleasure.»33.	For my delegation  the degree of our pleasure is qualified to some extent on this occasion by the sad events which have overtaken two distinguished international figures who but a short time ago addressed the nations gathered here. We recall with pride and with sorrow Amilcar Cabral and Salvador Allende  two men who in their own very distinctive ways have sought to advance the interests of the people of their countries. It is not for us here to make judgement on the internal affairs of other countries. We accept the principle  in matters related to development and the fate of the third world  that ""any man's death diminishes me""  and so we feel that something has been lost in the death of those two men because they loved their people and their countries. We feel that in each case their death marks but a momentary pause in the irresistible movement of the forces for freedom in which they believed. The fight for freedom will continue as long as there continues to beat within the hearts of men the love of freedom and concern for their fellows.34.	Much criticism has been aimed at this Organization but not for lack of appreciation of what it has achieved for millions in the fields of education  health improvement and labour conditions. Such criticism as we repeatedly hear arises more from the patent necessity for change that is so obvious in an instrument created 28 years ago in very different circumstances from those of the world of today. The changes in political and international affairs as well as in the domestic affairs of most of the nations have at times been spectacular and even dramatic. New ideas  new demands  new pressures and new expressions of national sovereignty  independence and international relations have emerged.35.	The world is slowly developing a system of values based on the principles of the rights and duties of States. This new phenomenon has brought about the evolution of a complex of institutions and a system of consultations to meet the present realities. Some of this is not entirely new but over recent years we have seen a great deal of progress in those directions centred mainly around detente — detente which unfortunately takes place entirely outside of the ambit of the United Nations.36.	The very fact that in this Organization we have heard from this podium repeated plaudits on the achievement of detente which itself was contrived outside this Organization  leads us to ask ourselves two questions  Do those who sing those praises lack faith in this Organization as the proper instrument for achieving detente? Can anyone claim that in bypassing the Organization  lustre has been added to its cause  or is it that the benefits of detente are not expected to extend far beyond their immediate concern? I must confess that in a small country which looks upon this Organization as the greatest repository of hope for the peoples of the world  serious doubts exist as to the achievement of this detente  both its method and its effect. There is an African proverb very well known by my friends the people of the United Republic of Tanzania and others  which says that when two great elephants fight it is the grass that suffers. The present period of detente makes us add the second phrase: even when the great elephants make love it is also the grass that suffers.37.	We must acknowledge that this great Organization was conceived and created   in different times. As was pointed out by President Mobutu of Zaire in that address [2140th meeting] which spoke for all Africa and beyond  the same five permanent members of the Security Council exercise the same control today as they did at the time when they assumed their position as the reward for victory. Since then the Organization has been enriched by the valuable contribution of some of the best brains in regions outside of Europe  Asia and America. You yourself  Mr. President  and many others who have occupied that distinguished Chair derive from countries outside of the favoured five. In these modern days of science  when all horizons are challenged  it would pay us well were we to examine some of the political systems  social characteristics and humanitarian developments that emanate outside of this small original group. It has been suggested that Japan be considered a candidate most fit for and worthy of joining the Big Five for a permanent seat on the Security Council. Without questioning for one moment either the suitability of Japan or the suggestion itself  let us look at this matter for a moment. The fact is that the continent of Africa  with its 360 million people and 41 independent sovereign States  and Latin America  with a population of over 250 million and 25 independent States  would seem to have a stronger case for consideration. Certainly we need to bring this element as well as other aspects of the Organization into line with present-day realities. Clearly  the establishment of rational criteria for change is superior to an ad hoc approach to the revision of the Charter.38.	Today we see the quality of life on this planet in a fragile balance. We see the need  as recent events have shown  for international co-operation and collaboration in the fields of trade  monetary reform and population growth  in correcting environmental deterioration and in relation to the question of the earth's resources whether ""and-based or sea-based. In this new relationship which must be forged  the technologically advanced countries must be prepared to accept and abide by a new code of ethics and international morality — a new code which will ensure a greater share and a more equitable and rational distribution of the fruits of progress in the interests of the peoples of the countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America.39.	The 1970s will be remembered as the decade in which the world came to recognize much more fully some of the realities of life as far as development is concerned.40.	We have watched with disappointment approaching dismay the ever-widening gap between the developed and developing countries; the gloomy outcome of the First United Nations Development Decade and the hopeless prospects of the Second; the eroding effect of the resurgent inflationary pressures and the uncertainties centring on the international monetary system; and the increasing burden of debt borne by developing countries.41.	We have seen the struggles of many developing countries in their attempts to wrestle with domestic  economic and social problems and needs and the forces within resisting change and the external forces adversely affecting them.42.	We have seen how easily countries striving to improve their condition can be thwarted by natural disaster — by drought  flood  earthquake or hurricane.43.	We have seen how the preoccupation of developed countries with their own problems diverts attention from the fate of the vast majority of the world's peoples.44.	We have observed the way in which the global food supply is quickly affected by internal social and political forces in a few large countries and by changes in bilateral relationships and trade between them.45.	We cannot avoid certain conclusions which emerge from all this: the heavy bias in favour of the better endowed  the wealthier  the more technologically advanced countries; the limited contribution of the conventional approaches to development in the making of any significant impact on the basic problems of poverty and towards the narrowing of the development gap; and the inevitable growth of economic power and influence as evidenced by the emergence and rise to virtually unchallengeable influence of the multinational corporations  representing  in institutional terms  a new political dimension in the economic affairs of the world and operating  so far  outside of the sphere of real control of Governments and international institutions.46.	All of that points to the need for real and fundamental change in international economic relations between developing and developed countries and for the establishment of a much greater range of economic interplay between developing countries.47.	The Secretary-General has proposed that at the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly we examine seriously the relationship between the real issues facing the world and the institutional framework of the United Nations and the capability of that Organization to play a significant part in resolving those issues. As he stated in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization  many of the present world-wide economic and social problems were scarcely foreseen at all when the United Nations system was created  and these  as he said  include the interrelated problems of development  trade  population  natural resources and environment. We agree with him that ""institutions created in 1945 often no longer correspond to current needs"" [A/9001/Add. 1  p. 3] and that the United Nations in respect of this and other issues ""will not develop through ritual public statements of approval and support which are not backed by inner conviction  realism and whole-hearted participation"" [ibid.].48.	It is in that spirit and in the full realization that we continue to be in danger of falling far short of our real responsibilities that my delegation would like to address this session of the General Assembly.49.	Under the auspices of the First Development Decade  the developed countries undertook to contribute 1 per cent of their gross national product toward the resources of the developing countries. That undertaking has not been fulfilled  but we must acknowledge that some countries have lived up to their promises.50.	But we now know that even if the aid-target was fully achieved  and if the 6 per cent per annum growth rate of developing countries was accomplished  the development gap would continue to widen. The fact is that the per capita income of the developing countries of Africa and Asia is about $100 to $120. This is just about equal to the yearly increase in the per capita income of the developed countries.51.	From that it can easily be seen that the masses of the third world cannot hope for even the beginning of the fulfilment of their aspirations in the Second United Nations Development Decade. It is thus clearly and mathematically illustrated that there is falsity behind the thinking that conventional aid can in any way bridge the problem of the dangerous imbalance between the poor nations and the rich.52.	The other approach to aid suggested by the Soviet Union is that 10 per cent of the cutback on armaments expenditure should be used to assist the developing countries [A/L. 701/Rev. /]. But while this matter is being debated and examined  perhaps we should look at other possible approaches. For example  we suggest that if even the interest on foreign debts of developing countries was wiped out by the creditor nations  it would greatly reduce the very heavy pressure of this indebtedness.53.	Let us stop fooling ourselves and fooling each other that aid as we have known it can ever by itself solve this problem. The answer is clear: trade  not aid  must be the main approach to the achievement of an equitable international economic system. The developed nations must pay us more for our primary commodities and give us greater access to their markets for the manufactured goods we produce. The illustrious President Nyerere of the United Republic of Tanzania has pointed to the fact that  whereas 8 or 10 bales of cotton could buy a tractor 20 years ago  today it would take some 25 bales of the same commodity to buy the engine of that tractor. This situation can also be illustrated in terms of sisal  bananas and so on. President Mobutu of Zaire has indicated that the price of rubber is less today than it was 20 years ago  and we are all aware of the increase in the price of tires over that period.54.	If we are seriously considering the problem of elevating the living standards of the poor of the world  if we are seriously contemplating the danger on the borders and in the shanty-towns of all our countries where the human time-bombs of poverty are ticking away in the settled hopeless expectation of a futureless existence  then we must sit down at this very Assembly and work out a system which will relate the price of bananas  cotton  rubber and so on to the price of machines and tractors and trucks and automobiles so as to link the two sets of commodities in such a way that they will move up together automatically as the prices move up in the industrial countries. What we need is a formula which will serve as the basis for this new relationship and the construction of appropriate indices to measure and guide movements of :he basic elements.55.	Is such a task beyond the ingenuity of this international institution? It is in fact a vital and urgent one. But will you admit that it is at present outside the desire of this Organization and its Members? My country proposes that the United Nations should make a clear commitment at this session of the Assembly that the Economic and Social Council  in collaboration with UNCTAD  should apply its collective mind to this problem now. My delegation will submit a draft resolution ir. the appropriate Commitee proposing that a task force should accordingly be set up to work out such a system and to consider all the monetary and other implications attendant on it. It is- surely not beyond the ingenuity or the desire of this international Organization  founded on such high hopes  to relate the effort of the worker in the sugar-cane fields with that of the labourer in the factory of a more temperate climate. The fact is that there is now no meaningful or equitable relationship whatever between the artificial prices manipulated by the few and the misery of the millions who produce these commodities in both the developed and the developing countries.56.	A few days ago Secretary of State Kissinger called on the Latin American Governments to join with the United States in a ""new dialogue"". My country welcomes this invitation. We applauded his remark that ""We do not believe that any institution or any treaty arrangement is beyond examination"". Let me apply this new and hopeful approach in international policy to the existing state of affairs  for it is one of the most significant expressions of United States international policy in this decade. Placed within the framework of my own country's traditional and hallowed respect for the sanctity of contracts  it gives  in our view  expression to the need for  and understanding of  the principle that in the matter of treaties and agreements  review is an inevitable and natural and just process of history. It takes into account the reality of present and changing patterns of international relationships and the growing respect for the sovereignty of all nations.57.	The application of this principle relates equally to the structure and form of the complex of international institutions that have been established over the last 28 years. As an example  the urgent need for the reform of the international monetary system is no longer in doubt. What is really in doubt is whether such reform  when it comes  will ever be really practical or effective. It is clear that here  as elsewhere  the developed countries have not been prepared to submit sufficiently to the jurisdiction of a fully elective international body. Let me hope that Mr. Kissinger's remarks when he proposed to us  his Latin American neighbours ""a friendship based on equality and a respect for mutual dignity"" will bear fruit. The Secretary of State was right when he said ""... such a relationship is needed for all of us  and I believe it is needed also for the rest of the world"". By the same token  reform in the case of the monetary system must include the achievement of more effective participation in decision-making by the developing countries  in particular  by ensuring the adequate representation of such countries in the appropriate bodies.58.	Reform must also mean the more effective introduction of the concept of development into the international monetary system. The urgent requirement of the immediate post-war period was the establishment of a system of controls and a code of behaviour in the monetary field. Today we need to move on to a realistic pursuit of development in the widest sense of that term. Reform must include the association of the reserve assets  the special drawing rights  with a system allowing a greater flow of resources between developed and developing countries. We ask that further thought be given to proposals advanced by us and others at the recent joint annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Nairobi to evolve a hew type of loan bearing a lower interest rate from that institution.59.	Reference has been made by several speakers to the recent meetings at Algiers of the non-aligned nations.31 was very proud of the contribution made by my own small country on that unique occasion. I was particularly pleased to see over 70 great nations  in many instances represented by their Heads of State  from Afghanistan to Zaire  concentrate so much energy and thought on economic and social matters. In these areas there seems to be no space for detente. This effect is not felt here  and it is precisely in these fields that the poor nations need most consideration and that the world needs a new understanding. The very reason that brought the non-aligned group into existence was that the world became aware of the total disaster that could overtake it unless sanity prevailed. It seems less ominous today than it was a decade or two ago  and a great deal of this is owing to the pioneers of the non-aligned movement; but the spread of terrorism  the grim hatreds behind the smiling and non-smiling faces in the ghettos of the world require a universal awareness of the need to fashion effective means of constructive action in the economic and social fields. Failure to do this will not merely mean for us a failure to grasp the opportunity of the moment  but will also cast all of us in the role of enjoying a frivolous flirtation with history.60.	The United Nations was conceived by idealists. We make no apology for following the road of idealism  but it is an idealism that is limited only by the will of each of us to carry out specific commitments within our powers — great or small.61.	As a small country  we make no apology for concentrating more on people than on property. We feel that nations  great or small  should pay no more importance to the balance of payments than they pay to the balance of human distress. Traditional mathematical representations such as gross national product are often meaningless in terms of either hunger or homelessness. We go further and say it is short-sighted to neglect social development  which is the essential purpose of economic development. This was made clear in a short passage of the Honourable Prime Minister of Jamaica's inaugural address to this Assembly a year ago:""I am convinced that housing is going to have to become the great new area of world concern and effort. It seems to me that  in the absence of a home  much else that we seek to plan and to achieve is frustrated and overwhelmed by the sheer  brutal reality of shanty-town life. I believe that much of education is lost upon a child who returns from school to share one room with his brothers  sisters and parents. I believe that many of the hostilities and tensions which frustrate the economic process can be traced  a t least in part  to this problem. Therefore I wish to suggest that the international community should address its mind to the development of a world-wide plan for housing. I was pleased to see that the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment has taken note of this problem and called for support for the housing fund that was proposed at that Conference. I suggest that formulas be explored for ensuring that fundsfor housing become a planned and standard addition wherever investment capital moves.""62.	Here at the United Nations and elsewhere  Jamaica has played a particularly active role in the field of the human environment  for we believe that through the environment programme there is a possibility of approaching more closely the heart of the matter of development. We have stressed the need to view the human being as central to the theme of the environment. We urge  therefore  that the ideas and priorities agreed upon at the first meeting of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme in Geneva in June of this year should be pursued  particularly those concerning human settlement  health and habitation.63.	My country enters a plea for forgiveness in repeatedly returning to the idea that the central core of all our endeavour is the improvement in the quality of life of the individual human being. We have already seen how national statistics may have scant relevance to this central theme. We have also seen that in the determination of economic development it is no longer possible to neglect the social factor.64.	Following Jamaica's initiative during the twenty- seventh session  the Assembly adopted resolutions dealing with the institutional and financial arrangements for housing and human settlements. We are aware of the considerations that have taken place on these resolutions of the Assembly. We note with regret  however  the illusion of action on these resolutions and will raise these issues in the appropriate forum.65.	My Government continues to note with regret the low priority that has been accorded to this sector by the United Nations system. We are heartened that the World Bank has committed itself to allocating substantial funds for the housing and human settlements sector of its activities. It is our hope that the question of establishing new and realistic criteria for determining the rates of interest and the eligibility for soft loans in this sector will be given the urgency of treatment and attention that it deserves. It is our further hope that a new sense of international morality and financial commitment by the developed countries will emerge  and that action based on this recognition by the World Bank of the intimate relationship between economic development and such social problems as urbanization  unemployment  poverty and the condition of human settlements will not be frustrated. Let us remember that the greater the task  the greater the need that the effort be rooted in the deepest human convictions. It is time for us to introduce a new game-plan to reflect the high priority that was accorded to this sector in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] and that was again reinforced in the number 1 priority of the Governing Council for environmental programmes. The scale of activities so far undertaken is not at all commensurate with the magnitude of the problem. The Jamaican delegation will at the appropriate time work with like-minded delegations in an effort to accelerate and give further impetus to the activities in this sector  and to ensure full participation by the developing countries in any new mechanism that is being up within the United Nations system.66.	It is because my small country  Jamaica  has never faltered in its support for the United Nations as the greatest repository of hope for the peoples of the world that we cannot pass without noticing a very unfortunate phrase from a most distinguished source referring to ""the increasingly assuming characteristic of a bloc of its own — the alignment of the non-aligned"". If this is not a naive misunderstanding of the history and nature of that great and growing movement for the preservation of peace  it could only be a deliberate and calculated misrepresentation of the role of this great movement. We are not a bloc. By definition we are against blocs. We never have been a bloc and we persist in a solemn resistance to being lured into joining any bloc.67.	As a small and poor nation  our strength lies less in the threat to exercise power against others than in the capacity to remain objective and frank both to our friends and to any who choose to describe themselves otherwise. It is in this tradition of frankness that my delegation refers with deep sadness to the unfortunate turn of events in the Middle East. We have always hoped  and still do hope  that in Security Council resolution 242 (1967) in its entirety lies the hope for a true and lasting peace in this area. As a consequence Jamaica calls for an immediate cease-fire and the commencement of negotiations in accordance with that resolution  which  we repeat  is the only hope for peace in the Middle East.68.	We believe equally that unless we follow more the dictates of our collective conscience and less the escalation of rhetoric and hypocrisy  many more conflicts will erupt and continue  at the cost of countless innocent dead. A few days ago we witnessed in this very room the disgraceful exhibition of that small band who purport to represent the people of South Africa  shamelessly supported by a very slim minority of this Organization in a legalistic argument^ as to their right to freedom of speech. The enunciation of that right sounds thin and hollow in the mouths of a racist regime whose best-known characteristic is their own denial of that right to the millions forming the majority in their own country. The shameless gang will continue this massive exhibition of hypocrisy as long as they obtain encouragement from the few remaining supporters in this Organization  who  by such support  cast grave doubts upon the moral posture of the Organization itself.69.	It is in this setting  and at a time when bombs are raining death and blood is flowing like a red sea of its own  that I give this solemn warning. War is caused by breaches of faith  by desertion of principle and abandonment of a moral code.70.	How can we absolve ourselves from blame — we who sit comfortably unconcerned while the brutal bandits of South Africa  who demand their freedom of speech here  refuse to reply to the demand of the International Court of Justice that they set Namibia free? It is this body which has by resolution after resolution  in accordance with the legal decision of that high Court  set up the instruments for the liberation and lawful government of the people of Namibia. Yet we lack the will to put them into effect. There are many areas of the world in dispute that come Before us In which there are  however weighted  two opinions to be decided. In the case of Namibia there is but a single clear  irrefutable example of injustice — that by South Africa. South Africa is illegally in charge of Namibia. There is no legal obstacle to United Nations action against it. It would have been indefensible if this were only a case of territorial aggression. It would be even more reprehensible if it were merely an extension of that wrong in that South Africa had annexed property and people in the manner of the classical colonialist. But it goes further: the conscience of the world is tortured by the dehumanizing practices that are forced upon the people of Namibia by this racist abomination which is supported here by those few friends who legalistically uphold the right to freedom of speech.71.	The conscience of the world cries out  in the name of those dying today on the battlefield of wrong  that this Assembly should call upon the Security Council to act now.72.	Our hope for peace demands that we ask the Security Council: first  to demand that South Africa surrender the administration of Namibia  or that force be exercised against it to enforce its obedience to the law; and secondly  to protect the United Nations Council for Namibia that has been established to administer Namibia and restore to its people God's gift of freedom.73.	In the name of my small country  Jamaica  I ask you  each of you  Have you the will to demand this  that the United Nations summon up its collective will to take up its own Mandate?74.	The precious young lives being sacrificed even as we speak in comfort here cry out this warning  If you do not maintain the force of law  your sons and daughters will die under the law of force.75.	The painfulness of the truth is already evident in other parts of Africa. Jamaica and the rest of the free world salute the freedom fighters of South Africa  Angola  Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau. We welcome the brave liberators of Guinea-Bissau  our newest nation  which recalls the struggle for freedom in the United States of America  and elsewhere when men believe in ""liberty or death"". My country was the first in the new world to recognize Guinea-Bissau.76.	My delegation believes that the main purpose of the United Nations is to preserve peace  not to stop war. We believe that much has been done by this great international body for which the world must be grateful. But the preservation of peace demands that we be constantly alert to maintain our principles and enforce our resolutions. There are areas today in Latin America which are not yet in a state of war but which are far from enjoying the atmosphere of peace. I refer in particular to the tiny Territory of Belize. Belize has been promised independence by the United Kingdom. But fear of accepting that freedom  which its people deserve  arises from fear of invasion the moment independence is granted. Let me pray that we shall take strong and timely measures  clear for all to see  to prevent the use of force from spreading the seeds of war and oppression in that otherwise peaceful area.77.	My country  Jamaica  has never lost faith in the influence for good that exists here in the United Nations. Thehopes of mankind rest in our hands. Can we summon up the will to do that for which future generations will be grateful? Each moment of indecision  hesitancy or disobedience to the dictates of our conscience  every sacrifice of principle on the altar of expediency  each wasteful death in the ghetto or on the battlefield of wrong cries out to us. We can no longer afford the luxury of delay."
"59",3555,"JOR",28,1973,"﻿117.	 Mr. President  it is my privilege to add my voice to those of the speakers who preceded me in congratulating you on your election to the high office of the presidency. I would also wish to express my hope and belief that under your wise stewardship the work of this twenty-eighth session of the Assembly will be carried out with maturity and expedition. I am delighted that a distinguished son of Latin America is now at the helm.118.	I also wish to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Trepczynski  for the exemplary manner in which he presided over the work of the twenty-seventh session of the Assembly.119.	We are meeting today in a situation of ominous gravity. Full-fledged fighting is raging once again in the Middle East  underscoring the enormity of Israeli aggression and its seizure of the national soils of three Member States — Egypt  Syria and Jordan — since the earlier aggression of 5 June 1967.120.	Precious lives  representing the cream of their countries  are being offered for the national survival in dignity and peace.121.	It is unnecessary and irrelevant to attempt to refute Israeli allegations as to how the firing started. It started as a culmination of a condition of continuing aggression and occupation. Suffice it here to state that fighting is raging on the national soils of Egypt and Syria and that the sons of these sisterly countries are operating in their own homelands.122.	The blood of those innocent youths stains the hands of the Israeli leadership  whose motto all along has been  as this Assembly knows all too well  that might is right; that the only measure of justice is the intensity of fire-power and the intricacies of modern mechanical gadgets.123.	Whatever the fortunes of war might be  the United Nations represented in this Assembly should continue to shoulder the supreme responsibility for ensuring that Israeli aggression shall be terminated and that the territories of Egypt  Syria and Jordan  occupied for well over six years  shall be restored to their rightful owners.124.	In the meantime  let us all hope and pray that the long ordeal which has been imposed upon our countries by Israel's wanton aggression  will at last come to an end  enabling our peoples to resume their onward march on the road to progress  development  and peaceful existence.125.	The concerns of the world are also our concerns. What I had intended to speak on in this general debate encompassed the whole spectrum of your Assembly's concerns  political  economic and humanitarian. But the urgency of the events in my area necessitates a departure from the conventional review of international concerns and achievements to a more direct focusing on the present agonies of our peoples at war.'.26. It is agonizingly hard for us to go on repeating year in and year out the painful story of the aggression to which the peoples of the Middle East have fallen victim since the 1967 conflict. It also must be agonizing to this world body to be reminded constantly of its inability to deal effectively with it. And yet  at the cost of repetition  the facts as they stand today must be reaffirmed in this general debate on the world situation. What I intend to state I will do so without acrimony or rhetoric. It is rather the facts  the bare facts  as they exist today and they are as follows:127.	First  since June 1967 Israel has been in occupation of the national soil of Jordan  Egypt and Syria  and under its military rule it enslaves over a million of the indigenous inhabitants of the occupied lands. This is in addition to the one and a half million Palestinian Arabs rendered homeless refugees by the gross injustice and convulsions of 1948. It is a sad epilogue to the great chapter of liberation which the United Nations has witnessed and has helped to forge through over the past 25 years.128.	Secondly  notwithstanding the fundamental principles of the Charter and the multitude of definitive resolutions of the United Nations in opposing conquest  Israel adamantly refuses to withdraw from the occupied territories. In the early years of the occupation  the refusal was based on procedural and mechanical pleas. When these became no longer tenable  Israel came out unrestrained in its penchant for territorial expansion. No longer are the claims for annexation the irresponsible urges of the fanatics and the few. They recently have been incorporated into the official platform of the ruling party  in preparation for the forthcoming elections. If one adds up the territories claimed by the various members of Israel's ruling establishment  they would amount to practically the whole of the occupied lands.129.	Thirdly  virtually every part of the occupied lands has been earmarked for eventual  if not immediate  annexation and colonization  either on grounds of alleged security or of the Zionist mythology. Although the weight of colonization has fallen more heavily on some parts than on others  it is now generally conceded that the tempo of colonization is less inhibited by considerations of international law than by the absorptive capacity of the new colonial Power.130.	Within the over-all strategy of colonization  programmed in practical stages  Israel feverishly is engaged in absorbing and settling the occupied lands. Settlements are mushrooming everywhere  whether in occupied Egypt  Syria or Jordan. The national character of these centuries-old Arab lands is being destroyed systematically.131.	Jerusalem  the city of peace and of eternal history  to which hundreds of millions of people belonging to all religions and denominations look with the reverence which it deserves  is being disfigured beyond recognition  the victim of parochial and heedless fanaticism. And while this blasphemy against civilization continues unabated  the world watches with subdued anger andhelplessness. Even the Security Council's specific resolutions to save the city have remained no more than ink on paper.132.	The Israelis are carrying out these acts of despoliation  confiscation of lands and property and the eviction of the inhabitants of Jerusalem under one false pretext or the other. It is a situation where the occupying Power is devouring by every means the occupied city and destroying its historical  cultural  physical  and human character. What else can this be but the most naked act of conquest and annexation which heeds nothing but its own brute force and its utter insensitivity to the beliefs and welfare of the world at large?133.	It should be recalled that immediately after the 1967 conflict one of the first acts of the General Assembly was the adoption of a resolution [2253 (ES-V)] for the preservation of the historic character and the status quo of the City as a trust of civilization. That trust has been totally abused  the resolution callously ignored. Should the United Nations continue to watch in suspended animation while the process of devouring the Holy City and its people continues unchecked? But the suffering of occupation does not end there.134.	The economies of the occupied territories are being made appendages for the purpose of serving the designs of occupation and the eventual absorption of those territories and their peoples. Large areas of arable land on the west bank of the river Jordan are forcibly made idle by the ever-expanding ""military zones"" and Israeli armed settlements. The gun is replacing the tractor  and the farmers are left with no alternative but to be herded into Israeli farms and industries  only to be discarded when the time is ripe for their eventual expulsion.135.	No one knows better the direct destructive effects of the occupation than my own country and countrymen. Jordan is a country torn asunder by occupation. Well over one third of its citizens are the victim  of that occupation. Hundreds of thousands of its own citizens and residents of other occupied Arab lands have formed another category of misery on its eastern bank  under the name of ""displaced persons"". The economic and social burdens of the occupation are as heavy as the pain of dismemberment is acute: Jordan continues to bear the enormous burden of supporting by every means  economic and otherwise  the determined efforts of its citizens to survive economically  culturally and demo-graphically under an occupation of displacement.136. Fourthly  less tangible but perhaps psychologically more devastating is the climate of extreme uncertainty that surrounds the lives of the masses of people in their occupied homeland. Noone can be sure when the dual pressure of Zionist xenophobia and massive Israeli immigration will create conditions which will transform the policy of gradual displacement into one of outright expulsion. The perpetual fear of such an occurrence is understandably traumatic. The sense of living on borrowed time can end only with termination of the occupation. 137. Fifthly  it may be argued by those who have not had the opportunity to follow closely the sequence of events that a mere compilation of grievances  no matter how just  does not in itself lead to a solution.  the answer is that in November 1967 Jordan accepted Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which outlines the basis of just settlement in the Middle East. By that resolution  the Arab parties accepting it committed themselves to the establishment of a lasting peace in a framework of Israeli withdrawal  mutual guarantees and a just solution to the tragedy of the first victims of Israeli violence  the homeless and dispossessed Palestine Arabs.138. Within that context  we extended full cooperation to the sincere and dedicated efforts of Ambassador Gunnar Jarring  the Special representative of the Secretary-General  who has been entrusted with the task of working with the parties the modalities of implementation. 139. When the secretary-general  Kurt Waldheim  undertook his commendable initiative and visited the area recently  Jordan expressed a genuine and unmistaken resolve to work for a just and lasting peace  provided our sovereignty and territorial integrity are not tampered with. But at every juncture in the process of the peace making  the Israeli government obstructed the process. Israel's negativism has been widely revealed to the world at large despite its deliberate obscurantism  as Israel's designs against the occupied lands unfolded in their full ferocity. it is clear now that Israel  in spite of all its claims to the contrary  is not seeking a just and lasting settlement  but territorial expansion and political hegemony in the area. 140. Moreover  it is becoming the adjacent Arab countries that instead of making  amends for the ruthless dismemberment the displacement of its people  Israel is only determined to do more of the same.141. We listened the other day to the statement of the Foreign Minister of Israel before this assembly  in which he outlined Israel's policies towards the tragic situation prevailing in the Middle East. That statement  of course  contained no new departures and revelations  except for its attempt to use language to conceal real aims. It would be futile exercise to engage in polemics  and equally futile to dismiss lightly a statement so fraught with the most serious policy contents. Let me cite just one examples in the manipulation of semantics to which this Assembly was subjected by Israel's Foreign Minister. 142. The Charter of the aggression against States and the annexation of their national soil. And yet  because Israel occupies the territories of three Member states and has evidently no intention of relinquishing such occupation  the Foreign Minister of Israel declared  using the technique of the double negative  that Israel did not declare that it did not intend to relinquish all or even most of the occupied territories. In plain English it means that Israel does intend to annex portions of the occupied lands and enslave their people. This is the crux of the matter. 143.	That those portions already victims of annexation and colonization include Jerusalem — a continually expanding Jerusalem: to the north  to the south  to the east and to the west  one which practically devours the heartland of the occupied west bank and leaves the rest as virtually isolated pockets — does not seem to evoke much remorse in the Israeli assessment. That the lands annexed or earmarked for annexation include large areas of the fertile Jordan valley  to serve as a security belt  does not seem to impel the Israeli Foreign Minister to ask himself about the hundreds of thousands of human souls for whom such exercises in map-drawing mean a death sentence in the form of displacement  suffering  enslavement and alienation of themselves and of generations yet unborn and the loss of their past  present and future.144.	The trouble is that  underlying the whole of Israel's statement is an arrogant dismissal of any consideration of humanity or of other people's entitlement to God's grace and justice on this earth. The aggrieved inhabitants are simply impediments to be removed or shuttled around —  not human beings to be accorded the inalienable human rights to which they are entitled  as are other human beings and communities.145.	The Israeli Foreign Minister told this Assembly that the Israelis have their roots deeper in that region  in tongue and in spirit  than all the rest. Do we have to remind Israel that when the Hebrew tribes set foot in Palestine some 2 000 years ago  and for a short interlude  they did not descend upon an empty wasteland? They came to the highly developed land of the forefathers of the present victims of the Israeli onslaught  only to marvel in exhilaration at the land of milk and honey which was the product of the toil of the indigenous inhabitants of the land. Palestine was their homeland ages before those tribes ever came there  and has remained their homeland up to the present day — or remained so at least until the Israelis  by brute force and violence  caused their displacement over the past 25 years.146.	Jordan and its Arab brethren have been faced since the occupation with a situation which cannot be accepted. They are for a just and lasting peace  but they cannot accept as its price the loss of their national soil or the permanent enslavement of their people. The Charter of the United Nations precludes any such diktat; the resolutions of the United Nations preclude it no less vehemently. And the spirit of the age marching forward to rid humanity of colonial domination and conquest is irrevocably aligned against it.147.	While we are adamant in our determination to hold on to our rights and national soil  we have a clear vision of how a just settlement can be established. These are its bases: first  Israeli withdrawal from all the territories occupied in June 1967; secondly  action to redress the injustice inflicted upon the Palestinian Arabs who were forced out of their homes in Palestine and dispossessed in 1947-1948 and whose rights have been recognized repeatedly since 1948 by the General Assembly; and thirdly  the enforcement of the principlesof a just peace envisaged in and defined by the provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967).148.	Peace  to be lasting  must be based on justice. Without that no genuine peace can be achieved.149.	I shall end my statement  as I opened it  by urging the General Assembly  to unite in action to end the tragic ordeal of the peoples of the Middle East. The way to end  it is not by side-tracking the fundamental issues which have given rise to it over the past 25 years  and more specifically over the past six years.150.	The fundamental principles involved are clear-cut and overwhelming. They are sustained by the Charter which pledges support for every Member State which falls victim to aggression.151.	Let us  therefore  unite all our efforts and our wills to save the Middle East  which is the cradle of civilization  from the scourge of war and aggression by reaffirming justice  freedom and peace."
"60",3602,"JPN",28,1973,"﻿46.	 On behalf of the Japanese delegation I wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Ambassador Benites on his assumption of the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I am confident that Ambassador Benites will guide this session of the General Assembly with the sagacity and good judgement born of a wealth of experience. My delegation for its part will spare no effort in co-operating with him in the discharge of his great responsibility.47.	At the same time  I wish to express my profound appreciation to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczyuski  the President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We were deeply impressed by the leadership he manifested during that session.48.	I wish to take this opportunity also to pay my tribute to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our esteemed Secretary-General. I recall fondly the great pleasure the Government and people of Japan had in welcoming the Secretary-General to Japan last February for friendly exchanges of views on a variety of problems  both within and outside the purview of the United Nations.49.	I should like next to extend a warm welcome to the Federal Republic of Germany  the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas upon their admission to the United Nations at the opening of the current session of the General Assembly. Let me express our sincere hope that the three new Member States will join the others in contributing to the attainment of the objectives set forth in the Charter.50.	More than a quarter of a century has passed since the end of the Second World War and the birth of the United Nations. Looking back over the history of these years  I cannot but have the keen realization that the world is now entering a new era. Profound changes are taking place in the international situation around us.51.	Let me enumerate a few of the fundamental problems which have characterized the changing world since the Second World War. First  I wish to dwell upon the fact that the development and control of nuclear energy has become a prime determinant of international politics. The development of nuclear weapons  which might be said to be the baleful offspring of the Second World War  has given rise to a ""balance of terror"" in the post-war international community  thus making it possible to avoid the outbreak of total warfare. This is one notable feature of the post-war world. It is a new development  unprecedented in modern history  that large-scale  total warfare has not broken out among the major Powers of the world for nearly 30 years.52.	None the less  it must be admitted in all candour that this state of affairs has been brought about on a highly shaky basis of mutual checkmate among the major Powers  under conditions of the ""balance of terror"". Whatever peace we have had upon this shaky ground has been a ""transient peace""  and it is for this very reason that the United Nations has been making continuous efforts to see that this peace becomes a more stable one. A quarter of a century has elapsed since the end of the war  and the ""transient peace"" has at last begun to show signs of shedding its ""transient"" character. I believe the time has come to build a framework for consolidating and perpetuating these new moves on a more stable basis. I believe the time has come for the United Nations to consider on its part a new pattern of co-operation addressed to the needs of such a new era.53.	The second point I wish to emphasize is the new relations among countries which came out of the war transformed. A large-scale war always brings about an enormous change in the relations among nations  and the Second World War  which was fought literally around the world  was no exception. The relations between the victors and the defeated  the emergence of ""super Powers""  and the relations between them and the rest of the world marked a fundamental change in international politics brought about by the Second World War. Over the quarter century since the war  there has been a gradual but steady process of readjustment of such relations. Today we talk about the multipolarization of the world. What we in fact see in this may be essentially a convergence of the world at large in a new international order  after years of readjustment in the post-war era. I believe it necessary for the United Nations to recognize this change fully and to adapt itself to it with sufficient flexibility so that it can function in a truly effective way as the centre of international peace and co-operation.54.	The third point to be noted is related to the retreat of colonialism and the birth of a number of new nation-States. The number of States Members of the United Nations  which was 51 at its inception in 1945  has grown to 135. The very fact that the vast majority of these newly admitted Members are new States  born after the war  amply testifies to the magnitude of the change. This in itself is a phenomenon which merits special mention in the history of the world.55.	I believe  however  that I am justified in saying that the change which this produced in post-war international relations was not only one of quantity but also one of quality and goes to the root of such relations. As former colonies were liberated and a number of new States came into existence  there emerged in the international community diversities in many respects such as race  creed  ideology  culture and even scales of values. Consequently  it has become more difficult than ever before to reach consensus in dealing with the multitude of problems which confront the world.56.	We realize this difficulty fully when we recall the major problems we are now addressing ourselves to in the United Nations. At the same time we realize that the role to be played by an organization like the United Nations has become all the more important inasmuch as it aims at the adjustment of different scales of values and the realization of international accords in this highly diverse world of today.57.	In order to grasp precisely the changes in the contemporary world I have just described and to respond to them in an appropriate manner  we have to develop an awareness on the part of us Member States in line with the new situation. I consider it most essential for all Member States to appreciate this challenge and to proceed to co-operate within and outside the United Nations in tackling the major problems of the world which are brought before the United Nations today.58.	In this connexion I should particularly like to stress that many of the multifarious problems of today's world cannot be resolved satisfactorily through isolated efforts of an individual State or even through traditional bilateral means. The problem of natural resources and energy and the problem of world food are typical examples of such problems becoming increasingly urgent in recent years. Similarly  in order to ensure the prosperity of the international community as a whole and to promote the well-being and the standard of living of each of its members  it is essential to expand trade in accordance with internationally established rules. In this context  international trade and monetary problems are also problems which require solutions through concerted efforts and co-operation among nations. We are faced also with the problem of the human environment and with the problem of economic and social development in developing countries  which is of the greatest concern to all of us in the present-day world. We all know that we cannot hope to solve these problems through isolated  single-handed efforts. We must all recognize the absolute necessity of guiding our work with the recognition that this is really one world  not just one world in the abstract.59.	I would even go one step further and stress that the implications of that fact go beyond the realms of economic and social development or of scientific and technical collaboration  and that they are extremely important also in ensuring world peace and security. To illustrate this point  international co-operation in the field of disarmament can be effective only if we tackle the problem  not merely in terms of military power  but also on the basis of wide-ranging co-operation among all the nations in such diverse fields as the economy and science and technology.It is from this viewpoint that Japan is contributing as best it can to the promotion of disarmament  in particular nuclear disarmament  as an important aspect of its foreign policy  by making its knowledge and technology available in the cause of world peace.60.	1 believe that the few examples I have cited show clearly that the world is now entering an era of new possibilities  an era in which interdependence among States  mutual understanding among peoples and wide-ranging cooperation in the fields of the economy and culture  communications and technology could serve as more effective vehicles for the maintenance of lasting and stable peace than deterrence by force or deterrence by the balance of terror.61.	What we need now in this rapidly changing world is to build a new framework for co-operation and to translate the emerging awareness of the solidarity of the international community into concrete action. It is true that at the time of its inception the United Stations did not clearly envisage for itself this role as the centre of efforts for such actions. Nevertheless we have every hope and expectation that the United Nations will succeed in adapting itself to this new challenge of the time and become an organization capable of responding to the challenges which confront us in the world today  We have high expectations for the United Nations in this respect  since  with all its imperfections  it is the only body mankind can turn to today.62.	At this juncture I wish to invite the attention of this Assembly to the introduction to the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization for the past year fA/9001/Add.l]  issued a few weeks ago. This report shares the viewpoint I have tried to elaborate. In particular  the Secretary-General has urged the States Members of the United Nations ""to decide on constructive  contemporary and imaginative ways in which it can be used to meet the present and future problems which we face"" through mutual co-operation. I am fully in agreement with that view. I wish to welcome as appropriate and timely the initiative for the examination of the problem as suggested by the Secretary-General.63.	As early as on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations  Japan emphasized the need to review the Charter in order that this Organization might be able to adapt itself to the changes of the 25 years since the war.3 Now that the United Nations is approaching its thirtieth anniversary  I should like to propose that each Member State engage in soul-searching  free from any preconceived ideas  and reflect on the role to be played by the United Nations in this new era. We can share the benefits of our wisdom and rally our forces together in the common effort to open up a new vista for the future of the Organization 64.	When I consider the role the United Nations can play in the ever-changing world of today  I find it necessary to emphasize how important it is for Asia  which has undergone unprecedented changes since the Second World War  to find a new order and stability befitting the newsituation in which it finds itself. I do not think I need reiterate here our deep interest in important questions confronting the world today  for which there is an ever-increasing need for an early settlement. I refer  for example  to the problem of the Middle East and the question of southern Africa. Nor do I need to stress the importance we attach to new developments among nations in other parts of the world  particularly in Europe  as symbolized by the Conference on Security and Cooperation In Europe.65.	But  as the representative of Japan  which is located in a part of Asia  I cannot but notice in particular the outstanding changes both in quantity and in quality that have taken place in Asia amid the major developments in the world over the past year since the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly.66.	The first to be noted in this connexion is the return of the People's Republic of China to the international community  symbolized by the restoration of its seat at the United Nations at the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly  two years ago [resolution 2758 (XXVI)]. I accompanied Prime Minister Tanaka when he visited Peking just one year ago with the mission of putting an end to the anomalous relations which had existed between the two countries for such a long time. As a result  diplomatic relations were established between the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China under their joint communiqué of 29 September 1972. It is also to be noted that developments leading to the improvement of relations between China and the United States of America  which began with the announcement in 1971 that President Nixon would visit Peking  have been accelerated since then. On the other hand  I have noted with great interest that efforts to achieve a new order and stability have been intensified among the nations of Asia  particularly among the Association of South-East Asian Nations group countries. That development should be evaluated as symbolic of the spontaneous efforts of the nations of the region.67.	In Indo-China  the Agreement on Viet-Nam was concluded in January this year and the Peace Agreement on Laos in February. Moreover  in Laos  the agreement on the solution of the. political and military problems was reached among the parties concerned and the Protocol to the Peace Agreement was signed. Thus  the international situation in the Indo-Chinese peninsula has undergone an epoch-making development leading towards a lasting peace.68.	Japan established diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam on 21 September  taking into account the new international developments brought about by the conclusion of the Paris Agreement. I firmly believe that this establishment of diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam can contribute to the peace and stability of the Indo-China region in the future. In Cambodia  to our regret  there is yet no prospect of peace in sight and fighting still continues. Japan  for its part  seeks peace and stability in Indo-China and earnestly hopes for the early settlement of Cambodian problems. I cannot but express deep concern over the present situation in Cambodia.69.	Japan thinks it desirable that the settlement of Cambodian problems be brought about without outside interference  through peaceful negotiations among the Cambodian parties concerned  in accordance with the principle of self-determination. From this viewpoint  Japan wishes to appeal to the Cambodian parties concerned that they  for their part  spare no effort to assist the efforts of the parties concerned.70.	There has also been a significant development in the Korean peninsula. Ever since the issuance of the joint Communiqué at Seoul and Pyongyang on 4 July 1972  the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have been engaged in a direct dialogue and have been endeavouring to find their own solution for their problems. My country sincerely welcomes this dialogue and wishes to observe its progress with patience and sympathy. In this connexion  the statement made by President Park Chung Hee on 23 June of this year is a monumental landmark in the path of securing peace and security in the Korean peninsula  We foresee a number of difficult obstacles to be surmounted before the goal of unification  which all the people of Korea so ardently desire  can be achieved and permanent peace and security in the region can be attained. We appreciate highly the fact that the Government of the Republic of Korea has shown  in frank recognition of the reality of coexistence of the Governments in the South and the North  its realistic and constructive attitude in dealing with the situation before the achievement of the ideal of unification. We sincerely hope that the dialogue and co-operation between South and North will be developed further and that the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula will be maintained  thus strengthening the foundation for peaceful unification.71.	On the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent  the groundwork for the normalization of relations between India and Pakistan was laid with the conclusion of the Simla Agreement of 2 July 1972. We are gratified to note that an agreement was subsequently reached in New Delhi on 28 August of this year for the solution of the pending issues regarding prisoners of war  as a result of continuous efforts made by the two countries. It is our hope that Bangladesh will be welcomed to membership in the United Nations at the earliest possible date.72.	I believe that these new developments during the past year are clear signs that Asia is now entering a new era in which Asians will seek a new and stable order  and prosperity based on such order. As one responsible for the foreign policy of Japan  an Asian nation  I welcome these new developments in Asia and renew my determination to fulfil our responsibility in the cause of further stability and development in Asia. It is in this spirit that I wish to take this occasion to reflect on the roles the United Nations can and is expected to play in advancing the stability and prosperity of the region.73.	I need hardly reiterate that the United Nations  as a universal international Organization  is responsible for the maintenance of peace and prosperity in all the regions of the world. This implies in no way that the United Nations can remain indifferent to possibilities for regional cooperation in each individual part of the world. The United Nations is an organization whose basic objective is to promote the security and welfare of the whole world and mankind. In the process of achieving this objective  however  the United Nations is expected to encourage  in the political  social and economic fields  the kind of regional co-operation best suited to individual regions  taking into account their respective characteristics and thus contributing to the harmonization of efforts to promote peace and prosperity through regional co-operation. I attach the greatest importance to the study of the concrete measures which the United Nations can take today for Asia  which is in a period of transition  for this will offer very useful suggestions in probing for new possibilities open to the activities of the United Nations in this new era.74.	To that end  I should like to examine today the presence of the United Nations in Asia and explore this question from three different angles: namely  first  what role the United Nations can play in the maintenance of peace in the region; secondly  what contribution the United Nations can make to the economic and social development of the region; and  thirdly  what should be the relations between the United Nations and Asia in the fields of culture and science.75.	The end of the war in Viet-Nam is  as I have pointed out  an event of such importance that it could signal the opening of a new era in Asia. I sincerely hope for the earliest possible arrival of the day when the peoples of Indo-China can concentrate their entire energy on the task of the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the region; the day when they can work for the stabilization of their lives and the promotion of their welfare; the day when lasting peace in the region can thus be ensured. In this perspective  I am firmly convinced that the United Nations can play no small role in stabilizing life as well as promoting welfare in this region  thereby bringing about peace and security in the region.76.	In this connexion  I welcome the statement made on 27 February 1973 by Secretary-General Waldheim  at the International Conference on Viet-Nam in Paris  that if the Governments in the region so desired  the United Nations and its specialized agencies could play an important role in receiving  co-ordinating and distributing international aid to meet emergency and rehabilitation needs. My country has long stressed the necessity for the provision of rehabilitation assistance to die region  and is already adopting the policy of initiating whatever assistance is feasible at present. However  I believe it desirable that such rehabilitation assistance should be made available for the whole of Indo-China  regardless of differences of social system  on the basis of broad international co-operation. We therefore expect the United Nations to play a positive role in promoting international co-operation directed to the entire Indo-China region  and Japan will be prepared to make an appropriate contribution to such activities of the United Nations.77.	In seeking lasting peace and security in Indo-China  I believe that it is important to re-examine the roles theUnited Nations can play for the purpose of maintaining and ensuring peace in Indo-China.78.	As Members are aware  Japan appreciates highly the activities undertaken by the United Nations to prevent the spread or recurrence of. conflicts; these activities are in fact the most effective manifestation of the peace-keeping functions of the United Nations conceivable in the present circumstances. In particular  the achievements of the United Nations in such areas as Kashmir  the Middle East  the Congo and Cyprus have marked an important page in the history of the Organization's maintenance of international peace and security. It is from this viewpoint that we have advocated at several past sessions of the General Assembly the strengthening of such functions of the United Nations and their further institutionalization.79.	In Indo-China  where there are at last growing prospects for peace after many years of conflict  it is highly opportune for the United Nations to reaffirm its role as a peace-keeping Organization and to explore the possibilities open to it in ensuring peace in this region. Such an initiative merits serious consideration as a part of the long-term task of determining how the framework can be built under which peace and stability in Asia are to be secured. Until now  I must concede  the United Nations has not concerned itself sufficiently with the conflicts in the region. It has in fact been denied an important role in settling these conflicts by the inhibiting reality of international politics. However  the United Nations has proved itself to be capable of functioning with adequate effectiveness at least in the field of preventing the spread and the recurrence of conflicts  and this is a field for which the United Nations is discharging the primary responsibility. We should always bear this in mind as we examine the possibilities  consideration should be given to the will and desire of the countries concerned. In this spirit  both Viet-Nams should be welcomed as Members of the Organization if they wish to join.80.	In the Korean peninsula  the United Nations has been involved in the problem of the unification of Korea from 1947 until today. We believe that the United Nations deserves deep appreciation for the valuable role it has played by its presence in restoring and maintaining peace in this region. It has immensely contributed to the maintenance of peace in the whole of Asia.81.	The United Nations has persevered for a long time in its efforts to achieve rehabilitation and unification in the Korean peninsula through the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. There have been recent moves calling for new responses on the part of the United Nations. The significant development of the situation in the Korean peninsula  and the efforts of North and South Korea to make progress by means of a peaceful dialogue between themselves  have made it most important for the United Nations to adapt itself to the new situation and to welcome and encourage such moves. It is also important for the United Nations to re-examine its role in a constructive manner  and to seek the most appropriate way for the Organization to co-operate in the establishment of a stable order in the Korean peninsula.82.	It is equally essential to have a correct understanding of the role which has been and is still being played by theUnited Nations in the restoration and maintenance of peace in the Korean peninsula. It is now 20 years since the termination of the Korean war  and the United Nations is still fulfilling its responsibility  as a direct party to the Armistice Agreement   for enforcing and securing the armistice line  thereby contributing to peace in this region. It is my conviction that this fact should never be forgotten by the Members of the United Nations who are responsible for  and concerned with  the maintenance of international peace and security.83.	As we turn our attention to the field of economic and social development  we find ourselves in the year of the first review and appraisal of the International Development Strategy for the United Nations Second Development Decade  which was adopted at the twenty-fifth commemorative session of the General Assembly. Japan welcomes this programme as a significant undertaking.84.	At the same time  in implementing such an ambitious programme and in seeking to bring about the economic and social progress and development of the world  it is not to be forgotten that Asia  with a population of over 2 billion  — more than half the total population of the earth  and embracing a large geographical area as well-merits weighty consideration. It should be noted that  despite the very low average per capita income of the developing countries in Asia  the per capita receipt of official development assistance in Asia from 1969 to 1971 amounted only to an annual average of USD3.13  which is below the average per capita receipt of $4.27 for die developing countries as a whole. I should like to stress the necessity of giving greater consideration to the needs of the Asian region  as symbolized by these figures  in order to achieve the over-ail goals and objectives of the Development Strategy.85.	While it is our expectation that the Asian countries will continue to accelerate their own-efforts for development  my country for its part will continue to co-operate with them in whatever way we can. In this connexion  I should like to point out that there is much room for the United Nations to take a more active part in tire economic and social development of Asia. As a concrete possibility along these lines  I should like to make particular mention of the recent movement in which the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East [ECAFE] is expected to be further strengthened and developed in a new direction while responding flexibly to the changing situation in Asia.86.	My country hopes that ECAFE  which covers almost all the countries of Asia  can make a great contribution to the achievement of the common goals of over-all economic and social development of the countries of the region  while overcoming the difficulties arising from the diversity and complexity involved in all the political  economic and social aspects of the Asian region. My country firmly believes that such a contribution by ECAFE is indispensable for the prosperity of Asia.87.	In this context  it can be said that the twenty-ninth session of ECAFE  held in Tokyo last April  was particularly significant. At that session  against the background of various important events indicating the tidal wave of change in the region over* the past one or two years  it was recognized that it is of utmost importance to stabilize and elevate people's livelihood through the economic development of the entire region  and thereby to strengthen the foundations for peace. I should like to take this opportunity to make a few suggestions on the significance of ECAFE and the desirable role it can play against the background of the achievements of the Tokyo session. 88.	First of all  it is felt that  although ECAFE has numerous achievements in the past to its credit  its recent activities have been extremely diversified on all fronts  perhaps excessively so. I think it has become necessary for ECAFE to give constant consideration to the fixing of priorities and in so doing to discard obsolete projects and consequently give preference to projects in new fields which are truly necessary for the economic and social development of Asia.89.	Secondly  in contrast with the past activities of ECAFE  which have been focused on industrialization  trade and resource development  I should like to call attention to the importance of agricultural development as the heart of the economic development of Asia. The economy of developing countries in Asia is heavily dependent on agriculture  and agricultural development is the key to their over-all economic development. From this point of view my country stressed at the Tokyo session that ECAFE should explore a new strategy for economic development  based on a comprehensive approach  with greater emphasis on more efficient agricultural development. It is gratifying to note that such a way of thinking  as set forth by my country  came to be shared by other members of ECAFE  and finally found its expression in the resolution adopted at the session.90.	Thirdly  we are all well aware that  parallel with agricultural- development  a solution of the population problem is another key to Asian development  In connexion with the problems of employment and over-all social development  over-population constitutes an important cause of mass poverty in Asia. It is the expectation of my Government that ECAFE will also play a greater role in this field.91.	Fortunately  ECAFE  now headed by Mr. Maramis  the new Executive Secretary  has actively launched reforms of its activities. It is the intention of my Government to consider a wide range of co-operative measures in dealing with these problems. I highly appreciate the importance of such positive co-operation toward economic and social development by ECAFE  which represents the presence of the United Nations in Asia. I sincerely hope that the United Nations will play an ever increasing role in the over-all economic and social development of Asia through ECAFE  with full co-operation and co-ordination with other agencies of the United Nations family  such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  which are undertaking valuable activities in this field.92.	As I turn to the activities of the United Nations in Asia in the fields of science and culture  I wish  first  to refer to the point I made at the outset  namely  that the world of today embraces diversities of race  creed  ideology and scales of value. In such a diverse world  greater importance than ever is attached to the role to be played by an international organization like the United Nations  which aims at adjusting the different views and values of various peoples and thereby achieving international consensus. In this spirit my country believes that the establishment of the United Nations University  which was approved at the last session of the General Assembly [resolution 2951 (XXVII)]  will be a highly significant undertaking.93.	Japan has always recognized the utmost importance of the realization and strengthening of international solidarity as a means of laying the foundation for peace  and  for that purpose  has consistently endeavoured to make the United Nations University a reality ever since U Thant  the former Secretary-General  proposed that project in 1969.® For reasons of history and geography  Japan has had the experience of being a cultural meeting-point between the East and the West  and has endeavoured to act as a bridge between the developed and the developing countries. With this in mind  I firmly believe that  if the headquarters of the United Nations University is established in our country  it can play an extremely important role in promoting the presence of the United Nations in Asia. The University has vast opportunities open to it in many areas of learning -such as the comparative studies of different cultures and social values in the world  the development of measures to tackle the environmental problems common to all human beings living on the ""only one earth""  and studies of possibilities for co-operation between the developed and the developing countries in promoting economic and social development  The symbolic importance of locating the headquarters of this world-wide research institution in Asia is by no means small.94.	At the same time  with a view to securing sound administration of the University on a stable financial basis and in accordance with the principles of academic freedom and independence  I believe it is necessary to establish what we might term ""the endowment fund of the United Nations University""  to enable the University to obtain the necessary financial resources for its administration. My country therefore hopes that the maximum number of Member States  as well as other sources  will join in making contributions to this fund and share the burden in reasonable proportions. The University can then acquire a truly international character and prove to be a most effective means of international co-operation  I wish to announce that  with the fulfilment of these expectations  the Government of Japan is prepared to make a financial contribution to the fund up to a total amount of SUS 100 million in five yearly instalments  subject to the approval of the Diet.95.	Besides those activities which I have touched upon  mention should be made of the activities of the United Nations and other related bodies in the fields of science and culture  covering such extensive and complex areas of international co-operation as the sea  outer space  atomic energy  the human environment and meteorology.. With therapid progress of science and technology  the activities of United Nations bodies in these areas are expected to become increasingly important. At the same time  in considering the Organization's activities in these new areas  attention should be paid to the enormous usefulness of regional co-operation and the possibilities of helping to solve some of these problems through a regional approach-96.	For example  in the protection of the human environment  monitoring programmes and other regionally organized activities are necessary and can be effective. In the Asian region  positive initiatives in this direction have been taken by such bodies as ECAFE  and further development of such co-operation should be considered. In the field of outer space there have also been active deliberations in the forums of the United Nations concerned with such problems as direct broadcast satellites  which will be put to practical use in the near future. It is the desire of my Government that the direct broadcast satellites to be launched over the Asian and Pacific region should contribute to the greater solidarity of the international community in that part of the world.97.	I have made some suggestions here focusing attention on the question of what roles the United Nations should play in Asia  which is on the threshold of a new era. However  in order to play its full role in responding to the expectations of Asia  as well as of the rest of the world  the United Nations naturally must consolidate its foundation and should make great strides In its future activities on the basis of a stable foundation. Before concluding  therefore  I should like to touch upon the necessity of stepping up efforts to strengthen the financial position of the Organization.98.	It is indeed deplorable that the United Nations is facing a serious obstacle to the effective and efficient performance of its functions as a result of the growing accumulation of debts year after year. In a realistic response to this problem  Japan has made its positive contribution to a series of new efforts to find a comprehensive and complete solution for the accumulating deficit of the Organization. To our great disappointment  however  no solution has been found to this day. Representatives of many Member States have stressed the importance of placing the finances of the United Nations on a sound basis. I am convinced that there is unanimous recognition among the Member States of the importance of settling this matter as soon as possible.99.	What is urgently required now is a positive move which will trigger concrete actions leading to the solution of the problem on the basis of our common concern. I appeal to those Member States which support the principal financial needs of the United Nations- and in particular to the permanent members of the Security Council  which are entrusted with special tasks and high responsibilities for the maintenance and development of the United Nations-to take the initiative in making voluntary contributions to the Organization.100.	In making this appeal  I should like to announce that the Government of Japan is ready to seek the approval of the Diet at the earliest opportunity for a voluntary contribution of $US 10 million to help solve the financial problem. This contribution is not only an expression of the high hopes and great esteem that the people of Japan have for the activities of the United Nations  but also clear evidence of my country's spirit of co-operation with the United Nations. I make this announcement with the expectation that it will induce other Member States to take similar action and thus mark the first concrete step towards a fundamental solution of the financial problem. I wish to couple this announcement with the expression of my sincere hope that all the Member States  in particular those in a position to provide the principal financial support of the United Nations  will demonstrate their constructive and co-operative attitude. At the same time  I wish to request the Secretary-General to make still greater efforts to solve the financial problem.101.	My country has a deep-rooted national policy of living as a peace-loving nation  committed to its ideal of preserving its security and existence  trusting in the justice and faith of the peoples of the world. For a country like Japan  with its dense population and scarce natural resources  there can be no peace without peace for the world  and no prosperity without prosperity for the world. From such a standpoint  my country is determined not merely to be a beneficiary of peace but also to accept its responsibility in the building of peace.102.	The United Nations is the forum for co-operation in a wide range of fields  covering politics  economy  culture  science and technology. Such co-operation  I believe  is the best means for Japan to abide by its renunciation of the role of a military Power  and to contribute to the building of peace. As I mentioned earlier  the world is now moving into an era in which deterrence by international cooperation will assume ever-greater importance in maintaining and ensuring peace and will supersede deterrence by force. My country sincerely hopes that the United Nations will become the principal vehicle for such deterrence by international co-operation and firmly intends to redouble its efforts to strengthen such functions of the Organization.103.	In this connexion I wish to express my appreciation for the sympathetic statement by the Secretary of State of the United States in which he expressed his support of the important role to be played by Japan in the United Nations.104.	I shall be extremely happy if what I have said can be taken as evidence of Japan's hopes for the United Nations as well as its earnest desire to strengthen it.105.	In closing  let me express my sincere hope that this session of the General Assembly will succeed in achieving constructive and fruitful results."
"61",3674,"KEN",28,1973,"﻿83.	Mr. President and representatives  I bring to you the greetings and good wishes for the success of our deliberations from His Excellency President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta of the Republic of Kenya. That veteran fighter for freedom  liberty and independence for the oppressed people of the world now stands ready to fight for peace  liberty and justice for all nations  particularly individuals and minority groups who face oppression from any State.84.	My delegation extends its felicitations to the newly- elected President of the General Assembly  Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador. His exceptional ability  breadth of vision and wide experience in the affairs of the United Nations should ensure the successful conclusion of the present session.85.	To the outgoing President  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski of Poland  we express our deep gratitude for conducting the last session with dispatch  skill and success.86.	My delegation deems it appropriate to welcome into our fold the new Members — namely  the Federal Republic of Germany  the German Democratic Republic  and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. It is our conviction that their membership will strengthen the United Nations and promote effectively its fundamental objectives of peace  justice and co-operation. We hope that the stand of the United Nations for the promotion of justice and equality in the Territories under colonial domination or in the minority racist regimes in Africa will receive their unequivocal  sympathetic  and action-oriented support.87.	Turning now to the seemingly intractable problem of the Middle East  I wish to express the deep concern of my country over the grave situation in the Middle East. In less than 25 years  this is the fourth full-scale war which has engulfed the people of the Middle East in untold suffering and destruction. Unless checked soon  it could easily develop into a global conflagration.88.	We African countries are not big Powers; we do not possess arsenals of sophisticated weapons. But we are intensely interested in peace  justice  progress and good- neighbourliness. Our own economies can develop only in conditions of peace and harmony. Therefore  we must play an active and sustained role in bringing about an honourable  just and expeditious settlement to the Middle East crisis under a durable structure of peace. In our view  what is called for is a fresh initiative by the African countries  alongside the other nations  to bring about the desired peace. This would be complementary to any efforts of the Security Council to find a meaningful and just solution through purposeful initiatives.89.	The current eruption of warfare should be terminated by cessation of hostilities  the immediate withdrawal of troops  and application of the following principles: first  the acquisition of territory by force of arms is inadmissible; secondly  all States in the region have a right to existence in conditions of peace and security; thirdly  the rights of the displaced Palestinians should under no circumstances be abused  overlooked  sacrificed or minimized; fourthly  the super-Powers should desist from accelerating an arms race in the whole region  because it eventually acts as a catalyst to warfare; and fifthly  an international system for guaranteeing the territorial inviolability and political independence of every State in the area  including measures of demilitarization and the establishment of zones of peace  if necessary  should be seriously considered.90.	Kenya sincerely hopes that unnecessary loss of life and property on all sides will be averted through a cease-fire. It is high time that a permanent solution  which has long proved elusive in the halls and corridors of our Organization  was found — for the benefit of the peoples of that region and for world peace at large. The immediate national interests of foreign States should not be permitted to override the supreme necessity of restoring a lasting peace in the Middle East.91.	Our yearly congregation in New York for the General Assembly session should not be merely an exercise in passing resolutions and declarations or exchanging impressive rhetoric and bitter polemics for consignment to the mushrooming archives of the United Nations. Urgent political issues of decolonization and restoration of peace require our urgent attention. Loud rumbles of economic discontent call for concerted action. Threats to peace need to be totally eliminated. Super-Power interests and covert collaboration should not be permitted to diminish the role of the United Nations in peace-keeping and in the processes of peace- building. The liberation of over 30 million Africans held in servitude in southern Africa should be accelerated by determined action on the part of the international community. The rapidly opening horizons in science and technology need to be applied to development for the eradication of poverty  disease  illiteracy and squalor.92.	In short  the challenges to be faced are numerous and multidimensional. Our responsibilities  therefore  are all the greater. To meet them realistically  we must not remain locked in sterile debate  inordinate delay or ideological confrontation. That is the path to abdication of responsibility  chaos and eventual ruination.93.	It is only proper that we should welcome the recent international detente  even if it does not mean a solution to most of the outstanding problems of this day and age. The dialogue of peace and co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union should be seen as a hopeful development. Similarly  the meeting together of two big Powers  which are also permanent members of the Security Council — one from the East and the other from the West —  is a step in the right direction.94.	The cessation of hostilities in  and the withdrawal of foreign troops from  Viet-Nam should help the cause of peace and rehabilitation in that war-ravaged part of the world.95.	The process of reconciliation and normality between India and Pakistan should prove useful for building a durable structure of peace  progress and co-operation on the Indian subcontinent  encompassing as it does the great States of India  Pakistan and Bangladesh.96.	Tangible results from the difficult negotiations at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe are expected to strengthen peaceful relations amongst States  which should cut across the military pacts conceived in the context of cold-war politics. The enlarged European Economic Community should act as an effective counterpoise to the unbridled ambitions of the super-Powers. Other regional groupings of newly-emergent nations have a similar role to play.97.	The Assembly will readily understand Kenya's concern for the dire fate of millions of Africans who are condemned to slavery by Portuguese colonialism in Angola  Mozambique  and Guinea-Bissau  by the repression and terror of the apartheid regime in South Africa and Namibia and by the illegal rebel regime in Rhodesia.98.	Before I dwell in some depth on the situation in southern Africa  I should like to hail the Declaration of Independence by the valiant freedom fighters of Guinea-Bissau. After decades of the slaughter of innocent men  women and children; after incalculable loss of property; after indescribable sufferings and deprivation  the gallant people of Guinea-Bissau have finally achieved their independence by armed struggle.99.	Just as the Mau Maus of Kenya tore to shreds British colonial occupation in our forests  just as the Algerians defeated  the French in the vast desert expanses of the Sahara  the people of Guinea-Bissau have now smashed the Portuguese colonialist presence in Guinea-Bissau by a relentless fight in the forests  plains and valleys of Guinea. That is an object lesson for the oppressed peoples of South Africa  Rhodesia and Namibia to take to the velds and karoos of southern Africa to win their independence if all peaceful methods fail to give them their inalienable birthright to freedom and sovereignty.100.	Kenya pledges unreserved support to the people of Guinea-Bissau in consolidating their independence. Recognizing the new State is not sufficient in itself; we must ensure that it receives every form of moral and material support  particularly from the African and non-aligned countries that consistently supported the liberation struggle  in Guinea-Bissau. Kenya not only recognizes the new State of Guinea-Bissau  but is ready to offer any help that the new State may need.101.	Africa holds no brief for violence. Africa wants a peaceful solution to problems of race and inequality in Territories under alien domination and minority racist regimes. If  however  all these methods fail  then no one should blame the Africans for raising the standard of rebellion and violence against the oppression  terror and bloodshed which is inflicted on them by unrepresentative and imposed orders. If it should prove necessary  Africa is ready to water the tree of liberty with blood. Responsibility for any ensuing racial conflagration must then be placed squarely at the door of the racists and the colonialists. Let that be very clearly understood both by the racists and by the world community.102.	The conscience of the world has been outraged by the atrocities committed by the trigger-happy Portuguese soldiers in Mozambique. Defenceless  unarmed and innocent men  women and children have been butchered in the villages of Mozambique. These brutalities were exposed by reputable missionaries and by international journalists with impeccable credentials. It is probable that such massacres take place in great secrecy with calculated regularity in areas under Portuguese domination. This body must act to stop this wave of destruction  rape and plunder against the African population. The United Nations has a decisive role to play in this regard.103.	The Portuguese should learn from their allies of 600 years  the British  who once held sway over a global empire over which the sun was supposed never to set. The winds of change swept away that myth and Britain realistically granted independence to almost all its colonies and Territories. Today the representatives of the liberated countries sit with Britain in the councils of the United Nations. In cordiality  and without bitterness over the past  they even have a club called the ""Commonwealth"".104.	Portugal should also learn from France  another imperial Power that was forced to grant independence to numerous colonies in Africa and elsewhere.105.	Portugal  in this day and age  lives in the dead dreams of the yesteryear of Vasco da Gama  when it thought that its writ spread from Europe across Africa to the Far East. That is amply demonstrated by the fact that even today two members sit in the Portuguese legislature who are supposed to represent Goa. That is indeed the height of absurdity. The impoverished  impostor Government of Caetano should now realise that the boundaries of Portugal do not extend beyond Europe. Unless Portugal wakes up from this Rip van Winkle sleep  it is in for rude shocks.106.	We call upon the Church in Portugal and the enlightened opinion of the young and the intellectuals to join hands with us. Let us expose the fictitious nature and bankruptcy of the policies of the Portuguese regime which have spelled misery  bloodshed and ruin for millions of enslaved and helpless Africans.107.	The non-aligned countries which held a summit meeting last month in Algiers adopted a resolution which urged all members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] to expel or suspend Portugal from NATO unless it terminates its colonial wars in Africa  stops the massacre of Africans  withdraws its troops from Africansoil and grants independence to its colonies [see A/9330 and Corr. 1  pp. 36-38]. The reasons for that move are very clear. NATO arms intended for Europe release weapons in Portuguese possession for prosecuting Portuguese colonial wars in Africa. Portuguese officers trained under NATO programmes are known to be transferred later to the African theatre of war. They are therefore used  not for the purpose originally intended  but for maintaining the colonialization of Africans. These arms are not used for the avowed aim of protecting the freedom and liberty of Europeans  but rather to promote the suppression of human rights  democracy and freedom in Africa.108.	In the face of Portuguese brutalities in Africa  no member of NATO can support the use of herbicides  defoliants and exceedingly potent chemical weapons for the mass destruction of people and crops. Many members of NATO themselves suffered from Hitlerite oppression which they eventually defeated through enormous sacrifices in life  limb and property. Our struggle against the alien regimes that are essentially Hitlerite in character and content is similar. Therefore  members of NATO should stand behind us in our legitimate struggle; for what is good for freedom- loving Europeans is equally good for the oppressed Africans. It is clear for them to see that Portugal is committed to a cause that is futile and a war it can never win. Let NATO members therefore play a rightful role in this shameful episode of Portuguese colonization of African Territories.109.	Kenya is gratified that progressive countries like Norway and Denmark are now openly questioning in the NATO Councils the wisdom of the Portuguese colonial war effort in Africa. Other countries  like Sweden  the Netherlands and those in the socialist camp  have stepped up their moral and material assistance to the liberation movements in Africa. To all these countries we express our deepest gratitude. To the others that do not yet support us  we address an appeal to emulate the worthy example of the countries sympathetic to our cause.110.	We also welcome the support that organizations like the World Council of Churches  the Anti-Apartheid Movement and many other private and public institutions are giving to the cause of freedom and independence in our continent of Africa.111.	Here I should like directly to address France  a country which is associated with the noble sentiments of liberty equality and fraternity of mankind. Has France forgotten or neglected these ideals  which contributed to its greatness? If not  it should come out in the open with a clean conscience and bring pressure to bear upon Portugal to terminate the massacre of the black people in Africa and to grant them their inalienable right to freedom and independence.112.	I ask Britain  which is credited with democratic traditions  rule of law and humanitarianism  not to disown its time-honoured values. The United Kingdom should not be seen to be associating with countries like Portugal  which systematically practise genocide and slavery in Africa.113.	The great country of the United States  whose modern democracy was laid down by men like Washington  Jefferson and Lincoln  should not disgrace the glorious principles which were laid down by these men. It should not be associating with a puny Power like Portugal  which has spread terror and rained death and destruction on our continent.114.	All these great and self-confessed Christian nations should not fold their hands and sit back oblivious to the decimation of the black people in Africa by the brutal and dehumanizing policies of Portugal. Kenya urges all of them to suspend or expel Portugal from membership in NATO unless it complies with the principles and purposes for which the Organization was established.115.	The Decolonization Mission of the Organization of African Unity [OA U]  on which Kenya had the privilege of serving  highlighted the plight of subjugated Africa during its sojourn to numerous world capitals. World attention is now focused on the sufferings of Africans under colonial regimes. The United Nations-sponsored International Conference of Experts for the Support of Victims of Colonialism and Apartheid in Southern Africa  which was held earlier this year in Oslo  was indeed successful. More such conferences should be held throughout the world to keep this issue alive and under constant review by world leaders.116.	The Cabora Bassa hydroelectric project in the Tete province of Mozambique is conceived as a master-plan to settle millions of poor whites from Portugal so that they can enrich themselves through the toil  tears and sweat of the Africans. This will enable the whites to carry on indefinitely the oppression of the blacks and  through the exploitation of the vast mineral resources of this Territory  to fill the coffers of metropolitan treasuries in Europe.117.	Although technically it would be a good project for a free  democratic Mozambique  at this juncture it is wrong to support it because it will strengthen Portuguese colonialism in Africa. It was for that reason that the OAU Decolonization Mission requested Western Governments  institutions  bankers and investors to desist from taking part in this project. We are grateful to the Governments which heeded our appeal; I must single out for special mention many Swedish and Italian firms which withdrew their participation from the Cabora Bassa project. We request those who did not do so to examine their conscience and help Africa's cause. We are merely asking for the postponement of their collaboration  not for their permanent exclusion from the project. When Mozambique attains independence  it can proceed to completion. At that time we shall appreciate it.118.	Kenya also urges the isolation of and a comprehensive boycott against Portugal. The Security Council should act decisively to repel threats to international peace and security posed by Portuguese colonialism in Africa. An arms embargo against Portugal is called for. Brutalities and excesses of the Portuguese troops in Africa should continue to be exposed in the hope that the outraged world conscience will be galvanized into effective action against the colonialists in Africa. Concrete and meaningful steps are necessary to break the growing alliance between Portugal  South Africa and Rhodesian whites.119.	In South Africa a most explosive and dangerous situation obtains. As if the massacre of Africans in 1960 at Sharpeville was not enough  the South Africans indiscriminately slaughtered workers at Carletonville last month when they were protesting against unjust employment conditions in South African mines. This demonstrates that the bloodthirsty minority regimes of southern Africa have an insatiable appetite for death and destruction of the Africans.120.	South Africa has created certain ""Bantustans"" as homelands for the black people of South Africa. This is an entirely erroneous description because all the land in South Africa belongs to the Africans. We are told that the ""Bantustans"" are independent entities designed to ensure equal and separate development. But this is deception at its highest and arrant nonsense aimed at hoodwinking the world. In actual fact  the ""Bantustans"" are reservoirs of black majority population strategically located in arid regions on which the whites can swoop down at will and forcibly take away African labour to mines  factories  homes of the whites and other such places. They are festering sores of unemployment  discontent and squalor where no development in any form or shape has taken place. They are like cattle-pens from which the desired number of animals are taken for slaughter to make vast profits for sustaining the apparatus of apartheid.121.	Vorster hopes to control the ""Bantustans"" by creating divisions amongst them and the liberation movements. His designs are to play one against the other and to see blacks fight against black brethren while the whites prosper and look at black men killing black men.122.	The concept of ""Bantustans"" is the most pernicious evil conceived by the human mind. The world body must reject it outright.123.	With regard to Rhodesia  the Kenya Government recommends the convening of a round-table conference of all the interested parties to work out a constitutional arrangement for the granting of independence to the African majority under an equitable electoral system. The Africans  whose political destiny is at stake  must participate fully and freely in such negotiations. Those incarcerated in Smith's prisons ought to be released. Restrictions on African political movement and organization must be lifted. All discriminatory laws should be repealed in recognition of the right of the Africans to freedom and independence. South African military and police contingents have no business in Rhodesia. Those are fundamental conditions for an equitable and a lasting settlement to the Rhodesian problem.124.	On Namibia  we shall support fully all the efforts of the United Nations to maintain a physical foot-hold for the purpose of promoting African majority rule and independence. Eviction of illegal South African presence from that Territory is imperative. It is our feeling that direct negotiations with South Africa as to the future of Namibia have proved fruitless. They should therefore be discontinued and other concrete alternatives tried.125.	I may be asked  quite legitimately  why the African countries have now seen fit to maintain a militant stance towards the colonial and minority racist regimes in Africa. Our answer is that all peaceful methods have been tried without success  and the patience of the oppressed peoples is mounting to a breaking-point. 126.	Free Africa's call  in the Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa   was rejected by Vorster. This was an appeal for a peaceful solution on the basis of freedom  equality and democratization of the rigid apartheid system within South Africa. The United Nations  the non-aligned world and OAU made several appeals for peaceful accommodation which were rejected outright by South Africa. Free Africa was ready to discuss ways and means of democratizing the internal situation in South Africa in a peaceful manner for the amelioration of the conditions of the black people.127.	This meant discussions on the system of apartheid and its eventual abolition. It  too  was of no avail. Vorster's reaction was to rain insults and aggression on free African countries to the north. The territorial integrity of Zambia  the United Republic of Tanzania and Zaire was violated by joint action of the South African  Rhodesian and Portuguese militarists. In the face of this intransigence  does Africa really have a choice other than that of an armed struggle?128.	Permit me now to say a few words about our steadfast commitment to the non-aligned movement. We are convinced that this movement has been a dynamic force for promoting peace  justice and understanding in contemporary international affairs. It is a solid front against colonialism  racism  exploitation and inequality. It has a definite role to play for the economic and social welfare of the non-aligned States.129.	I should also reiterate Kenya's unswerving support for OAU. It is our ultimate hope for the liberation and economic advancement of our continent of Africa. It is our instrument for forging continental African unity in every field. Under its banner  we shall continue to fight for intensification of inter-African trade  investments and cooperation at all levels  and for a united front in international organizations to achieve equality  justice and development in the whole continent in general.130.	In the larger sphere  Africa is determined unitedly to press for its relationship with the European Economic Community in accordance with the political and economic interests of our peoples. We shall not allow ourselves to be dictated to by the rich and powerful nations to suit their policies and objectives at our expense. Our resources and potentialities are plentiful and our scope for economic cooperation unlimited. Therefore  we need not entertain any feelings of despondency or helplessness in this regard.131.	That was our stand at the recent historic joint annual meeting of the World Bank-International Monetary Fund and its affiliates in Nairobi from 24 to 28 September this year. I call that conference historic because a meeting of this magnitude and size was held for the first time on African soil. The official opinion was that this huge conference was successfully organized. We are naturally gratified by this impartial evaluation. We can assure the international community that we shall do everything in our power to ensure the success of future meetings in Nairobi. It is indicative of our belief that major conferences need not be confined toestablished centres  like New York  Geneva and Vienna and others in the Western world. Other capitals which can offer the necessary facilities should also be given the chance to play host to important meetings. This is a reflection of the universal nature of our Organization.132.	In that spirit Kenya is privileged to play host to the United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] in Nairobi. The Kenya Government has made available ample facilities for accommodation  communications and services for the successful establishment of UNEP  which was formally opened last week in Nairobi by His Excellency Mzee Jomo Kenyatta  President of the Republic of Kenya.133.	May I take this opportunity to express the gratitude of the Kenya Government and people to all the countries that supported our offer of Nairobi  Kenya  as the site for UNEP.134. I wish to express our deepest sympathy to the victims of the Sudano-Sahelian famine which has now assumed catastrophic proportions in Chad  Mali  Mauritania  Niger  Senegal and Upper Volta. The Kenya Government is currently considering on a basis of urgency what aid it can give to the victims of this unprecedented drought. They can rest assured of our support to the best of our capability. We urge the United Nations  OAU  and all other interested organizations to join hands in combating the consequences of this natural disaster. It is a grim reminder that the international community should set up a long-range  permanent arrangement to meet such catastrophes in the future in any region of the world.135.	Before I conclude  I deem it important to appeal to all countries to respect human rights without any reservations. Any change of government  or accession to power by any political party in any State should not be used as a licence to wipe out opponents or to unleash terror and bloodshed. Each national of every State  irrespective of colour  religion  sex or political persuasion  has a God- given right to life and protection under the due process of law. We cannot acquiesce in any political murder  massacre or repression in any part of the world. After all  shorn of all the technicalities and diplomatic jargon  this is the central message of our Charter and of the many conventions that have been adopted by the General Assembly.136.	Finally  Kenya would like to see the United Nations remain in outlook and action a positive  active and dynamic force for justice  fair play and humanity. That must remain our guiding philosophy as the United Nations triumphantly marches from strength to strength in the face of many odds ahead."
"62",3745,"KHM",28,1973,"﻿183.	 Mr. President  the delegation of the Khmer Republic is doubly gratified by your election to the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly of our Organization. Firstly  you are the representative of a friendly nation with which my country enjoys the most cordial diplomatic relations. Also  you combine in your person the distinguished qualities of a diplomat and valuable experience in United Nations affairs  experience acquired over the many years during which you have brilliantly represented your beautiful country. We have no doubt that under your leadership the discussions at this session will be conducted with the tranquillity and success which we all expect.184.	My delegation associates itself with previous speakers in conveying to you  Mr. President  our warmest congratulations.185.	It is also an agreeable duty for me to pay a tribute to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  President of the twenty-seventh session  who directed the proceedings last year with remarkable mastery.186.	I cannot let this occasion pass without repeating once again to Mr. Kurt Waldheim our warm admiration for his tireless efforts to see to it that justice and peace reign in this world  which unfortunately  is still troubled in spite of a clear-cut trend towards detente.187.	Subscribing unreservedly as we do to the principles of the universality of the United Nations  we should like to extend our sincere congratulations  best wishes and welcome to the representatives of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany  with which the Khmer Republic enjoys the best relations.188.	For three years representatives of the Khmer Republic have had occasion to draw the attention of this Assembly from this rostrum to the crimes and the destruction being committed by foreign aggression. In their passion to destroy everything that is specifically Khmer  the North Viet-Namese and the Viet-Cong are victimizing our civilian population and everything which may be regarded as a resource of our country  whether it be humanitarian  cultural or economic.189.	The temples of Angkor  which are one of the most important heritages of the civilization of the world  have been militarily occupied since June 1970  in spite of the efforts of our Government  with the support of ourSecretary-General and that of almost all the members of UNESCO  to place them under the special protection provided for by The Hague Convention of 1954.  It is very sad to note that these monuments of inestimable artistic and cultural value have  in this way  become the objects of vandalism and have been exposed to the elements because of a lack of proper maintenance.190.	Indeed  since January 1972 these occupiers have prohibited access by the curators of Angkor  who work under the aegis of the French School of the Far East  an apolitical organization well known in the archaeological world.191.	For our part we are refraining from recovering these temples by force for fear of damaging them irremediably  even though the enemy might use them for military purposes.192.	Furthermore  our concern is the greater because art treasures which were stolen from Angkor have been placed on sale  according to press reports  in certain world tourist centres.193.	Elementary school  high school and university buildings of the Khmer Republic are also subject to the destructive fury of the aggressors. It is the secondary schools particularly which are the most affected because they are scattered throughout the countryside  in large measure in the actual battlefields. Just to mention the primary school buildings: 3 154 of them have been destroyed. Hence  of a student body numbering 1.1 million in 1969-1970  only 720 000 of our school children were able to go to school this year.194.	In the realm of the health infrastructure 12 hospitals  24 health centres and 160 infirmaries have been either demolished or damaged. What is more  our doctors and nurses have been massacred  in defiance of all humanitarian rules.195.	Many religious buildings have had the same fate meted out to them  while several hundred Buddhist monks have been murdered or captured. Many of them have been forcibly defrocked and enrolled in the ranks of the aggressors  something which the Khmer people  who are more than 90 per cent Buddhist  consider as the worst kind of sacrilege.196.	The damage done to our roads  railways  dams * factories  airports  and so on  amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars. Unable to win a military victory  the  enemy devotes himself to the destruction of our economic infrastructure and does not even respect the work sponsored by the United Nations. The Prek Thnot dam  under construction  was twice attacked — in September 1971 and August 1973-and yet this international project  which  according to the very words of the Resident Representative of the United Nations in Phnom Penh  ""has really peaceful and humanitarian objectives""  is financed by the following countries: the Federal Republic of Germany  Australia Canada  Denmark  France  the Netherlands  India  Italy  Japan  Pakistan  the Philippines and the United Kingdom.197.	But the saddest spectacle of all in this aggression is the sight of people fleeing their villages or fields to take refuge in security zones. They have lost everything: their families  their houses  their harvests and their cattle. To date there are more than 2 million refugees in the capital and in the provinces-2 million human beings to feed and shelter for a country having a population of only 7 million. That tells you something of the tragedy of my country.198.	Instead of giving way to despair  our Government  with the scanty resources available to it  has taken measures to deal with the highest priorities. However  in spite of the humanitarian assistance of friendly countries and international charitable institutions  the problem is far from solved.199.	Parallel to our national resistance efforts  and in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the Khmer people  a new Constitution was prepared and submitted to a national referendum. The First President of the Republic was elected by universal and direct suffrage on 4 June 1972. The legislative elections gave the country a Parliament  and this was followed by the establishment of other democratic institutions.200.	We should particularly like to stress here the social achievements of the Khmer people since the founding of the Republic. For the first time  a labour code has been promulgated.201.	As far as our outside obligations are concerned  we have not been neglecting the obligations incumbent upon us as a Member of the United Nations and other international organizations. Within the framework of our modest resources  we shall continue to take an active part in international co-operation.202.	Steeped as they are in Buddhist teachings  the Khmer people reject all forms of racial discrimination between human beings  whatever the colour of their skin  their ethnic group or their religion.203.	Since we  the Khmers  have known similar experiences in the past  we firmly support the authentic movements of fraternal peoples still under foreign domination. But with the same determination we resist expansionist aggression and intolerable interference in the internal affairs of other countries.204.	In this connexion we should like to pay a tribute to distinguished previous speakers for having recognized the right of the Khmer people to settle as it wishes its own internal affairs without interference from outside.205.	Since some representatives have been cynical enough to cast doubt on the legality of our Government from this very rostrum  I feel constrained to draw their attention to certain historical truths which may perhaps have escaped their notice.206.	We are well aware that every State is free to recognize any given Government  including a government in exile as is the case with the so-called Government of Norodom Sihanouk  who has chosen to reside in Peking. But to manoeuvre to impose such a government on the Khmer people constitutes inadmissible intervention in the internal affairs of that people  and we vigorously protest against such an act. As I asked here last year ""In what treatise or manual of international law ... canone find such criteria whereby a government-in-exile canbe considered the legal government of a land? "" 207.	Cambodia was a monarchy until 9 October 1970  the date on which the Republic was proclaimed. Prince Norodom Sihanouk was in power for 30 years — from 1941 to 1955 as King  from 1955 to 1960 as Prime Minister or head of the party and from 1960 to 1970 as constitutional Head of State. In 1955 he abdicated in favour of his father. In 1960  on the death of his father  he had the Constitution amended to enable him to become Head of State once again without being King. In 1960 then  the two Houses of Parliament met and appointed him Head of State pending the appointment of a King. But that temporary situation lasted 10 years.208.	On 18 March 1970-that is  10 years later-the same two Houses of die Khmer Parliament met and  after a long historic debate  withdrew from him their confidence and by a unanimous vote divested him of his functions as Head of State. Our Members of Parliament unanimously accused Prince Sihanouk of having authorized North Viet-Namese and Viet-Cong troops to occupy Khmer territory illegally during the second half of the 1960s and to install there veritable military bases in flagrant violation of Khmer neutrality enshrined in the Geneva Agreements of 1954. That was also a blow against our independence  our sovereignty and our territorial integrity.209.	The vote in the Khmer Parliament was preceded by many popular demonstrations in the provinces and then in the capital against this foreign invasion.210.	Dissatisfied with this unanimous decision of the representatives of the Khmer people  Sihanouk asked for the aid of the North Viet-Namese and the Viet-Cong so that he could be restored to power by force.211.	On 29 May 1970  the date on which these foreign troops began their first open and deliberate attacks against our defence forces and our civilian population  we identified the following North Viet-Namese and Viet-Cong units  which were spread out here and there throughout our territory:(a)	First North Viet-Namese Division  101-D Regiment: 2 000 men stationed at Angkor Borey in Takeo;(b)	Fifth North Viet-Namese Division  174-05 and 275 Regiments: 5 000 men stationed at Snuol in Kratie;(c)	Seventh North Viet-Namese Division  141-165 and 209 Regiments: 6 200 men stationed at Memot in Kompong Cham;(d)	Ninth North Viet-Namese Division  95-C  271 and 272 Regiments: 6 000 men stationed at Chup in Kompong Cham;(e)	the B-3 Front  Regiments 24-28-66-95-0: 10 800 men stationed at Ratanakiri in Bokeo;(f)	moreover  there were the command posts and the headquarters: 12 000 men;(g)	and logistical services: 23 000 men. That makes a total of more than 65 000 men.212.	Many North Viet-Namese and Viet-Cong prisoners whom we hold at present in Phnom Penh  and the many documents that we seized in those attacks  constitute proof which no one here or anywhere else can refute.213.	It was in these circumstances that Sihanouk founded his Government in exile in Peking  as he put it  ""to liberate"" the country. But do we really need to stress that at that time  and even now  there were no American troops or military bases on Khmer territory? The only foreign troops that were to be found and that are to be found today in my country are exclusively those of North Viet-Nam and the Viet-Cong.214.	At the time when Sihanouk was stripped of his powers Marshal Lon Nol was already Prime Minister and he continued to direct the same Government until 1972  before being elected President of the Republic. It is quite clear that our Republican regime and its institutions  founded upon democratic and popular bases  were legally established.215.	On 30 April 1972 the Khmer people by means of a referendum organized throughout the country  in which more than 80 per cent of the electors participated  voted overwhelmingly for the Republican Constitution.216.	On 4 June 1972  under the new Constitution  Marshal Lon Nol was elected by universal and direct suffrage the first President of the Khmer Republic for a term of five years.217.	On 3 and 17 September 1972  the first National Assembly and the first Senate of the Khmer Republic were also elected by universal suffrage. The other institutions of the Republic — the Constitutional Court  the Supreme Court  the High Court of Justice  and so forth — were successively and subsequently established.218.	It is infinitely regrettable that by means of flagrant lies our adversaries have succeeded in misleading part of public opinion with regard to the territory and population controlled by them.219.	Indeed  to be honest we must make the following distinction: territory administered by us  about 20 provinces; the zones temporarily occupied by our adversaries  that is to say  the four Eastern provinces  whose density of population varies from three to five inhabitants per square kilometre  and the rest of the territory which constitutes combat zones.220.	In the circumstances  it is less than honest of them to claim to control 90 per cent of the territory.221.	With regard to the population  the lie is even more flagrant  because in Phnom Penh alone the population is already more than 2 million  and to this figure should be added the 4 million inhabitants residing in the provinces of Kandal  Battambang  Kompong Cham  Kampot  Kirirom  Kompong Chhnang  Kompong Som  Kompong Speu  Kompong Thom  Oudong Meanchey  Oudor Meanchey  Pailin Phnom Del  Prey Veng  Pursat  Siem Reap  Svay Rieng  Takeo and Vihear Suor.222.	Members can see that in confirming that we control more than 6 million inhabitants of a population of 7 million we are not at all exaggerating.223.	We are not seeking to discomfit our adversaries  but it is our duty to provide the necessary clarification so that international public opinion is not misled  and particularly so that the judgement of the representatives present here can be based not upon falsehood but upon realities which are  incidentally  easily verifiable.224.	During his years of power Sihanouk made himself into the all-powerful master of the country and its inhabitants. From 1967 to 1968  in particular  he began his witch hunt  which took the lives of 1 500 Red Khmers  as he himself confessed at Kompong Thom on 19 August 1968 over the national broadcasting network. Is there any need to recall the few democratic principles so often affirmed and so often forgotten  namely  that in Cambodia  as in other countries  sovereign power belongs to the people and no foreign State can claim the right to usurp that sovereignty for the benefit of anyone else  still less when that beneficiary is outside national territory. The Khmer political solution can only be found within the Khmer community resident on Khmer territory.225.	The Khmer Republic last year held its first presidential and legislative elections. However  my Government does not exclude the possibility of new elections once peace is restored and foreign troops have been withdrawn entirely from our territory.226.	The so-called neutrality of Norodom Sihanouk was in fact nothing but acquiescence in the use of Khmer territory for the benefit of aggressors from a neighbouring country.227.	As members are all aware  when foreign armed forces occupy and use a country to attack another country  the population inevitably suffers and the territory of the accomplice State inevitably becomes the scene of warfare.228.	The Khmer Republic  whose third anniversary we shall soon be celebrating  ostracizes no one. All Khmer citizens  whoever they are  may participate in public affairs without any consideration other than that of their talents. The last presidential elections demonstrated this fact. Indeed  my country is perhaps the only one in the world where two candidates for the presidency of the Republic who campaigned against each other during the electoral campaign joined forces after the elections to set up a common executive. Furthermore  political detainees and even the supporters and relatives of the former Chief of State  Norodom Sihanouk  were all freed and if they wish  they may even leave Cambodia. It is rare for a country which has known a change of regime to adopt such a liberal attitude. Countries which have undergone revolutions normally deny political rights to the members of the ruling family for a period which may last several decades or even longer. The Khmer Republic  which is only three years old  did not think that it needed to engage in such discrimination. All its citizens  without any distinction  have the same rights and duties with respect to the Republic.229.	If since 15 August-the date of the end of American air support — the Khmer Republic has remained on its feet  it is indeed because all Khmers preserve faith in the Republic. East is convinced that  whatever his origins and political allegiances  he will find in the Republic a social and political framework enabling him to realize his aspirations.230.	I have no doubt that outside the Khmer Republic some people are attempting to destroy the structure born of an effort at national reconciliation  to replace it by a regime based upon the will of a single man  a regime with which we Khmers were only too familiar up to 18 March 1970. There have been efforts to refuse the Khmer Republic any possibility of existence in international life. Governments which do not have deep knowledge of the realities of Cambodia have been misled and have directed overt hostility towards the Khmer Republic. In some cases these efforts have been successful  but in most cases they have failed. If genuinely socialist States continue to maintain normal relations with the Khmer Republic  it is certainly because they consider that the republican regime is the only one open to all and likely to bring about reconciliation. On the other hand  the former regime  which was based upon the will of a single man  cannot serve as a basis for national reconciliation. The strength of the Khmer Republic  even when it can rely only on itself  lies precisely in its capacity to rally the people around its flag and not around a single man  a prey to all kinds of excess and to all moods. Union based on law and freedom of the people cannot give way to the will of a single man.231.	Despite all their denials  the foreign forces of aggression continue to be stationed and to operate in our territory. In the 60 days which followed the signing of the Paris Agreement on Viet-Nam they introduced into our country fresh troops estimated at more than 10 000 fighting men  thus bringing their strength up to about 45 000. We have identified  among others  the First North Viet-Namese Division  the Viet Cong C-40 Division  the frontline B-3 Division  the 207th Regiment of the Fifth North Viet-Namese Division  the 277th Regiment of the Ninth North Viet-Namese Division  the Engineer Regiment No. 377 and the North Viet-Namese Heavy Division No. 69.232.	In order to mislead international public opinion our aggressors are attempting in the present phase of the war to camouflage their presence behind the formations of Red Khmers christened ""liberation forces"" for the occasion. However  with the conclusion of the Paris Agreement on Viet-Nam  our profound desire to live in peace and understanding with all countries  in particular with our neighbours  whatever their political or ideological allegiance  is stronger than ever today.233.	Indeed article 20 of that Agreement provides that all foreign troops operating in our territory should leave our country without delay: To demonstrate our goodwill  the President of the Khmer Republic has ordered the unilateral suspension of all offensive operations so as to facilitate the withdrawal of foreign troops. We were even ready to begin negotiations with the North Viet-Namese Government.234.	In spite of the absence of a positive response from our opposite numbers  my Government  on 6 July 1973  made another concrete peace proposal containing the following points: first  strict and immediate application  by all parties  of article 20 of the Paris Agreement of 27 January 1973; second  immediate withdrawal from Khmer territory of all foreign troops  their arms and munitions  to enable the Khmer people to settle its own problems without foreign interference and free from any outside pressure; third  reactivation of the International Commission for Supervision and Control set up under the Geneva agreements of 1954 to supervise the strict application of article 20 of the Paris Agreement; fourth  an immediate cease-fire between the troops of all parties; fifth  talks among Khmers with a view to bringing about a cessation of hostilities and national reconciliation.235.	We have notified the signatories of the Final Act of Paris12 of this proposal and have appealed to all countries which love peace and justice and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations to help make this proposal a reality and to obtain from all parties concerned the strict application of article 20 of the Paris Agreement of 27 January 1973.236.	We are encouraged to see that this proposal has met with a favourable response from all countries which have a real knowledge of the actual situation in the Khmer Republic.237.	It has  however  not been understood by those who hope to put an end to the war by a military solution and annexation.238.	Recent developments in military operations show that peace in Cambodia can be brought about only under circumstances of national reconciliation  which  in turn  cannot be achieved without the total withdrawal of foreign troops.239.	It is in order to spare our people further suffering and misery that my Government  four days ago  repeated its peace offer which it made on 6 July last240.	Peace is something to which we aspire with all our hearts and we have done everything within our power to obtain it. We are very much encouraged by having heard speakers here support us in this aim by calling for detente and international co-operation.241.	The world has welcomed with relief the conclusion of the cease-fire agreements in Viet-Nam and Laos. As an immediate neighbour  the Khmer Republic can only be gratified at such a development. However  we are firmly convinced that no true peace can be brought about in the region as a whole until a similar peace is established also in our country.242.	In conclusion  I should like on behalf of the Khmer people to make an appeal to all Members of the international community to help us  in keeping with the spirit and the letter of the United Nations Charter  to restore peace  the peace which we have lost because of foreign aggression to satisfy the megalomania of one man."
"63",3859,"KWT",28,1973,"﻿211.	Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to express to you  on behalf of the State of Kuwait  heartfelt congratulations on your election to your high office. I should like to commend the high status you enjoy in international circles as a statesman with wide experience and outstanding reputation. I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  for the manner in which he presided over the past session of the General Assembly.212.	Kuwait welcomes the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany  the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to the United Nations. This constitutes a major step towards achieving universality which will enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations as an instrument of peace and security. I should like also to take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to Guinea-Bissau on the proclamation of its independence  which constitutes a victory for the principles in which we believe.213.	In view of the grave events of recent days I shall confine my remarks to the situation in the Middle East. Clearly  those events are the inevitable result of the developments of the past six years.214.	Israel's occupation of territories of three Arab States through a war of aggression violated not only the natural right of those States to territorial integrity but also the principles of the United Nations Charter. And the continued occupation of those territories is tantamount to a continuation of the original aggression through which that occupation was accomplished.215.	The Arab States whose territories fell under Israeli military occupation in 1967 have patiently spent six long years waiting for the international Organization to adopt effective measures for putting into effect the principles of the Charter  the rules of the law of nations  and the provisions of successive international decisions. In the meantime  they have responded positively to every international attempt to ensure Israel's withdrawal within the framework of a peaceful and just settlement of the whole problem.216.	But those international attempts have been aborted  one by one  by Israel — which has shown nothing but disdain for international principles and the will of the international community. Israel has  in fact  formally proclaimed that its permanent retention of some of the occupied Arab territories is a natural right which it will under no circumstances give up  and that its withdrawal from the remaining Arab territories is subject — in its scope  circumstances and timing — to its own assessment of its-national interest.217.	Moreover  Israel has proceeded relentlessly from proclamation to action. Inspired by its expansionist policies  Israel's practices in the occupied territories have sought to transform them demographically  economically  and politically into Israeli territories.218.	The international community  which has reviewed Israel's practices year after year  has condemned them and declared them null and void. I shall not burden this Assembly with a citation of the dozens of resolutions expressing this solemn international verdict. I shall merely refer to the most significant of recent decisions.219.	On 8 December 1972  this Assembly  by a vote of 86 in favour and 7 against [2105th meeting]  declared once more that the acquisition of territories thus occupied must be restored; invited Israel to declare publicly its adherence to the principle of non-annexation of territories through the use of force; declared that changes carried out by Israel in the occupied Arab territories in contravention of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 were null and void; called upon Israel to rescind forthwith all such measures and to desist from all policies and practices affecting the physical character or demographic composition of the occupied Arab territories; called upon all States not to recognize any such changes and measures; and invited them to avoid actions — including actions in the field of aid — that could constitute recognition of that occupation [resolution 2949 (XXVII)].220.	On 26 July 1973 13 members of the Security Council voted in favour of the eight-Power draft resolution which  inter alia  strongly deplored Israel's continuing occupation of the Arab territories and declared that no changes that might adversely affect the political and other fundamental rights of the inhabitants of the occupied territories should be introduced or recognized.7 The fact that one permanent member of the Security Council chose to cast the lone vote against that draft resolution has served not to diminish the moral force of that expression of the Council's will  but to emphasize the extent of Israel's isolation in the international community.221.	Similarly  outside the framework of the United Nations  the international community has given unambiguous expression to its verdict.222.	Thus  the Assembly of Heads of State and Governments of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  at its tenth ordinary session held in May 1973  stronglycondemned the negative attitude of Israel  and its obstruction of all efforts aimed at a just and equitable solution; called for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied African and Arab territories; declared that all changes effected by Israel in the occupied territories were null and void; and pledged not to recognize any changes leading to a fait accompli or likely to jeopardize the territorial integrity of the countries concerned.223.	Similar pronouncements were made  a month ago today  by the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries.224.	Israel's intransigence in clinging to the occupied Arab territories and refusing to withdraw has been inspired or fostered by three factors: first  by a greed for territorial expansion  which is an inherent and inseparable part of the objectives of zionism and which is accompanied by an arrogant belief in Israel's superiority in ail fields  including the military field  and by the further belief that such superiority absolves Israel from any obligation to submit to the supremacy of the law or to respect the rights of other peoples and States; second  by the continuous and virtually limitless aid which Israel has been receiving  and which it believes it will continue under all circumstances to receive  from the United States  in economic  military  political and other fields; and third  by the failure of the United Nations to take any effective action towards the application of its principles or the implementation of its resolutions.225.	The right of a State to self-defence is absolute and sacred. The Charter of the United Nations has recognized it as a natural and inalienable right of every State. It is incontestable that the right to liberate its national territory from military occupation is a facet of the exercise by a State of its right to self-defence.226.	Only last month  the Fourth Conference of Non-Aligned Countries solemnly declared its support for the legitimate struggle  by various means  of the Arab States concerned for regaining their occupied territories in their entirety.227.	The Arab States that are now fighting to liberate their usurped lands are engaged in exercising  on the battlefield  their absolute right to self-defence. They do so after having endured occupation patiently for six long years — during which they have seen Israel refuse to' acknowledge its duty to withdraw but endeavour instead to transform military occupation into permanent annexation  and they have seen the United Nations nevertheless refrain from taking any action aimed at restoring their rights without bloodshed.228.	Kuwait supports without reservation the right of Egypt and Syria to liberate their occupied lands.229.	And — prompted by its faith in the principles of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force as well as by the bonds of brotherhood and common destiny which bind it to other Arab countries — Kuwait now renews its declaration that it places its capabilities and resources at the service of international rights and Arab brotherhood."
"64",3904,"LAO",28,1973,"﻿166.	Mr. President  our Prime Minister  His Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma  is retained in Vientiane by his many obligations and has done me the honour of asking me to be the leader of the delegation of Laos to this twenty- eighth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Thus it is my pleasant duty to express to you  on behalf of my country  Laos  our feelings of great esteem and confidence as well as our warmest congratulations on your brilliant election to the presidency of the Assembly.167.	I could not at this time fail to pay a just tribute to your predecessor  the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland  who last year guided the twenty-seventh session with equal diligence and talent.168.	I should also like to refer with admiration to the dedication and unflagging activities of the Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim. We hail with respect his praiseworthy initiatives and his frequent pilgrimages in the quest for peace to serve the principles of the United Nations Charter so as to adapt them to the new realities.169.	Because we ourselves have suffered from the Indochina tragedy  we can fully appreciate the initiatives for peace and goodwill which are presented to circumscribe an incipient conflict and to restore order and calm wherever they are threatened.170.	It is a fact that mankind does not know and has practically never known universal peace. But our common duty is patiently to seek it by uniting all our efforts so as to banish war and to promote the coming into being of a rational order. What might appear to be Utopian today may become a reality tomorrow. Perhaps we shall thus be able to limit conflicts and end terrorism  which all too freely springs up in many different places in a way which ensures impunity for itself while making innocent victims run grave risks. We understand the deep reasons for certain struggles and we respect the ideals and the aspirations which prompt them. But it is difficult for us as Buddhists to recognize that a systematic recourse to force is the right way to promote an ideal or a just cause. Furthermore  if the means used are cruel and repugnant  they may do a disservice to the cause which they are supposed to defend. In this sense and contrary to the well-known adage  ""the end does not justify the means""  it should be possible to settle the most legitimate claims by peaceful means through national and international legal institutions.171.	This concept of non-violence obviously leads us to regret the bloody events which have overcome our neighbour the Khmer Republic  a country friendly to us. It came into the conflagration late and it deserves to have the hostilities on its soil come to an end soon and to have a peaceful life more in accord with its Buddhist traditions.172.	Further removed from us  three new States have been admitted to the Organization: the Federal Republic of Germany  the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. We congratulate them and welcome them.173.	Until they become reunited  the simultaneous admission of the two German States is a source of satisfaction to the international community at the level of political realities. This new event is the result of a long evolution and we see in it also a healthy result of detente. These are two States having different systems of government which recent events have brought much closer together and which are now on a footing of equality within the same Assembly. Because of this doctrine  other divided States may expect sooner or later to be admitted in similar manner to the United Nations. However  one must be forewarned against an improper application of that concept. It is not conceivable  on the pretext of universality  to take into consideration a mere dissident movement in rebellion against the central power of a State. To do so would create a dangerous precedent and introduce in international relations a centrifugal and pernicious force which would encourage new divisions or the erosion of sovereign States. We have recently observed the de jure recognition by certain States of political parties or movements which are far from having the attributes of a sovereign and organized State. An extensive interpretation of the legitimacy or representative character of these movements would lead us — and this would be mistaken — to multiply admissions to the United Nations at the whim of revolutions and alliances.174.	The Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  recently held in Algiers  rightly pointed out  among other considerations  this delicate problem of legitimacy among the non-aligned. It further drew attention to the polarization on a world scale of wealth and poverty. It is to be hoped that the views expressed and the settlements proposed on that occasion will prompt the rich countries to think these things over and lead them to consider or reconsider the problems of underdevelopment with more sympathy and understanding.175.	Allow me now to speak on the problem of Laos in the light of the most recent events.176.	Emerging weakened after a lengthy struggle  my country is now reborn to hope  to a dawn of a new era of peace and national harmony. Whereas internationally there is detente and co-operation  internally we must liquidate the consequences of war and organize peace. Our efforts in this direction have not been in vain. To our great relief  the useless fratricidal struggles have stopped and there is on both sides  in a spirit of agreement and mutual understanding  a firm will to promote a mutually satisfactory negotiated settlement of the problem of Laos. A reassuring event has already taken place  which deserves our attention. On 21 February 1973  to the general satisfaction of all  the Agreement on Restoring Peace and Achieving National Concord in Laos was signed in Vientiane in order to seal the reconciliation of all the people of Laos and decree the immediate cessation of fighting.177.	After lengthy and laborious negotiations on the thorny problems which remained in abeyance  this agreement was defined and completed by the Protocols of 14 September last. These new arrangements set forth in detail the conditions for the implementation of a vast programme of reconciliation of the people of Laos without foreign interference.178.	On the basis of the agreements concluded and under the decisive impetus of His Highness Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma  who achieved this  a new Government of national union will shortly be formed.179.	The problems we had to face throughout the negotiations were many and arduous. The patient and determined quest for peace made possible the most difficult compromises and made the most delicate points easier to handle. It was not a question of sterile quarrels  of rhetorical jousts  of vain propaganda. It was rather a matter for the two opposing parties to undertake constructive talks and to clear the way for a broad consensus on the points which could bring us together and unite us. These sustained efforts have borne fruit. Moderation  common sense and  above all  the spirit of conciliation have prevailed. It is the victory of reason over division and misunderstanding. Whatever the results of the fights  the country does not wish to recognize either victors or vanquished. Everyone is an equal citizen  with the same rights and duties  and all are equally determined to work for the common good. A chapter of sorrow in our history has been closed.180.	Perhaps the situation has never been more favourable  nor the opportunities greater for our country to become again an oasis of peace.181.	If it so happens — and this is always regrettable — that some promises are not kept  or there are violations of the cease-fire  these may be isolated events caused by irresponsible agents  or ephemeral and localized acts of minor importance that cannot be allowed to jeopardize the policy of reconciliation which was won in noble battle.182.	We also know that the atmosphere of detente has had a decisive and beneficial influence on our own political situation and has greatly eased the problem of Laps.183.	It would bean illusion  nevertheless  and indeed even dangerous in some respects  to seek peace at any price. Need I remind you that Laos is a small country which has paid a heavy toll for the war imposed on it from abroad  a war which is not ours. My country must no longer  directly or indirectly  pay the price for detente. That is why we are striving to find a political balance in the best way possible which  while respecting treaties  will effectively guarantee our independence and neutrality. We no longer wish to be a battlefield for any nation  whether it is a matter of an ideological war or of territorial conquest. We reject any domination and oppose all the most insidious forms of a certain ""mini-imperialism"" which  under fallacious pretexts  would seek to expropriate a part of our national territory  carrying out what you yourself  Mr. President  have described as ""partition by despotism"".184.	We also wish the international community to be witnesses  to recall solemnly to those who will bear the responsibility for it  that there is an imperative need for the total withdrawal of all foreign troops  in particular those which two decades ago brought war to our country. Under the terms of the Paris agreements and of the Vientiane Agreement  this withdrawal must be complete 60 days after the formation of a Government of national unity.185.	I shall spare you further details. We are at present embarked on our path of national reconciliation and peace  while aware that this will be long  difficult and full of pitfalls  because it is no easy matter to eliminate the seeds of distrust and suspicion which a quarter of a century of foreign interference and subversion have inevitably accumulated.186.	As such  the Laos Agreements nevertheless constitute an interesting experiment and a valuable contribution to world peace. It is indeed in Laos that progress towards a political settlement and the restoration of peace in Indochina have been most marked. In comparison with our neighbours  the Laos solution is unique  because there never has been and there never will be in the new situation  either in law nor in fact  any division of the country. Under the aegis of our august sovereign  a single Government will be formed which will exercise its prerogatives over the entire Kingdom and will follow one policy only.187.	What can that policy be if not one of strict neutrality towards all States without exception  a policy which my Government has voluntarily taken up since 1962  at the time of the signature of the Geneva agreement?  Laos  because of its size  can be a threat to no one and cannot be considered as such. Its people have no hostile intentions towards any country. It has never interfered in  nor will it ever interfere in  the internal affairs of another State. Its congenital pacifism predisposes it to the maintenance of a peaceful system in its own country and to the continuance of good relations with all its neighbours. Naturally it is entitled to expect that other States will show equally strict respect for its sovereignty and frontiers. Neutrality has become our creed and the aim and basis of all our foreign policy.188.	Yet it remains a fact that the Laos solution is only one step towards genuine peace. Without a global settlement  covering all of Indo-China  the peace will be precarious and my country may indeed fall back into the chaos of war. But the first corner-stone has been laid. We wish to strengthen it and place other corner-stones elsewhere among our neighbours.189.	Friendly nations who are interested in world peace and in maintaining a neutral Laos  have not spared their encouragement and support. We note with reassurance that the process of rapprochement and reconciliation has been followed with a great deal of sympathy by the concert of nations  as well as by the great Powers  which are more specially concerned with safeguarding and consolidating peace.190.	It is a good augury that those same Powers  in a spirit of generosity and of international solidarity  which is to their credit  are prepared to grant the countries of Indochina the aid they need for reconstruction within a multilateral and bilateral framework and according to modalities that are to be determined. At present  a large-scale programme is being prepared among the donor countries.191.	Endless conflict has in the past accustomed us  in spite of ourselves  to launch recriminations and hurl invectives  —  to condemn  and to deplore from this lofty rostrum the ill deeds of an implacable battle.192.	The favourable turn of events makes me confident however and enables me to end my statement on a more optimistic note.193.	1973 is a propitious and reassuring year. For my country it is the year of concord and the year in which peace has been restored. By giving us peace  this year has also given us faith in the future and new reasons for hope."
"65",3951,"LBN",28,1973,"﻿140.  It is my pleasant duty to extend to Mr. Benites my warm congratulations upon his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. These congratulations are all the more warm since Lebanon maintains with Ecuador  as indeed it does with all Latin American countries in general  particularly cordial relations.141.	I also take pleasure in paying a tribute to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland  who assumed with competence the presidency of the last session of the General Assembly.142.	It is also my pleasure to express the appreciation of my delegation for the devotion of the Secretary-General of our Organization. Mr. Waldheim's attachment to the purposes of the United Nations and his tireless efforts in the service of peace resulted most recently in his visit to the countries of the Middle East. I should like to state here that his visit to Lebanon was very highly appreciated and very useful. My Government is a convinced supporter of the action of the Secretary-General and would express the wish that his efforts be crowned with success.143.	These wishes are not just a matter of form. Lebanon  a founding Member of the United Nations  has always had great confidence in our Organization and has always shown a sincere and constant attachment to it. It has participated in its activities and supported its actions in so far as it has been able. At a time when the United Nations is preparing to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the promulgation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  permit me to mention as an example the contribution made by Lebanon to that historic event. I should also like to remind you that in the Middle East  of which it is a part  Lebanon has always tried to promote United Nations action and to make available to our Organization and the specialized agencies all of the facilities it has been in a position to offer. Thus 10 organs of the United Nations are today represented in my country. The Lebanese Government has decided to establish  in co-operation with our Organization  a United Nations Centre in Beirut. The Economic Commission for Western Asia  the establishment of which in Lebanon has just been approved by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1818 (LV) and will undoubtedly also be approved by this session of the Assembly  strengthens even further the ties which exist between the United Nations and Lebanon.144.	The United Nations  for its part  has always shown a great deal of understanding towards my country and has lavished upon it all the support it has been in a position to give. During the course of the suffering which has afflicted the Arab countries since 1967  it is worth while reminding you that Lebanon has had frequent recourse to the Security Council to denounce the acts of aggression directed against it by an irascible neighbour. Eight times the Security Council has condemned Israel and supported the Lebanese Government.145.	Lebanon  therefore  a small country devoted to peace and a resolute partisan of international co-operation  would like to express its most fervent hope that the Organization will be strengthened  its prestige enhanced and its means of action increased. Unfortunately  however  when one takes a look at the agenda of this session and compares the results achieved by our Organization with the responsibilities which it would normally be expected to assume  one cannot help feeling some disillusion. How many major problems still remain unsettled. All our debates in the past  the many resolutions we have adopted  and all our efforts have not succeeded in settling them. The Middle East crisis remains in a state of deadlock; the question of Korea has not-yet been settled; colonialism in Africa is not slackening its grip  and racial discrimination continues to exist there. The disarmament discussions are still in their embryonic stage; the difficulties encountered by the developing countries are becoming ever more serious; and the gap between the poor and the rich countries is growing constantly wider.146.	Nevertheless  the agenda does  of course  reflect positive aspects and the progress achieved in certain areas  Although we are far from final solutions  we note with satisfaction that the United Nations is approaching constructively the economic and social problems which arise in the international sphere  particularly those of the environment  population  trade  the sea-bed and so on. Considerable progress has been achieved  too  towards universality. We therefore are gratified at the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany  the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to the great family of the United Nations. May we be permitted to express the hope that in the near future the United Nations will become synonymous with the international community as a whole?147.	We note with equal satisfaction the progress achieved in the past year towards the relaxation of international tension. Although bilateral diplomacy has played a decisive role in achieving this progress  there is no doubt  that the United Nations has contributed  and continues to contribute  to an improvement of the international atmosphere by promoting better understanding and by creating broad possibilities for dialogue. The rapprochement between the great Powers  the agreements on South-East Asia  the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  the talks between the two Koreas  the bilateral negotiations on the limitation of strategic weapons and the agreements on the problems of the Indian subcontinent are all positive results which reflect the new international spirit and encourage optimism.148.	Of all the political questions which will be considered at this session  the one which causes the most concern to us is obviously that of the Middle East. I should like to express here and now the deep conviction of my delegation that this question  and indeed all those which involve the fate of human communities  whatever their size  can be settled satisfactorily and lastingly only if such a settlement is based first and foremost on a spirit of equity and justice. Political manoeuvres  considerations based on the balance of forces and interests should in no way be allowed to stifle the voice of right and justice.149.	Let us take care not to stifle that voice any longer. History teaches us that every time the voice of right and justice has not been heeded  the result has inevitably been an explosion  leading to the collapse of structures which had been established to maintain the peace 150.	The fundamental facts of the Middle East problem are very familiar to this Assembly. They have been so amply set forth  commented upon and debated that I have no intention of repeating what has so often been said in the past  nor do I intend to anticipate what other speakers may say at this session. I shall confine myself simply to recalling here certain basic truths and to setting forth succinctly the views of my Government.151.	The first truth is that Israel  a Member of the United Nations  to which it owes its very existence  continues to occupy by force territories belonging to sovereign States which are also Members of this Organization. That occupation constitutes a flagrant violation of international-law and a defiance of the United Nations  which  by several resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council  has condemned the acquisition of territory by force. Israel no longer troubles to conceal its ambitions with regard to the fate of these territories. Through the words of its most authoritative leaders and by the military  economic and settlement policy which it has been pursuing for six years  it is systematically applying a policy of conquest and annexation. Of course  the Arab countries will do everything in their power to resist that colonial policy  and they will offer that resistance as long as is necessary. But the problem transcends the context of the Arab countries and involves the international community as a whole. The question is whether we live in a policed world or must resign ourselves indefinitely to the law of the jungle. Lebanon has appealed to the United Nations whenever the occasion has arisen and exhorted it to contemplate concrete and effective measures to ensure the rule of law and right. From this rostrum I firmly and solemnly repeat the same exhortation.152.	The second truth is that Israel has driven a whole people from its motherland  gained possession of its property and trampled underfoot its most elementary and sacred rights. Israel has inflicted and continues to inflict upon it and upon all those who have granted it their hospitality most brutal violence: violations of air space  bombardments  abduction of soldiers and civilians  punitive expeditions  occupation of strategic points  hijacking and destruction of civilian aircraft. At the beginning  Israel pointed to the activities of the fedayeen in an attempt to justify its aggression. As we know  those activities were committed sporadically  I would say  by uncontrollable elements. But today Israel no longer takes the trouble to find justifications. It claims the right to take preventive measures against Palestinians whom it has driven from their homes or who have fled the ostracism of the invader.153.	The fate of the Palestinian people constitutes the heart of the problem in the Middle East. Even if other aspects of this problem were settled to the satisfaction of all the States concerned  even if the territories were liberated  the Holy Places restored to their universal function and questions of shipping resolved  as long as the fate of the people of Palestine was not settled in accordance with equity in a way satisfactory to their legitimate aspirations to freedom and human dignity  nothing would really have been solved. That people must be consulted on its future. It is entitled to respect  understanding and consideration.154.	Everyone knows that Lebanon took no part in the military operations of June 1967. It was not  therefore  directly involved in that conflict. But that conflict has had a profound effect upon it  not only because it is a member of the League of Arab States and considers itself bound by ties of solidarity with those States but also because Israel has certain designs on its territory and its waters  and because more than 300 000 Palestinians live on its territory.155.	Lebanon will  in so far as it is able  participate in the search for a just and lasting solution. But Lebanon has no territorial problem to discuss with anyone  either directly or even indirectly. The only international document which defines its position on Israel is the Lebanese-Israel Armistice Agreement of 1949. That Agreement put an end to hostilities and established the supervision and control organs with the co-operation of the United Nations and under its chairmanship. Whatever allegations to the contrary may be put forward by Israel  that document is still in force. The Security Council itself has repeatedly decided so  most recently by its resolution 337 (1973)  adopted unanimously on 15 August 1973.156.	Lebanon considers that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) primarily concerns those countries which took part in the 1967 conflict. It does not  therefore  have either to accept it on its own account or to reject it. But it does support it  because it sees in it a basis upon which the over-all solution should be built. That resolution contains  among others  a provision calling for the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from occupied territories and stating the need to settle the Palestinian problem equitably.157.	It is no longer possible in our day to apply the old adage  ""Politics first"". Economic matters have assumed such an importance that they are now inseparable from politics.158.	For 25 years Lebanon  like other Arab States  has constantly suffered the disastrous economic consequences of an unresolved political conflict. Only the establishment of peace can permit the peoples of the region to devote their resources and energies to constructive purposes  And this peace cannot be beneficial only to the peoples of the region themselves. It will also serve the interests of the human community as a whole and will strengthen international stability and security.159.	The subject of economic and social development  which has been given -prominence for many years now  has unfortunately not yet produced sufficient concrete results. The evaluation of the Second United Nations Development Decade  in the light of the discussions in the Economic and Social Council and the Food and Agriculture Organization particularly  is not very encouraging. The rich countries do not seem sufficiently aware that in the world of today  in which everything is interdependent  it is in their interests to increase substantially the effort asked of them. For their part  the developing countries seem to be confining themselves more and more to a demanding attitude unlikely to facilitate a dialogue.160.	The problem of disarmament is no less distressing than that of poverty. Everything has already been said on this subject. I would simply like to suggest that  if a decision is taken to reduce armaments  the possibility be studied of creating within the framework of the UnitedNations a special fund designed to give rapid assistance to countries afflicted by natural disasters  a fund financed by a portion of the financial resources at present devoted to the production of means of destruction.161.	The United Nations quite rightly is displaying growing interest in the problems of the environment. Man  the marvellous creator  has suddenly discovered that he is also a ruthless destroyer. He knows that nature is threatened by death. That realization has already led to abundant research and study  which has not  however  yet been translated into action by a rescue programme. I should like to mention that my country has made a special effort in the area of the protection of nature. A Mediterranean conference was held in Beirut last May to study ways and means of fighting pollution in the Mediterranean basin. It adopted a programme which it called the Beirut Charter and established a standing conservation committee which will be staffed by the National Council for Scientific Research in Lebanon.162.	Another problem which is worthy of our attention is that of the sea-bed. In its resolution 3029 (XVII)  the Assembly entrusted the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction with the task of preparing a draft convention to be submitted to a plenipotentiary conference in Santiago next April. Unfortunately  the draft convention is not yet ready. In the course of the many meetings which have been held  Member States have not shown a sufficient degree of co-operation. The Assembly proclaimed  amidst general enthusiasm  that the resources of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction constituted the common heritage of mankind as a whole [see resolution 2749 (XXV)]. An international organization was to be set up to exploit these resources for the benefit of all nations. These fine promises seem to have been forgotten very quickly. The conflict of national interests has overshadowed respect for the interests of the international community  and almost diverted the Committee from its initial task  which was to work for the development of international law of the sea and not to try to stifle it.153. The United Nations was created to promote the ideal of peace and justice in the world. In spite of all the setbacks and the difficulties which have been encountered  I should like to proclaim the faith of my country in our Organization and our attachment to it. Of course  as I have already pointed out  its possibilities of action are small compared with the considerable responsibilities it bears. Many of the extremely sc IUS and urgent problems unfortunately are still unresolved principal among which we find the distressing problem of the Middle East. But I am convinced that it is in the spirit of the Charter  and preferably within the framework of the United Nations  without excluding all other possibilities  that these problems should be examined and debated. It is upon the United Nations that all good will should converge in order to strengthen the possibilities of action and to lay down the principles of right and justice on solid foundations. We believe that it is not so much a matter of defining principles  outlining objectives and adopting new resolutions which are indistinguishable from each other  but rather a matter of tackling seriously the question of practical measures which should and must be taken in order to ensure the total and effective application of these resolutions. However that may be  Lebanon  for its part  however humble may be its contribution  will always work in this spirit and towards this objective."
"66",3994,"LBR",28,1973,"﻿85.	 Having already had the privilege of expressing to you  Sir  the profound congratulations of the Government of Liberia on your election to the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations  and our very best wishes and assurances of our co-operation as you assume your grave responsibilities in the interest of securing world peace  you will permit me now to extend our sincere appreciation to your illustrious predecessor  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  the Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland  for the able and astute manner in which he conducted the affairs of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly.86.	My Government also wishes to convey to the Secretary-General its deepest appreciation for the dedicated and wise manner in which he is discharging his arduous and highly important task on behalf of justice  peace and security for all peoples throughout the world.87.	Liberia reasserts its firm belief in the principle of universality  because it is only by the harmonization of action by the peace-loving peoples of the world that mankind can achieve that security and lasting peace to which this Organization is dedicated. I therefore again express  on behalf of my Government  a warm welcome to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic on their admission to this Organization.88.	That the era of cold war and confrontation among the major Powers is being replaced by a new era of negotiation and detente is a heartening development  which my Government unreservedly welcomes and will actively support. We do not  however  believe that the achievement of this long-awaited detente in itself guarantees the establishment of a just and lasting peace. Such a peace can best be assured if all the nations strive to promote an atmosphere of trust and tolerance in international affairs and assiduously grapple with the perennial economic  social and political problems with which we are all still confronted. The seeds of peace and concord have been sown  but they cannot be nurtured into a satisfying harvest so long as situations which constitute threats to international peace and security are not promptly and fairly dealt with.89.	The Government of South Africa  supported by a minority racist clique from within and by its powerful trading partners from without  carries on with impunity what this Organization has rightly called ""crimes against humanity"". Apartheid  the worst form of racism in existence today  continues to plague the African peoples of South Africa. The United Nations has condemned this outrageous policy  which denies to the African majority their fundamental freedoms and constitutes a threat to the maintenance of international peace and security. Our brothers in South Africa have demonstrated extraordinary patience and endurance  but their patience is not unlimited. Unless this Organization can find means effectively and speedily to implement its resolutions on South Africa  I foresee a deterioration of the existing situation and a consequent failure of all efforts aimed at a peaceful solution.90.	Regrettably  the South African police  in a repetition of the Sharpeville tragedy  recently murdered several black workers whose only crime was their boldness in pointing out the inequities of existing employment practices and economic benefits. But were those murderers punished? No-they were rewarded with words of congratulation.91.	These practices  clear manifestations of a bold and unrepentant racism  and the system of government which fosters them  are so deeply wrong  so offensive to morality  so unbearable  so unjust  so clearly at variance with the noble sentiments contained in the Charter of this Organization that it is still astounding and a source of despair that men can support and uphold such practices and such a system  seemingly blind to the terrifying evil and inhumanity of it all.92.	We express the hope that the principal trading partners of South Africa will weigh their desire for profits and immediate financial returns against their responsibility to assist  on moral grounds and in keeping with their obligations as Members of the United Nations  the oppressed peoples of South Africa to obtain their most basic  fundamental and God-given rights as human beings.93.	Willy Brandt  Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany  in his profound statement delivered before this Assembly on 26 September  said unreservedly for his country that "". . . we condemn racism as inhuman and as the cause of the most terrible crimes"" and reaffirmed its support for ""the principle of the universality of human rights."" [2128th meeting  paras. 59 and 60.]94.	The Secretary of State of the United States  Henry Kissinger  in his brilliant address before this twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly on 24 September  said  among other things:""We shall honour our pledge to promote self- determination  economic development and human dignity across the continent of Africa."" [2124th meeting  para. 51. J95.	My Government finds those commitments most encouraging and expresses the hope that all nations will desist from those activities which perpetuate injustice and inhumanity in southern Africa and  rather  render substantial moral and material assistance to the peoples of South Africa and southern Africa as they seek to acquire their fundamental freedoms.96.	In all forums of this Organization  Liberia and other nations have appealed for justice  self-determination and freedom for all the peoples of Zimbabwe; yet the illegal regime of Ian Smith continues its oppressive domination of the majority African population while denying to them the basic rights of political representation and equal economic and social opportunities. Most African political leaders in Zimbabwe are either in prison or have severe restrictions placed on their movements. This increasingly intolerable situation cannot and will not last. A small group of men  solely for racial reasons and because they possess the power to do so  continue to deprive the African majority in Africa of all their political rights  as well as of their equitable share of the wealth of their own land. Such practices must shock the conscience of the world-and if the people and leaders who perpetuate and benefit from them cannot be convinced by measures now being employed  then it is. the responsibility of the entire international community to undertake whatever new measures are required to eliminate those injustices.97.	We reaffirm our commitment to and total solidarity with our oppressed brothers in Mozambique  and Angola. Portugal should now know that there is no price which the people of Africa will not pay to end oppression and colonial domination.98.	The Assembly is aware of the recent reports of massacres in Mozambique. Portugal  in its brutal attempts to intimidate the courageous people of Mozambique  has resorted to mass indiscriminate slaughter of innocent men  women and children.99.	This is not the first time that Portuguese atrocities have attracted world-wide attention. The representative of Liberia on 20 February 1961 sounded an early warning in a letter to the President of the Security Council in which he asked that immediate action be taken by the Council to prevent further deterioration and abuse of human rights in Angola. He then gave the following reasons why it was necessary for the Council to meet:""This is necessary because men are dying in Angola  because men are being cast into prison without trial  because men are living under conditions which are an affront to human dignity and a defiance of human rights. .. . Must the machinery of the United Nations wait until the dead are counted not by the scores  but by the thousands before action is taken? "" 100.	Today  in Mozambique as well as in Angola  Portugal continues its ever more repressive and desperate activities  the last faint flickers of a dying and vicious colonialism. The dead are now indeed counted by thousands  but the will of the people to freedom cannot be denied. How long will we tolerate this?101.	I must make special mention of the gallant people of Guinea-Bissau who  having liberated three fourths of their country  happily proclaimed their independence on 24 September. My Government on 26 September joyously accorded recognition to this new sister State. Moreover  as a mark of its profound solidarity with the new Government and people of Guinea-Bissau and as an expression of its deepest satisfaction and joy at their declaration of independence  my Government will  as soon as a constitution of the new Republic is announced and the new Government is organized  proclaim a national holiday in commemoration of their attainment of independence. We cherish the hope that Guinea-Bissau will soon assume its rightful place among the ranks of nations in our world Organization which are contributing to international peace  security and co-operation.102.	The Government of Liberia continues to view the question of Namibia as a serious special case for the United Nations. The General Assembly  through resolutions 2145 (XXI) and 2248 (S-V)  by which it terminated South Africa's mandate over Namibia and provided for the establishment of a Council to administer the affairs of Namibia  and the Security Council  by agreeing in resolution 301 (1971) with the opinion of the International Court of Justice that South Africa's presence in Namibia is illegal  have together established a firm base upon which the United Nations would be enabled to use the best channels available to it to bring about a peaceful transfer of power from South Africa to the people of Namibia.103.	However  the United Nations Council for Namibia remains totally ineffective because South Africa neither recognizes it nor permits it to exercise its lawful role in ensuring the independence of Namibia. Instead  the Government of South Africa seeks to entrench in Namibia its grim policies of apartheid and exploitation.104.	As the mission of the Secretary-General to Namibia may not continue after this year  the question that confronts us now is  What next? If a tragic and violent confrontation is to be avoided and the rights of the people of Namibia ensured  then the United Nations  and in particular the five permanent members of the Security Council  must urgently undertake new initiatives designed to bring about the speedy implementation of the decisions both of the General Assembly and of the Security Council.105.	The Liberian Government remains convinced that the highly explosive situation existing in the Middle East constitutes a grave threat to world peace. We believe that the territorial integrity and the right to national existence of all the States in that region must be ensured. Therefore we emphatically oppose all forms of aggression and the acquisition of territory by force of arms. For this reason  the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) appeals to us as the most practical measure for ensuring a just and lasting solution to an admittedly difficult situation. The Secretary-General should be complimented for his untiring efforts in seeking ways to bring a speedy and lasting solution to the problems of this troubled region of the world. We note with appreciation his recent visit to the Middle East and look forward to further positive action to this end.106.	Ten years after the whole world sighed with relief when the nuclear test ban treaty of 1963  was signed  promising a lessening of the threat of nuclear war and raising hopes that the danger of radioactive contamination had ended  it is regrettable that some countries continue to conduct nuclear tests in the atmosphere. Such actions threaten the hopes of mankind not only for a safe and clean environment but also for world peace.107.	At this  the focal point of the conscience of mankind  we appeal to all Governments concerned to heed the anguished pleas of a concerned people and to desist from all further nuclear tests in the interest of humanity.108.	We note with deep appreciation the action taken by the General Assembly to ban the use of bacteriological weapons [resolution 2826 (XXVI)] and we express the hope that measures will soon be undertaken by the Assembly to prohibit the employment of chemical weapons as well.109.	With the convening of the proposed Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  an opportunity will be presented to all of us to assist in furthering the realization of universal peace by justly contributing to the economic development of all nations. Thirteen years have passed since the Second Conference took place in Geneva. In that brief span of years  the increase of world population  the birth of new nations and revolutionary advances in science and technology have combined to make   the question of the uses of ocean space a foremost question of our day.110.	If  in our one world  inequalities still abound and the gulf between rich and poor nations continues to widen  the causes lie in the way in which the wealth generated from the quarter of the earth's surface comprising land space has been unevenly distributed. The forthcoming Conference on the Law of the Sea affords us an historic opportunity to advance the cause of peace and prosperity for all nations by the legal order we shall frame to govern the three-quarters of our earth comprising ocean space. For this reason  my Government has attached the greatest importance to the work of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction  of which we have been a member since its beginning in 1967.111.	The Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations refers to our determination both ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" and ""to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom"". In accomplishing these ends  we are pledged  among other things  to employ international machinery for the economic and social advancement of all peoples. Moreover  Chapter IX of the Charter specifically deals with economic and social co-operation for the purpose of ensuring ""the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations ..."".112.	Although United Nations efforts in pursuance of these goals have fallen short of the purposes and principles of the Charter  the assistance rendered by the specialized agencies of the United Nations has been helpful in meeting both chronic and emergency needs around the world  thereby fostering the kind of co-operation among the peoples of our one world which exemplifies the highest ideals of this Organization put to practical effect.113.	Recently  the United Nations commendably assisted the countries of the Sudano-Sahelian region in dealing with the human problems resulting from the severe droughts which have affected that region and drastically reduced the availability of both crops and livestock. The United Nations also rendered prompt and valuable assistance to the peoples of India  Pakistan and Bangladesh during the recent natural disasters affecting those countries.114.	However  effective as those measures have been  much more must be done.115.	The framers of the Charter wisely understood that the problem of preserving international peace and stability was not solely a matter of providing means for ensuring the peaceful resolution of international conflicts and the prevention of aggression around the globe. The emphasis placed on the social and economic advancement of the world's peoples reflects the belief that all the peoples of the world should share in the bounties of this earth and that freedom from hunger and want  from poverty  ignorance and disease is an essential prerequisite to the enjoyment of all fundamental rights. We affirm these beliefs primarily because it is right and just to do so. But more than that  we do so in the sure knowledge that world peace and security cannot be long ensured if the gap between the ""have"" and the ""have-not"" nations remains so vast and apparently unbridgeable. That this gap continues to widen is unacceptable and extremely dangerous to the achievement of international stability and harmony.116.	The First United Nations Development Decade has been a painful disappointment. We look now to achievement of the goals set forth for the Second. But what becomes increasingly apparent is that a firm commitment from the developed countries has not existed in the past. Without that commitment  these efforts cannot yield success. Moreover  the vicissitudes of the international economy  and the world monetary system  factors over which developing countries exercise no control  often adversely affect our economies.117.	What is at stake is to ensure that the prerequisites of development  including capital inputs and technological assistance  are available to all nations on a sufficiently large scale  with reasonable and unburdensome terms. It is only by those means that the chronic problems of underdevelopment and the resulting instances of human misery  the inability of all men fully to have the opportunity of realizing their individual capacities  may be effectively tackled.118.	The President of Liberia has called upon all Liberians to become totally involved in building a better Liberia  in working for the development of the country to the benefit of all. He has therefore emphasized that the primary effort of ensuring development must be ours. ""Self-reliance for self-sufficiency""-this phrase sums up his challenge to the people of Liberia. But these policies are not limited to measures taken within the boundaries of Liberia  for we believe strongly in economic co-operation among all nations for the benefit of all the peoples of the world.119.	At a time in history when the genius of mankind has provided the means for vastly increasing agricultural production on less acreage  for producing heavy machinery and consumer goods on a massive scale  for arresting many of the conditions which breed disease and ill health  the challenge which faces us collectively is to use this capability for improving the condition of humanity. Let us refrain from large and wasteful expenditure of scarce resources on implements designed for the destruction of human life. Let us create in our one world that degree of mutual trust  tolerance and goodwill which will ensure that all men  regardless of race  creed  religion or ideological persuasion  shall live together in peace and prosperity.120.	I applaud  therefore  the recent proposal put forward by Mr. Andrei Gromyko  Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union [2126th meeting]  that the military budgets of States permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and other States with major military and economic potential be reduced by 10 per cent  and that part of those savings be directed towards providing assistance for developing countries. This is a notable and commendable positive step  and my delegation calls upon the General Assembly to consider this proposal seriously.121.	It is true that a nearly identical proposal was put forward by the Soviet Union in 1958*4 and 1959   but as an essential twin goal of the proposal is to effectuate some progress in the area of disarmament  those years of cold war may not have allowed for its serious consideration. However  in the spirit of major-Power detente which now prevails  ushering in a spirit of increased trust  tolerance  understanding and co-operation  we sincerely believe that this proposal will receive the consideration it deserves.122.	It is perhaps fitting at this time to remind ourselves that a new order of change has come into being in international relations  and to ponder over the fate of this Organization and refuse to permit sterility of imagination to cause us to remain unresponsive to problems that have been defined by new realities.123.	In this regard  we call upon all Member States  big and small  to give serious consideration to measures which will make this Organization more effective in today's world by enhancing its democratic character and adding to the impact of its decisions. The interest of a nation in peace  justice and economic progress does not increase or decrease in degree with the size of its population or the military power contained in its arsenals. These are issues which are vital to all nations and on which all nations should speak with equally authoritative voices.124.	My President recently said:""At its birth  the United Nations placed great emphasis upon the limitless possibilities of the human mind — and personality. It affirmed the equal creation of all human beings  and expressed the hope that the developing nations of the world would enjoy the right to share equitably in the wealth of the world. Unfortunately  after 27 years of its existence  man's hopes for a world order of peace  equality and justice have remained disappointingly unfulfilled.""125.	Let us therefore focus on this task and rise to this grave challenge and  in so doing  fulfil the sacred purpose of this great repository of man's hopes: to attain peace in our time and for all time  and to promote the economic and social advancement of all peoples in freedom and justice."
"67",4040,"LBY",28,1973,"﻿61.	I should like to express my delegation's sincere congratulations to Ambassador Benites on his accession to his high office. He is a distinguished son of Latin America  and his election therefore constitutes a source of pride to all of us in the third world  particularly the countries of Latin America that are struggling against difficult circumstances to achieve progress for their people. Despite the tragic events in Chile and the overthrow and cruel murder of President Salvador Allende  we are confident that the peoples of Latin America will continue their efforts to make progress and to gain complete control over their national resources.62.	Permit me also to express our consummate admiration to Ambassador Benites' predecessor  Mr. Trepczynski for his efforts while presiding over the affairs of the last session of this Assembly.63.	In the name of the Libyan Arab Republic  I should like to welcome from this rostrum the declaration of independence of the State of Guinea-Bissau  a country in Africa that is very close to our hearts. We look forward to the day when that country can take its rightful place in this Organization.64.	My delegation also takes this occasion to welcome the admission of the German Democratic Republic  the Commonwealth of the Bahamas and the Federal Republic of Germany to membership in this Organization. However  we cannot fail to deplore the policies pursued by the Federal Republic of Germany in maintaining relations with the racist and Nazi regimes in occupied Palestine  South Africa and Rhodesia.65.	The events that have occurred in the course of the past year still confirm the determination of colonialism and imperialism to pursue policies of threat  domination and extortion. Imperialism still employs all its resources to maintain a grasp over peoples. How else can one interpret the latest criminal aggression by Zionist gangs on 6 October than as one in a series of repeated aggression? within the over-all international imperialist and colonialist plot? The establishment of the puppet Zionist clique in the midst of the Arab nation was directed towards the control of the area and its resources. They also sought to impose on peoples of the area a state of fear and terror in order to prevent them from devoting all their attention to development and progress. This puppet clique was established through an international and colonial conspiracy  and the Arab people of Palestine were and remain today one of its victims. The Arab people of Palestine were expelled from their homes and their country and were dispersed to different parts of the world. They were replaced by hordes assembled from different parts of the world with no common purpose other than blind fanaticism and false slogans not based on any religious  historical  or national foundation.66.	The Zionist gangs took as their example chapters in United States history to establish the machinery that perpetuates itself through treachery  plunder and mass slaughter. They employed the same criminal methods that were used by the white settlers on this continent in subduing and exterminating the American Indian people. The record of the conduct of this clique and their United States supporters is overflowing with acts of aggression and conspiracy against the Arab nation. The current events in the Arab region illustrate just one further chapter in a series of aggressions oft repeated over the last 25 years.67.	This Zionist clique would not have been able to continue its aggression and expansion were it not for the material support of the United States of America  its partner in mass murder  extermination  and expulsion of the indigenous people of Palestine.68.	It has become very clear to the world that the United States of America has placed in the service of the Zionist gangs all its military and material potential  without any limit. Moreover  it has become a matter of fact that the same member of the Security Council has placed its right of veto in the hands of the Zionist gang  challenging the conscience of the world community in defiance of the Charter of the United Nations.69.	The Zionist gang  with the connivance of the United Stat<.   terrorizes  murders  annexes and expands with the inter  ion of imposing on the Arab nation a policy of defeatism and acquiescence. When the Arab nation defends itself by liberating its territories  the Zionist gangs and their supporters deny us our legitimate rights.70.	In the context of the latest aggressions against the Arab nation  is it not strange that the partner of the Zionist gangs  in its naked insolence  should demand the withdrawal of the forces to the positions they held prior to the outbreak of hostilities on 6 October 1973? The United States of America  abusing its seat in the Security Council as one of the five permanent members  has the audacity to demand that the Arabs withdraw from their own territories  evacuating them to accommodate Zionist immigrants. It backs up this audacious demand by threatening to use its Sixth Fleet  based in the Mediterranean  in a deliberate attempt to intimidate the Arab nation.71.	This ugly logic of domineering colonialism is based on deception  treachery and distortion of facts.72.	With these facts in mind  we can easily understand the motives behind these aggressions and the collaboration of the United States with the Zionist gangs. In plain terms  it is the lust for domination of the area  subjugation of its people and the exploitation of their resources.73.	The situation in Palestine can be dealt with neither from the approach of who it was who did or did not start the hostilities nor from that of finding superficial temporary Solutions. The problem can be dealt with only in its real essence and historical roots  which are that the Palestinian people have been expelled from their homes and their land and have been deprived of all their legitimate rights. Any solution that ignores this basic fact will be doomed to failure  whatever the magnitude of the Power that seeks to impose it.74.	The Libyan Arab Republic  which commits all that is in its power to the cause of the Palestinian people  calls upon the international community to support the Palestinian struggle against Zionist and colonialist forces. It is high time for the international community to raise its voice demanding the restoration to the Palestinian people of the inalienable rights of which they have been dispossessed in their usurped land.75.	It is all too clear that there is a threefold unholy alliance between  first  the forces of the Zionist clique  second  the colonialist regimes and  third  the regimes of apartheid and racial discrimination in Africa. They devise the same conspiracies  practise the same methods and pursue the same objectives  namely  close collaboration with international monopolies  suppression of the aspirations of legitimate indigenous peoples  imposition of alien settlements  and the practice of racial and religious discrimination. The struggle of the peoples of Angola  Guinea- Bissau  Mozambique  Namibia  Zimbabwe  the Saquia el Hamra  so-called Spanish Sahara  and Palestine for the liberation of their homelands encounters every day a greater deployment of force and terrorism on the part of the colonialist and racist regimes  supported by all the war machinery of the NATO Powers. The Libyan Arab Republic has stood and always will stand ready to place all its material and moral resources in support of the African and other struggles in the liberation movements in the world.76.	Colonialism and its agents perpetrate to this day acts of international terrorism. The determination of national liberation movements to achieve their objectives is confronted with even greater use of force and violence on the part of colonialist forces. This use of force has reached an unprecedented level in the practice of organized international terrorism  leading to mass murder and political assassination of such martyrs as Amilcar Cabral  Edouardo Mondelane  Kamal Adwan  Abu Yusuf and Kamal Nasser.77.	The recent developments in the international relations of the super-Powers  which have resulted in what has been called detente  should not be at the expense of the interests of the small countries. The developing countries have suffered expensively  during the period of international confrontation between the major Powers  from the policies of domination and division of the world as pursued against colonized and small nations alike. We are afraid that this detente is an agreement among the super-Powers to divide the world into permanent spheres of influence and to resolve international disputes among themselves without due regard to the interests of the international community  where the small countries constitute an overwhelming majority. At a time when it is said that the world has entered into a period of detente  we witness the consolidation of the bases of colonialism in Africa and Asia. We also witness conspiracies to exploit the natural resources of developing countries which are becoming increasingly extensive and devious. The methods of monopoly have reached the level of armed attack against the sovereignty of States to undermine the social and political systems of these countries.78.	In order that international peace and security based on equity and justice among nations may prevail  the non- aligned countries  in awareness of their responsibility to international society  have consolidated the:- efforts to destroy the monopolies and the political domination of the  major Powers. These efforts are also aimed at rectifying the imbalance prevailing in the international  political  economic and social scene  especially with regard to narrowing the gap between the have and the have-not nations.79.	Unfortunately  it is a fact that there are among us those who question the right of peoples and nations to exercise full control over their natural resources. This right constitutes an integral element in the exercise of national sovereignty by all States. It is high time for those who still undermine such national sovereignty because of their greed to recognize this legitimate right. The gravity of the situation becomes even more alarming when the States that are incited by international monopolies begin devising conspiracies  threatening to use force  and fabricating reasons in order to enlist other States in defiance of the recognized principle of national sovereignty over natural resources.80.	The situations in Indo-China  in the Arab region  and in the African continent are a constant reminder that the peace we seek remains elusive. The great victory of the heroic people of Viet-Nam against the forces of aggression and treachery is a triumph for all people struggling against imperialism  colonialism and neo-colonialism. Despite their great victory  the heroic people of Viet-Nam still suffer because of the violation by the United States and by the Saigon administration of the provisions of the Paris agreements  as well as of other international instruments related to the question of Viet-Nam. The situation in Cambodia is no better than that in Viet-Nam. The forces of colonialism remain represented in the puppet regime of Phnom Penh  which  with the support of the United States  still pursues inhuman policies against the people of Cambodia  struggling under the leadership of the Royal Government of Norodom Sihanouk.81.	One of the results of detente has been the imposition of partition on peoples and nations; and  what is worse  the United Nations has been used to consolidate and give legal status to such partition. Yesterday it was Germany  today it is Korea  and tomorrow it will be Viet-Nam.82.	The right to self-determination is the inalienable right of all nations  and can be exercised only in a context of free will  devoid of foreign interference and pressure.83.	International security is indivisible  and any disturbance in one area will result in disturbance of the international peace and security of the whole world. The current attempts of European countries to create in their continent new conditions of peace will not meet with the expected success unless Europe achieves self-reliance and terminates its reliance on foreign force  dismantling all foreign military bases  pacts  alliances and treaties.84.	In this context the presence of foreign fleets and foreign military bases in the Mediterranean area constitutes in itself a direct threat to the peace and security of the littoral States.85.	The Libyan Arab Republic  in raising this basic issue  wishes to draw the attention of all peace-loving States to the dangerous situation that resulted from the acts of aggression and provocation perpetrated by the United States of America in order to intimidate the people of the Libyan Arab Republic and prevent them from exercising their legitimate rights over their territorial waters and natural resources. The provocations of the Sixth Fleet and its repeated infringements of our territorial waters are just one further chapter in a long series of American aggressions against our coasts. The first attempt to realize this colonialist dream began in the early years of the nineteenth century and is  in fact  still embodied in the official anthem of the United States Marine Corps  which begins ""From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli"".86. The Libyan Arab Republic  in informing the international community of these provocations  assures it that itreserves its unequivocal right to protect its national sovereignty against all aggressors  however mighty.87. In conclusion  I should like to hail the heroic people of Egypt  Syria and Palestine  as well as the peoples of the third world  for their struggle to restore their rights and their land. This is an historic  crucial moment that will always be remembered in the annals of human history as one of the most noble missions of mankind in his struggle to achieve  justice and peace on earth."
"68",4145,"LKA",28,1973,"﻿147.	On behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka and the delegation of Sri Lanka  I extend to Ambassador Benites our cordial congratulations on his election as President of the twenty- eighth session of the General Assembly. His acknowledged eminence as an international jurist  his vast experience in United Nations affairs and the conspicuous diplomatic skill which he has displayed  as well as his personal qualities of patience  courtesy and tact  assure us of wise guidance and leadership during this session.148.	The United Nations owes its sincerest thanks to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczyfiski  the President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly  for his adroit handling of the work of that session and especially of some particularly controversial problems. His capacity for negotiation spared the Assembly discussions that might have been acrimonious and futile.149.	On the eve of this session the world heard the shocking news of the violent change of government in a country with which we have always maintained the most friendly understanding  a country which had co-operated with us closely on important problems both of a political and economic nature  and had taken its rightful place in the community of non-aligned nations. The Government which was overthrown had sought through a socialist policy to ensure for the people of that country a greater measure of social and economic equality and justice than they had enjoyed before.150.	The Government and people of Sri Lanka heard with profound grief and distress the poignant and tragic news of the death of President Salvador Allende  who gave his life in an attempt as a politician to fulfil what his friend and compatriot  the late Pablo Neruda  described as the poet's duty to take his place alongside the people in their struggle to transform society  which has been betrayed into chaos by its rulers  into an orderly existence based on political  economic and social democracy.151.	The experience of Chile shows that the deadliest enemies of social and economic reform and of the egalitarian society are the forces of reaction within a country  that privileged and pampered elite  which would not shrink from enlisting the support of external forces which command unlimited financial resources and exercise a decisive influence in key areas of the economy. This power and influence embolden them to conceive and even conduct operations designed to subordinate the democratic will of the people to their blinding obsession with profits and the politics of financial and economic dominion. The people of Chile have our deepest sympathy.152.	A new chapter in the history of the United Nations has been opened by the admission to its membership of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. We accord them a warm welcome to this Organization. They come here pledged to support the cause of peace and to redeem the past. We can no longer demand of them any further expiation of the crimes their leaders committed. In relations between nations  as between individuals  there is a time to remember and a time to forget. 153. We take special pleasure in welcoming the Commonwealth of the Bahamas on their admission to membership in the United Nations. We extend to them our best wishes and assure them of our close and constant co-operation.154. The past year has seen dramatic improvements in the United States relations with the Soviet Union and China  as well as clear signs of increasingly close and friendly co-operation between Japan on the one hand and the Soviet Union and China on the other. These developments are a favourable portent for the future. Wehope that they will gain increased momentum. Above all  we hope that at least the ideology they share in common will help compose the differences that now unfortunately exist between China and the Soviet Union.155.	The cessation of hostilities in Viet-Nam has removed one of the principal impediments to final reconciliation — the presence of foreign forces in that unhappy country  torn by internecine conflict and tormented and devastated by continuous warfare over a period of more than 30 years. But the end of war does not necessarily herald the dawn of peace. It is now left to the various factions in that country to refrain altogether from hostile acts against each other and to take the fullest advantage of the cessation of hostilities by entering into negotiations for the restoration of peace and harmony and for the initiation of the process of reconstruction. A commendable example has been set by Laos. We sincerely hope that a similar process will be started in Cambodia  uninfluenced by the interference  overt or otherwise  of outside parties.156.	The presence of both North and South Korea in our midst as observers should give a further impetus to the realization of the objective which should benefit them both — the ultimate unification of that country.157.	It is in the same spirit that we welcome the Indo- Pakistan Agreement of 28 August 1973 regarding the repatriation of Pakistani prisoners of war and civilian internees in India and the repatriation of all Bengalis in Pakistan and all Pakistanis in Bangladesh  specified in the Agreement. Ties of culture and history bind us firmly to the peoples of those countries. The future of South Asia depends very greatly on the maintenance of friendly relations and co-operation between them  and we in Sri Lanka stand ready  as always  to enter into active partnership with them in all efforts to ensure stability in the region and to bring peace and prosperity to all our peoples. We believe that  given a display of fraternity and magnanimity on all sides  all existing obstacles to the admission of Bangladesh to the United Nations should soon be removed.158.	The enlargement of the European Economic Community through the accession of the United Kingdom  Denmark and Ireland creates new opportunities for some but acute problems for others  among. them my own country. The increase in the strength and cohesion of the European Economic Community  while creating ideal conditions for rapid economic progress and ever-increasing prosperity for the members of the Community itself  could be so exploited as to produce beneficial consequences for the rest of the world by increasing rather than limiting trade opportunities to  and providing better markets for  the products of the developing world as a whole. The loss of those preferences which the members of the Commonwealth enjoyed in the past and the attenuation of the most-favoured nation principle  both of which result from Britain's accession to the Common Market  create special problems for the developing members of the Commonwealth  among them Sri Lanka  whose principal trading partner has been and continues to be Britain.159.	We sincerely hope that the negotiations that have already been set in train for the establishment of a special relationship between the Community and the associable territories will bring substantial relief and advantages to those territories. Those advantages are expected to take the form of trade and financial aid schemes  as well as compensatory financing and the creation of special institutions. We welcome this policy  but must appeal for its progressive application to others not yet eligible for such special treatment  particularly Asian Commonwealth countries like Sri Lanka  which will suffer deprivation as well as denial. We will lose the benefits hitherto enjoyed under the Commonwealth preference scheme and face the problem of unequal competition in European markets. The enlargement of the European Economic Community should not be allowed to arrest or reverse the trend towards greater liberalization of international trade and the elimination of all discriminatory trade practices.160.	The President of Upper Volta reminded us today of the calamity of the Sudano-Sahelian drought and famine and the heavy toll they have taken. The time has come for us to marshal all the resources of modern technology to avert such catastrophes in the future. We therefore welcome the initiative taken by the United States delegation in proposing the convening of a world food conference [2124th meeting]. If we cannot agree on reducing our stocks of guns  let us at least try to increase our stocks of food grains.161.	Interest in the concept of collective economic security has been revived on the initiative of the Government of Brazil  and that Government deserves to be congratulated on that initiative. We also applaud the initiative of the President of Mexico in regard to the adoption of a charter of economic rights and duties. The essence of those two concepts has already been distilled in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. We would welcome any new and concrete proposals for giving expression to the concept of collective economic security  but we should like to emphasize that there is no need for any new institutions for that purpose. We already have the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  which treat the problems on an interregional or global scale  while on the other hand we have the regional economic commissions which are equipped with both the means and the authority to promote regional cooperation.162.	The results achieved during the First United Nations Development Decade were disappointing and dismal. The Strategy for the second Decade contains certain priorities  incorporated in paragraphs (24)  (25) and (26)  which constitute the essence of collective economic security  namely  the priority aim of ""... securing stable  remunerative and equitable prices"" for the raw materials produced by developing countries; the principle that ""No new tariff and non-tariff barriers will be raised nor will the existing ones be increased by developed countries against imports of primary products of particular interest to developing countries;"" and that priority should be given by developed countries . .to reducing or eliminating duties and other barriers to imports of primary products  including those in processed or semi-processed form  of export interest to developing countries..."".163.	These results were to be achieved by 31 December 1972. That there is little to review and less to appraise  except failure  is abundantly clear from the report on the second session of the Committee on Review and Appraisal.164.	Most of the problems that exist between nations might  in our belief  perhaps be considerably mitigated  if not solved  through greater economic co-operation and the improvement of economic relations between countries.165.	More attention and encouragement need to be given to those organs of the United Nations family that are concerned with economic co-operation and questions of international trade and development  in particular UNIDO  which was established with the definite purpose of dealing with the problems that afflicted the developing countries and of establishing a more solid association and partnership between the developing and the developed sections of the world to their mutual benefit and advantage. If there is any tendency to set up UNCTAD as a rival to the Economic and Social Council  it should be resolutely discouraged. There are clear and hopeful signs of the Council's regaining its vitality and assuming the constitutional role assigned to it under the Charter. The Secretary-General has in his introduction to the report on the work of the Organization drawn pointed attention to this question and has noted with satisfaction the reassertion of the constitutional authority of the Economic and Social Council [A/9001/Add. 1  p. 7]. One of that Council's most important functions is the coordination and reconciliation of the activities of the independent specialized agencies and other organs —  steadily growing in number — through which the economic and social policies of the United Nations are carried into effect. There has to be decentralization but not at the expense of integration; there should be effective co-ordination to avoid duplication and dissipation of effort  waste of staff and inefficient use of funds.166.	The criticism is often heard that the developing countries are too importunate or too peremptory in their demands for aid. The modest targets set for the transfer of resources from the developed to the developing countries do not  in our opinion  justify such a harsh criticism. Aid is like the quality of mercy: it blesseth him that gives and him that takes. If it is inspired by altruism  it is also sustained by self-interest. It is an investment that will some day yield a dividend in which the donor will himself share  as it will give the recipient nations readier access to the products of the donor nations. This is sufficient justification for the developing countries' proposal  in regard to the reform of the international monetary system  that there should be a definite link established between special drawing rights and development aid. The proposal that in the next issue of special drawing rights the developing nations should have a greater share is only the other side of the same coin. The creation of this next issue should no longer be deferred.167.	The question of a world disarmament conference will once again be discussed. The major Powers have an opportunity of providing an earnest of their good faith and thus creating a favourable climate for such a conference if they pledge themselves to a total and unqualified renunciation of the use of nuclear weapons; a comprehensive test ban treaty  to be concluded without any further excuses or delay; the total cessation of the manufacture of all nuclear weapons; and the dismantling of all nuclear arsenals. Those Powers which enjoy an overwhelming superiority in nuclear capacity and whose nuclear armouries pose the greatest threat of nuclear war ending in a nuclear holocaust must first set an example by giving the lead in committing themselves to these four points. If we condemn atmospheric testing  we must not content ourselves with merely making mild remonstrances against the conduct of underground testing. We must condemn all forms of testing and demand the immediate conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty  accompanied by the other and related measures which we have already proposed.168.	The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has once again failed to keep its promise of producing a draft agreement on the prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and the destruction of stockpiles of such weapons. The excuse given by those who wish to retain these weapons is palpably flimsy.169.	In striking contrast to the fervour with which the major Powers appeal for the support of the rest of the membership for any disarmament proposal they produce is the attitude of disdain and superciliousness with which they themselves have treated a proposal that adopts a positive approach to the problem  one that seeks to prevent the spread of the arms race into at least one region of the world  one that seeks  as its ultimate aim  the removal of all military bases from that area and one that by this means seeks to create a climate of peace where the accumulation or the use of arms would not be necessary. I refer to the Indian Ocean peace zone proposal on which the General Assembly adopted a Declaration at its twenty-sixth session [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. This Declaration  may I remind the Assembly  failed to secure. the support of the major Powers with one notable exception — China. The First Committee will shortly receive and consider the report of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean [A/9029] established by General Assembly resolution 2992 (XXVII). I do not feel called upon  therefore  to comment on the report at this stage.170.	The United Nations does not appear to be anywhere near a solution of the Middle East problem. On the other hand it seems to be coming — if it has not already come — perilously close to the eye of the storm. Institutions and individuals that ardently support respect for human rights and express their indignation over the denial to a certain group of the right to leave their country do not show any concern over the fact that the assertion of that right results in the flagrant denial and destruction of the human rights of another group. I refer to the policy adopted by the State of Israel of establishing along the perimeter of the occupied territories a pattern of settlements in which for the most part Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union are settled.171.	Why do the champions of human rights fail to voice their objections to the expropriation of the lands of the Palestinian Arabs and to their use for the establishment of Jewish settlements on the pretext of security? This pretext cannot be reconciled with the declarations of Israeli leaders that the State of Israel commands overwhelming military superiority over the combined forces of the Arab world. This is no idle boast. More disturbing  however  are the statements of Israeli leaders that they are acting in accordance with the doctrine of the power of right or the right of power  the most naked and unabashed assertion of the principle that might is right  which is totally at variance with the fundamental principles of the Organization to which they belong and to which they have pledged their support.172.	We wish to see a settlement in the Middle East  — one that will guarantee conditions of peace and security not merely to the people of Israel but to all the peoples of the Arab world that are their neighbours. We wish to see a partnership established between them that can be of lasting benefit to both groups. But we must hold the scales evenly and create conditions in which negotiations  direct or indirect  can start. To invoke Security Council resolution 242 (1967) is meaningless if the violation of the human rights of the population of the occupied territories continues to pass unchallenged and unchecked. The present policy of Israel can only be described as one of territorial aggrandizement based on the territorial claims of Israel and in transgression of the very instrument that created the State of Israel within clearly demarcated boundaries. The State of Israel has a right to welcome Jews from all over the world — no one questions that right — but it must not be left free to encroach on the territory  and extinguish the rights  of the Palestinian Arabs.173.	As long as the occupation in its present form continues and is consolidated by the practices and policies systematically pursued by the Government of Israel  the conditions required for negotiation will never be created. The hope of peace will remain as remote and evanescent as ever and the danger of the outbreak of hostilities will haunt us  undiminished by considerations sacred or secular. The fighting that flared up on 6 October was a grim warning.174.	The Charter is a document that has a sanctity of its own  even if it lacks Messianic inspiration  and any violation of the Charter is a greater blasphemy and sacrilege than a decision to assert one's rights while one antagonist is absorbed in a spiritual exercise of supreme significance to him — even if that were actually the case. All faiths must be held in reverence  but it is no less a blasphemy and sacrilege to plead that the most sacred hour in one's calendar must be invoked to secure one's immunity from the consequences of one's own wrongdoing.175.	The latest news is that civilian targets in densely populated areas in the heart of Damascus are being subjected to intensive and ruthless bombing by the Israeli Air Force  the excuse being that they are close to military headquarters. There are even reports  still to be confirmed  that fatal casualties have occurred among the families of foreign diplomats. Against this background of savagery  the Israeli Foreign Minister's impassioned and propagandistic reference at the 2139th meeting to atonement sounds utterly hollow and hypocritical.176.	The inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by force is a principle that must be accepted and honoured without qualification or equivocation. It is a principle that is not open to modification or attenuation. Any attempt at manipulating it through prevarication to suit a particular nation's policies and designs will deceive nobody. It is  as it were  the coping stone of the archway of peace through which all posterity must be free to pass in safety  in honour and in dignity. Tamper with it  and the whole structure will collapse in ruins.177.	It is in that spirit that the efforts to implement Security Council resolution 242 (1967) must be renewed.178.	The members of the international community will soon face their severest test in co-operation and compromise for the establishment of a stable and viable law of the sea when the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is convened. We shall be called upon to review existing international law and transform it  especially that part of it that derives its authority from custom  to suit the moral values  ethical standards and political principles of the twentieth century. These are entirely different from the values  standards and principles of the generation of Grotius and Selden. Any law or custom governing the conduct of nations in their relations with one another must be based on principles of equity and international social justice. If a genuine and durable reform of the law of nations  whether it be in regard to the law of the sea or other aspects of international law  is to be achieved  there has to be a willingness on the part of the powerful and affluent to accommodate the interests and aspirations of the less privileged nations of the world. A law which will ensure order as well as justice must be free from extravagance and must take into special consideration the interests of the land-locked countries  if they are to be treated as equal partners with an equal right to the common heritage of mankind.179.	The United Nations has made little progress with the problems of Africa. The savage and ruthless suppression of liberation movements in Portuguese colonial Territories by the Government of Portugal  the odious and obnoxious racist policies of the Smith regime in Southern Rhodesia and of the South African Government continue unabated. Civilized opinion throughout the world remains outraged but helpless. The only effective weapon  short of armed intervention —  which is beyond contemplation — is sanctions if they are scrupulously enforced. It is too often pleaded that a Member State's duties and responsibilities under the Charter must be governed by realities. In the language of diplomacy  reality is only an imaginary obstacle to the fulfilment of a binding obligation. This plea or pretext is most often advanced in regard to the enforcement of mandatory sanctions against racist regimes. More than anything else  this attitude undermines the Charter and impairs its effectiveness  while at the same time dealing a mortal blow to the prestige of the principal organs of the United Nations — the General Assembly and the Security Council. The lofty sentiments often heard in this Assembly lose their meaning when they are belied by actions and policies which reject or ignore Charter obligations.180.	In the general debate scant attention is paid to one of the principal organs of the United Nations — the Secretariat. The United Nations is the hub of the international civil service and should serve as a model to all the other members of the United Nations family in regard to the maintenance of efficiency  morale and that essential ingredient of all forms of service  loyalty to the employer — in this instance the international community. Without loss of national identity there could be subordination of it in the larger interest of the world community. Morale can be sustained only if the permanent members of the international civil service are assured of fair treatment in the matter of promotion and remuneration. Recruitment policies must similarly be designed to secure the best talent available subject only to the requirement stated in Article 101  paragraph 3 of the Charter.181.	Every Member has a right to ensure that the principle of equitable geographical distribution without sacrifice of merit and efficiency is strictly observed  but we cannot blind ourselves to the fact that there are occasions when undue pressure is exercised by delegations in regard to appointments and promotions. Where such pressures are successful and affect the legitimate career prospects of permanent members of the Organization  some degree of demoralization must result. The Members should extend their co-operation to the Secretary-General in ensuring that the highest standards are maintained in regard to recruitment and. promotion  free from any suspicion of political influence  and that recruits to the international civil service have an assured prospect of steady advancement unaffected by extraneous factors  provided they maintain the requisite standards of integrity  efficiency and loyalty.182.	Another aspect of the problem which deserves attention is the remuneration of members of the Secretariat. The currency fluctuations of recent times have caused hardship to many  especially those in the lower grades. An arrangement should be made whereby the adjustments in allowances can be effected with the least possible delay where currency fluctuations have an adverse effect on the emoluments of the staff. Such an arrangement could conform in large measure to the policy and practice of the host country in regard to the members of its own civil service. Relief often comes too late  and in the meantime avoidable hardship is inflicted on the staff.183.	In section XI of the excellent introduction to his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General has drawn attention to the additional burden imposed on the Organization's finances through the exchange fluctuations that have occurred in recent times  particularly the decline in the value of the United States dollar. It would appear that the nervous breakdown of the United States dollar — and I deliberately describe it as a nervous breakdown  as the decline in the value of the dollar has nothing to do with economic factors such as the productive capacity of the United States economy and its competitiveness — has resulted in an increase of as much as 25 per cent or more in the cost in dollars of purchasing the currencies required to meet the United Nations regular budget obligations in Geneva  Vienna and elsewhere.184.	It would not be unfair to suggest that that extra cost should be borne by those countries whose currencies have strengthened against the United States dollar. Some of those countries have acquired that position of strength and superiority largely owing to the generosity of the United States. If the extra financial costs imposed on the Organization as a result of this development in the world's money markets has to be met at the expense of humanitarian programmes undertaken or contemplated by the Organization  the prosperous economies should not begrudge the United Nations this special measure of relief. While on this theme  we should like to congratulate the Government of Japan on its special grant of $10 million and the Government of the United Arab Emirates on its special grant of $ 1 million to meet part of the deficit under which the Organization is now staggering. Those are examples worthy of emulation by others.185.	The need for a revision of the Charter has been referred to by many speakers. In our opinion  the Charter remains the best instrument for international cooperation to secure peace  harmony and progress and the establishment of a stable world order that human ingenuity could have devised to suit the fickleness and frailty of human nature and the unavoidable partisanship that is dictated by expediency and overrides principle. There are some aspects in regard to which the Charter requires revision to bring it into line with contemporary realities. Changes of a fundamental character  especially those affecting the relationships that existed between the members of the victorious alliance of the Second World War 28 years ago. have taken place and must be considered in any revision. Two continents do not enjoy the privilege of permanent representation and the power that goes with it in the Security Council. Political considerations today count for much less than economic factors. But in any attempt at reform we must reckon with the fact that once conferred special privileges are difficult to withdraw. The most urgent reform of all is reform of ourselves."
"69",4189,"LSO",28,1973,"﻿210.	 It is a source of great pleasure for me to congratulate Ambassador Benites  on behalf of the Lesotho delegation  on his election to the high office of President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I have no doubt that he will — as he has already demonstrated — guide the work of this session to a successful and fruitful conclusion.211.	I should also like to take advantage of this opportunity to congratulate the Commonwealth of the Bahamas on its accession to independence and its subsequent admission to membership in this world Organization. On the basis of its history  my delegation is convinced that the Bahamas will be an active and effective Member of the United Nations  especially in the field of decolonization.212.	My delegation hails the admission of both Germany s to membership in the United Nations because it is a significant landmark in the history of this Organization. It is a great achievement in diplomacy and a giant step towards making the United Nations a truly universal Organization.213.	My Government will be happy to lend its support to the admission of the remaining divided nations to this Organization to ensure that all peoples are adequately represented in our deliberations.214.	I speak before you on behalf of a people who  alongside others  lost their own in the two major wars of this century. We welcome the detente amongst the big Powers. We were happy at the signing of the Paris peace agreements on Indo-China and the lowering of tensions in Europe is for us a matter of satisfaction. Indeed I believe that mankind is now poised to seize the opportunities for a more durable peace that are offered by these developments.215.	But these opportunities for a more permanent peace will be lost if the basic human rights of all peoples are ignored. There can be no peace that is based on the sufferings of others. The hunger and poverty of the vast majority of humanity are no basis for a permanent international regime which provides for mutually satisfactory accommodation of the interests of all peoples.216.	As Chancellor Willy Brandt of the Federal Republic of Germany said last week so eloquently:.. human distress is conflict. Where hunger prevails  there can be no peace in the long run. Where bitter poverty prevails  there can be no justice. Where a man's very existence is threatened for want of basic daily needs  it is not permissible to speak of security."" J217.	The denial of human rights to others either on the basis of race or any other characteristic can contribute no more to humanity than deluding us into interpreting temporary armistices or the absence of bloody conflicts as peace.218.	The allocation of resources to military expenditures by the rich countries continues to increase  while in the rest of the world the basic daily needs of millions of people have no hope of being satisfied.219.	It is in the context of this reality that this Organization  whose principal function is the maintenance of international peace  should take concrete decisions to alleviate man's suffering as a pre-condition to a more permanent peace structure.220.	The urgency of meeting this reality is underlined by the current indications of a world-wide food shortage. No one can dispute the fact that such a shortage  unless redressed  will create conditions in the third world which will undermine social institutions and stability.221.	This Organization should galvanize man's creative abilities in science and technology to solve the perennial problems of drought  which afflict many countries of the developing world. My country is among those which have suffered drought year after year. We do not hope to rely solely on relief foodstuffs from the rich countries. We hope more permanent solutions can be found to alleviate problems arising from these conditions.222.	My delegation in this context welcomes the initiative of the United States Secretary of State for the convening of a world food conference [2124th meeting] and we sincerely hope that the energies that detente between the super-Powers and other big Powers has released will be devoted to the realization of that most fundamental of human rights  the right to live.223.	On behalf of the Lesotho Government I wish to register Lesotho's opposition to the recent spate of nuclear tests because  inasmuch as these tests are irrelevant to the essential needs of humanity  they militate against international co-operation and endanger the lives of human beings as well as the living resources on which they depend. They are regrettably carried out in a spirit of overt defiance of international public opinion and of the principles of peaceful coexistence.224.	When the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade was adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-fifth session in 1970 [resolution 2626 (XXV)]  some of us were hopeful that the international community had at long last become aware  in the interests of durable peace and stability  of the pressing need to combat the scourges of mass poverty  unemployment  disease and malnutrition plaguing the developing countries. But the first over-all biennial review and appraisal of progress has already shown how dismally over-optimistic we were.225.	The gap between the planned objectives and targets of the Strategy and their achievement in the wide spectrum of the problem areas o+ socio-economic growth and development  as elaborated in the Strategy itself  remains as wide and frightening as ever. To quote but a few areas of critical importance to the development effort of such least-developed countries as mine  there has been a failure on the part of developed countries as a whole to achieve aid goals of 1 per cent of gross national product  a failure to achieve official assistance of 0.7 per cent of gross national product  insufficient action to help developing countries gain access to export markets in spite of the newly introduced generalized system of preferences  failure to evolve a concerted policy on debt relief  and a tendency to pay lip service to the interests of developing countries in multilateral trade and monetary negotiations. I cannot hope to exhaust the whole list of disappointments or shortfalls here  and of course some individual developed countries have performed better than others in various fields. But all in all  the economic and technological gap between the ""have"" and the ""have not"" countries  or between the north and the south  is ever widening. As one expert study on the subject concludes  the International Development Strategy remains ""much more a wish than a policy"". The situation gives the impression that the Strategy was adopted with no intention of implementing it  and if this is the case my greatest fear is that the credibility of the consensus of this august body is being terribly undermined.226.	In my view the bleak and disappointing results of the first two or three years of the Second Development Decade make it urgent and imperative that both the developed and the developing countries should vigorously make a concerted effort  not only to implement the existing targets and policy measures of the Strategy  but also to seek new areas of agreement  to widen and deepen existing ones  to evolve new concepts and standards and to seek agreement on additional measures. As an extension of the new east-west policy of detente  both rich and poor countries should seriously strive to establish new structural relationships on the basis of equitable co-operation and partnership  as well as mutual benefit. The world community ought to realize that  while the basic responsibility for thedevelopment of the developing countries rests with those countries themselves  development  like maintenance of world peace  is a global problem that transcends national frontiers and very often defies national solutions  and it is therefore a joint responsibility of all nations.227.	As members of the General Assembly are very well aware  Lesotho is one of the hard-core among the least developed of the developing countries. In addition to the problems that are common to all countries which are similarly classified  Lesotho is plagued by unique problems which other developing countries are fortunate enough not to experience. The source of those unique problems is Lesotho's own geographical situation  which is such that it is the only State Member of the United Nations whose territory is completely embedded within the territory of another State Member of the United Nations  whose political philosophy is  furthermore  directly opposite to its own.228.	At this stage I can only express the hope that special measures in favour of the least developed among the developing countries  as well as special measures in favour of land-locked developing countries  envisaged-in the International Development Strategy and elaborated upon and refined by other forums or agencies will be translated into reality as a matter of priority  taking into consideration the unique geo-economic position of my country. I should like to state that the Government of Lesotho stands ready to support any efforts aimed at evolving institutional arrangements for the implementation of such special measures. The idea of the creation of special funds is attractive to my delegation  but in the event that this is not sufficiently palatable to the majority of developed countries I would like to give support to the use of the United Nations Capital Development Fund in favour of the least developed among the developing countries  in the hope that the developed countries will now be more favourably disposed towards increasing their contributions to the Fund.- 229. My Government fully supported the establishment of the United Nations Environment Programme  as well as the establishment of the Fund of the United Nations Environment Programme. We hope that the establishment of the programme will lead to an internationally co-ordinated solution to the problem of the pollution of man's environment  which is one of the most recently recognized hazards to human survival. We also hope that in addressing themselves to these problems both the Governing Council and the secretariat of the United Nations Environment Programme will attach as much importance to the problems of the spread of deserts as to the loss of productive soil through soil erosion. In my country soil erosion is the greatest environmental problem which we have for many years been trying to solve. Our efforts have so far not met with any success. Our very limited arable land is annually being swept away to the oceans by soil erosion  thus undermining our annual increase of agricultural output. The hazard to human life posed by the spread of deserts such as the Sahara Desert is too recent an example to need emphasis.*230. With the passage of time the Middle East situation  as is evident from recent events  is becoming more and more complicated. As the attitudes of parties to the conflict continue to harden  the United Nations peace-making machinery seems to be manifesting symptoms of fatigue and helplessness. This conflict is gradually becoming the . pivot of the world's energy crisis. In addition  a colonial situation seems more than ever before to be developing in the occupied territories  which makes all the more tragic the fate of the Palestinian people. It is the view of my Government that any measures calculated to change the character of those territories would only complicate the solution of the problem. Even under these greatly changed circumstances  Security Council resolution 242(1967)  if not distorted  still provides a reasonable framework for its solution.231.	In southern Africa  35 million African people continue to be politically dominated and economically as well as morally exploited by a handful of settlers of European descent  who use their overwhelming military and economic power to deny their subjects even the most basic of human rights and freedoms.232.	We in Lesotho continue to insist that a just solution of the Rhodesian crisis must of necessity be preceded by the release of all political prisoners; the revocation of the current state of emergency; a watertight guarantee of freedom of expression and of assembly; the repeal of current discriminatory legislation; and the convening of a genuinely representative constitutional conference  whose decisions would have legal effect only if approved by all Rhodesians on the basis of unqualified universal suffrage.233.	The solution of the Rhodesian problem is the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government. We believe also that it is the duty of the international community to assist the liberation struggle in Zimbabwe morally  materially and in any other way possible. The continued existence of the Ian Smith regime is incompatible with the establishment of durable peace in southern Africa  as has been demonstrated by its past military excursions and its senseless economic blockade of Zambia. In addition to the fact that its persistence is a threat to the security and sovereignty of the independent African States which neighbour it  it is a potential source of racial conflict which may one day engulf the whole of southern Africa  unless events in that part of the world follow a different course.. 234. While the world continues to be shocked by the revelations of the atrocities of Portugal in its colonies  some of Portugal's powerful western allies continue to deny that their military and economic assistance is used in the perpetration of those atrocities. I submit that  if the Imilitary  economic and technical resources which are placed at the disposal of Portugal are not used in Portuguese wars against freedom movements  that kind of aid to Portugal at least frees resources of Portuguese origin to be deployed against the human rights of Portugal's colonial subjects  to stifle the liberation struggle and to perpetuate Portuguese political domination and the economic exploitation of Angola and Mozambique.235. In conformity with my Government's policy  Lesotho was among those countries which blessed the Secretary-General's initiative in making contacts with Pretoria over the question of Namibia. Addressing itself to the stark realities of the situation  Lesotho is now beginning to entertain serious doubts on the wisdom of this dialogue  as South Africa's continuing Balkanization of the territory  even during the course of the negotiations  is clearly calculated to prejudice any possible satisfactory outcome.236.	On the situation prevailing in South Africa the views of my Government are well known. My Government has stated many times before that the people of South Africa would soon come to the conclusion that they had no alternative in the solution of the apartheid problem but resort to the use of force. My Government has also observed' that apartheid was likely to lead to the tragedy of racial confrontation-confrontation that could not be confined to Africa but that would result in racial hatred and bitterness throughout the world. It is clear to us that  unless there is a change of heart on the part of the South African Government  racial violence is going to become a feature of life in southern Africa.237.	My Government has always espoused a policy of friendship with all States and good neighbourliness in particular with all the countries of southern Africa. We seek confrontation with no one. Our policy of good neighbourliness in no way diminishes our commitment to the United Nations principles on the universal rights of man; therefore we shall never cease to condemn the evils of apartheid  racism and colonialism.238.	In our own society we shall continue to reflect the common humanity of man. We shall continue to provide refuge to the victims of apartheid  racism and colonialism. In our schools we shall continue to provide places for people of all colours to enable them to develop their intellectual capabilities to the fullest extent possible in an atmosphere free from racial bigotry.239.	Our foreign policy is dictated by our national interests. In the formulation of those interests we shall continue to be guided by our obligations under the Charter and our commitment to peace and justice.240.	Allow me to express the profound appreciation of my Government at the expressions of sympathy and condolences extended to my Government and the families of the Lesotho nationals who lost their lives or suffered injuries in the recent shootings at the Carletonville Mines in South Africa. These expressions of sympathy give us reason to believe that the international community is still fully conscious of the value of human life and the dignity of the human person. I wish to assure you that the Lesotho Government has made arrangements for the interests of those affected and their dependants to be looked after by counsel in the proposed judicial inquiry into this incident.241.	Finally  I am pleased to inform this Assembly that the Kingdom of Lesotho has today accorded full recognition to the new sovereign State of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. On behalf of my Government I wish to congratulate the Government and the people of Guinea- Bissau on the bold step they have taken."
"70",4259,"LUX",28,1973,"﻿182.	First of all  Mr. President  I should like on behalf of my delegation to congratulate you most warmly on your accession to the Presidency of the Assembly. We all know how wide is your experience and authority and we know we shall need those two qualities in order to complete our difficult discussions on the many subjects before us at the present session.183.	In accordance with well-established tradition  the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  has made things easier for us by the submission of his clear  objective and realistic report on the work of the Organization.184.	I should like to join the many speakers who have preceded me in greeting the admission to the United Nations of the two German States and the Bahamas. That brings our Organization closer to the ideal situation  which is the participation of all nations of the world in our work. We are particularly happy at the admission to our Organization of the Federal Republic of Germany  a neighbour arid friend with which we enjoy close ties of friendship and fruitful co-operation in a number of international organizations  particularly within the framework of the European communities. I wish to express the conviction that the arrival among us of new Member States represents an appreciable strengthening of the United Nations and I trust that the very few countries which have not yet joined us will be able to do so in the very near future.185.	If one glances at the international situation today7 one is able to see certain reasons for satisfaction. Is it not true that for the moment there is no major source of war  causing considerable loss of human life? I believe that fact should be stressed and Sir Alec Douglas-Home was quite correct when he quoted the Secretary-General and stated that we could consider with a certain optimism the fact that the United Nations had in the last few years contributed to defusing a number of conflicts [2128th meeting  para. 122]  Thanks to the wisdom of enlightened statesmen  satisfactory compromises have recently been achieved that have led to a considerable reduction of hostilities in Indo-China. I trust that the agreements recently reached between India and Pakistan will allow a definitive settlement of the difficulties that still persist on that subcontinent.186.	Unfortunately  the world is not safe from new sources of violence and illegality.187.	It is with the deepest feelings of sadness and regret that we heard of the tragic death of President Allende and the overthrow by force of a democratically elected regime  regardless of the merits or deficiencies it might have had. For the Chilean people and in the interest of all nations here assembled  I trust that democratic freedoms will promptly be re-established  and we ask above all that  there as everywhere else in the world  respect for human rights be guaranteed to all men irrespective of their political opinions.188.	To turn to the European continent  the second phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has just started in Geneva and the negotiations on mutual and balanced reductions of forces in Central Europe will soon enter an active stage.189.	A continent which for many decades has been disturbed will thus be able to make progress on the road of co-operation among countries with different social regimes  on the road to better mutual understanding and  hence  to increased security. I express the hope and the profound conviction that the negotiations under way will serve to ensure not only material exchanges but also  and primarily  better mutual information and a freer exchange of men and ideas  as well as full respect for human rights and intellectual freedoms. Together with my colleague Mr. van der Stoel  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands  I should like to stress that  in saying this  our concern is not to intervene in the domestic affairs of certain States but rather to address an appeal to them to prove by tangible deeds that detente and rapprochement between peoples are much more than a vague slogan and have become an everyday reality.190.	In the Middle East  there has been no progress for a very long time. Although a certain detente is enjoyed all over the world and countries of very different ideologies are in the process of establishing relations that could hardly have been dreamed of only a few years ago  that region is still in a situation which is neither war nor peace and which may at any moment degenerate into a new confrontation. That situation is — we must unfortunately repeat it-contrary to the spirit and the letter of the Charter  to the rules of international law  to the resolutions of the United Nations and also to the interests even of the parties and all the countries of the region.191.	The need for a settlement is manifest. The principles on which such a settlement should be based are set forth in the Charter as well as in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). I need not reaffirm the importance of that resolution  which has the twofold advantage of having been adopted unanimously and of defining the respective obligations of the parties. Furthermore  it has acquired particular value since it was accepted by three of the parties concerned  namely  Egypt  Jordan and Israel.192.	The provision on withdrawal from the territories occupied by Israel must  however  be considered in conjunction with the right of Israel to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries. These two elements cannot be considered each as a prior condition for the other  since that would lead to never being able to change the situation. Only the parties concerned  either through direct or indirect contacts  whether these are termed negotiations rather than soundings or preparatory talks  can decide by common agreement what in the end will be secure and recognized boundaries and  consequently  what will be the so-called minor changes to be made to these same boundaries.193.	May I be allowed sincerely to regret the fact that such negotiations have not yet been possible and also that Israel is in the process of creating a fait accomplis in certain parts of the occupied territories  which might jeopardize the very objective of such negotiations.194.	It is naturally also true  and experience has proved this very often in the past  that it is difficult to maintain for a long period of time a status of strict occupation. That is not an accusation against any of the parties  nor is it an excuse; but it is merely a statement of the regrettable fact that  the more time passes  the more the search for a solution becomes difficult. May I express  contrary to what certain other speakers have said  my conviction that in this specific case time is on no one's side but against all  and my hope that all the countries concerned will realize this and act accordingly before it is too late.195.	For five years from this rostrum I have drawn the attention of the Assembly to the fact that we must never underestimate the importance of the Palestinian phenomenon within the framework of the Middle East conflict. The inexcusable acts of terrorism and political blackmail exercised through innocent victims should finally prove to the most recalcitrant observers that no final settlement can be arrived at if they overlook this burning question.196.	I come now to the question of colonialism and connected phenomena. Although the situation in this connexion has greatly improved throughout the years  it is nevertheless a fact that millions of human beings are still deprived of their fundamental rights to self-determination  freedom and independence.197.	Despite the numerous resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council on this subject  we must unfortunately note that colonialism  racial discrimination and apartheid continue to prevail particularly in southern Africa.198.	I should like to make the position of my Government very clear on this matter. We are firmly opposed to anypolicy which an objective examination of the facts allows us to consider as colonialist or subject to convictions of racial discrimination  and we consider the action of Governments following such a policy as reprehensible. My Government gives neither military nor economic assistance to such Governments and fully complies with the mandatory decisions of the Security Council in this respect. However  we do not consider the exclusion of colonialist Governments from international organizations  or even the breaking off of diplomatic relations  as constituting the most effective means of forcing them to change their policies.199.	I should like to add here that I profoundly regret a certain confusion which seems to have been created in the Assembly between the notion of struggling against terrorism and that of opposition to colonial or national liberation movements. The legitimacy of the objectives of the latter can but suffer from that confusion.200.	We are convinced that it is necessary unreservedly to condemn any terrorist activity endangering the lives of innocent persons. The taking of hostages  the hijacking of aircraft and the resulting blackmail are particularly repugnant crimes which cannot be justified nor excused by any motive and in any circumstances. It is truly deplorable that a series of political motives — albeit valid but nevertheless secondary when compared to the objective sought — has prevented the conference recently held in Rome from adopting any concrete decision. It is certainly necessary that this Assembly adopt quick and efficient measures on this matter and that the highest political gatherings of the world thus reaffirm the great moral principle that the end does not justify the means.201.	I come now to another important question  which deals with economic development and social improvements in the world in order to achieve a more equitable distribution of wealth among all peoples. Three years have elapsed since the General Assembly adopted the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]  and certain doubts have appeared regarding the possibility of achieving the targets set by the Strategy  because of the absence of sufficient funds. That does not necessarily prove that we should give up the Strategy here and now and lose confidence in the results to be expected from the Second Development Decade. Indeed  the Strategy was conceived from the outset as a dynamic instrument which had to be adapted to changing circumstances. Therefore  its contents can be expanded to take into account certain new elements  while the general philosophy and the basic objectives are maintained.202.	Thus the interdependence of monetary problems and those raised by economic development and the structure of international trade has been brought to light. Another important element is the poverty of the masses in the developing countries  with all the attendant scourges such as under-employment  malnutrition  lack of decent housing  lack of education and crying inequalities in standards of living. It is urgent that valid solutions be found to these complex problems. In order to do so  we have to replace the old statistical approach of measuring economic growth on a per capita basis by a new concept placing human welfare in all its aspects at the centre of development policy.203.	I should also like to mention the world-wide problem of finding a sufficient supply of food-stuffs and the necessity for an increased international effort to contain the expansion of desert zones and to improve the yield of arid lands. The tragic drought that has devastated a number of Sudano-Sahelian countries in western and central Africa has suddenly brought these two problems to the attention of the world. Very significant assistance has been given following that catastrophe  both on a bilateral basis and through the machinery established by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. However  since it is quite possible that the drought may persist in the region  outside assistance is still indispensable. And for that assistance to be effective  it is imperative that the international community  and the organs of the United Nations in particular  tackle these problems in a co-ordinated fashion.204.	I believe that the proposal made [2124th meeting  para. 71] by the Secretary of State of the United States  Mr. Kissinger  for the holding next year of a world food conference is a wise one and that preparations should immediately be undertaken for it.205.	I am happy to state  within this general context  that my Government has just decided considerably to increase  within the limits of its possibilities  the assistance we give to the developing countries. This increase will start with the 1974 budget.206.	With regard to the world population problem  it is encouraging to note that the United Nations Special Fund has increased its activities. It is to be hoped that the World Population Conference to be held in Bucharest in 1974 will produce ideas concerning all aspects of this very delicate problem.207.	All over the world  efforts are being made to create concrete programmes based on the results obtained at the United Nations Conference on the Environment  held at Stockholm in June  1972. We know that our natural resources are not unlimited and that the search for growth at any price can have extremely grave long-term consequences. In asking nations to protect and improve the common heritage  we must endeavour to seek genuine growth but also to protect the human element. It is therefore urgent to find a way of reconciling the immediate legitimate interests of mankind with the protection of the interests of succeeding generations.208.	In recent years  the United Nations and its affiliated international organizations have assumed new tasks which the authors of the Charter of San Francisco could not foresee  and thus the very structure of the Organization and the co-ordination among the various organs have become more and more complex. I therefore believe that the time has come to re-examine this evolution as a whole in order to make the necessary improvements while maintaining the central and co-ordinating role which the Charter has entrusted to the Economic and Social Council.209.	I have very briefly tried to express the views of my Government about some of the problems now confronting the United Nations. The achievement of a better world community is an extremely difficult task whichcalls for the full co-operation of all nations. I trust that the efforts of the present session will bring us closer  under your guidance  Mr. President  to that noble goal."
"71",4330,"MAR",28,1973,"﻿83.	Mr. President  I am very pleased to be-able to add the congratulations of the Moroccan delegation to those that have already been addressed to you. The Assembly's choice this year with regard to its presidency is a manifestation of the general esteem and respect that you have acquired in the course of a long career  a goodly part of which has been in the service of this Organization. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Brazil stated at the opening of this session on behalf of the whole of Latin America [2124th meeting  para. 2] it is the expression of a pride which we share with him and which he has voiced on behalf of us all with spontaneity and talent.84.	Since the United Nations displays the truth of its universalise character and its enrichment through diversity every year  it must congratulate itself on being able to count three new Members with differing political heritages and political and cultural horizons. The Moroccan delegation welcomes with sincere satisfaction the delegations of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic and hopes to develop and expand the most cordial and extensive cooperation with these delegations.85.	But if each admission of new Members is in itself a source of satisfaction for the United Nations  may I be permitted to say that there are cases where such an admission assumes the dimensions of an event that is rich in significance both historical and political. The admission of the two German States is one of them. The whole of the post-war period has been marked for Europe and for the world by the complexity of the German question  and Europe and the rest of the world have had to display much courage  political intelligence and patience in order to save  —  on numerous occasions  and sometimes at the very edge of the precipice — the peace and international security which the confrontation between East and West  particularly in connexion with Germany  have been endangering at every moment. The long diplomatic path that has led to the present happy stage is a positive sign of the reality of a certain detente  first in Europe and also in other parts of the world. We are gratified at this turn of events for the German nation and the two States representing it  with which Morocco is maintaining relations of profound friendship and mutually advantageous co-operation. We are happy in this respect also for Europe  where Morocco has on two occasions lost many of its sons and thus cannot fail to be legitimately concerned for its destiny. We are gratified also at the peace  whose fragility we have felt so frequently both on the Rhine and on the Elbe  consolidation of which in Europe today should make it possible to hope for its extension to other regions of the world where it is still only a desire.86.	If the itinerary that has been followed in the efforts towards detente during the whole of this quarter-century has for some been limited to the brilliant encounters of Peking  Moscow  Paris and Washington  it is in fact a long process in which  for a long time and at serious risk  certain countries have participated — countries whose contributions for safeguarding peace were no less efficacious even though patient and discreet. The policy of coexistence and non-alignment — the only possible policy for all those for whom the confrontation of the two blocs ran the risk of affecting their sovereignty  compromising their independence or affecting their territorial integrity — was not only a defensive policy involving the preservation of their own interests  but a policy of intervention on the world scene every time that the great Powers were unable to emerge from a crisis save through a move that might lead them towards war. And if today it is necessary to say that the great Powers have rescued peace in Peking  Moscow  Paris and Washington  it must be recognized that others  too  have saved peace when it was indeed endangered in Indochina  Berlin  Suez and Cuba. .The detente is in fact the result of all these efforts  which since 1947 to this day have converged  despite different approaches  towards the primary importance of dialogue and of its prevalence over confrontation and conflict.87.	If the flowering of this atmosphere of detente is the result of the common efforts of all the forces favouring peace  its strengthening and its effective translation into new international realities must even more so be the common task of all. The tranquillity  however relative and fragile  which prevails today in international relations has engendered sufficient hope for the action of the leaders of the world to be the subject of vigilant attention and for their responsibility to be submitted to the most rigorous scrutiny and judgement.88.	No conscience  however lofty it may be  and however satisfied it may be over its action for peace  can today claim total tranquillity as long as this peace is limited essentially to arrangements which preserve only national interests  however respectable these may be  to the exclusion. even temporarily  of the imperatives of a generalized peace applied to all continents taken together. The most determined optimism over the relaxation of the world crisis still conflicts in reality with a picture of the international situation which is not entirely a rosy one.89.	Of course  the improvement in relations among the great Powers engenders hope  inasmuch as their antagonisms have been an essential source of tension. It is also true that certain regions of the world  torn by conflicts which  directly or indirectly  engaged their interests as Powers  today are finding tranquillity and dialogue  which have now replaced war. It is also true that certain countries divided by considerations which are not of their own making are progressively finding certain objective conditions which are bringing their peoples towards this fundamental virtue of seeking their national unity in spite of all the vicissitudes. As we look back at recent history we must view this new situation as immense progress.90.	But is this sufficient reason for proclaiming everywhere  on all occasions  that peace has arrived  when numerous regions of the world continue to be denied even the first signs of it? Who can deny that the situation in the Middle East remains a major obstacle towards an improvement of the present atmosphere in international relations? Peace-building is certainly an enterprise that requires sustained effort and long patience  and progress towards a solution presupposes the progressive elimination of all obstacles of so-called secondary importance. But it is difficult to admit that there is a hierarchy of peace and that certain peoples deserve it on a priority basis  while others must resign themselves to a tragic destiny until better times arrive.. The political and diplomatic impasse in which the Middle East situation has bogged down and the attitude of semi-indifference on the part of the great Powers vis-4-vis this situation  may tend to substantiate the thesis that peace can be a tangible reality only because it remains at the level of the higher interests of the great Powers. The Middle East crisis seems to be held in abeyance and seems to serve as a test-tube in which experiments would be conducted concerning some sort of formula for detente or common harmony. But any crisis situation that does not improve only worsens  by the very nature of things.92. The persistence of Israel in its refusal to implement a single one of the United Nations decisions  the constant reinforcement of its military potential  and the measures of all kinds aimed at the permanent organization of life in the occupied Territories and the entrenchment of Zionist immigration into-Arab lands are factors not likely to facilitate the pursuit of a peaceful solution.93.	So in whose interest is it to allow this situation to deteriorate? If one were to analyse the various political and moral responsibilities within the international community  one would realize without any difficulty that our Organization has constantly condemned Israeli aggression  rejected the principle of the acquisition of territory by violence  and has called for the evacuation of such territories.94.	The efforts made by the representative of the Secretary- General  the Secretary-General himself  the Security Council and the General Assembly  are still treated with contempt by the Israeli authorities. Israel  whose propaganda is based essentially on the beguiling of international opinion  cannot today boast of having any favourable audience or of finding indulgence or understanding in world public opinion.95.	The OAU  basing itself on its experience in the struggle against colonialism and racism  has finally torn away this veil of lies that Israel had tried to spread over the African continent  where today it can rely only on South Africa and Rhodesia  which constitute with it the last alliance of the racist regimes. The OAU has memorably celebrated its tenth anniversary by its unanimous condemnation of Israel and support of the Arab cause.96.	Elsewhere  more than 70 States  gathered last month in Algiers and  representing all the peoples of the world  all systems of government and all ideologies  indicated  in a unanimous  unequivocal resolution  their support for the Arab cause because it is the cause of right  justice and peace.97.	If the whole of the conscience of the world  organized in various world-wide or regional institutions  is thus united in proclaiming the primacy of law and justice  where  then  is the force that is still blocking this profound desire for peace in the Middle East? What more is required before we consider that it is urgent to begin a serious pursuit of peace? Unfortunately  the same conditions are still present in that region and the slightest spark may ignite a war which  in any case  will not be like the one in 1967.98.	And yet  are the great Powers  which either cannot or do not wish yet to impose peace on that region  likely to be able to prevent war for much longer; and  if so  for how long?99.	The Palestinian people has now crossed the threshold and has taken its destiny into its own hands. Its resolve to fight until final recognition of its legitimate rights is every day taking different forms  and neither Israel nor its allies are today unaware of the dimensions which the direct fight of the Palestinian people has brought into the complexity of the problem.100.	In the face of this situation  which they can only confront squarely  the Arab States and the Palestinian people have often proved that the constraints of war can still leave room  however modest it may be for the time being  for the sincere search for a peaceful solution that would be in keeping with justice and dignity.101.	In certain circles  people are still hoping that time is working for them; but if time belongs to those who know how to use it  the Arabs have also learned  although at their own expense  that time could be one of the other means still at their disposal.102.	The idea that a hotbed of war or tension does not remain indefinitely under control in a region at the level one wishes to maintain it is shared by the peoples of the Middle East  because they have lived this truth throughout the whole of their history  a history that has been highly active. The Middle East crisis  whether it remains latent or proceeds towards an escalation or a peaceful solution  brings about political change in other parts of the world adjacent to it.103.	Would it be possible  for instance  to speak reasonably today of the strengthening of peace in Europe if the Mediterranean basin in the east as well as the west remains the centre of a conflict which is undermining a well- understood concept of European security and economic and cultural co-operation among all the coastal countries of that basin?104.	If the destiny of Europe has been historically influenced at Poitiers  in Pomerania  on the Rhine  on the Elbe or on the Moskva River  it has also been influenced  with equally important consequences  and sometimes even the most felicitous ones  around the Mediterranean.105.	Similarly  the destiny of the Arab world has been played out not entirely around the Tiber or the Euphrates  at Acre or at Fez  but also in Anatolia  in Sicily  on the plains of Spain or on the other flank of the Pyrenees.106.	The elements of the contemporary world around the Mediterranean  although they are different in some of their manifestations  have in no way altered in their profound realities the geopolitical or economic foundations of this historic interpenetration.107.	This analysis is the basis of the direct or global interest which Morocco has with its neighbours of this sea in Europe's efforts to try to strengthen its security and ensure fruitful co-operation between the States of the continent.108.	We are happy that the Committee of Co-ordination of the Helsinki Conference has agreed that non-European Mediterranean countries should be invited to express their interest in co-operation with Europe and to display their concern for the indivisible security of the whole of this region. France and Spain were good enough to submit Morocco's request with sympathy and support  since both these countries were aware with us that our historical intimacy  our cultural and economic ties and the imperatives of security on both sides of the western Mediterranean would meet legitimately the interest of Morocco in the security and development of good relations in the region.109.	It is highly desirable — and we continue to hope this with all our hearts — that all our relations with Spain be finally freed from any controversy  the removal of which is not an unrealizable ambition for two countries and peoples that are so close to each other.110.	We had hoped  and rightly  that at a time when  after the fashion of numerous countries of other parts of the world  we had extended authority over territorial waters where our interests had long suffered  Spain  a powerful and prosperous country  would understand the desire of a country which is trying to take stock of its resources and is mobilizing them all in the service of a people legitimately aspiring to its own development  first of all through the use of its own resources. Other countries  although opposing the legitimacy of such a decision  have accepted our offers of co-operation within a framework where our sovereignty prevails.111.	The attitude of the Spanish Government — and we profoundly regret this — creates a situation where all must exercise a vigilance that is constantly put to the test in order to avoid incidents within our territorial waters  where there is always a risk of confrontation between a modest navy which is protecting its national waters and a belligerent fleet which considers it has to protect  in its own way  fishing boats that are there without any legal basis. Both of us are aware of this danger  and I hope that we shall be able to avoid it if  given our will for certain co-operation  we shall first find respect for our national sovereignty.112.	In the presence of all the fundamental and real factors which contribute to the establishment of exemplary relations between Spain and ourselves  we are attempting on our side  with good faith and with considerable patience  to arrive at an identical or concordant comprehension concerning the style and the method for the decolonization of the Sahara.113.	It is a known fact that my country has solemnly proclaimed here  as well as in other international forums  that it was in favour of the principle of self-determination for the populations of that Territory. Spain has supported that principle and in 1969 voted in favour of the resolutions of this Organization which referred to this as the necessary way to decolonise that Territory.114.	However  periodically the Spanish Government promulgates laws which modify the structures of the Territory and its status  while proclaiming that such measures are merely stages which advance the Territory towards the desired goal of self-determination. On 22 September last the Spanish Government again promulgated another series of measures in the same spirit.115.	Yet  if the Government of Spain were to adopt the same decisions with the co-operation of the United Nations  as called for in numerous resolutions  the prudence of our Organization would doubtless have guaranteed the finality of such measures and the genuine freedom of the expression of the will of the peoples. In admitting that these measures  in their formulation  might constitute progress  Spain's suspicion with regard to co-operation with the United Nations is legitimately upsetting the confidence that it called for from us and that we were prepared to grant it in good faith in a framework which excludes initiative on the part of the administering Power alone.116.	If my last words concern decolonization and if I expect to be brief on the subject  it is essentially out of deference to President Gowon of Nigeria  the acting President of OAU  who was good enough to agree to come himself and present before the United Nations the preoccupations of the African continent as a whole in regard to the persistence of colonialism and the increasingly clear trends of the strengthening of the racist regimes upon our continent.117.	In Africa now there is a fact that cannot escape either our Organization or international public opinion — even less the last adherents of colonialism and racist regimes. This is the existence of an open fight by all the peoples that are still dominated in Africa  who are taking their destiny into their own hands because they see they are obliged to follow the narrow road of a most arduous but most worthy fight for freedom.118.	This fight has brilliantly led to the demonstration of what can be achieved by the will of a people which at the beginning of this summer was still called as rebellious and which some 40 States have recognized in a few days as the first manifestation of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau.119.	This twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly  which coincides with the tenth anniversary of OAU  could not have any better introduction than to remind it that peace cannot redound to the benefit of certain peoples and not confer the same benefit on other peoples whose courage entitles them to live  without delay  in dignity and freedom."
"72",4426,"MDG",28,1973,"﻿101.	O temporal O mores! We could not have found a better place than this nor could we have selected a better occasion than this to take up again this cry of alarm  more than 20 centuries after Cicero  in view of the present way social  political and economic world mores are developing.102. By your leave  may I first recall here  by way of explaining our attitude  a text which is well known and reads as follows:""We  the peoples of the United Nations  determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind  andto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small  andto establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained  andto promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom and for these endsto practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours  andto unite our strength to maintain international peace and security  andto ensure  by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods  that armed force shall not be used  save in the common interest  andto employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish these aims"".Thus our elders express themselves in the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations  which was signed on 26 June 1945.103.	It is true that there is many a slip 'twixt cup and lip. And this may continue to be so as long as nations remain what they are.104.	It is true also that the history of mankind has always been that of a permanent struggle between the wisdom and the folly of men. But more than at any other time in history  we consider that today it is essential that one day man brings his wisdom up to the level of his power if he wishes to save the world.105.	O temporal O mores! That cry alarm is amply justified by the lowering of morals in the present-day world. The mind of any thinking man is completely disturbed at the present time. It would seem  as has been frequently said  that the origin of this unusual mental crisis should be seen as the giddy  almost anarchic  development of technology and science  which enslave the men they were designed to serve. And they have engendered a consumer society which makes man more selfish  which reinforces the egocentricity of nations and exacerbates the excessive cult of material wealth and the desperate search for profit.106.	Man is disoriented by so much immoderation and has sought evasion in many ways. Hence  we have a excessive consumption of all sorts of stimulants such as alcohol  drugs  erotic films and pornography  sexual perversion  excess of speed  bright lights and noise. All these are factors which favour the decline of morality and the increase of criminality.107.	Man  now appears  because of the progress of science  to be capable of a number of technological achievements and of responding to all the technical problems that exist; but he is so lamentably disarmed in the face of purely human problems such as racism  hunger  the environment  social justice  peace. Our technical civilization seems even to have further complicated these problems without having been able to give human wisdom new means of resolving them.108.	O temporal O mores! That cry is also amply justified in the face of our incapacity to resolve international political problems.109.	Let us take a look together at the situation of our Organization  without flattering ourselves. Theoretically  the United Nations should be resorted to whenever any serious crisis appears on the international scene. Unfortunately  we must painfully recognize that the role of the United Nations and of international organizations remains a desperately secondary one.110.	Just as it was between the two world wars  when major conflicts such as the war in Spain  the Japanese attack against China  the aggressions of Nazi Germany  were not submitted to the League of Nations  similarly no decisive role was played by the United Nations in settling the two Viet-Nam wars  the conflicts in Nigeria and in Pakistan  or even the Cuban crisis. But even worse  the resolutions of the United Nations on the Middle East  particularly the well-known resolution 242 (1967) of the Security Council  have remained a dead letter.111.	Israel spurns the decisions of our Organization — this very Organization which gave birth to it — emboldened by the support which it invariably finds from certain great Powers.112.	Resolution 242 (1967)  once we supported it with the ultimate degree of verbal vehemence  allayed our consciences. It is not even put into effect! And even if it were put into effect  it would not solve the fundamental problem  which it completely overlooks  namely  the inalienable right of the Palestine people to existence and self-determination.113.	In the course of a television programme  two French broadcasters imagined a tourist poster for Israel for the year 2000  which would read:""Visit Israel and its pyramids.""114.	What appears to us as an artists' joke is perhaps already a definite plan in the minds of the international Zionists if we are not careful  as would seem to be suggested by the present gradual annexation of the West Bank through the confiscation of land by the Israeli Government  the purchase of lands by para-State organizations  such as the KKL (Jewish National Fund) and other private land speculations and transactions.115.	This is also suggested by the geometric progression of the area covered by Israel since its creation in 1948.116.	In fact  the evanescence of the responsibilities of the international community  the notorious impotence of the United Nations  the arrogance of power  State terrorism or preventive reprisals — which are  by the way  a concept inadmissible in international law — the occupation of foreign territories and the colonization of those territories  repression of civilian populations  denial of the rights of the disinherited Palestinian people  whose only choice is to resort to violence in the face of a self-satisfied and intransigent power  the impatience of the Arab peoples who have been despoiled and who object to the fait accompli of the occupation of their territories by force — all the conditions exist for a new armed confrontation  with incalculable consequences for international peace and security.117.	Are we finally going to react in the proper way to prevent a conflagration which might well involve our planet's catching fire?118.	At the risk of disappointing some and shocking others — because sometimes things have to be said if we really wish to get out of an impasse — this is how we have tried to grasp the complex problem of the Middle East.119.	The Larousse dictionary gives the following definition of Palestine:""A country in the Middle East between Lebanon in the north  the Dead Sea in the south  the Mediterranean in the west and the Syrian desert in the east. It is a narrow strip of land between Lebanon and the sea  and the Jordan River runs through it.""The same Larousse gives the following definition of Israel —  of course  it depends on the edition one reads:""Israel comprises that part of Palestine where the Jewish population is predominant  but its frontiers  which are the result of an armistice  are arbitrary"".Thus  at first blush  juridically speaking  the State of Israel is-without frontiers and does not exist.120.	We said last year  and repeat today  that we have nothing against the Jews. The sufferings that they endured are sufficiently repellent for them still to be fresh in our memories.121.	However  we are trying objectively to analyse the facts and to arrange them logically and consistently.122.	Representatives are aware of the Projekt Madagaskar of Hitler that Theo Denneker addressed to Rademacber in August of 1940. It was a question  no more and no less  of deporting 4 million Jews to Madagascar  At that time there were 3.8 million Malagasies  and this would have turned our island into a vast concentration camp  an enormous Jewish homeland.123.	I do not think I am mistaken when I affirm that the Malagasy people — which has never accepted colonialism since the time of the Menalamba and the Vy Vato Sakelika  in 1947 and 1971-1972 to actual independence in 1973 —  would have had any different reactions from those of the Palestinians today. We therefore understand their plight.124.	As Mr. Pinhas Sapir himself said  ""Israel today occupies Arab territories not by force of law  but by the law of force""  and that is something that we could never accept and that prompts us to support the cause of the Arab countries.125.	But we must go further in our analysis of this puzzle.126.	By what absurd logic  by what strange aberration  did Balfour and Britain imagine that this strip of land  this narrow strip between Lebanon and the sea  could welcome millions of Jews previously scattered throughout the world  without subsequent expansion? How could they have conceived mutatis mutandis  that England could receive all Americans of British origin as well as all Europeans  Australians  New Zealanders  Rhodesians and Canadians of English lineage? How could they have imagined that a State like Israel  surrounded on all sides by hostile States  could live in any degree of stability or peace?127.	In fact  the reply is simple. The imperialists did not want peace in that region. And the reason is this: there are in that area of the Middle East vast supplies of oil.128.	But in this case would the Israelis  Palestinians and Arabs be only pawns in the hands of the great Powers? Would they be simply the tools of an underhanded struggle for economic domination of the area?129.	If that is so  the necessary conclusions must be drawn.130.	The situation is even more complicated because the Israeli population also grows according to a geometric progression; from the few tens of thousands which they were originally  they have now grown to several million  thanks to Jewish emigration from the four corners of the world  Thus we are simply witnessing a new form of settler colonization.131.	May we dare to carry our analysis to its logical conclusion by asking a simple question. What if the underlying reason for the creation of the State of Israel was simply the anti-Semitism of the great Powers? In that case we might risk the following reasoning: Europeans do not like Jews; Hitler was not able to carry out his ""final solution""; but since the Jewish question remains extant  the former anti-Nazi Powers found it more elegant and more useful for their long-term global strategy to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine.132.	That is why we say the Israelis must cease to be only an international problem. They should cease to be the simple tools of zionism and customers of arms dealers; they must look reality squarely in the face and try to understand the Palestinian people.133.	Turning now to the situation in southern Africa  we know as well as anybody that the resolutions of our Organization have changed nothing in the area. In point of fact  in that quarter of the world where it would be really indecent to speak of peace  security or justice — because they are conspicuous by their absence or  if they do exist  they are interpreted in a distorting mirror  unilaterally  in favour ofusurping minorities and of their near or distant allies — the situation remains the same.134.	The joint and archaic alliance of illegality  of usurpation  of apartheid and imperialism continues to oppress and dominate the peoples of that area  in scorn or ignorance of the black man and with a pathological taste for half truth  It continues to give social  political  economic and cultural relations the same hollow justification directly inherited from the nineteenth century  according to the notorious theory of ""continuity in evolution""  which could be called more accurately ""continuity in stagnation"".135.	Undo the increasingly threadbare cover of ""the defence of the free world""  this neo-colonialist  paternalistic  traditional or doctrinaire policy  though condemned in words  is in fact supported by the NATO Powers and the forces of capitalist imperialism.136.	It is in fact quite evident that southern Africa remains one of the last bastions of lost causes and of minorities who call themselves the torch-bearers of a ""civilizing mission"". And it is in the name of that mission that we see perpetrated every day outrages  summary executions  massacres such as the one at Wiriyamu  genocide in Mozambique — all with the silent complicity of some and the material assistance of others  and all against the background of United Nations paralysis.137.	We reject this alleged policy of appeasement consisting of an uninterrupted series of evasions based on a so-called differentiation among cases. In fact  such a policy could be justified only if we were to recognize the primacy of the inalienable rights of peoples over the dubious and uncertain right of States. On the basis of this last hypothesis  all is possible. Unfortunately  we are confronted with bad faith and inertia  which leads us to demand that an end be put to the sterile negotiations with South Africa concerning Namibia.138.	In South-East Asia  just as similar causes produce similar effects  the setting is different but the substance of the problem is the same.139.	In Indo-China we find ourselves faced with a striking example of a situation which some believed on the way to settlement following the Agreement of 27 January 1973 7 but one which carries within itself the seeds of a third war in Indo-China. The reasons for this precarious and ambiguous situation are varied: They are inherent in the very nature of the Agreement — this is an agreement which is fundamentally political but which has been thwarted by reservations that have served to encourage contractual agreements. They are inherent in the foreign interventions that continue in subtle forms  in the form  for instance  of ""civilian advisers"" to assist in the war effort in Viet-Nam and in the unjustifiable raids and bombardments and the scarcely disguised invasion of Cambodia  in support of regimes hardly to be called representative. These direct foreign interferences demonstrate in fact an unquenchable thirst for the maintenance of political and economic bastions  and thus the urge to dominate and the selfishness of certain Powers that still dream nostalgically of influence.140.	The solutions proposed in this context can be at best improvised and unrealistic.141.	The fundamental principles underlying a peaceful  just and lasting solution remain: equality of rights among peoples  as recognized by the Charter; the right of those same peoples to self-determination  and full respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.142.	Hence we hold it to be indispensable  first  that there be complete and genuine withdrawal of all forces of foreign intervention  whether in Indo-China  in Korea or in Cambodia; that the task of determining the conditions for participation in national and international political life be left to the peoples of those areas themselves  according to their own standards and not according to models imposed from outside; that the desire of those peoples to live in peace in accord with their own genius be recognized  so that they may live in a coherent society  not a society artificially held together or divided by any insincere allegiance to the sullied values of a foreign civilization; that an end be put to the chauvinism that has been elevated by some to a political principle  international in application but completely untenable because it runs contrary to the sovereignty of peoples.143.	Unless these conditions arc achieved and respected  security in the Indo-Chinese peninsula and in South-East Asia will remain precarious and illusory 144.	O temporal O mores! This feeling is further justified by our inability to ensure security throughout the world. The development and progress that have been achieved in weapons of mass destruction and the perfection of their means of delivery are such  in our time  that a generalized nuclear war seems  unless there is a miscalculation  highly improbable. The unleashing of a nuclear war by one or other of the super-Powers would inevitably end in genocide and collective suicide. All the great Powers can do now is engage in so-called ""conventional"" warfare. It is curious that the term ""conventional"" is used to describe a war that is so unconventional. In any case  a limited  classic type of war among great Powers  despite all the theories of ""flexible response"" or other theories  run the risk  in accordance with the ""domino theory""  of rapidly developing into a generalized nuclear war. We all know that no interest from now on is sufficiently great to justify such a holocaust. Consequently  the great Powers are forced to reach agreement. It is the end of the cold war and the beginning of detente.145.	Thus the great Powers have become aware of the absurdity of their struggle and the sterility of their direct military confrontation. And thus we see yesterday's enemies renouncing what divided them  looking for things they have in common so that they may join forces and collaborate. This is true of Germany and Italy  which come into the Common Market beside Great Britain  Belgium  France and the Netherlands. This is the case of the United States of America  of Japan and of the Soviet Union  which are already beginning to co-operate beyond their ideological divisions. But since the political interests of the great Powers are not yet entirely identical  they wage war by proxy  with the third world in between. At any rate  they have to sell their armaments and keep their arms factories going.146.	This is why we welcome  as we should  the efforts made by the Europeans in the field of organizing theirsecurity  for this approach to the problem is in fact in accordance with the aims and principles of the Charter. It responds  furthermore  to European concerns and  where their interests are identical with those of others  to the concerns of all peoples.147. But in spite of all  we cannot refrain from a certain scepticism in more general terms. In point of fact  the tendency of the great Powers and the super-Powers to negotiate among themselves has not improved or guaranteed in any absolute way the security of small and medium-size nations. The organization of co-operation  as we see it now in its exploratory and preliminary stages  may be carried out without the third world  at the latter's expense or even against its interests. The great Powers and the superpowers seem to be turning toward a consolidation of their positions and their respective advantages. Is it not  furthermore  symbolic and is it not one of the great paradoxes of our times  that the same small countries that previously were so noisily demanding the end of the cold war are today beginning to denounce the Russian-American rapproachement  which they regard as collusion? In the face of this contradiction between intentions and interpretations — a completely normal and healthy reaction on the part of a world disabused because often abused — it will be necessary  we believe  as the Preamble to the Charter tells us  to reaffirm and make real the equality of the rights of States through collective steps in connexion with security and international co-operation  and to create a new  more egalitarian order among peoples  large  medium-sized  or small  which would be tantamount to internationalizing social justice.148.	Let us now turn to disarmament. We are  of course  gratified that a bipartite agreement has been reached between the Soviet Union and the United States on the prevention of nuclear war.8 But here again we cannot give way to unqualified jubilation. That agreement does not in particular solve  in a global way and with respect for the sovereignty and equality of all States  large  medium-sized or small  the problem of the diversification of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction or their stockpiling  nor does it solve the problem of nuclear testing. In this connexion  we expect the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to produce more positive results; otherwise security may well turn out to be an illusion. Military disengagement  the withdrawal of foreign troops and the liquidation of bases on foreign soil remain very much on the agenda  and progress achieved in these areas remains marginal.149.	The small and medium-sized Powers  particularly those that are peripheral and belong to no alliance or military pact  feel rather frustrated by the role of mere spectators to which they have been relegated. Since disarmament is something that concerns us all  and not only the superpowers and the military blocs  we are more than ever convinced of the need to create conditions that will be propitious for the achievement of complete and immediate disarmament.150.	The creation of zones of peace similar to that which is planned for the Indian Ocean would undoubtedly be one ofthe instruments which we could use to achieve our goals of disarmament  peace and security. Actually  in the case of the Indian Ocean  the creation of a zone of peace will make it possible: for the countries concerned to get together in order to establish co-operation based on genuine mutual trust; to outlaw the present race  which in fact draws heavily on the theory of spheres of influence; to utilize the human and material resources of the countries in that area for purely peaceful purposes; to guarantee independence and the genuine sovereignty for those countries without risk of direct of indirect interference.151.	But  again  there is many a slip 'twixt cup and lip  because the great Powers are putting forward the following objections to this generous and peaceful project: first  that the zone of peace might impede freedom of navigation on the high seas  and secondly that this liberty is generally recognized and will be defined at the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.152.	That is why certain great Powers advocate  purely and simply  that the creation of zones of peace should await the convening of the Conference of the Law of the Sea — as if the freedom of the high seas and its exercise were incompatible with the desire for peace of the peoples of that area  and as if they did not know that the conclusions of that Conference will be legal and economic in nature and thus will not in any way take precedence over the collective political will of the littoral countries of the Indian Ocean.153.	As far as we are concerned  last year we announced that the emergence of Madagascar to full sovereignty and to completely national and international responsibility make it imperative henceforth that it play fully the role which belongs to it in that part of the Indian Ocean where it is located.154.	How has the Malagasy Government tried to live up to this role? First  by creating conditions for genuine national independence in all areas: the creation of an autonomous currency and central bank; the adoption of an outward-looking policy of friendship with all; the severance of alienating links with foreign countries  particularly with South Africa; and the evacuation of foreign troops and bases from its territory.155.	The last two points should be particularly emphasized and analysed. In point of fact  by eliminating foreign bases and troops from its soil and by refusing to join the Southern Defence Pact  Madagascar has contributed in a significant way to creating a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean area  a position which is in accordance with the desires of non-aligned countries.156.	The Malagasy Government has taken its place on the world scene particularly by being more active in international affairs — with the non-aligned countries  in OAU  in the United Nations and so on. Thus the Malagasy Government is helping liberation movements in Africa and elsewhere. It welcomes the proclamation of the independence of the former Portuguese colony of Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands  It considers that that new State is juridically and morally entitled to international recognition and to participate in our work  if our Organization intendsto remain faithful to its ideals of freedom  progress and justice.157. The Malagasy Government considers that the solution of the Korean problem depends on the determination of the Korean people itself to diminish tension and internal friction  to promote co-operation in all areas  to forge awareness of a common destiny  as set forth in the proposals of the North Korean Government  which we entirely support.J58. The Malagasy Government also recognizes the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia as the only .legitimate and legal Government  and supports the idea of the urgent need to restore in the United Nations and its system the rights of the Cambodian people to be represented by a Government free from any form of dependence or foreign allegiance.159.	It also recognizes  with some 40 other States  that the Provisional Revolutionary Government of Viet-Nam is the authentic representative of the South Viet-Namese people. The Government and the people of Madagascar can never forget that they in fact owe their present independence to the heroic struggle of the Viet-Namese people; to the historic ""No"" of the fraternal people of Guinea; and to the brave combat waged by the dauntless people of Algeria.160.	The Malagasy Government has followed with some sympathy the experience of the Government of Popular Unity of Chile. The policies of Salvador Allende were in accordance with the aspirations of the people  which has long been enslaved and frustrated by the alliance of reactionaries and monopolists. We pay a tribute to Mr. Allende  his courage  his honest and universal vision  and his universalism in the defence of genuinely independent nations and completely liberated peoples.161.	Finally  the Malagasy Government is making its voice heard in international bodies on questions of monetary reform and in the Economic and Social Council  particularly on questions relating to the environment and the law of the sea.162.	Thus we consider that the concept of the continental shelf and the definition which has been suggested are valid only for the great Powers. In point of fact  the criterion of the 200-metre isobath for the delimitation of the continental shelf is not applicable to a number of countries of the third world. The hydrography of that area has either not been carried out at all or has been done in summary fashion. Furthermore  there are a number of countries which have no or very little continental shelf. For example  a few miles from our coast one frequently finds the abyssal depths. Consequently  we would prefer the idea of an exclusive economic zone based on a distance  rather than a depth  criterion.163.	With regard to the idea of the territorial sea  here again our position has been dictated by our desire to adapt everything to the realities instead of submitting to decisions imposed from outside. Up to now  the great Powers have determined the breadth of this territorial sea on the basis of cannon range. Thus  they adopted three nautical miles; and then — we do not know why or how — they decided toincrease that distance to 6 and then 12 miles  —  perhaps because the range of their ordnance grew accordingly. Nevertheless  at a time of intercontinental ballistic missiles and rockets  the criterion of the range of armaments for the delimitation of territorial waters no longer makes any sense 164.	For a small island country such as ours  we prefer to choose another criterion in delimiting that area. Since we wish to protect  in so far as possible  our island from any possible intrusion  landing or invasion  we chose the concept of the time it takes for us to summon our coastal or air forces. That is why the Madagascar Government decided to increase the breadth of its territorial waters to 50 nautical miles  starting from the baseline  and the exclusive economic zone to 150 miles  starting from the same point.165.	O temporal O mores! Our pessimism is finally justified by the iniquitous organization of present international economic relations. The political liberation of all continents is being achieved. But this political liberation could only be a delusion if it were bereft of any economic content.166.	All delegations here stress as a Leitmotiv that the growing gap between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots"" may seriously compromise international peace and security.167.	We feel it is our duty to reaffirm that underdevelopment is not backwardness in development. It is  more or less  the result of an historical process — colonial and then neo-colonial exploitation by means of which developed countries empty the economies of the poor peripheral countries of their substance.168.	Some euphemistically describe this colonial depredation as ""deterioration in the terms of trade"". It remains true that pillage of the resources of the third world continues in ever-more subtle forms. That is why these so-called developing countries are actually under-developing countries. They are in a state of perpetual under-development because the conditions which brought about this situation are continually recurring.169.	An eminent person said that development is now the new name of peace.170.	But we refuse categorically to follow those who support development by incantation  as if it were sufficient to speak about development for it to materialize. ""Disarmed laws""  said Cardinal de Retz  ""are not to be respected"". To overcome under-development we have to dismantle the whole machinery and bring about a drastic transformation in relations between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots"" and also in the social relationships existing in our countries.171.	To decolonize  to democratize  to make more moral international relations and trade is  of course  excellent; but we know that States never willingly renounce their interests. It is up to us  the countries of the third world  to force the rich countries to accept our points of view. We have the material ways and means of imposing the ideas which we believe are fair  since our countries contain in their soil and sub-soil the main natural resources of our planet  resources which are indispensable to the economic growth of the industrialized countries.172.	We have the opportunity to organize ourselves and to adopt clear options on the basis of our common interests  despite our differences in civilization  language  ideology  religion or political systems.173.	Furthermore  the developed countries themselves can set aside their differences and they do not hesitate to decide to sacrifice us to their strategies.174.	As far as we are concerned  we henceforth refuse to entertain that dichotomy  that Manichaean division of the earth into rival East and West blocs  That is no longer in accordance with reality.175.	As long as the developed countries have a common interest and a common goal — to assure their economic development  to the detriment of the poor countries — the world is naturally divided into two camps: the imperialist exploiters on the one hand and the exploited on the other. But as long as we are content to demand  to exhort  to make pressing appeals and to beg the great Powers to do certain things  we will not achieve results.176.	As long as the richer countries continue to freeze their assets in London  Paris  Bonn  New York and Tokyo  the sums which the imperialists then lend to us at very high rates  or use to finance and arm Zionist armies  although they could be used to hasten the development of the third world; as long as we are content to mouth words such as ""the freedom of peoples to determine their own destiny"" —  which is only  after all  the freedom granted by imperialism to Governments which dispose of our peoples as they will  Governments which are docile — without giving any genuine economic and cultural content to that liberty; as long as we former colonized peoples remain in the wake of Europe  by clinging to the Commonwealth  by following the French or the European Community  by joining regional organizations dominated by a particular great Power; as long as we have not understood  as the Europeans have  that our strength comes from organized unity; as long as we  the peoples of the third world  are content simply to ask the rich countries to stabilize the prices of primary commodities  whereas we have the means to get together to impose and fix ourselves the sale price of our commodities; as long as we do not assist each other in our struggle for economic liberation as we did in our struggle for political liberation  we  the countries of the third world  will always remain peoples who are mere objects  because the rich countries  the self-styled democracies  have not hesitated and will not hesitate to send colonial expeditions  such as those sent to Indo-China  Algeria  Suez  Mozambique and Angola. They will not balk at aggression and economic exploitation and they will let us have  at best  the crumbs of their unprecedented development.177.	Finally  it is obvious that our salvation will come from ourselves. We have to count on ourselves  rely on ourselves. We must not shuffle off our responsibilities onto others. We have to overcome our own weaknesses. It is a question of political will and determination.178.	Those were the anxieties and preoccupations contained in our cry  ""0 temporal O mores!"" I think  Mr. President  you will understand why we pay a heartfelt tribute to the competence  skill and devotion of your predecessor  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  a citizen of a great country which suffered particularly from war  racism and man's folly  who was able in such a masterly way to conduct the work of the twenty-seventh session.179: It is also fitting that we should wish the Secretary-General and all his co-workers to continue to serve with devotion the noble causes of our Organization  which  according to the words of the Secretary-General  should be ""a reliable instrument of world order and co-operation  accepted and respected by all Governments.""180.	But we are particularly happy to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your well-deserved election to preside over this twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. That  following the Fourth Conference of Heads of States and Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Algiers  the representative of Ecuador  a developing country  should be elected to the presidency of the General Assembly — you  Mr. Benites  with your experience of international affairs and the aptitude and objectivity which we know are part of your character — is for us small countries full of significance. We see it as an earnest of the fact that the problems of the developing countries  which have been left outside the deliberations of mankind  will be examined with all the attention they deserve  because those countries represent the overwhelming majority of our planet.181.	. We are pleased to offer you our entire co-operation  so that the work of this session will lead not only to a few more resolutions but also to concrete and significant results  so that the world may one day see wisdom victorious over man's folly."
"73",4509,"MEX",28,1973,"﻿1.	Mr. President  greeting you on behalf of the country that I have the honour to represent is not only the fulfilment of a routine  but it is a resumption of a personal dialogue and an official exchange that we started in Mexico  when you were Secretary-General of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America [OPANAL]  a post in which you  as usual  performed brilliantly. I therefore am fully aware of your ability and your capacity  which have justifiably placed you in the post of President of the twenty-eighth regular session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that you will fulfil your duties as President with the good judgement and calmness that you have always shown in your long career in different international bodies. I congratulate you most sincerely.2.	The breath of death sweeps America and the world as a whole. A cold spectre lowers over our continent. A champion of democracy who tried to achieve the redemption of the needy of his country has died.3.	A few days ago you yourself  Mr. President  in your inaugural statement mentioned your deeply felt conviction that the constitutional President of Chile was ""... a man who loved his people and defended his ideals with his blood and his life."" [2117th meeting  para. 40.]4.	We fully share that assessment. It is for that reason that we wish to pay a tribute to the memory of Salvador Allende  who died in the defence of freedom and social justice. This enlightened Head of State waged war without quarter to achieve the desires of his country. Perhaps for the first time  a real effort was made to achieve profound structural changes in the life of a nation heading towards socialism  while remaining within the democratic  legal and peaceful way of life. The entire world followed that new experiment with great interest  and a number of nations  with deeply-rooted hope. Today that hope has perished — even though the fervour and the love for the hero that fell will continue —  exactly as five years ago that noble effort of giving socialism a human visage died also.5.	My country believes that violence is not the answer  nor is the destruction of freedom. The President of Mexico himself put it: ""Any action adopted against a free people diminishes the total freedom of all  and thus inevitably affects us all.""6.	It would appear that at this tragic moment Chile has lost its best sons: Pablo Neruda is dead. When my country learned of the horrors in the La Moneda presidential palace in Santiago we invited the great poet of Isla Negra to reside in Mexico and restore his precarious health. The invitation was accepted  but  unfortunately  it could not be complied with.7.	We have always scrupulously respected that noble institution of Latin America  the right of asylum  quite irrespective of the ideology or political leanings of the one   persecuted. Thus the Mexican Embassy in Santiago opened its doors to all who felt themselves seriously threatened  anda good number of them are today on Mexican soil. We hope that the requirements of the existing inter-American agreements on this question will be strictly complied with  for we are convinced that the eyes of all the peoples of the world are now focused on Chile and are carefully watching the evolution of the situation  .8.	As far as the foreigners there are concerned  many of them refugees from other Latin American countries —    whose number has been assessed at approximately 14 000 —  we are encouraged by the information made public by the Secretary-General of the United Nations regarding his own efforts and those of other high international officials and regarding official safeguards offered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile.9.	However  the situation prevailing is still extremely grave. We are particularly concerned about the fate of the political prisoners for whose lives and freedom — within the framework of human rights — the General Assembly should continue to be alert and vigilant.10.	The situation prevailing in southern Africa continues to be intolerable. There the most elementary human rights are ignored because of the colour of a person's skin  and the practice of racial discrimination has been raised to the level of State policy. But  like peace  freedom is indivisible. While there are peoples subjected to colonialism or racial discrimination  men of good will cannot remain calm or satisfied. Our Organization must continue to struggle in order completely and definitely to eliminate colonialism in all its forms and manifestations  whether direct or indirect  whether political or economic. The Mexican delegation is ready to contribute to the study of measures that should be adopted to achieve that end 11.	I should like to congratulate the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on their admission to membership in our Organization. Thus our Organization is coming even closer to the effective fulfilment of the principle of universality. We trust that soon we shall be able to welcome equally those States that are not yet Members of the United Nations.12.	The International Law Commission has just celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of its existence. Its work has contributed greatly to the codification and progressive development of international law. A not unimportant portion of contemporary international law has now been incorporated in a number of treaties  thanks to its constant activity. I am very happy to extend our congratulations to that body on its praiseworthy efforts.13.	There are many items on the agenda of the present session of the Assembly that call for our particular attention. However  it would be impossible for us at the moment to examine them all. We shall have an opportunity to present our views on the majority of them when they come up for consideration in the relevant main Committees or in the plenary meetings of the Assembly. Therefore  I shall limit myself at this time to making known the views of Mexico on four of those items which  because of their ramifications and important implications  are of greater significance and  we believe  cannot be over-stressed: the law of the sea  disarmament  the Treaty of Tlatelolco and the charter of economic rights and duties of States.14.	The Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction  which has been preparing the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has just concluded its work in Geneva without having achieved significant agreement on substantive questions  such as the demarcation of the territorial sea  the nature and characteristics of the zone of national jurisdiction — which we have baptized the ""patrimonial sea"" — certain aspects of the delimitation of thecontinental shelf  and the regime to be applied to what has been called ""the common heritage of mankind"".15.	Doubtless that situation arose owing to the fact that all the efforts made were not sufficient to achieve agreements that are indispensable. We wonder  in these circumstances  whether we are in a position to start a conference on the date set by the General Assembly  or whether we might not be better advised to make a last effort that would allow us to go to that meeting with an adequate basis to work on.16.	In order to do so  we believe that the best procedure might well be the following: to inaugurate the Conference here  as provided  in the month of November; to hold an organizational and procedural session for a period of two weeks; to convene a preliminary meeting in which all States invited to the Conference would take part. The preliminary meeting could be held in March or April  either in New York or in Geneva; negotiations would concentrate on those problems that constitute the nub of the future law of the sea  leaving for July and August the task of elaborating the corresponding instruments.17.	We are convinced that  during the three years of preparatory work  although agreements have not been arrived at  nevertheless the essential basis of what might become the common concepts of a great number of countries has been laid. I refer to the new concept of the ""patrimonial sea""  as we  the countries which signed the Declaration of Santo Domingo 1 have called it  or the ""exclusive economic zone1'  as the Heads of State of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] have preferred to call it.18.	This concept includes two inseparable elements: a territorial sea with a maximum width of 12 nautical miles  over which the coastal State exercises full sovereignty  and a zone adjacent to the territorial sea and extending for a distance of 200 nautical miles.19.	In that oceanic zone the coastal State does not exercise sovereignty as it does over the territorial sea  since it must scrupulously respect the rights of all States  either coastal or land-locked  to the freedom of navigation and over flight and to the laying of submarine cables or pipelines. However  in that zone the sovereign rights of the coastal States would be recognized with respect to renewable and non-renewable resources that may be found in the water column  on the sea-bed and in the subsoil thereof  together with rights relating to the regulation of scientific research and the prevention of the contamination of the marine environment.20.	As was evident during the negotiations that have taken place  we believe sincerely that this new definition can satisfy the great majority of States.21.	Fortunately  this time we are not facing a position whereby the developing world is placed in confrontation with the highly industrialized countries. We have noted with satisfaction that the concept of an exclusive economic zone  or patrimonial sea  has been accepted and defended by members of both groups.22.	We are now approaching the middle of the decade which the General Assembly agreed in 1969 to proclaim as the Disarmament Decade [resolution 2602E(XXIV)]. At the same time  and with good reason  the Assembly emphasized the beneficial influence that this Decade could have on the strengthening of international security and on the encouragement of economic development.23.	We therefore find it inexplicable that the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament should once again come to this high body of the United Nations  just as it did last year  with empty hands.24.	We share the view expressed by many of its members  among them Mexico  and reflected in the 1973 report [A/9141-DC/236]  namely  that the primary responsibility falls on the two States that have been jointly serving as Chairmen of the Committee  and that there is no reason whatsoever that can justify the stagnation in the Committee's work or the present lack of effective negotiations.25.	It is now up to the Assembly to pass judgement and adopt decisions in order to remedy this disturbing situation concerning disarmament. As an illustration  it is sufficient to recall that nuclear arsenals exist that represent such a capacity of ""over-kill"" that they are more than sufficient to blot out  not once but many times over  every sign of life on this planet; that the amount annually squandered in military spending amounts to more than $220 000 million  in other words  a sum 30 times greater than the amount the developed countries are induced  with a great effort  to earmark annually in the form of official assistance for development; and that we are confronted with an unbridled arms race aimed at increasing the already terrifying destructive potential of nuclear weapons and designed to produce  among non-nuclear weapons  refinements of cruelty and indiscriminate extermination that must be inconceivable to any sound mind.26.	Among the decisions that the General Assembly should adopt  there should be one  we believe  unequivocally reaffirming that general and complete disarmament under effective international control — that same question which  first in 1959 [resolution 1378 (XIV)}  and for a second time 10 years later [resolution 2602 E (XXIV)]  the General Assembly itself described as the most important question facing the world today — continues to be  and must continue to be  the final goal of all the efforts of the international community in this sphere of action. Thus  too  it should be made perfectly clear that one of the primary stages to be achieved in order to reach that goal must be the destruction of the enormous stockpiles of nuclear weapons already accumulated  and a strict prohibition on any future resumption of their production.27.	Among those same decisions  we believe that there should be one involving also the approval of a number of resolutions calling for a total cessation of nuclear weapons tests and the elimination of all chemical weapons. These are two matters which  as the United Nations has so often repeated  warrant the highest priority.28.	The frustrating sterility of the negotiations in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament led Mexico  last February  at the beginning of the 1973 session of that body  to suggest an immediate examination of other subjects  first and foremost among them the reduction of military budgets. It is therefore natural that we should have been gratified at the formal request submitted by the Minister for Foreign Relations of the Soviet Union  Andrei Gromyko  that there be included in the agenda of the present Assembly session an item  the consideration of which might lead to an agreement among the permanent members of the Security Council making possible equitable reductions in their respective military budgets  together with the employment of the resources thus saved for assistance to developing countries [A/9191].29.	With regard to the machinery available to the United Nations for disarmament  the experience of the last two years has made apparent the urgent and unavoidable need to strengthen the only deliberative body — the General Assembly — which in practice has been functioning  and to reorganize thoroughly or to replace the negotiating body  namely the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament.30.	We are convinced that it is indispensable for us  at this session  to establish a body whose task will be to bring about the timely convening of a world disarmament conference at which all States will be able to set forth adequately their views on the problem of disarmament that so vitally affects the interests of all peoples. We venture to hope also that such a body  regardless of the name it may be given  should have a membership and terms of reference that will guarantee the co-operation of all the nuclear Powers  so that a repetition of the sad experience of the so-called Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference maybe avoided.31.	With regard to the negotiating body  we believe it would be advisable for the General Assembly  using whatever procedures it may deem appropriate  to explore without delay the question of what reforms in composition and in procedure should be recommended  so that the negotiating body on disarmament may be rendered more effective and  in particular  be able to count on the participation of all the nuclear Powers.32.	Quite contrary to what has been occurring in the rest of the world  in Latin America the regime of total absence of nuclear weapons set forth in the Treaty of Tlatelolco2 — for which the Government of Mexico has the honour of serving as depositary Government — has continued to progress and gain strength.33.	As a result of the discussions held by the President of Mexico with the Heads of State of the French Republic and the People's Republic of China in the course of the visit he made to both those countries in the spring of this year  the French Government decided to sign Additional Protocol II of the Treaty on 18 July last  and the Chinese Government did so on 21 August.34.	Those significant acts  which will doubtless be complemented in the near future by the corresponding ratifications  have strengthened the efficiency of the Treaty. In fact  it will be recalled that the nuclear Powers Parties to the Protocol committed themselves both to the obligation offully respecting the statute of denuclearization in respect to warlike purposes as defined in the provisions of the Treaty and pledged themselves not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against the contracting parties to the Treaty.35.	Since it is well known that the United Kingdom and the United States had already in the past acceded to the Protocol  the steps now taken by France and China mean that only one of the five nuclear Powers is still withholding its co-operation regarding the Latin American nuclear-weapon-free zone  the only densely populated zone thus far established as nuclear-free.36.	I take advantage of this opportunity to appeal to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to reconsider its attitude and to accept the obligations deriving from Additional Protocol II of the Treaty of Tlatelolco.37.	It might almost seem redundant  —  since they are so obvious  —  for us to stress the grave crises that afflict our world today  but we cannot complacently watch world inflation  the imbalance of the terms of trade  the food crisis  the absence of regulations governing the transfer of technology  the interventionist and unbridled attitude of a great number of transnational corporations  the lack of an adequate demographic programme  the lack of a balanced and generalized utilization of the resources of the sea and of a rational preservation of the environment. All those deplorable conditions are just so many serious problems which the United Nations must consider  and regulate —  and do so immediately.38.	To refer merely to what I might term the ""food crisis""  damaging meteorological phenomena  plagues  diseases  human carelessness and the irrational utilization of natural resources all depict a panorama of despair. In 1972 wheat production was limited to 300 million tons  that is to say  6 per cent less than the 1971 world harvest. For the present year the supply of rice has been termed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] as barely enough  in marked contrast to the abundant surpluses during the last three years. With regard to secondary cereals — corn  sorghum  millet  barley  oats and rye — it has been calculated that in 1972 their production amounted to 555 million tons  that is to say  20 million tons less than in 1971. Generally speaking  the reduction of food supplies has increased the demand and  therefore  caused a general rise in the cost of the majority of food products  They have also suffered very adversely from speculation and financial crises which have also aggravated the situation.39.	In the last few years the Mexican Government has stressed its foreign trade  seeking to promote and diversify our international economic relations. It was for this reason that we went to the Tokyo Ministerial Meeting to start new trade negotiations of a multilateral nature within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GAIT].40.	In the course of the GATT negotiations the fundamental concepts of non-reciprocity  non-discrimination and preferential treatment in trade relations of the developed countries with the developing countries were encouraged and advanced  so that the developing nations can enjoy fair and increased participation in world trade.41.	Mexico was also present at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund [IMF]  held from 24 to 28 September in Nairobi  Kenya. The Secretary of Finance and Public Credit  Mr. Jose L6pez Portillo  was selected as the spokesman for Latin America  and through him Mexico reiterated its traditional position concerning international monetary reform. He emphasized the fact that Latin Americans do not consider a reform complete unless it simultaneously and interrelatedly includes the transfer of real resources to the developing countries  at adequate rates and on adequate terms. One sentence by the Mexican Secretary of Finance summed up the philosophy that should underlie economic relations among nations. He said: ""The powerful countries belong to humanity and not humanity to the powerful countries.""42.	Aware of the problems and the crises afflicting our generation and threatening to continue with greater recurrence in the times through which our descendants will live  the President of Mexico  Mr. Luis Echeverria  sensing the feelings of all and consonant with the active foreign policy that his Government is pursuing  proposed to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] at its third session  held in Santiago  Chile  in April 1972  that there be prepared and approved a charter of economic rights and duties of States.3 The proposal was approved and transmitted to the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly  and the Assembly decided [resolution 3037 (XXVII)] that a group on 40 nations  to be designated by the Secretary-General of UNCTAD  Mr. Manuel Perez Guerrero  would devote itself to the noble task of drafting the charter. That group of 40 has earned our congratulations for its hard work. It has concluded its task and its report is now before the present session and is to be considered in the Second Committee.''43.	One extremely important point in the course of elaborating that charter is the fact that it was the subject of a special section of the Economic Declaration approved at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State and Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Algiers  at the beginning of September of this year. Section XIII reads:""The non-aligned nations deem it necessary that the United Nations General Assembly should give priority at its twenty-eighth session  to the elaboration of the Charter of economic rights and duties of States.""This document should give expression to the economic aspirations of countries struggling to achieve over-all development as well as those of the international community as a whole."" 44.	The manifest support given by the Heads of State and Government of so many varied and important countries present at that Conference of non-aligned countries comforts us greatly. We are also grateful for the express reference which was most constructively and positively made by the recently designated Secretary of State of the United States  Mr. Henry Kissinger  when he spoke of the charterof economic rights and duties of States. We should like also to express our appreciation to all the other representatives who have offered or may in the future offer their support for this initiative.45.	The hour to act has struck. Millions of people are concerned and worried or living in misery and want. The line of ""the hungry encircles the world. Technological progress is still the monopoly of a few. Many transnational corporations are continuing to disturb the situation. World inflation cruelly oppresses the developing nations and foodstuffs are lacking while populations are growing dangerously. The resources of the sea are being utilized indiscriminately by the great naval Powers. The environment is deteriorating  endangering human life. Are we to be imperturbable  indifferent and insensitive as we watch this increasingly terrifying situation? Are we going to allow succeeding generations — if they succeed in existing — to call us irresponsible?46.	The proposal of the Mexican President does not  and should not  belong exclusively to my country. It is a common cause. It is a generous and worthy undertaking of all mankind. Let us not allow routine or bureaucracy to delay  vitiate or damage that noble effort. Let us speed our procedures  come to agreements quickly — in a word  let us approve this indispensable document as soon as we can.47.	This great international pledge must contain  among other fundamental concepts  that of the right of States freely to dispose of their natural resources  to regulate and govern foreign investment  to participate in the international decision-making process in the solution of world economic and monetary problems and to share in the benefits resulting there from  and to participate in fair and balanced world trade 48.	We must also govern the obligation of States not to discriminate on the basis of political  economic or social systems  to introduce structural changes in the world economy in order to achieve an international division of labour that is just and rational  to facilitate the widest possible access to the benefits deriving from the progress and achievements in science and technology and to give technical and financial assistance in favourable conditions  and also the duty of all States to safeguard the common heritage of mankind and protect and improve the human environment.49.	If the Charter of the United Nations is primarily a political alliance for maintaining international peace and security  let the charter of economic rights and duties of States be an economic alliance that will unite us in progress and welfare. Once and for all  let us put an end to economic discrimination. Let there no longer be apartheid in the distribution of benefits. Let not poverty be a constant stimulus for revolution and war  Let us do away with what divides us. Let us exalt what unites us.50.	Greece left us an ethical heritage; Rome a legal one. The mediaeval era left us religion. The Renaissance left us aesthetics — and so on. Each generation has distinguished itself by leaving a fruitful heritage to its heirs. Our generation  that of the twentieth century  although it has been outstanding because of its prodigious technological progress  has also suffered two great world conflagrations and the threat of a third which  if it were to occur  would inevitably be the last. Are we incapable of leaving a more advantageous  more generous heritage to our succeeding generations?51.	Let us here and now prove that we have gone through this world  not leaving marks of violence and aggression  but giving birth to and creating a more just and more prosperous society."
"74",4604,"MLI",28,1973,"﻿72.	 The General Assembly of the United Nations is at present no doubt living through one of the gravest and most decisive moments in its existence. The events unfolding throughout the world  particularly in the Far East and in Africa  where injustice  arrogance and exploitation are regarded as rules of international conduct  clearly indicate that we must assume our responsibilities with all the equity and determination dictated by the situation. This session is therefore crucial  and that is why my delegation is happy to see that the Assembly has elected a political personality of Mr. Benites' wisdom to direct our work. You will all understand the satisfaction we feel as we congratulate him on his brilliant election to the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Through his august person we also convey our felicitations to his country and to the third world of which we are a part for their important contribution to strengthening the United Nations. We wish also to associate ourselves with the congratulations offered to his predecessor  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczyfiski  Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland  who conducted the debates of the twenty-seventh session with courtesy and great lucidity.73.	My delegation cannot  of course  overlook the efforts the Secretary-General continuously exerts in his search for peace.74.	The brave people of Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands have turned a new and glorious page in the history of the liberation of peoples.75.	Indeed  after a succession of decisive victories against the enormous military and industrial apparatus placed at the disposal of Portugal by its NATO allies so as to perpetuate its colonial domination in Africa  the People's National Assembly of Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands on 24 September 1973 proclaimed at Boe the independence of that country.76.	The sacrifice of our brother Amilcar Cabral was not made in vain. It is fitting to pay a tribute to the memory of that pioneer of independence of Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands  that authentic son of struggling Africa who was treacherously assassinated on 20 January 1973 by the executioners of the Fascist Lisbon Government.77.	We salute the birth of that new State. We welcome   that event as one of the most characteristic of our times. Itmeets one of the great hopes of peoples which love peace  justice and freedom.78.	It was perfectly normal for the people and Government of the Republic of Mali  which consider that victory to be their own  to recognize the State of Guinea- Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands immediately on the proclamation of their independence.79.	Indeed  the Head of State of Mali  in his message to his brother Francisco Mendes  the Chief Commissioner  said:""This historic act  which is a new victory of Africa against its foes  must make all African patriots more determined than ever to commit themselves resolutelyin the struggle against imperialism  colonialism  neocolonialism  racism and apartheid.80.	In inviting the representatives of the national liberation movements to participate in its work and in giving them assistance  the United Nations has acted in accordance with the trend of history. The people of Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands have confirmed that view. To be true to itself  our Organization must as soon as possible decide to admit that new State to membership.81.	Henceforth  any hostile act of the Fascist Lisbon regime against Guinea-Bissau or the Cape Verde Islands should be considered an attempt against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that State. The United Nations will then merely have to put into effect the appropriate provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter against the Portuguese Government.82.	It is a pleasant duty for my delegation to welcome to this Organization the worthy representatives of a brother State  the Bahamas. The people of the Bahamas has after a long struggle turned a new page in its history. We are happy to see it  and on behalf of the Government of Mali  I want to tender our heartfelt congratulations to the delegation of this State.83.	We are sure that the initiatives which were taken throughout the year by certain Powers to improve their relations contribute to creating a new international order  which thus must succeed the state of confrontation resulting from the cold war. It is to this process that we owe the restoration in 1971 of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China and the admission to the United Nations at the present session of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. These victories  which mark our difficult path towards the universality of the United Nations and which are indeed a triumph of reason and wisdom over the vanity of material power  are evidence that the peoples do not need tutelary power to accomplish their destinies.84.	The Government of Mali  true to its policy of non-interference in the domestic affairs of States  could of course only entertain the happiest relations with the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. The admission of these two States to the United Nations meets one of the warmest wishes of the international community  and we are very happy to see it.85.	The universality which I have just mentioned will of course have no real significance unless it is understood as a possibility for exchanging political  intellectual and moral values among nations.86.	The Preamble to the Charter reflects cardinal principles whose correct implementation would normally produce a better world. Since our moral  intellectual and material resources are such as to enable us to achieve this purpose  we should welcome every initiative and every action which commits the international community to this process.87.	Whether what is involved is protection of life  respect of human rights  the struggle against injustice  slavery and hatred or the right of peoples to live in decent economic and social conditions  the objectives of the Charter can only be fully met if they are consonant with the profound aspirations of the peoples on behalf of whom the Charter was adopted.88.	In fact the struggle for peace after the Second World War has been a continuous confrontation between the forces of progress and those forces which feel that they can continue to govern the world. The latter have found out the hard way that sacred and permanent values on which our society is based are so lofty that they can be temporarily ignored but can never be really destroyed. This reality should be sufficient in itself to establish the philosophy of greatness on the triumph of these values and not on the search for the means to destroy the human race.89.	To the impossibility of dehumanizing the world has now been added the futility of using weapons in the settlement of conflicts among States  and while we await the establishment of complete justice in the world  peace can be based only on the principles of the Charter  whose essence is based in turn on comprehension and tolerance among nations.90.	The progress which has been achieved towards detente  even though inadequate  nevertheless is a positive contribution to international relations  and we must now not only continue this tendency but also orient it so as to give it a universal character and thus prevent the explosion of anger of the peoples who have been so frustrated in their aspirations to freedom and progress.91.	If peace requires genius and if genius requires patience  we can only welcome the conclusion of the cease-fire in Viet-Nam  the cessation of the bombings in Cambodia  the conclusion of the agreement on the repatriation of the Pakistani military and civilian personnel  the conclusion and implementation of the agreement on the formation of a coalition government in Laos  the continuation of negotiations on co-operation and security in Europe  the improvement of co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union and the development of the relationships between the United States and the People's Republic of China.92.	The signature in Paris on 27 January 1973 of the agreement on the cease-fire in Viet-Nam  has officially put an end to 18 years of military commitment by the United States in that country  and it is indeed a victory of the heroic people of Viet-Nam  which has written some of the most glorious pages in the history of the liberation of peoples. It has shown once again that faith in human dignity and the nobility and greatness of the nation is not to be destroyed by any weapons  no matter how powerful. The authentic representatives of that country have already taken their place among their comrades in the same struggle among the non-aligned nations  while we await their appearance among us here.93.	We can only hope that the Paris Agreement  which was concluded after an objective analysis of the political and social realities in Viet-Nam  will be really applied by all the interested parties in accordance with the spirit which presided at its signature.94.	We can only hope that the search for a false subcontinental balance will not prompt Thieu and his masters to repeat the acts which were condemned by the universal conscience and which were so contrary to the appropriate provisions of the Charter.95.	We pay a tribute to the Viet-Namese people for having overcome aggression and at the same time having established the political and social structures of the nation.96.	Asia  like the rest of the world  aspires to peace. The success which was achieved in Viet-Nam and the formation of a coalition government in Laos are preludes to a political and social stabilization in the Far East  and this will allow  if these agreements are kept  a reconstruction of the nations which have suffered so much in that region of the world.97.	Peace which is imposed by the force of arms alone is fearsome as such  because it contains the seeds of its own destruction. Indeed the very timid agreements which were achieved among the super-Powers cannot really reassure us  because the mad arms race is continuing  and the spectre of the destruction of mankind can only be banished by general  complete and controlled disarmament.98.	The implementation of the promises which were given with regard to the chance to conclude in 1974 substantial agreements on the second phase of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks is awaited by the whole of mankind with legitimate impatience  because it may perhaps allow us to free ourselves from the nightmare of self-destruction.99.	However  peace and security are so complex that they must have a universal character  which alone can ensure their permanence. A search for solutions to international problems which is based on this fundamental reality can of course lead to concrete results  and Europe gives a partial justification of this view.100.	Indeed the idea which was advanced in 1966 for a global discussion of the problems of that continent by all the States composing it has finally become affirmed and was concretised on 3 July in Helsinki by the first phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.101.	Of course  an analysis of the political and social crises in Europe through more than five centuries and the impact of these events on the peoples of the other continents and their negative impact on the normal development of most of the countries which are now called ""the third world"" justifies our interest in any step which can create objective conditions of stability in that part of the world.102.	But we must recognize that  whereas it may be easy for a comment or subcontinent to draw material boundaries it is not quite so easy to find solutions to problems of collective security — and this because of the interpenetration of the interests of the nations and their interdependence. This fundamental fact makes it incumbent upon us to envisage global solutions to the problems important for the future of mankind. The use of force and circumstantial arrangements can only lead us to an absurd equation and to precarious balances.103.	In the view of my delegation  the international community can really give the full measure of its creative genius for producing durable and great works only in a climate of detente. But unfortunately we see that in Asia  Latin America and Africa  where intolerable events are still taking place  peace and security are still looked upon by foreign Powers in terms of power relationships.104.	Thus  the illusion is fostered that islands of peace and prosperity can continue to subsist in a tormented world and that the great majority of men will accept forever to live in conditions of mere survival.105.	A correct appreciation of political  economic and social realities in the world and of the role which every State must play in a universe which wants to be democratic has not always prevailed in our attempts to bring about a settlement of international conflicts  because certain Powers continue to consider themselves as the only ones capable of interpreting the law  while others display a permanent attitude of contempt for the international community  and mock with impunity the values which are the very essence of our existence.106.	Is it not really frightening to see that  at a time when the whole of mankind wants stability and at a time when the Viet-Namese people envisage a future of peace  Powers exist which invoke democracy to support the hysterical clique of Thieu  which wishes with all its heart for new hostilities and a new conflagration?107.	The proposals for the return to normal life in Viet-Nam that were made by the Provisional Revolutionary Government are so logical that they must be supported by the signatories of the Paris agreements and by the whole of the international community.108.	But it remains evident that the task of making peace in the Far East will be unfinished until the plot against the Cambodian people has been thwarted.109.	The Cambodian Royal Government of National Union has achieved many victories over the forces of reaction  despite the blind bombings  the systematic massacre of innocent people and the intensive arming of mercenaries in the pay of wealthy Powers.110.	The policy of the Royal Government of National Union of Kampuchea  presided over by Prince Norodom Sihanouk is based on neutrality and is in keeping with the deep aspirations of the Khmer people. It is in agreement with the principles of the Charter and the policy of non- alignment  which has contributed to the positive development of international relations.111.	The Government of the Republic of Mali would like to express its satisfaction at seeing the Royal Government of National Union of Kampuchea re-establish its legitimate rights  recognized by the historic summit conference of the non-aligned countries in Algeria  which astonished the world by its unity  by its proper assessment of the international situation and by its proposals which  we are sure  will inspire the action of the international community  because they are based on contemporary realities.112.	One of those realities  which is based on the legitimate representation of peoples in international organizations  requires  as was the case for the non-aligned countries  that the spokesman for Cambodia in the United Nations should be the Royal Government of National Union of Kampuchea  which has always been the Government of the Khmer people. Its sound opinions are especially necessary here at the very time when we are working to establish a new order in the world.113.	Last year  in completing my review of events in the Far East  I said that peace was ""...within reach in Korea. In order to safeguard it  it. would be sufficient to help the parties to accelerate the process of peaceful reunification which is going on. "" The People's Democratic Republic of Korea  true to the principles of settling conflicts by negotiation  proposed last February  in its discussions with Seoul  a peace treaty containing five points which would implement the peaceful reunification of the country. As one could expect  the representatives of the South rejected those proposals  fearing that the United Nations Command would disappear and thus showing that they owe their existence only to the presence of American troops  which are still stationed in Korea under the banner of this Organization. A graver insult could not possibly be offered to the General Assembly of the United Nations.114.	We want to reaffirm again that the intervention of the United Nations in Korea is a flagrant contradiction of the spirit of the Charter. The so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea has given those who created and supported it an eloquent example of an accurate appraisal of the Korean realities by inviting us to recognize that it is not needed and to disband it. The attempts to endanger the territorial integrity of Korea  in their turn  are condemned to failure because the United Nations  which has always affirmed the indivisibility of the Korean nation  can only reject such proposals aiming at perpetuation of the partition of that country.115.	With respect to the Middle East  the situation remains explosive because of the persistent refusal of Israel to comply with the relevant resolutions of our Organization.116.	As though the sufferings of the last world war had not sufficed  as though one had erased from memory the ultimate sacrifice of millions of men from every continent who fell on the battlefields to bring about the downfall of racism and of genocide of the Jewish people  as though one no longer remembered the cavalier treatment accorded the League of Nations  there are Powers  some of which are permanent members of the Security Council  that encourage and arm Israel in its scorn for the sacred principles of the Charter.117.	Whereas on the one hand we affirm the precarious- ness of any political settlement based on force  on the other hand some encourage by all means the establishment in the Middle East of a so-called balance that would be based only on the power of arms.118.	Thus Israel  which no longer limits its dreams of conquest and whose actions have been reproached by the universal conscience  has deliberately set itself up as a terrorist State. The destruction of a commercial Libyan aircraft  the hijacking of an Iraqi plane  the repeated attacks against Syrian and Lebanese population centres by Israeli fighter planes  the hand of death striking in Beirut and other actions are eloquent illustrations of this.119.	The genius and superiority of a nation are measured by its contribution to peace and not by its capacity to unleash useless violence.120.	The faith of peoples in the restoration of their usurped dignity is a force so powerful that Israel would stand to gain by pondering the fate of those regimes which have attempted to break that faith; it would draw sound lessons if it did not wish to expose its people to international hatred and condemnation.121.	The community of nations would stand to gain in authority if after a quarter of a century of guilty passivity in the face of the tragedy in the Middle East it granted the legitimate demands of the martyred Palestinian people.122.	To the knowledge of my delegation there has not been  apart from cases of unconditional surrender  situations where negotiations on ending conflicts were started without restoring the conditions that existed prior to those conflicts.123.	The unconditional withdrawal from Arab territories occupied by Israel and the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council are the only basis for a just settlement of the Middle East crisis. To interpret those clear resolutions inevitably leads to distorting them. Yet that is what Israel and its allies are doing  thus blocking any initiative for a peaceful settlement of this tragedy  in particular the efforts of Mr. Jarring and of the African Heads of State.124.	The members of the international community would be accomplices to flagrant violations of the Charter if they did not take energetic measures to repress in an exemplary manner the threat to peace in the Middle East. The belligerent and indefinable idea of secure and recognized frontiers advocated by Israel is a tendentious distortion of Security Council resolution 242(1967).125.	The resumption of hostilities last Saturday in the Middle East proved that the situation of ""no peace  no war"" which prevailed was only an illusion and that any incident could set off an explosion which would lay waste the entire region. Israel bears full responsibility for the tragic development of that crisis. It is time for the allies of Israel to understand all the risks which their negative attitude entails for peace in that region  which  for the fourth time since 1948  has become a battlefield with its attendant misery  destruction  humiliation and frustration.126.	Let us recognize that one cannot be for peace and support Israel and international Zionism in their insulting and persistent defiance of the community of nations. One cannot be for peace and sanction the occupation by Israel of the Arab territories of Gaza and Sinai  the Golan Heights and the west bank. One cannot be for peace and challenge the inalienable rights of the martyred people of Palestine to self-determination and to a homeland. One cannot  finally  work for peace in Europe and continue to support Israeli aggression against the Arab nation in the Middle East. The contradiction which characterizes the international conduct of the allies of Israel is  to say the least  an aberration. The complicity of Israel's allies is condemnable and our Organization must draw the lesson by having recourse to the relevant Articles of the Charter to compel the Zionist State to co-operate in restoring peace in the Middle East. In this connexion  the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the occupied Arab territories and the restoration of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination must not be coupled with any condition or requirement. It is at that price  and that price alone  that our Organization can halt the chain reaction of violence in the Middle East and re-establish there a just and lasting peace in accordance with the historical mission entrusted to it by the Charter.127.	We are told that the world is in a state of detente; intransigence born of misunderstandings and mistaken appreciations of the profound aspirations of peoples is vanishing. Despite this ray of hope and the solemn commitment undertaken in 1945 to fight  if necessary with arms  all threats to human dignity  we are compelled to note that the most abject colonialism and the most infamous oppression are still rampant in Africa and elsewhere.128.	In opposition to the concerted goodwill to make relations between States democratic  in opposition to the happy initiative taken or about to be taken to establish this universal peace to which all peoples aspire  there are the ignominious theories and practices of exploitation of man and discrimination of all kinds.129.	Whereas during the course of the year there has been an increase in the visits and negotiations between Heads of State and Government to reduce the tensions Iborn of the last world war; whereas associations of workers  young people  men of learning and religious men have condemned apartheid and colonialism  the crime of genocide perpetrated at Sharpeville has been re-enacted by the dastardly assassination of the Carletonville miners by the racists of Pretoria and the massacre of the peaceful populations of Wiriyamu in Mozambique by Portuguese soldiers — and during that time Caetano was sipping champagne in London. The United Nations must shoulder its responsibilities towards Portugal  which  with the support of its NATO allies  continues with impunity its colonial wars in Africa in defiance of theprovisions of resolution 1514 (XV) on decolonization and of the principles of the Charter.130.	In Southern Rhodesia  the Zimbabwe people  which rejected the Anglo-Rhodesian proposals that would have confiscated their right to independence for the benefit of the white minority  is daily persecuted by the rebellious and racist Salisbury regime and apartheids being strengthened there by the multiplication of ""bantustans"". One must recognize that the non-application by certain Member States of the economic sanctions adopted by our Organization against the Ian Smith clique has simply strengthened the Salisbury usurpers' ability to resist. Even though the United States is not the only country to breach the decisions adopted against that rebel regime  it is to be hoped that the Congress of that country will accede to the wish of its Government to put an end to the importation of Rhodesian chrome.131.	The racist regime of Salisbury has increased its hostility to the independent Republics of Tanzania and Zambia by unilaterally closing the frontiers with those countries and perpetrating on their territory acts of aggression and terrorism that have resulted in the loss of many human lives. Those attempts to stifle action  which have been directed in particular against Zambia  have been rendered futile by the solidarity of the international community  which responded to our Organization's appeals.132.	In South Africa repression against African nationalists and the liberals of the white race increases while the curve of summary executions and individual assassinations constantly rises. The racist Pretoria Government continues to commit aggression against the people of Namibia  in defiance of the United Nations decision which put an end to its Mandate [resolution 2145 (XXI)] and which has been confirmed by an opinion of the International Court of Justice at The Hague.  Despite the fact that repression has become more severe  the Ovambo people boycotted the electoral sham which the South African occupation authorities organized to perpetuate their domination. The failure of the mission of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General vis-à-vis the Government of Pretoria gives us a measure of the latter's obstinacy in refusing to co-operate with our Organization in the implementation of the relevant resolutions on Namibia.' 134. Those are factors which throughout the year have hampered the attainment of the objectives of our Organization in southern Africa. It appears that the persistence of such a situation simply increases the tragic racial tension which prevails in that sensitive part of the world. The General Assembly and the Security Council are bound to draw the appropriate lesson. For its part  the delegation of Mali rejects the conclusions of the report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  and proposes that his mandate be ended.135.	The arrogance of the Government of South Africa is a result of the support and  in particular  the material and technical aid obligingly given it by the NATO military- industrial Powers in the form of unlimited deliveries of arms and munitions. This attitude is doubtless dictated by the fact that those Powers consider South Africa to be a bulwark against I know not what Communist tide. Is it not in the name of that red peril — which  furthermore  is baseless — that the Government of Pretoria pushes its stupidity and ignominy to the extent of establishing discrimination between animals? The NATO Powers must abandon their support of the unholy alliance constituted by the Lisbon-Pretoria-Salisbury axis and co-operate with the United Nations for the restoration of peace in southern Africa  because any racial confrontation that is started there may engulf that part of the continent.136.	The peace to which all our efforts are directed cannot be reconciled with the economic imbalances which characterize our world. Indeed  the gap between the developed and the developing countries continues to grow. The new economic order to which mankind aspires must be based on world co-operation which safeguards the interests of all the partners. At this time the great hopes placed in the Second United Nations Development Decade are beginning to vanish  because  according to the evaluation that has been carried out  the growth rate of the developing countries is far from having attained the 6 per cent target. The report of the Secretary-General on the world economic situation during the year 1972 '1 furthermore  points out that while the economic growth rate generally rose in the developed countries  the situation in most developing countries is reflected in a growth rate slightly lower than during the 1960s.137.	The reasons for such a decline are known. I shall mention only those relating to the permanent and increasingly more acute deterioration in the terms of trade  the existence of quota and tariff barriers against access to the developed countries' markets of the primary  finished and semi-finished goods of the developing countries  the exploitation of their products by transnational companies  monetary instability and the chronic deficit of agricultural harvests caused by natural catastrophes. The monetary instability which is shaking the world has aggravated the precariousness of the economies of the developing countries. While the successive devaluations of the ""have"" countries currencies and the unilateral readjustments that mark the end of the Bretton Woods system have had little effect on the economic expansion of the developed countries  the consequences have been drastic for low-income countries. We very much doubt that the negotiations taking place in Tokyo within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will lead to the establishment of a new integrated economic order. We rather fear that they will lead to an accentuation of the division of the world into two antagonistic poles: one in constant growth  the other withering away under the requirements of the first. Furthermore  if we are not careful  the famine which increasingly threatens mankind may attain dramatic proportions.138.	The tragic consequences of the drought on the economies and living conditions of the Sudano-Sahelian countries are serious warnings for the United Nations to take up the problem of food in terms of carefully thought- out plans and not in terms of circumstantial programmes.139.	I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to address my sincere thanks and express the profound gratitude of the Government of Mali to all friendly countries  to national or international organizations  governmental or non-governmental organizations  which have given us aid in our efforts to overcome the consequences of the drought  which has been a hard trial for my country.140.	Nevertheless  while this international solidarity permitted us to forestall the worst  the fact is that prospects for a return to normal production conditions in our country remain distant. Indeed  the cycle of drought continues and the latest news enables me to affirm that this year again plants have dried on the ground before they attained full growth. The international community must therefore consider the urgent implementation in those countries of medium and long-term plans so as to free them from their quasi'-total dependence on a capricious rainfall.141.	In our work we find ourselves facing clear and decisive choices.142.	Our success will be the measure of the determination with which we seek equitable solutions for the multiple and complex problems of our times.143.	The United Nations  because of its universal vocation  represents the ideal crucible where ideas should be merged so that  patiently but with resolution  we may  from one session to the next  contribute in a positive manner to the progressive attainment of the objectives set out in the Charter.144.	These are problems of survival which our society faces and no nation is sheltered from the storm.145.	Thus  we have no choice but to work jointly for the coming into being of a new international order based on justice and equity.146.	It is to this task that my delegation invites the Assembly of nations."
"75",4692,"MMR",28,1973,"﻿162.	Mr. President  at the outset  I should like to extend in the name of the delegation of Burma our warm congratulations to you on your election as President of the twenty-eighth regular session of the General Assembly. Your distinguished career and your wide knowledge of world affairs and of the practices of the United Nations are a guarantee to us that under your able guidance the proceedings of this session of the General Assembly will be conducted efficiently and effectively towards a successful outcome.163.	Let me also pay tribute to our outgoing President  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski for his wise steering of the affairs of the twenty-seventh regular session of the General Assembly and the vision with which he fulfilled the functions of his high office.164.	This year we have in our midst the delegations of the German Democratic Republic  the Federal Republic of Germany and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. I should like to offer to them on behalf of the delegation of Burma our warm congratulations and friendly greetings on the occasion of their admission to the family of the United Nations. By their presence in the United Nations they will be able to make a fuller contribution towards the realization of the purposes of the United Nations.165.	The over-all impression which emerges from the present course of world developments and changing power relationships is that we are passing through a critical period in the general relationships between nations and are now at a juncture  in international relations  of general relaxation of tension. On the other hand  this seemingly favourable trend in international relations is somewhat thwarted by the fact that the world political  economic and monetary scene is still essentially far from stable  and we should like to dwell briefly on some of the aspects which lead us to think along these lines.166.	The prevailing trend towards detente in international relations has generated positive processes hopefully opening up prospects for a more peaceful world order. Against that background some former opposing great Powers  recognizing the need to coexist with one another  have sought to normalize their relations and other disputant Powers have begun to seek accommodation of their mutual problems. While those moves have resulted in a lessening of tensions in many parts of the world  the continued existence of tensions and armed conflicts in certain regions calls for renewed efforts for their elimination.167.	With the growing readiness of States to improve their relations and mutual security in the spirit of detente  the quest for international peace and security is beginning to gain strength among the majority of nations inspired by the basic concern to work for the creation of conditions towards this end. The tendency is gradually emerging among nations today to seek new options other than great- Power protection to ensure a peaceful environment in the interests of their own security. Speaking of developments nearer home  in the form of initiatives coming from within the regions which have been prompted by these considerations  we notice the movements under way to secure the recognition of and respect for the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace  and of the South-East Asian region as a whole as a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality  free from any form or manner of intervention by the outside Powers.168.	Since the conclusion of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly certain important developments have taken place in our part of the world. Of particular international significance is the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam  signed in Paris on 27 January 1973  and the Agreement on Restoring Peace and Achieving National Concord in Laos of 21 February 1973. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of every Indo-Chinese State to determine their own future without any outside interference. It acknowledges the inadmissibility of outside intervention in the internal affairs of any of these Indo-Chinese States. It provides for the settlement of the problems existing in the countries of Indo-China by the Indo-Chinese parties themselves on the basis of respect for each other's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  and non-interference in the other's internal affairs. These simple principles embodied in the Agreement  which are of universal application in relations between States  are by no means new principles. What is significant is that they are acknowledged and reaffirmed after years of bitter conflict in Indo-China  which has seen massive intervention by outside Powers and which has brought untold suffering to the valiant Indo-Chinese peoples and immeasurable damage and destruction to their countries.169.	The delegation of Burma is gratified at the prospect that the peoples of the countries of Indo-China will be able to determine  without external interference  their own political status and to pursue their economic  social  and cultural development. However difficult their tasks of national reconciliation  concord and national reconstruction  we have faith that they will be able to work out among themselves satisfactory solutions to their own problems and to rebuild their nations successfully. Belonging as they do to South-East Asia  the Indo-Chinese States  like other States in the region  will have to play their part in the region and will have to share in its future. The restoration of conditions of peace and stability in Indo-China will open up new prospects of consultation and co-operation among the countries of the region for building up the kind of Southeast Asia they want. It is therefore essential that the peoples of the Indo-Chinese States reach speedy settlement of their own problems and that no further outside interference take place on whatever pretext.170.	Burma welcomes the Delhi agreement of 28 August 1973 which  we believe will pave the way to a peaceful settlement of the problems of the Indian subcontinent. Burma is also in full accord with the desirability of obtaining conditions of relaxed tension in the Indian Ocean  being of the view that this would be conducive to the peace and stability of the States bordering it. Admittedly  the legal  political  and military implications are many-sided  and we are inclined to take the view that reasonable time will be needed for steps to be worked out to improve the chances for creating an atmosphere favourable for countries within the region  as well as for outsiders active in the region  to acknowledge their mutuality of interests. We express the hope that the proposal for a peace zone in the Indian Ocean will eventually mature and receive the support and cooperation of all States concerned.171.	It distresses us particularly that the situation in the Middle East has deteriorated. While the United Nations continues its quest for new initiatives to resolve the problem  we would urge the countries of the region most directly concerned with the problem to exercise restraint and to avoid further bloodshed and destruction and to try instead to arrive at a negotiated settlement. We express the hope that it will still be possible to reach a peaceful settlement of the problem on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967).172.	And now I turn to the issue of colonialism  racism and racial discrimination as they relate to relations between the rest of Africa and the States of the south of the continent. I refer here to questions of colonialism in the Territories under Portuguese administration  racism in Southern Rhodesia and racial discrimination in the form of apartheid in South Africa. The General Assembly has been dealing with these issues over the past two decades and yet the prospects of a solution are no nearer. Over-all development in the past year has heightened fears that the mounting sense of tension in South Africa is moving ever faster to a critical point of explosive proportions. Colonialism in the Territories under Portuguese administration  racism in Southern Rhodesia and apartheid in South Africa continue to persist in flagrant violation of all accepted norms concerning the dignity and worth of the human person. At a time when the greater part of the international community is seeking more positive relations to build a better world than we have known  a fraternally linked Africa no doubt could contribute a great deal towards international peace and security.173.	There can be no question that the ultimate goal for mankind as a whole in the field of disarmament must be the achievement of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control. Burma has always supported that goal  but has felt at the same time that the most realistic approach to that end is to direct our immediate efforts towards achieving agreements on what are referred to as collateral or partial measures  which hold far better prospects in present circumstances. Two such measures which are urgently needed are  in our view  the comprehensive prohibition of chemical weapons and the achievement of a comprehensive test ban.174.	My delegation shares the general disappointment at the lack of any material progress towards agreement on the prohibition of chemical weapons. A large number of suggestions were made at the 1973 session of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament with a view to inducing movement towards agreement. However  positions on the fundamental issues involved have remained frozen and  in some cases  seem to have hardened.175.	It is now 10 years since the signing of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water. Having consistently opposed the testing of nuclear weapons in all environments  Burma became a party to the Treaty in the belief that it represented an important step forward towards the realization of a universal and comprehensive test ban in all elements. In the circumstances  my delegation considers that the General Assembly should urge the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to redouble its efforts at its next session with a view to the early conclusion of a convention on the prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons and a comprehensive test ban.176.	I now turn to a subject which constitutes a central issue of our times — the problem of the ever-widening gap between the developed and developing countries. The level of existence of countless millions of people in the developing part of the world is still pitifully low. Those people are often still undernourished  uneducated  unemployed and wanting in many other basic amenities of life. While a part of the world lives in comfort and even affluence  much the larger part suffers from abject poverty. In fact  the disparity is continuing to widen. The most acute problem in the present period of world economic relations is the instability of the world trade and monetary situation  the consequences of which bear heavily on the developing countries  thus placing the very question of their economic development in serious jeopardy. As we are all aware  two decades ago the developing countries set out to accelerate their pace of development. Despite national and international efforts at development the achievements have been meagre and present indications are that the gap will continue to widen.177.	For developing countries the major source of foreign exchange to finance the process of economic development comes from foreign trade earnings. The central problem for the developing countries is the persistent deterioration in their terms of trade in their position as traditional exporters of primary products. The adverse trends in commodity trade for the developing countries are well known. The industrially developed countries lay down the prices 6f raw materials and semi-finished products  the prices of which continue to deteriorate steadily and are unable to keep pace with the rising prices of imported industrial products which developing countries must pay. As a result  the share of those countries in world trade continues to decline. A generalized system of preferences has been offered as the answer to the developing countries' demand for equity in world trade  but in practice the procedure has proved so lengthy and encumbered with exceptions that it has not had the desired maximum effect. For the effective functioning of the preferential system it must be complemented by related assistance and trade promotion. The trade question is linked to the cost of shipping  for shipping is largely owned by the developed countries arid as a result the rising cost of freight charges for exports and imports is having increasingly adverse effects on the balance of payments of the developing countries  especially those in the least developed category.178.	The lasting self-supporting growth of a country cannot be achieved by development aid alone  Even if considerably increased  such aid can only be marginal to a country's development. Moreover  development assistance has in the past two decades been a record of increasing indebtedness. From all this it is clear that  apart from development aid  there exists a necessity for the industrially developed countries to contribute to building up the earnings of the developing countries through improved access to their markets.179.	The magnitude of the problems encountered by the developing countries has been further compounded by the international monetary crisis  which has adverse effects on the currency reserves  imports and terms of trade of the developing countries. In this era of trade and monetary politics  when political relations between States are increasingly determined by economic considerations  it has become more than ever necessary for the developed and developing countries to collaborate as equal partners; otherwise the fear that the two will soon be heading on a collision course may inevitably materialize.180.	Lastly  may I be permitted to state our view that however big or small  powerful or weak a nation  there is a need now  far more than ever before  for Member States of this Organization to. redouble their efforts to make the United Nations an effective arena of action. The direction of United Nations persuasion lies in a two-fold challenge —  how can it be a force for peace  and how can it be a force for greater economic and social equality? The international political and economic relations to which we have been accustomed since the end of the Second World War are undergoing profound changes. Ours is an era of adjustment. It is therefore imperative for Member States to have deeper faith in the Charter and to place more reliance on the United Nations system in the solution of their problems  in order to follow faithfully the path of structuring their relations in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter. Notwithstanding its imperfections  the United Nations and its organs provide us with a unique field for initiatives in all areas of international co-operation."
"76",4748,"MNG",28,1973,"﻿  Mr. President  allow me  on behalf of the delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic  to congratulate Mr. Benites sincerely once again on his election to the high post of President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly and to wish him success in the discharge of his responsible duties. I should also like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to his predecessor  the Deputy Foreign Minister of the Polish People's Republic  Comrade Trepczynski  whose outstanding competence and personal qualities helped significantly to bring the work of the last session of the General Assembly to a successful conclusion.2.	Since the last session of the General Assembly  substantial changes have taken place in the world. We are moving towards a further development of the process of detente and a fundamental restructuring of international relations as a whole. As a result of these favourable changes  a new situation is developing in the world-a shift from confrontation and the ""cold war"" to peace  international co-operation  and the creation of a firm basis for peaceful co-existence. The basis for the far-reaching transformations now taking place is to be found in a general change in power relationships in favour of peace and social progress.3.	Genuine successes in the relaxation of international tension have become possible mainly because of the active and enterprising efforts of the socialist countries  which are fighting a consistent and insistent battle to strengthen peace and universal security. The efforts of all peace-loving and progressive forces and a realistic approach by other States to a solution of urgent problems are helping to improve the international situation.4.	The beginning of the work of the current session of the General Assembly was marked by an important event  which also reflects the positive shifts taking place in the world. It may be said that the admission of the two sovereign German States  —  the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany  —  to the United Nations is a landmark in the history of our Organization. The membership of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany in the United Nations is also the result and the confirmation of the accelerating process of detente in Europe  where a clear trend has emerged towards the creation of a durable and lasting basis for peace and security and towards the development of co-operation between the States of the continent on a basis of equality and mutual benefit.5.	In the last two years  definite progress has been made  on the initiative of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries  towards overcoming the consequences of the Second World War and towards the final legal establishment of the inviolability of post-war frontiers. Practical steps have also been taken to reduce the risk of armed conflicts and to reinforce the spirit of mutual understanding and co-operation between the States of Europe. A clear tendency to extend political detente to the military arena has become apparent  and this would presuppose a reduction of armed forces and armaments.6.	The successful conclusion of the first phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is an important step on the road to building a reliable system of collective security in Europe. The new historic situation that is now emerging on the European continent is meeting with the approval of all States interested in the development of an atmosphere of good-neighbourliness and cooperation. The favourable turn of events on the European continent raises hopes of creating a firm basis for peace and security not only in Europe  but throughout the world.7.	The improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America is assisting the process of detente and the stabilization of the international situation. It is difficult to overestimate the significance of the recent Soviet-American negotiations.8.	The importance of the development of Soviet-American relations transcends the framework of bilateral relations  since that development influences to a large extent the improvement of the whole international situation  which is in the interests of all States without exception  whether large or small  for progress and prosperity for every State are possible only in conditions of peace and security.9.	The changes now taking place in the world are creating favourable conditions preventing nuclear war and armed conflicts  for eliminating the last centres of tension  and for developing mutually advantageous co-operation between States.10.	The principal trend in the current development of international relations is towards the universal recognition and practical application of the principles of peaceful coexistence as the legal basis for relations between States with different social systems. Peaceful coexistence means not only the readiness of States with different systems to live in peace; it also implies a desire to develop economic  scientific  technological and cultural co-operation and mutually advantageous ties  and to settle controversial issues by negotiation.11.	The Mongolian People's Republic is constantly guided in its foreign policy activities by the principle of peaceful coexistence and will continue to develop and expand its ties and co-operation with other States in the world on that basis.12.	Like the other socialist countries  the Mongolian People's Republic is interested in seeing detente become global and all-embracing in nature. We consider that the general improvement in the international atmosphere is opening up good prospects of spreading the process* of detente to the continent of Asia as well  in order that the peoples of Asia may live by the laws of peace.13.	Our delegation would like to point out in this connexion that noticeable changes for the better have recently been taking place on the continent of Asia.14.	The long heroic struggle of the Viet-Namese people against imperialist aggression has ended victoriously. The ending of the war in Viet-Nam  which was one of the longest and cruellest wars of our time  has removed the most dangerous centre of tension not only in Asia  but in the whole world.15.	The victory of the Viet-Namese people  who relied on assistance and support from the socialist countries and all revolutionary and progressive forces  demonstrated to the whole world that you cannot defeat a nation fighting a just war for freedom and independence  in defence of its legitimate rights.16.	The Paris Agreement on Viet-Nam  which establishes the right of the Viet-Namese people to decide their own destiny  has created the necessary pre-conditions for solving the Indo-Chinese problem and for strengthening peace and security on the Asian continent.17.	Nevertheless  although an agreement was reached on ending the war in Viet-Nam  its strict observance is encountering opposition from reactionary forces. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic resolutely condemns the obstructionist acts of the Saigon administration and its patrons  acts which hinder the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Viet-Nam. It is only on the basis of strict observance by both sides of all the articles and provisions of the Paris Agreement that peace and tranquillity can be finally established on Viet-Namese soil.18.	The Mongolian People's Republic expresses its solidarity with the struggle of the patriotic forces of Laos and Cambodia for the realization of the national aspirations of the peoples of their countries. The signing on 21 February 1973 of the Agreement on Restoring Peace and Achieving National Concord in Laos opens the way to a settlement of problems in that part of Indo-China.19.	New and positive circumstances have arisen in the development of the situation in the Korean peninsula. Thanks to the initiative and constructive proposal by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  a dialogue has begun between the two parts of Korea to find ways to achieve the peaceful unification of Korea.20.	The attitude of the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic to the Korean problem remains unchanged: the Korean people must decide its own destiny without external interference. The immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea and the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea are still the essential condition for the peaceful unification of Korea.21.	We note with satisfaction the opening of the Office of the Permanent Observer of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the United Nations. Participation by representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the discussion of the Korean problem will undoubtedly contribute to an objective consideration of the question at this session of the General Assembly.22.	We welcome the progress that has been made in alleviating and normalizing the situation on the Indian subcontinent. A final normalization of the situation in that region would contribute substantially to the improvement of the political climate in Asia. Lastly  the indisputable fact of the existence of the People's Republic of Bangladesh  which has now been recognized by over 100 States of the world  must be acknowledged.23.	In this connexion  we must point out the abnormality of the situation in which this young and independent State  despite its right to be a Member of the United Nations  still remains outside the Organization. Our delegation expresses the hope that the current session of the General Assembly will put an end to this very obvious injustice to the People's Republic of Bangladesh and that Bangladesh will take its place in the ranks of the Members of the United Nations.24.	The Mongolian People's Republic has been following events in the Middle East with deep disquiet. The crisis situation caused by the aggressive acts and annexionist intrigues of the ruling circles of Israel  who enjoy the support and encouragement of international Zionism and imperialism  continues to be one of the most dangerous centres of international tension and a real threat to universal peace and security. Such a situation is particularly intolerable in the present conditions of a general improvement in the international situation.25.	Responsibility for the situation that has arisen lies entirely with the ruling circles of Israel and their imperialist accomplices. How much longer will the Israeli extremist^ spurn the efforts of peace-loving forces to bring about settlement of the Middle East conflict  and how much longer will they continue openly to ignore Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?26.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic considers that the solution of the Middle East problem must be based on the familiar Security Council resolution 242(1967) of 22 November 1967 and that the first essential condition for the application of its provisions is the immediate and complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the occupied Arab territories. The General Assembly must use its authority and influence to overcome the resistance of the Israeli expansionists and their patrons to the elimination of the centre of conflict in the Middle East.27.	like the peoples of the other continents  the peoples of Asia are vitally interested in ensuring lasting peace and in the creation of more favourable conditions for the solution of the social and economic problems facing them.28.	Now that the aim of ending the war in Viet-Nam has been achieved  the peoples and Governments of many Asian States are trying to evolve forms of co-operation and a structure that would guarantee peace and security on the continent. In many countries the public is becoming increasingly conscious of the fact that the real path to ensuring lasting peace in Asia lies in the creation of a system of collective security.29.	Such a system can provide the peoples of Asia with the conditions for peaceful development. It must not be directed against any other States  and all the Asian countries without exception must participate in it on an equal footing.30.	A system of collective security in Asia could be based on such principles as renunciation of the use of force in relations between States  respect for sovereignty and the inviolability of frontiers  inadmissibility of the seizure of foreign territories  non-interference in the internal affairs of countries and peoples  and. broad development of cooperation on a basis of equal rights and mutual advantage.31.	The practical realization of the idea of a system of security on the Asian continent would  of course  require a great deal of effort  but it is a realistic cause. We recognize that the increasing opportunities on the road to this important goal are accompanied by certain difficulties. These difficulties are due primarily to the policy of the imperialist and hegemonistic forces which are trying to hold back the process of detente and maintain tension on the Asian continent. Concerted action by the Asian States and all peace-loving forces are therefore required in the interests of ensuring security in Asia.32.	At its twenty-seventh session  the General Assembly solemnly reaffirmed [resolution 2993 (XXVII)] the principles and provisions of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2134 (XXV)) and urgently appealed to all States to implement those provisions consistently and fully. The principles proclaimed in that Declaration reflect  and are the concrete expression of  the principal and most pressing demand of our times  —  the exclusion of war as an instrument of national policy and as a means of resolving disputes between States.33.	The Mongolian People's Republic attaches great significance to a most important provision of the United Nations Charter: the provision concerning the non-use of force in relations between States. The principle of the renunciation of the use of force  which is one of the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter  is being increasingly put into practice in relations between States. As you know  resolution 2936 (XXVII) providing for the non-use of force in international relations as an inseparable concomitant of the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons was adopted at the last session of the General Assembly on a proposal by the Soviet Union. Strict observance of this principle by States Members of the United Nations and the establishment of its binding nature by the elaboration of special measures decided on by the Security Council will have an exceptionally beneficial effect on the whole development of international relations.34.	The policy of colonial domination and racial discrimination is still one of the fundamental obstacles on the road to strengthening peace and security.35.	In order to maintain its influence in Africa and in other areas  imperialism is trying to use the racist and colonialist regimes there to fight the growing national liberation movements of the peoples of the colonial and dependent countries.36.	The Mongolian People's Republic consistently advocates the final elimination of colonialism  and the immediate granting of independence to countries and Territories which are still under colonial domination. The speedy elimination of racism and racial discrimination in all their forms and manifestations  including the monstrous system of apartheid  is a pressing need of our time.37.	We are convinced that the just cause of the peoples of Angola  Mozambique  Guinea-Bissau  Namibia and Zimbabwe  and of the other peoples under the yoke of the colonialists and racists  will triumph with the growing support of all progressive forces in the world.38.	Experience shows that a rallying and a unity of action by all those fighting for freedom and independence  for peace and social progress  is essential for a successful fight against imperialism and colonialism. Hence the significance of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in September 1973 in Algiers  which expressed the determination of the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America to redouble the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle.39.	It should be noted that the forces of reaction do not hesitate to prevent the introduction of democratic  social and economic changes in various countries  or to divert peoples from their chosen path of progressive development. This is evident from the military putsch in Chile  which was carried out with the support of foreign imperialist forces. The Mongolian people resolutely condemn the overthrow of the legitimate Government of Popular Unity elected as aresult of the free expression of the will of the Chilean people  the treacherous murder of an outstanding statesman and politician  President Salvador Allende  and the bloody reprisals against the progressive forces of the country. We express our heartfelt solidarity with the working people of Chile and demand an immediate end to the terror and repression against the progressive forces in the country  and respect for the will and aspirations of the Chilean people.40.	The general improvement in the international political climate is creating favourable conditions for the elaboration and practical implementation of measures to limit the arms race. The conclusion on 22 June 1973 by the Soviet Union and the United States of the Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War was an extremely important step towards saving humanity from the horrors of thermonuclear war. It is making it easier to reach an understanding on further measures to limit the arms race.41.	The strategic arms limitation talks now taking place between the Soviet Union and the United States of America and the negotiations that have begun in Vienna on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe are no less important.42.	The Mongolian People's Republic still considers that the convening of a World Disarmament Conference is an urgent necessity and one that requires the active and constructive participation of all States  and the five nuclear Powers especially  in solving this key problem of our times. The Mongolian People's Republic  as a member of the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference  considers that urgent measures must be taken to ensure the normal functioning of that Committee so that it can start work immediately on practical preparations for holding a world disarmament conference.43.	For the past two years  the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva has been discussing  along with other issues related to disarmament  the draft convention on the prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and on their destruction. Nevertheless  a generally acceptable solution to this problem has not yet been found. It would require from States Members of the United Nations new and serious efforts to reach agreement on the banning of chemical weapons.44.	At the 2126th meeting of the General Assembly  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  Mr. A. A. Gromyko  submitted on behalf of the Soviet Government a proposal to consider at the current session an item on the reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries..45.	Our delegation considers this to be a timely and constructive proposal. The translation of this new and important initiative into reality would be a practical step towards solving the problem of disarmament; it would enable additional resources to be allocated for constructivepurposes; and it would permit the acceleration of economic progress in the developing countries.46.	While welcoming the readiness of the Soviet Union to reduce its military expenditure  we are entitled to expect that the other permanent members of the Security Council will do likewise  —  this is essential for the implementation of the proposal.47.	A reduction in military expenditure by the nuclear Powers would be a convincing example to other countries with large economic and military potential  and would promote the further strengthening of mutual trust and co-operation between States in the interests of peace.48.	That is why we consider it appropriate to examine the Soviet proposal  which is in the interest of all peoples of the world  at the current session.49.	In connexion with the problem of disarmament  we should like to draw the attention of the General Assembly to the need for an immediate cessation of all forms of nuclear testing  and above all nuclear testing in the atmosphere. The Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water   which was signed 10 years ago  was an important step on the road to saving humanity from the dangerous consequences of nuclear testing. But  despite the clearly expressed view of a broad stratum of world opinion  Asia and Oceania are still being used as proving grounds for atmospheric nuclear tests. These tests involve serious danger to human life and cause immense damage to the environment  particularly in those countries in the immediate vicinity of the areas in which the tests are conducted.50.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic adds its voice to those of the other nations that are demanding the cessation of nuclear tests in the atmosphere in order to bar the way to a nuclear arms race.51.	In our opinion  it is essential  in order to consolidate the present positive progress in the world  to spread the spirit of detente and realism to the area of international economic relations.52.	We appreciate the difficulties being encountered by the developing countries in their struggle for economic and social progress. As experience in many countries has shown  the acceleration of a country's economic development is fundamentally dependent on the mobilization of domestic resources and the introduction of far-reaching social and economic changes in the interest of society as a whole.53.	Another very important factor for the achievement of those aims is a general reform of the whole system of relations between the developing countries and the developed capitalist countries  a review of the current unjust international division of labour and the introduction of new just forms  standards and principles of co-operation.54.	At the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly  the socialist countries submitted an important document - a draft statement by the United Nations on promoting the development of co-operation in economic  trade  scientific and technological matters on the basis of equality.  The provisions of the draft statement reflect the objective demands of the development of modern international trade and economic relations based on the principles of equality and mutual advantage.55.	We hope that the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea will reflect in its decisions the interests of the land-locked States. The existing international legal provisions establishing the rights of land-locked States must be further developed and reinforced.56.	The Mongolian People's Republic consistently supports the reinforcement of the United Nations as an important instrument of peace and as a centre for reconciling the positions of different States.57.	We note with satisfaction that some positive progress has been made in enhancing the prestige and authority of the United Nations and in ensuring its universality.58.	Our delegation expresses the hope that this session of the United Nations General Assembly will make its contribution to accentuating the positive trends in the development of contemporary international relations  and reinforcing the spirit of mutual understanding and co-operation between States in the interests of peace and universal security."
"77",4835,"MRT",28,1973,"﻿The twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly opens at a moment when important events are occurring on the international stage. New centres of power and influence are appearing while detente and co-operation are replacing the traditional division of the world into two opposing blocs.2.	While these deep-rooted transformations in the general relations of forces constitute an important stage towards the establishment of peace  the countries of the third world still remain confronted with colonialism  foreign occupation and economic exploitation.3.	It is therefore in a new context  where peoples are torn between anxiety and hope  that this twenty-eighth session is opening  and it devolves upon you  Mr. President  to guide the labours of this session. Your responsibilities are difficult indeed  but we trust in your qualities as a statesman and as an outstanding diplomat  and we congratulate you warmly on your election. The well-deserved respect which your country enjoys  your foresight and enlightened understanding mean that you are well qualified to assume this heavy and difficult task.4.	Your predecessor also commands our gratitude for the tact and sense of equity with which he guided the work of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly.5.	We should also like to pay a tribute to the very meritorious manner in which our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  is discharging his lofty and difficult task. We should like once again to express our support for him in his courageous and persevering efforts to enforce respect for the principles of the Charter  and thus to ensure the maintenance of peace and harmony among peoples.6.	Lastly  I should like to extend again to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic our wishes of welcome and our warm congratulations  which have already been conveyed to them by the Mauritanian delegation.7.	However  I should like to add that my country experiences all the more satisfaction at these developments because its relations with the Federal Republic of Germany are long standing  and today are taking a vigorous upsurge reflecting the mutual respect between our two peoples. Our satisfaction is also justified by the peaceful work done in Europe in difficult conditions by the Federal Republic of Germany. We know how diverse these conditions are and we can therefore measure the true value of what has been accomplished and the immense task that has been carried out. These accomplishments do honour to the German people and should be a source of pride to its leaders. Such great objectives could never have been achieved without the determination of that people and the political courage and foresight of Chancellor Willy Brandt. We are convinced that the presence in the United Nations of such a highly qualified people and such far-sighted leaders will contribute to the search for justice  freedom and the equality of peoples  a search which our Organization has set itself as its objective.8.	The broad lines which guide the foreign policy of my country are naturally a reflection of its geographical position  its economic situation and its political options 9.	An under-developed country  a pivot between black Africa and Arab Africa  firmly devoted to its economic and political independence  the Islamic Republic of Mauritania intends to pursue its course in the community of efforts at the international level with firm determination to Tight to contribute to the advent of a world peace  justice and harmony.10.	It is on those fundamental factors that we have based our will to safeguard and consolidate our economic and political independence and our devotion to African unity  to non-alignment and to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.11.	Ever since the dawn of its accession to international sovereignty  the Islamic Republic of Mauritania has been aware that it must rely on itself before it can rely or others. It has been  above all  aware that the constant search for real political independence requires true cultural and economic independence.12.	It is this fundamental approach which has led my Government and my party to reject easy solutions and to take decisions which  if they have not been in our immediate interests  have been in accord with our principles and objectives. At the very time of our independence. Mauritania refused to became part of the former Common Organization for the Regions of the Sahara and expressed its unhesitating support for Algeria in its struggle for national liberation  to cite only that case.13.	In 1963  in the course of the third congress of our party  we decided to give up the subsidy that had been granted to us by France for our operational budget  opting thus for a policy of austerity and financial stringency. This will to make sacrifices  accepted by our country at the national as well as the individual levels  has always been part of our continuing search for true independence.14.	The logical consequence of this difficult but continuing search was naturally the revision  early this year  of our agreements with France which had been concluded at the time of our accession to international sovereignty. Those agreements were certainly justified at the time and in a very sell-defined context  but they of necessity had to suffer from the passage of time and the counter-effect of the evolution of our country  both internally and internationally. They therefore had to take into account our own national and international requirements  as well as our legitimate desire to regain control over the instruments of our economic and cultural policy.15.	It was on that basis that the Islamic Republic of Mauritania created its own national currency  the ouguiya  on 29 June last and signed with France new agreements covering various areas  not including the monetary and the military. Those new agreements  although they open a broad field of action  are  by their general nature  similar to the agreements signed by Mauritania with other foreign States.16.	Hence our two countries have decided to co-operate on the basis of mutual interest and in a framework open towards the future. In so doing  they have been able to preserve the multiple ties of esteem and affection which a long common history has woven between our two peoples. Such was the last stage in a certain area of co-operation and the point of departure for new relations of an evolutionary nature based on the real interests of our two States. That departure was not easy-for from it. At the same time as international economic relations are disturbed by the monetary crisis and its nefarious effects and by a generalized recession in the economy  a natural disaster of exceptional dimensions has struck our country at this decisive stage of our history.17.	Three successive years of drought have had dramatic consequences on the life of our people  on cattle and crops: 60 to 80 per cent of the livestock have died  depending on the region; there has been a severe food shortage  leading to epidemics among a portion  of the population  mass rural exodus  non-existent crops  and a lack of drinking water. Those are just some of the problems which require urgent solution.18.	An emergency plan was worked out on 18 November 1972 and put into effect on 1 January 1973. That plan included at the outset several approaches: a regrouping of the people concerned  organization of transport and the distribution of food-stuffs  protection of existing pasture land and the raising of reproductive livestock  the drilling of properly equipped wells  and the introduction of a market- gardening programme. By means of a rigorous limitation of expenses  my Government was able to participate to a large degree in the carrying out of this plan. While that participation has now risen to one sixth of our national operating budget  a 3 per cent national tax on salaries and a 1 per cent tax on the business earnings of companies operating in our country should reach the same amount. But if the forecasts for this initial plan have been largely exceeded  it is thanks principally to international solidarity  to which I should like to pay a warm tribute. I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to address the sincere thanks of my Government and people of Mauritania to the United Nations  to the specialized agencies  and to the private organizations and many friendly countries that have granted us rapid  effective and multifaceted assistance. Thanks to that national effort and to that international solidarity  urgent problems have found a solution or are on the road to solution.19.	We have avoided the worst; the people have been saved from a catastrophe of famine which could have killed thousands of human beings in this twentieth century  which none the less is witness to opulent consumer societies. It thus remains for us to prevent  through appropriate short- and long-term programmes  a recurrence of such a situation. The broad  general lines of this programme  for the financing of which we are calling upon friendly countries and the international community  have been defined by the Heads of State of the Sahelian region in Ouagadougou and will be communicated to the General Assembly by Mr. Sangoule Lamizana  President of the Republic of Upper Volta  who has been entrusted by his peers to undertake this task.20.	As can therefore be seen  it is in a difficult situation that my country has committed itself to the path of mastery of its economy  an essential prerequisite for true independence. But our country-with a fairly parsimonious State  with a people that tends by nature to economy  with a largely surplus balance of trade and an adjusted balance of payments-counting on the support of many brother-States and friends  has every reason to be optimistic and confident in the future.21.	On the other hand  this policy of independence characteristic of our country does not in any way  in our opinion  exclude the possibility of consultation and fruitful co-operation. Such consultation and co-operation  in a climate of confidence  can lead to agreements respecting each of the parties involved or to the taking of a common position flowing from solidarity of interests or any other valid and legitimate motivation. Our choice of non-alignment derives its force from this spirit of co-operation; at the same time  it is the expression of our refusal to be at the service of any hegemony or to replace centuries-old forms of domination by other  equivalent manifestations. It is explained also by our devotion to freedom  to the equality of all peoples and to the safeguarding of their national independence. For that matter  those are the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter  to which my country has subscribed ever since its independence and to which it has sworn an oath to be faithful.22.	As far as our relations with Africa are concerned  they are a reflection of our faith in the need for African solidarity. If the unity of Africa finds in us a particular welcome it is because our country  as was said by the Head of State of Mauritania:""... gives an example of harmonious cohabitation of people of different races and colours  who  with the same enthusiasm  are together building the Mauritanian nation. . . . These characteristic features of our country  as well as its geographic position  make it a link between Black Africa and Arab Africa  the cultures and races of which exist together there in order better to enrich it and to symbolize Africa united in its diversity.""23.	That is certainly not a passing attitude. Those are our deep-rooted considerations of reality which we have translated into facts in our relations with other African countries  both north and south of the Sahara  and with the whole of the Arab world to which we belong.24.	At the same time as our links with our brothers from the south and from the north are growing stronger day by day  we intend to build together the Arab Maghreb  in keeping with the aspirations of our peoples and with their centuries-old ties.25.	It is therefore on the basis of these political factors-if we may use that term-that the delegation of my country intends to participate in this debate without any prejudice or partisan spirit.26.	I said a few minutes ago that our peoples were divided between despair and hope. Indeed  if we look at the international situation we will note that it has been marked by decisions and negotiations which have brought us closer to peace. Among the great Powers a link of new relations founded on economic co-operation is being established above and beyond the differences of political regimes and ideological systems. This new spirit of co-operation and understanding derives from the realization that in the context of nuclear balance certain geographical or political frontiers could not be altered by force. It is also encouraged by the fact that people have become aware that two powerful industrial and commercial blocs can derive from each other tremendous advantage on this basis of economic co-operation.27.	In Europe  where for so long initiatives for peace and attempts at settlement by peaceful means of the problems inherited from the Second World War died at a wall of misunderstanding and mistrust  a new era of confidence and mutual respect is progressively being realized. That state of mind is in particular reflected by the admission to the United Nations of the two Germanys.28.	Concerning Indo-China  the signing on 27 January 1973 in Paris of agreements on Viet-Nam  the cessation of the American bombardment of Cambodia and the Vientiane agreement' open up new prospects for the people of Indo-China  who have so long been scourged by war and foreign intervention.29.	On the subcontinent  the agreement concluded in New Delhi on 28 August between India and Pakistan settling various humanitarian problems encourages reconciliation and peace in the region.30.	The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  while actually covering the prosperous regions of the planet  is none the less an initiative for rapprochement  which provides a framework for reflection and dialogue between nations that were recently competitive in all fields.31.	These outstanding factors in international relations beyond any question constitute a sizable achievement for the forces of peace in the world. They are therefore a legitimate source of hope. We must  however  recognize that peace is far from being assured in all parts of the world. That explains our attitude  which is based on equally legitimate anxiety.32.	Just so long as colonial wars rage  just so long as there is apartheid  occupation of territories of sovereign and independent States  the policy of force and economic exploitation of countries already poor  detente will remain an illusion or will be limited in scope. Peace and freedom are indeed indivisible  particularly at a time when the interdependence of countries and the solidarity of peoples become a vital and inevitable necessity. That is why the detente and rapprochement in Europe can have meaning only if they are not limited to a geographical zone and their effects can be extended to the rest of the world. Indeed  it happens  as though by a curious chance  that it is in the other parts of the world that one finds poverty and the sources of tension.33.	It will therefore be understood that detente can have no meaning for the oppressed peoples expelled from their homes  denied their legitimate aspirations to freedom  dignity and progress.34.	In the Middle East  Israel pursues its policy of aggression  following an unchanging scheme of colonization by force. The countries bordering on occupied Palestine have seen their territories reduced. Even their names have been changed. True violent change has been brought about-not by a normal and authentic development but by the application of a continued policy of expansion  occupation and resettlement.35.	The Palestinian people  whose lives and existence have through the centuries been intermingled with the geography and land of Palestine itself  have been expelled from their homeland  dispossessed of their goods  reduced to wandering and living on international charity. Such is the crisis in the Middle East which Israel  assured of impunity and the support of imperialism  launches as an arrogant challenge to the international community and to the United Nations itself.36.	In Southern Africa  the peoples of South Africa  Namibia  Zimbabwe  Mozambique  Angola  Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde islands continue to bend under the weight of colonialism  which becomes increasingly murderous and inhuman. The most recent massacres in Carletonville in South Africa and the criminal atrocities perpetrated in Mozambique by Portugal once again bring out the resurgence of this colonialism based on the oppression of the peoples of southern Africa by a minority of foreign settlers. These peoples are exploited and deprived of their fundamental rights  which flouts the most elementary values of the human person. This unholy alliance between Lisbon  Pretoria and Salisbury continues to strengthen its system of domination. It is encouraged by monopolies and economic and financial foreign interests and by the multifaceted aid it is granted by certain countries within the Atlantic alliance.37.	The people of the Sahara under Spanish domination continue to be deprived of the right to self-determination. My country reaffirms its devotion to that principle in conformity with the decisions of Nouadhibou and Agadir  and pertinent resolutions of the United Nations on this Territory. We should like to avail ourselves of this opportunity solemnly to call upon Spain without delay to apply to the people of the Sahara the principle to which Spain has in principle subscribed  as requested of it repeatedly by the United Nations. Any delay or hesitation could only worsen the situation in the Territory and compromise the many ancient and new ties of friendship and co-operation existing between Spain and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.38.	The situation in Indo-China continues to be a subject of lively concern for my country. Despite the signing of the Paris agreements on Viet-Nam and the cessation of United States bombing in Cambodia and Laos  peace is far from established. And it cannot be established so long as foreign intervention is manifested in support of all kinds for the Lon Nol regime and so long as the Saigon administration and those who support it do not really commit themselves to respecting the Paris agreements.39.	In Korea  the division of the country constitutes a permanent threat to peace in that region and to security in the world. The United Nations flag continues to be used to camouflage the presence of foreign occupation troops in Korea. The Korean people cannot bring about its independence and peaceful reunification save through exercise of its right to self-determination in the absence of any foreign intervention.40.	The hotbeds of tension or selective confrontation I have just touched upon are not the only limitations to detente. There is another crucial problem of our times-that of the increasing gap between the developed countries of the north and the developing countries of the south. The international economic and monetary structures set up after the Second World War were conceived in terms of the interests of the developed countries alone.41.	If at the outset only the interests of the Western countries were involved  in our times we must recognize the fact that this system extends to the economic interests of the developed countries of the East. It is a system within the framework of which the dependence of the developing countries is an essential factor in the future growth of the wealthy advanced countries.42.	True  praiseworthy efforts and progress have been made by international institutions such as the UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the International Monetary Fund  but relations between the developed countries and the developing countries continue to be relations of dependence rather than interdependence. Bilateral or multilateral aid has not been sufficient to meet the needs of the developing countries and is far removed from the objectives of the Second United Nations Development Decade. With the price fluctuations in raw materials and the increase in the price of manufactured goods  the already scandalous gap widens steadily.43.	Such conditions testify to the lack of a real political will to take the measures necessary to bring about  in the interests of all Members  true international economic co-operation. The developed countries  in their long-term interest  are in duty bound to organize that co-operation on the basis of the equality of States and the participation of all in a task which is of necessity a common use. Otherwise  detente will remain limited in principle and in scope. It could even ultimately bring about the division of the world not into ideological and antagonistic blocs but rather into a group of developed countries  an international gendarme at a dual level-political and economic-and a majority of poor States  pawns of political confrontations and military hegemonies.44.	That is a real apprehension that emerged from the historic Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Algiers from 5 to 8 September 1973  in which 76 countries representing a very large majority of the world's population met together. That concern  which was clearly felt in Algiers  would be further justified if the developed countries  and in particular the great Powers  failed to convert this detente into a real and committed effort for peace and progress for the benefit of all mankind.45.	The United Nations offers an appropriate framework for such international co-operation. The rivalry between the great Powers can be manifested in this task  not by acrimonious discourse  but by a sincere search for solutions of the many problems of mankind  particularly by the improvement of the fate of man and the application of his rights. It is at this price that our Organization  an instrument of peace and understanding among peoples  can see restored to it its role as a factor for political  economic and social progress. The United Nations indeed could not be satisfied to be only what the Member nations wish it to be  for among those countries the great Powers enjoy prerogatives so formidable that they could not be justified if they did not imply at the same time duties and respect vis-à-vis Member States and the resolutions of the Organization. It is in vain that we decry the inefficiency of the United Nations if those that bear the collective responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security are the first to flout its relevant resolutions.46.	We would express the sincere hope to see every Member State work for respect for the principles enshrined in the Charter and the application of the decisions taken by our Organization. Thus  for the greater good of mankind  we would see reborn the somewhat diminished confidence of peoples in this world Organization."
"78",4881,"MUS",28,1973,"﻿89.	Mr. President  I wonder whether I should congratulate you or sympathize with you in the onerous task ahead of you? Although  in electing you President of this session  this august Assembly has shown due recognition of your skilful diplomacy and high appreciation of your deep erudition — qualities which your country and the United Nations have had the privilege of enjoying in the most altruistic way. But  Mr. President  ""uneasy lies the head that wears a crown"". I bring you warm and fraternal greetings from my Prime Minister  the Right Honourable Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam  the Government and the people of Mauritius.90.	The outgoing President  Mr. Trepczynski  deserves our thanks and appreciation for his leadership and service during his tenure of office.91.	We are meeting at a very grave moment in the history of the United Nations  when three Member States which have pledged to abide by the United Nations Charter are at war. We members of the developing world have always dedicated ourselves to the cause of freedom and peace  and in such a spirit we pray and hope that wisdom and peace  justice and equity will soon prevail in the Middle East. It cannot rain all the time.92.	We warmly welcome the new Member States: the Federal Republic of Germany  the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.93.	Here I would like to pay a special tribute to my friend and distinguished colleague Comrade Willy Brandt for his perseverance  dedication  conviction and positive approach to a delicate  if not at that time a thorny  situation. All his noble and persistent efforts are now happily crowned with success in bringing about the close association of both Germanys. I am sure that the pages of history will record his far-sighted vision and cool patience since his accession to power and in making his latest hope a reality with an enduring reconciliation.94.	We are indeed gratified to underline that  in admitting these new States  the United Nations is steadily progressing towards the desired goal of universality. It is only by becoming truly universal that our Organization can fully achieve the aims so clearly defined in the Charter. That is why we sincerely hope that those States which are still outside the United Nations — by choice  for political or any other reasons — will be willing to join us in the9near future and will not hesitate to take their rightful places in the family of nations.95.	By the admission of the two German States to the United Nations as sovereign States  we have accepted prevailing realities of today with the concurrence of the two Governments concerned. But we trust that the present ideological differences between the two States will not prove irreconcilable as to render the gap unbridgeable —  for  in our opinion  such differences should not divide  but should allow mutual tolerance to sustain peaceful coexistence.96.	It is in the same spirit that we view the problems concerning the Korean people. Mauritius maintains friendly relations with both South and North Korea and would support their dual representation in the United Nations  thus paving the way for the creation of favourable conditions for the reunification of the country with the mutual consent of both parties. How rightly can I say here  quoting the words of Saint Francis of Assisi:""O Lord  give me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change  the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.""97.	My country welcomes the agreement reached between India and Pakistan for the peaceful settlement of their neighbourly differences. May we hope that Pakistan and Bangladesh resolve the outstanding issues so as to enable this new sovereign State to become a Member of the United Nations at this session. Bangladesh is a sovereign State  which Mauritius recognized as such as early as February 1972  and it is noted with satisfaction that the majority of Members represented here have given due recognition to this fact. We should encourage India  Pakistan and Bangladesh to continue their efforts  by direct negotiations  to achieve peace and harmony in the region and the cherished universality that we all desire.98.	Ever since we joined the United Nations  we have noted that  session after session  Assembly after Assembly  the Organization has considered the same problems under different guises  without apparent positive results  thus causing stagnation. No communion of people can progress if it does not move with the times. The process of decolonization is at a standstill. In southern Africa  millions of people who are looking to us for assistance and help to exercise speedily and peacefully their fundamental rights to self-determination  freedom and independence are forced to resort to armed struggle against their oppressors.99.	I shall deal with the relevant issues later  but let me say here that the basic problems concerning disarmament have not been settled  and hopes that a great number of countries had placed on the Second United Nations Development Decade are now being disappointed.100.	It follows that more co-ordinated efforts and concerned action are essential  made in a spirit of good faith and brotherly understanding. It is in this respect that I welcome the detente between the great Powers. This reduction of strains and tensions will allow the great Powers to concentrate on the United Nations and cooperate with the whole membership to enable the Organization to achieve the goals laid down in the Charter. So  in commending this detente in so far as it creates an atmosphere conducive to a more effective United Nations  it should not be a mere entente between those concerned for the sake of narrow and selfish interests. We are convinced that this detente in which Mr. Brezhnev  President Nixon  President Pompidou  Mr. Chou En-lai and Herr Willy Brandt have contributed  is certainly not at the expense of the developing countries. On the contrary  I hope it will enable the latter to develop their resources and channel their energies in peace and freedom  without becoming the victims of one super-Power or another. We pray and trust God that  for the sake of mankind  nuclear weapons should never be allowed to be utilized whatever may be the reason.101.	In our part of the world  decolonization and the elimination of racial discrimination are problems that are not yet resolved. We have on record all the resolutions made in this respect indicating very clearly what action should be taken to tackle those evils effectively. What is lacking therefore is the political will on the part of the great Powers  and here I indict the permanent members of the Security Council; only they can help the Council to take positive action to enforce those resolutions and thus compel South Africa to respect the political and human rights of that country's non-white majority and abandon the evil policy of that system which is not to be named among civilized people: apartheid. This Assembly has declared that apartheid is a crime against humanity. At its last session  the Commission on Human Rights adopted for the consideration of this Assembly a draft Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid [item 53 (b)]. Mauritius  as a multiracial country  abhors racial discrimination and supports this draft convention. We trust that the right-thinking members of this august Assembly will rise up to the occasion. We believe that effective measures to eradicate apartheid will still be needed to give effect to our solemn declarations and other pronouncements concerning apartheid. Let us here remember that the white notes of the piano alone will never give us the symphony we desire if the black ones do not participate too.102.	The case for effective action is clear  is very clear  as far as Namibia is concerned  in view of the special responsibility of the international community towards the people of that country. The Secretary-General has told us that his contacts and efforts in this direction have not produced the desired results. We concur with him when he says:.. it is important that the competent organs of the United Nations  and the Security Council in particular  should continue to seek effective approaches in their endeavour to bring about a solution based on the inalienable rights of the Namibian people to self determination  national independence and preservation of the unity and territorial integrity of Namibia."" [A/9001/ Add. 1  p.4.]103.	The United Nations decided to take endorsement action for the first time — I am referring to the sanctions against Rhodesia — but the results have not been conclusive. This is a sad reflection on the first positive stand.The fact that some countries can break the sanctions imposed by the United Nations against the illegal  unlawful and self-imposed regime of Ian Smith  shows that the United Nations should show more determination in taking endorsement action. This colonial regime in Salisbury should not be allowed to continue to defy world opinion any longer.104.	The question of disarmament will no doubt constitute one of the most important issues before the Assembly. It is obvious that the prevailing detente has not had any bearing on the attitude of those whose co-operation is needed. Military expenditures are increasing steadily and nuclear tests are still being conducted. We believe that a comprehensive test-ban treaty and general and complete disarmament should be the ultimate goals. It is regrettable that the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference set up by the Assembly at its last session [resolution 2930 (XXVII)\ has been unable to function. We sincerely hope that it will be possible to find other ways and means of making some headway. It is noted with great interest that the delegation of the Soviet Union has proposed a new item entitled ""Reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries"" for the consideration of the Assembly [A/9191].105.	We propose  and we pledge ourselves  to support that positive action. In this connexion I should like to refer to the Conference of the International Monetary Fund held last month in Nairobi  at which Robert McNamara  President of the World Bank  laid emphasis on the economic situation of the developing countries and went on to say:""Despite a decade of unprecedented increase in the gross national product of the developing countries  the poorest segments of their populations have received relatively little benefit.""""Nearly 800 million individuals — 40 per cent  out of a total of 2 billion — survive on incomes estimated at 30 cents per day in conditions of malnutrition  illiteracy and squalor. They are suffering poverty in the absolute sense. That absolute is no abstraction here.""106.	The high hopes which the developing countries had placed in the Second Development Decade are fading fast  but we believe that new ones will grow. This session will achieve much if more importance is attached to the economic and social progress of those countries. Is not the time opportune for us to give serious thought to the proposal of the President of Mexico for a charter of economic rights and duties of States?107.	Those are some of the points to which I wanted to refer  but before concluding may I state that my Government welcomes the peace agreement on Viet-Nam.  However  that will not be complete until the Provisional Revolutionary Government of Viet-Nam is allowed to pay its proper role as agreed at the Paris Conference.That alone can bring about ""durable peace""  to use a phrase of President Nixon  in that part of the world.108.	I reiterate the support of my Government for the liberation movements of Africa  which deserve all our encouragement and praise in their valiant struggle. My Government will give positive effect to the request of President Gowon  as President of the Organization of African Unity  with regard to the recognition of Guinea- Bissau as a sovereign and independent State.109.	May I say  as I said once before in another international forum  that it is not what we achieve which matters but the efforts we make to achieve it. To quote the words of Browning:""This high man  with a great thing to pursue Dies ere he knows it.That low man goes on adding one to one His hundred's soon hit.""110.	Mr. President  I wholeheartedly trust that where there is war peace will return  and where there is hatred understanding will prevail."
"79",4964,"MYS",28,1973,"﻿34.	Let me begin by offering to Mr. Leopoldo Benites the Malaysian delegation's heartiest congratulations on his unanimous election as President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. His election to that high office is an eloquent tribute not only to his own person but also to his great country  Ecuador. I am confident that with his diplomatic skill and the vast experience he has acquired during his long and distinguished association with the United Nations he is indeed most eminently qualified for his high office and that he will lead us to a fruitful conclusion of our deliberations. For my part  I pledge my delegation's utmost co-operation and fullest support in the execution of his task.35.	I take this opportunity also to say how grateful we are to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  the Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland  who as President of the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly so skilfully and in such a statesmanlike manner guided the Assembly to a successful conclusion. It is most auspicious that we should have begun our work at this Assembly by making yet further progress towards the universality of the United Nations by admitting three more States to membership. In that connexion I should like  in the name of my delegation and on behalf of the Malaysian Government  to extend our sincere congratulations and warmest welcome to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on the occasion of their admission to membership in this Organization.36.	The admission of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas is highly significant  for it marks another important development in the process of decolonization. But  while it is an occasion for rejoicing  it also reminds us of the unfinished task before us — that of helping other colonial territories still under foreign domination to attain their freedom and independence.37.	We congratulate the Governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on their successful efforts to reach an historic accord between themselves which  among other things  has led to the admission of the two countries to membership in the United Nations. This understanding between the two German States  and the agreement reached on Berlin  which was for many years one of the most intractable problems in East-West relations  are further important milestones in the gradual progress towards international harmony and concord.	c38.	A recurrent theme in this session's general debate is the subject of detente. Malaysia welcomes the initiatives of the past year towards the relaxation of tension among the major Powers  among them the dialogue at the highest level between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  the establishment of regular contacts between the United States and China and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Those are major initiatives which must be regarded as important developments towards an era of peaceful coexistence and positive cooperation among nations  which is more rational in concept and more beneficial to mankind than the discredited old order of mistrust  suspicion and confrontation of the cold war.39.	As a country pursuing the policy of non-alignment  Malaysia has all the more reason to welcome that development  since in a sense it represents significant progress in one of the major efforts of the non-aligned movement itself. The Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Algiers last month  was most timely and had a particular significance in this context of detente. On the one hand it dramatized the relevance of the efforts of the non-aligned movement in the past in preventing big-Power confrontation and in breaking down the barriers of the cold war. On the other hand it focused attention on the future role of the non-aligned movement in ensuring that the end of big-Power confrontation does not become the beginning of big-Power hegemony  and that the third world will retain the right and the capability of playing its part in shaping the destiny of mankind.40.	In welcoming this positive development we must be mindful that detente does not automatically guarantee the peace that we all seek. The renewed armed hostilities and Israeli aggression in the Middle East must serve as a stern reminder of the slender thread by which world peace hangs in the balance. At a time when the world is beginning to feel comforted by the thaw in the cold war it must serve as a warning that  unless the forces of detente are harnessed for the just solution of such urgent problems as the Middle East situation  the world will just slip into the abyss of international anarchy. That is indeed the challenge of detente. Whether it will prove to be beneficial to mankind or whether it will be detrimental to the cause of peace  or for that matter whether the advantages of this new beginning will be wastefully frittered away  must depend largely on how the international community responds to it.41.	In the final analysis  the real success of detente will be measured in terms of its contribution to achieving the purposes and principles of the United Nations. In that context detente cannot be meaningful if it does not lead to a greater willingness and effort on the part of the major Powers in particular and of all nations in general to strengthen the efficacy of the United Nations so as to enable this Organization to play a more effective role in grappling with some of the more intractable problems of our time  the solution of which requires the full support of the entire community of nations. Detente will have no relevance if it fails to accelerate the process of decolonization  whose slow progress at the moment is caused by the stubborn refusal of the remaining colonial Powers to recognize the right of peoples to self-determination. Detente will fall short of our expectations if it fails to generate a greater will among all parties concerned to attain the goal of general and complete disarmament to which the United Nations is committed and which the peoples of the world demand as a legitimate right for survival. And  finally  detente will turn out to be an utter disappointment  an illusion  if it does not bring about a greater dedication among the developed countries to the task of discharging their obligations and redressing the economic imbalance and disparity between the developed and developing world and a political will to do so. For detente to have any meaning at all it must be more than a process of accommodation among the major Powers; it must truly serve as the vehicle for the attainment of permanent and universal peace in the world  for the just exploitation of the world's resources and for the equitable distribution of wealth and prosperity for all mankind.42.	It is in that perspective that Malaysia views with great concern the outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East resulting from a renewed act of aggression by Israel. This latest act of Israeli aggression is manifestly a continuation of Israel's policy of annexation and consolidation of its occupation of Arab lands illegally occupied by force. We are concerned at the latest reports that  in its policy of aggression  Israel has resorted to bombing populated centres  such as Port Said and Damascus  causing many civilian casualties. Israel's continued persistence in carrying out that policy is not only a grave threat to international peace and security but also a serious impediment to the progress of detente and  because of that  it is all the more to be condemned.43.	Since its aggression of 1967  Israel has pursued a policy of systematic defiance of the United Nations Charter  of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and of world public opinion. Consistent with this policy  Israel has persistently aborted several peace initiatives aimed at securing the implementation of Security Council resolutions for the just and durable settlement of the Middle East problems. As a result Israel today is still in occupation of Arab lands acquired by force  and coupled with this continuing act of aggression. Israel is systematically carrying out its plans for the perpetuation of its occupation of Arab lands. Malaysia's sympathies are with the Arab peoples in their efforts to regain their lost territories.44.	Israel stands condemned not only for its aggression against Arab countries but equally for its refusal to honour and implement General Assembly resolutions on the question of Palestine. After more than 25 years the Palestinians are today still denied their inalienable right to self-determination  and continue to live in enforced exile with increasing misery and mounting desperation.45.	The renewed armed hostilities in the Middle East further emphasize the urgent need for the solution of the problem. It is more urgent than ever  more urgent than perhaps we care to admit  for this Organization to secure justice and peace for the Middle East on the basis of complete Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territories and of respect for the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine. This is a renewed challenge for the United Nations  and more particularly for the major Powers with special responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security  for which  in view of their new commitment and vita! stake in the further relaxation of international tension  this is also a challenge of detente.46.	I turn now to other developments in the international scene  some of which are positive in character. Of particular interest to us in Asia is the agreement reached recently between Pakistan and India and Bangladesh. We welcome this whole-heartedly. We hope it will bring to a quick end the misery and sufferings of thousands of those separated from their loved ones. The agreement is an important step towards final reconciliation among the countries on the South Asian subcontinent  with all of which my country enjoys the best of relations. My delegation earnestly hopes that the initiatives already begun will continue and lead towards the final attainment of a just and lasting peace. It is also our sincere hope that Bangladesh will be admitted to membership in the United Nations at the earliest possible opportunity.47.	We welcome also the constructive efforts by both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to work towards a peaceful solution of their problem and thereby contribute to the relaxation of tension in that area. The dialogue between the two countries is an important break-through in the impasse which has for so long kept the two Koreas in confrontation with each other. We recognize the enormity of the problem between them  but at least the efforts towards reconciliation have begun. As a country enjoying friendly diplomatic relations with both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea  Malaysia hopes that these efforts will eventually bring about not only peace but national reunification of the two divided countries.48.	In our constant striving for international peace and security  the most historic and significant achievement since this General Assembly last met took place in the region of South-East Asia. That was the signing of thepeace agreements on Viet-Nam. These agreements have been welcomed and endorsed by the international community since they provide a realistic and fair basis for the peaceful settlement of the Viet-Nam problem. It is clearly the duty of the international community to help in the implementation of these agreements and to ensure that nothing is done to jeopardize the chances of an early settlement of the problem and therefore delay the restoration of peace and stability in South-East Asia. The people of Viet-Nam should be allowed to decide their own future without further interference by outside Powers. It is indeed tragic in human terms for the people of Viet-Nam that even when the country is formally at peace they should continue to endure the agony and ravages of war. This should serve to emphasize the urgency of the strict implementation of the Paris agreements and scrupulous adherence to all their provisions by all parties concerned. After more than two decades of war and devastation  nothing should now be done to undermine and destroy the solid foundation on which peace should be built in South-East Asia.49.	We welcome also the signing of the Vientiane Agreement  as another positive contribution towards peace-building in Indo-China in particular  and in a broader sense in the region of South-East Asia. The strict application of the Agreement is therefore important and essential if peace and stability are to be restored and national harmony established in accordance with the aspirations and wishes of the people of Laos.50.	With regard to Cambodia  it is deeply regretted that no agreement has as yet been attained to stop the armed conflict. We hope that the parties in the conflict will achieve a peaceful settlement of their problem. And in this connexion we believe that the people of that country should be allowed to determine their own future without interference from outside  and that the parties concerned should be allowed to take their own initiatives and work for the reconciliation and settlement of the problem in accordance with their own wishes. Nothing  therefore  should be done that would prejudge the wishes of the Khmer people as this would constitute interference in their affairs. The best contribution we can make towards peace in Cambodia is to show complete and scrupulous respect for the right of the Khmer people to unfettered freedom  without outside interference of any form  to reconcile their differences and achieve a peaceful settlement and national reconciliation.51.	I would now like to address myself to another area which is of serious concern to the international community. I refer in particular to apartheid in South Africa and colonial oppression in Namibia  Zimbabwe  Angola  Mozambique  Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde  and other remaining colonial Territories. The peoples of these countries are experiencing the most serious forms of exploitation and oppression  and the failure of the world community to redress their situation has led them to resort to the only legitimate action left that promises some hope of recovering their fundamental human rights and dignity — that of armed struggle. The recent declaration of independence by Guinea-Bissau is an important development m the struggle of the African peoples against Portuguese colonialism in that continent. The fact remains  however  that the colonialist and racist regimes in Africa arc now even more entrenched in their position  convinced that some of their powerful friends and trading partners  some of which are permanent members of the Security Council  will obstruct any effective action by the United Nations. The persistent repression carried out by these regimes constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and a grave threat to international peace and security.52.	One of the most serious and urgent problems confronting mankind is that of general and complete disarmament. No true and lasting peace is possible while the question of disarmament hangs in the balance. In view of the awesome consequences to mankind of a nuclear holocaust. it is imperative that all nations subscribe to constructive efforts towards the goal of general and complete disarmament. Merely to give verbal acquiescence to disarmament is not enough. It is the hope of my delegation that the spirit of detente will generate a political will among the major Powers seriously to apply themselves to the question of disarmament  for it is they  the major Powers  which  with the awesome arsenals Of destruction in their possession  have the final responsibility for saving mankind from self-annihilation.53.	We recognize that there has been significant progress in this important field of disarmament where a number of agreements have been signed since 1963 for partial disarmament measures.54.	But while these significant gains are being made it is with grave concern that my delegation views the recent nuclear tests in complete disregard of world opinion. Both from the point of view of the dangers they pose to the environment and of their effects on the spiralling arms race all forms of nuclear testing must be halted. This is one of the crucial problems which the General Assembly must tackle with the utmost urgency and seriousness. Mankind has a right to demand the cessation of all nuclear testing in all environments. A treaty on such a comprehensive test ban is long overdue.55.	Having recognized that the question of disarmament is crucial to the attainment of true and durable peace  my delegation would like once again reiterate its support for the convening of a world disarmament conference under the auspices of the United Nations and pledge its readiness to play a role in that conference.56.	Another way by which we  the smaller nations  may contribute to disarmament is by creating conditions favourable to the relaxation of tension. In this belief  we welcome and support efforts for the creation of zones of peace. Malaysia  as a signatory to the Kuala Lumpur Declaration of 27 November 197L3 which seeks to establish South-East Asia as a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality  welcomed and is working for the establishment of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. It is of great interest to us that an area bordering upon our region should be meeting the challenge of detente by seeking to make itself free of big-Power hegemony and interference. In the same spirit  we salute the Treaty of Tlatclolco   which establishes Latin America as a nuclear-free zone. Malaysia equally welcomes all moves for the creation of other zones of peace and would pledge its support  sympathy and encouragement to those who seek to establish such zones.57.	As regards the proposal for making South-East Asia a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality  Malaysia lakes a realistic approach. The proposal seeks to withdraw the region of South-East Asia from being an arena for major-Power contest for spheres of influence. But we do not see the zone as a tight-knit inward-looking entity that would seek to deprive outside Powers of all their interests in the region. Rather  we envisage a situation where there will be no inhibition upon the pursuit of legitimate interests by all foreign Powers  restricting only the pursuit of illegitimate interests. The proposal additionally seeks to enhance co-operation among States in the region and to develop a sense of regionalism so that all who belong to the region need not feel themselves in a hostile environment. Towards that end Malaysia has established diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and  together with our partners in the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEANJ  we are committed to the expansion of this Association to include all States in the region.58.	A committee of senior officials of the signatory nations of the Kuala Lumpur Declaration has been at work to draw up the blueprint for the establishment of the zone. It is the view of Malaysia that satisfactory progress is being made  and upon completion of the blueprint a significant step will have been taken towards the point in time when States in the region begin the process of phasing in the South-East Asian zone of peace  freedom and neutrality  It is our hope that the sense of brotherhood and kinship that we expect to evolve from our partnership in the proposed zone will result in a solidarity that will prevent our differences from assuming proportions which in the past have resulted in their exploitation by those outside the region  to our terrible cost.59.	Malaysia is encouraged by the understanding and support already given to this proposal  particularly by the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in August in Ottawa and the fourth non-aligned summit Conference in September in Algiers. The declared will of the major Powers to work towards true and permanent peace  and their profession of the spirit of detente are grounds for further encouragement for the realization of this regional initiative.60.	Before I move to the problems confronting us on the international economic scene  I would like to address myself briefly to the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Malaysia has profound interest in the Conference and hopes that it will achieve positive results in establishing an equitable basis upon which the resources of the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction could be shared among the nations of the world. It is also our hope that the Conference will achieve agreements on a wide range of issues  such as the question of sovereignty over territorial seas  to which Malaysia as a littoral State attaches the utmost importance. Malaysia takes an active interest in the subjects and issues that have been seriously considered by the sea-bed Committee  and will work positively towards the establishment of a law of the sea that would be more fair and realistic  and one that would take into account the legitimate interests and rights of all States  particularly those in the developing world.61.	In the economic and social fields  the problems confronting the developing countries continue to cry out for attention. Most of the developing countries are beset with problems of mass poverty  unemployment  malnutrition  hunger  disease  maldistribution of income  low levels of productivity  an inadequate net flow of external resources and an increasing debt burden. These are not new problems. Yet  despite our best intentions and despite the efforts of the international community  the problems continue to confront us with growing complexity and increasing urgency. The fact is that time is not on our side. The third world cannot afford the luxury of waiting at the pleasure of the developed countries before we can hope to receive a sympathetic hearing or a helping hand from the richer and more industrialized countries  most of which laid the foundations of their present-day prosperity through the exploitation of the human and natural resources of the developing countries. If detente in practical terms means the finding of a modus vivendi among the richer and more powerful countries on the issues of peace and security without at the same time making a perceptible and measurable movement towards finding a solution to the problems of economic and social development facing the developing countries  then detente for the developing countries will fall short of our expectations.62.	In 1970  in an atmosphere filled with promise and hope  we adopted the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. Yet  with only two years gone by  the signs are very ominous  and the preliminary assessment is not at all encouraging. The Committee on Development Planning  a committee of experts  has concluded in its report  that the Strategy remains very much more a wish than a policy  and it goes on to say that the cause of development has lost momentum. No doubt we will be discussing the question of review and appraisal of the Second United Nations Development Decade in greater detail later. Suffice it for me to say here that the objective of the discussions should not be to make recriminations or to apportion blame but to infuse the Strategy with new life and lift it from the doldrums by identifying the shortfalls and reasons for them and by bringing it up to date with the inclusion of fresh ideas and innovations that have come to the forefront since the Strategy was adopted. A concerted effort has to be made to ensure that the provisions of the Strategy are implemented. Developed countries should not seize upon the reservations and objections they entered when the Strategy was adopted as an excuse to evade their responsibilities. What is needed is the political will among all of us  more particularly by the developed countries  to make a true success of the Strategy.63.	One area where there is a need for the political will to manifest itself is on the question of official development assistance under the Strategy. Not only has such development assistance from the developed countries fallen short of the prescribed target  but the rate has in fact shown some decline. This is indeed a matter of grave concern  and one which undoubtedly will be given great attention in our later deliberations.64.	In a period which stands out singularly for its lack of initiatives in the field of trade  the multinational trade negotiations now taking place represent a welcome initiative on the part of the developed countries. However  following the experience gained from the previous rounds of negotiations  developing countries cannot but express guarded optimism at the outcome of the current negotiations. What is of paramount importance to the developing countries is that their interests are not lost sight of and that they would indeed gain tangible and lasting benefits from trade liberalization measures which will be discussed at the negotiations. This is not asking for much  for such measures would have mutually beneficial results  both for the developed and for the developing countries. More trade would mean that the developing countries would be able to increase not only the tempo of their development efforts through the expansion of their export earnings  but also their purchases from developed countries  thus eventually contributing to a viable system of world trade and payments.65.	The progress made towards that end will be consolidated if we can  at the same time  bring about reforms in the present unstable monetary system as soon as possible  resulting in a stable and durable monetary order that will take into account the special interests of the developing countries and the need for them to participate fully in the decision-making process.66.	Since I have said much about developed countries and what is expected of them  it may justifiably be asked what sort of role developing countries themselves should play. The answer to this is clearly stated in the Strategy: the developing countries themselves bear the primary responsibility for their own economic and social development. The Strategy also establishes the well-being of the individual as the ultimate objective of development.67.	Malaysia is mindful of that  and all our national efforts are geared towards that objective. As our Prime Minister has said  ""No plan is good enough until it has reached the people and has received their acquiescence."" Hence there is active participation of the people at all levels in the development process. We in Malaysia have learned through painful experience that pursuit of the growth of the gross national product alone is not enough and that socio-cultural factors have also to be taken into account. That is especially so in Malaysia's case  where inequalities in the distribution of income coincide with racial divisions.68.	Hence the main objectives of the second Malaysia plan 1971-1975 are to eradicate poverty among all  to bring about a more equitable distribution of income  to ensure balanced development between the urban and rural areas  to create more employment opportunities for the growing labour force  to eradicate racial distinction in economic functions and to restructure society as a whole. In addition to that  the Malaysian Government has also oriented its educational programmes towards meeting the increasing demands for technical and managerial skills and is pursuing an active policy on family planning. Thus our development plan aims not only at the economic betterment of the country but at achieving it in a way that will improve the quality of life of all our people and promote the unity of the nation.69.	In order to meet the challenge of economic development it is imperative that the developing countries improve their bargaining position vis-à-vis the developed countries. The developing countries are individually prone to the vagaries of international economic and financial relations  and find themselves at the mercy of market forces dominated by the developed countries. Developing countries are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of mutual assistance  cooperation and self-reliance among themselves. It is only by standing together  by trading more with one another  by establishing institutional frameworks within which such trade can be conducted and by exchanging experiences which are relevant to the aspirations of their peoples that they can reduce the impact of adverse developments on their economies and development efforts.70.	That point was underscored by the recent summit meeting of non-aligned countries. The meeting called for the convening of a conference of developing countries on commodities which would give them the opportunity to work for a fair deal in world trade. That will go a long way in improving the bargaining position of the third world. The success achieved by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] in that respect is a very good example of what can be achieved through action based on solidarity and co-operation. If developing countries take those steps we shall then have achieved something we can be truly proud of.71.	In conclusion I wish to say that my delegation looks to the future not only with great expectations but also with the realization that those expectations can reach fruition only if we respond with dynamism to changing situations. Rarely has mankind faced such a challenge and opportunity as we now; see before us. It is vital that the nations of the world have the strength and the wisdom to rise to the occasion and meet this challenge and opportunity with a positive and dynamic response. For only then can we bring ourselves nearer to the attainmentof universal peace and a better quality of life for all."
"80",5037,"NER",28,1973,"﻿230.	May I extend to the President  on behalf of the delegation of the Republic of the Niger  my sincere and heartfelt congratulations upon his brilliant election to the office of President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. This judicious choice is a tribute paid not only to his country but also to his distinguished qualities and his great experience with international problems.231.	My congratulations are addressed also to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  of the Polish People's Republic  whose great competence made it possible for us to achieve fruitful results at the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly.232.	As for the Secretary-General  he may be assured at all times of our confidence and our .support in any actions that he may be required to undertake in the interest of the international community. I must add that we have been greatly appreciative of his presence in Addis Ababa for the celebration of the tenth anniversary of OAU. It was considered by. us as evidence of the interest he has in specific problems arising in our continent.233.	This twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly was marked immediately after its opening by an event of very great importance. I am referring to the admission to our Organization of three new Member States  namely  the Federal Republic of Germany  the German Democratic Republic  and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. On behalf of the Government of the Republic of the Niger  I should like to express our great satisfaction at the decision taken by the General Assembly and welcome warmly the representatives of these three countries which have now taken their place as full-fledged Members of the world-wide Organization. We are convinced that their admission will bring to our Organization new energy and greater moral political forces.234.	During the year that has elapsed since our last session  other encouraging facts make us optimistic with respect to the future of our international community. First of all  it is always with great satisfaction and even with some relief that we see the great Powers discussing among themselves how to put an end to their differences and to establish a co-operation that will be free from any war-like attitudes.235.	Thus  in the Republic of the Niger we have considered the contacts which took place between the United States and the People's Republic of China  on the one hand  and the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  on the other  as salient features in modern events. A new positive step was taken on 22 June 1973 through the signing in Washington by President Nixon and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Mr. Leonid Brezhnev  of the Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War. In our opinion  this agreement marks the birth of a new era in relations between the two super-Powers.236.	In the Asian continent the situation is much better than it was a year ago."" Indeed  it is with unanimous relief that the whole world welcomed the agreements signed inParis on 27 January 1973  putting an end to the war in VietNam. But the cessation of hostilities does not mean necessarily the establishment of peace. It is more necessary than ever to help the Viet-Namese people to recover from one of the most difficult trials that any country has ever had in its history. More than ever  the international community ought to do everything in its power to accelerate the process of a rapid restoration of peace in this shattered country so as to make its reconstruction possible.237.	The recent agreement concluded on 28 August between India and Pakistan comes at an opportune time in putting an end finally to a situation which earlier kept enveloping the subcontinent in flames.238.	Moreover  the talks that have been in progress for nearly two years between the two Koreas with a view to their reunification lead us to believe that there again ground for agreement is always possible. The Niger  faithful to its policy of dialogue and harmony  is bound to encourage all efforts undertaken to promote the self-determination of peoples in accordance with the Charter in an atmosphere of serenity and independence. The Niger therefore will give its firm support to the efforts made by these two parts of Korea with a view to a peaceful settlement of their differences.239.	But if there is reason for hope in Viet-Nam  in India  in Pakistan  in Korea and in Laos  we are bound to recognize that this is not the case in the other part of the Indo-Chinese peninsula — Cambodia. For more than three years this country has been unjustly enduring the atrocities of a devastating and deadly war imposed by foreign forces.240.	This is for us an opportunity to make a solemn appeal to all the sources of goodwill  to the great Powers in particular  to refrain from certain types of interventions that are not in conformity with the spirit and letter of the United Nations Charter  but which are directed against weaker countries  interventions which can have no other result but to aggravate their state of under-development.241.	With regard to Europe  our country is gratified at the establishment of a climate of detente between East and West. We are following with keen interest the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. We hope that it will show tangible results and that this will inevitably have as its consequence the establishment of a better climate of peace in this part of the world.242.	But what are we to say of the preoccupying situation in the Middle East? In spite of the mediation of Mr. Gunnar Jarring  in spite of the various resolutions of the Security Council  in spite of all manner of steps undertaken in various parts of the world  there is still not the slightest ray of hope. This impasse is due to the intransigence of Israel and to its obstinate refusal to apply Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967  which calls upon it to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories.243.	Moreover  if we are to judge by certain inhuman acts  in particular the destruction of the Libyan airliner which resulted in more than 100 innocent victims  and the hijacking of a Lebanese airliner  we are led to believe that Israel takes pleasure in adopting an aggressive attitude. That is why the Niger  imbued with a spirit of equity anddesirous not to maintain relations with a country which is not seeking peace and which is violating deliberately the principles of our Charter  has decided to break its diplomatic relations with Israel. The Niger  as President Diori Hamani stated  ""condemns all actions whose purpose is occupation or annexation of all or part of the territory of a sovereign State"". Moreover  it is clear that the restoration of peace can be effective in the Middle East only through the recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.244.	The behaviour of certain Governments of southern Africa is scarcely different from that of Israel. Most recently  at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries at Algiers  in speaking of the tragic situation which is prevailing in this region  President Diori Hamani stated in particular:""The wounds in the side of our continent  in Angola  in Mozambique  in Southern Rhodesia  in Namibia  in South Africa and in Guinea-Bissau are there to remind us at all times of the indescribable suffering endured daily by the African populations of these regions. The violent and criminal attacks committed by Portugal and its unquestioned allies in Rhodesia and South Africa against certain independent African States  the mass murders of innocent populations of the kind we saw perpetrated by the Portuguese colonial troops in Mozambique which the international press echoed  and  finally  the cowardly murder of Amilcar Cabral  this gallant leader of PAIGC8 whom we all esteemed  are so many facts which must incite the countries of the third world and those of Africa in particular to close their ranks even further for a decisive battle against the sworn enemies of our freedom.""Our common action must tend towards one and the same goal  which is that of determining the best possible means not only for ensuring rapid decolonization of the African continent  but also for making the international community and the great Powers end their unpardonable inertia. The numerous resolutions voted by the General Assembly as well as by the Security Council and also by the specialized agencies  resolutions which condemn in no uncertain terms the Governments of Pretoria  Salisbury and Lisbon for their ill-considered policies  have remained dead letters and have convinced us extensively and for some considerable time of their inefficiency.""The moral prestige of our Organization is thus seriously compromised. It is for us to take stock again  before it is too late  if we wish to prevent the United Nations from suffering the same fate as that of the defunct League of Nations. Unfailing solidarity and an energetic attitude on the part of the peoples of the third world before as crucial a problem as this are bound to wear down the guilt-tarnished inertia of certain great Powers vis-à-vis the racist and colonialist regimes.""245.	It is indeed evident that if the great Powers  by placing themselves above certain petty and selfish interests  were to adopt by common agreement a more energetic attitude and were to withdraw their support from thosescandalous regimes  the latter would be very quickly led to compromise.246.	Africa  the third world and the international organizations  thus rid of the problems of decolonization  could then embark upon nobler actions: the search for peace in the world  and the economic and social development of the poorer peoples.247.	That is why we again make a solemn appeal to the great Western Powers to halt their support of those anachronistic regimes so that a solution might be found to these agonizing problems.248.	The Niger  faithful to its commitment to African peoples that are still under foreign domination  was there to display  through the voice of its President  its solidarity with the brother people of Guinea-Bissau  which has just proclaimed its independence as a republic. The message addressed to Mr. Aristide Pereira on that occasion calls for no comment  and I merely quote it:""I am particularly pleased to extend to you the warmest congratulations of the people  party and Government of the Niger on the solemn proclamation of independence as a republic by your great party  PAIGC.""The people of the Niger  fully conscious of the historic importance of this event  which sounds the death-knell of Portuguese colonialism in Africa  unreservedly associates itself with the legitimate joy of the brother people of Guinea today.""In paying a heartfelt tribute to your gallant fighters  worthy heirs of that brave and ever-lamented son of Africa  Amilcar Cabral  we wish that their fight for freedom may come to a swift and successful conclusion.""We assure you of our unfailing support.""While awaiting impatiently the opportunity to welcome very soon to the great African family of the Organization of African Unity your nation which has already become the object of pride of the independent African nations  we wish every success to the brother people of Guinea-Bissau  to PAIGC  to President Luis Cabral  and to yourself in the immense task of national reconstruction.""(Signed) Diori Hamani 249.	To mark the defeat of Portuguese colonialism in Africa  our commitment goes beyond that message of support. Indeed  the Government of the Niger  on 22 September  published a communique confirming its recognition of the State of Guinea-Bissau.250.	By that recognition  it has committed itself to support any action aimed at the admission of Guinea-Bissau as an independent and sovereign State to the United Nations and to all international agencies.251.	If in political terms  in spite of a few black marks which remain on the scene  there is room for hope  the same does not hold true on the economic level  where the rich are growing richer and the poor are becoming evenpoorer  in spite of the meritorious efforts that they are daily making in the interest of their own survival.252.	Indeed  since the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] in Santiago  Chile  two years have elapsed and we are still very far from the 1 per cent of the gross national product of the industrialized countries which was considered as the minimum indispensable goal.253.	Moreover  all recent statistics  particularly those of the Development Assistance Committee  clearly show that development assistance is falling off dangerously.254.	For a certain number of years  the countries of the third world have constantly  in all international forums  been calling  but in vain  for a link to be established between special drawing rights and development financing. We will soon have completed the first half of the Second Development Decade  with no indication of any improvement in the situation.255.	The most pathetic declarations  the most appealing promises by the great Powers  have unfortunately taken the form of excessive use of the right of veto each time they felt their interests to be threatened.256.	At the fifty-fifth session of the Economic and Social Council  held in Geneva in July and August last  the Director-General of FAO stated that for 20 years grain stocks had never been lower or prices higher.257.	Thus it is in these circumstances  dramatic in themselves  that my country  which on the morrow of its independence had set up a system of regional co-operation and of national institutions designed to ensure its economic and social development  was brutally struck  like many neighbouring Sahelian countries  by a climatic phenomenon unprecedented in the annals of its history.258.	That drought  which has now lasted for more than six years and which reached a devastating level in 1972  has brought about an enormous food deficit to which radio  press and television networks throughout the world have referred.259.	This enormous deficit has not only engendered famine  but has in its wake bred malnutrition  epidemics and a massive rural exodus towards the urban centres and even towards the neighbouring countries to the south to which nature was kinder.260.	That drought  by destroying our vast grazing lands  has brought about the loss of 50 to 100 per cent of our livestock  depending on the region  and has resulted in the drying up of most of the wells in the northern part of our country.261.	But the effect of that natural catastrophe does not stop there.262. The drop in agricultural exports  by virtually wiping out our foreign exchange earnings  has also brought aconsiderable reduction in capital and consumer goods and will deal a serious blow to our fledgling processing industries which  even under ordinary circumstances  had great difficulty in maintaining a normal growth rate.263.	In the face of this natural calamity  and to deal with the most urgent problems  my Government has created a solidarity fund supported by the voluntary contributions of our own nationals and of all men of goodwill whatever their origins. This fund has been used  and still serves  for the purchase and transportation of food-stuffs towards our afflicted populations.264.	If this national effort has been a success  we are pleased to note that international solidarity  for its part  has also turned out not to be a vain expression. Indeed  this international solidarity has been demonstrated in the dispatch of food  medicines and means of transport.265.	This is an opportunity for me to thank here  publicly  on behalf of the Government and people of the Niger  those friendly countries  governmental and non-governmental organizations  institutions and private individuals who gave generously and in a brotherly way to aid our populations afflicted by disease  hunger and thirst.266.	For my country  the coming year may well be even worse than the past one. Indeed  in several of our regions  first the rains came too late  and then they stopped in mid August  even before the plants had reached the mid point of their growth cycle.267.	In the zones where some hopes might have been cherished  this period of premature drought has resulted in the resurgence of grain-destroying caterpillars.268.	My Government  still in its search for the most efficient solutions  has resorted to modern technology for artificial rain tests.269.	These tests  while very conclusive  unfortunately were undertaken too late and were thereby unable to have any beneficial effect upon this year's harvest. They have  nevertheless  had the advantage of showing that in the future this science could be one of the keys to our problem.270.	After the emergency measures that I have mentioned above  the Government of the Niger considered a long-term programme which is centred on three points essentially: first  water control  including rain water  surface water or ground water  the purpose of which is to make it possible to develop several millions of hectares through irrigation; secondly  reforestation  through which we hope to fight intensively against the spreading desert  which is seriously threatening a good portion of our national territory; thirdly  the restocking of 6ur livestock which  as I said earlier  was very largely decimated. Reconstitution of livestock is vital because the Niger  whose economy is essentially agricultural and pastoral  derives a substantial part of its export earnings from the sale of meat and hides.271.	This vast undertaking calls for the mobilization of enormous capital and the Niger cannot cope alone. That is why the President of the Republic of the Niger  His Excellency Diori Hamani  had advocated a type of ""Marshall Plan for the Great Sahel"" which  and I quote him:""... should take the form of collateral and even of joint collateral given by Governments and international agencies to a large loan floated on the world  financial market.""This formula has shown its worth at other times and in other places  both on small and very large scales. By analogy with the situation of Europe in ruins as it emerged from the war  it may be thought that the elaboration  implementation and success of such a plan are possible and desirable — possible  given the enormous mass of idle capital throughout the world  reserves of which are being threatened by monetary erosion and inflation.""272.	The six countries of the Sahel struck by this natural calamity  given the similarity of their problems and the immensity of their needs  have organized themselves into subregions and have set up an interstate committee with its headquarters at Ouagadougou.273.	At the beginning of September  a conference of experts and ministers of production of the six countries  reporting to the conference of the Heads of State and Government  had given the outline of a short- and long-term programme for which we are asking financing from friendly countries and the international community.274.	That programme will be brought to the knowledge of our august Assembly by the President of Upper Volta  Mr. Sangoule Lamizana  whom his peers have appointed to perform this task.275.	The most fervent and most ardent wish of the delegation of the Niger at this twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly is that the third world will finally see the industrialized countries in general and the superPowers in particular using their advanced technology and the power of their gross national product for the establishment of a world economically balanced  politically united and socially fraternal."
"81",5082,"NGA",28,1973,"﻿2.	 I am particularly delighted with the opportunity to address this Assembly. This is my first visit here in this capacity and already I feel that I am among friends. This is as it should be. For we are all united by our desire to translate into reality the philosophy behind the founding of this world body. It was the hope of the founding fathers that this Organization  representing peoples of different political  cultural  economic and social backgrounds  should be an effective instrument for harmonizing different views  reconciling competing interests and concerting such action as would give substance to mankind's aspirations for peace and plenty in justice and dignity. Ideals nobler than these for structuring a world order will definitely be difficult to find. To live up to such high expectations is the great challenge before all of us who are assembled here.3.	Permit me  Mr. President  to convey to you my heartiest congratulations on your election as President of this twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. It is a fitting tribute to your sterling qualities as a diplomat who has rendered distinguished services not only to your country  but also to the international community as a whole. Your election is also a well-deserved honour for your country Ecuador  with which my country enjoys warm relations  and which has shown consistent adherence to the principles and purposes of our Charter. I have no doubt that under your wise guidance this session of the General Assembly will achieve great success.4.	My congratulations also go to the members of your Bureau and to the distinguished Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who  since his assumption of office  has brought great dedication and sense of personal commitment to his heavy task. I wish him continued success and God's blessing. I wish also to place formally on record my appreciation of the excellent services rendered to this Organization and humanity by the past Secretaries-General  particularly the late Dag Hammarskjold and U Thant.5.	Thirteen years ago my country was admitted as the ninety-ninth Member of this Organization. On that occasion  the then Prime Minister of Nigeria  the late Sir Abu-bakar Tafawa Balewa  expressed the belief of Nigeria in the United Nations as the only effective machinery for bringing about world peace and the progress of mankind generally. Today  I wish to reaffirm my country's faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We in Nigeria believe that if all Members States adhere strictly to the provisions of our Charter  as an earnest of their dedication to the ideals of our Organization  then we may yet accomplish that unique and bright promise for all mankind which the United Nations represents.6.	I am a strong believer in the United Nations. I therefore find it rather disturbing that the image which some people tend to have of the United Nations is a misleading one of lack of dramatic success in dealing immediately with some of the major problems of peace and security  of human rights  and the degrading poverty of a large majority of the world's population. Proceeding from such a viewpoint  the conclusion is often heard that this Organization is hardly any more relevant to our times. I do not share such pessimism  and I venture to suggest that most Africans would not accept such a doleful assessment of the United Nations. We are all well aware of its shortcomings and its failings. These are  in some measure  a reflection of the world which produced and now operates the Organization. It is necessary to seek to improve its effectiveness  but we in Africa hope that the States Members of the United Nations will embark on such a process in a manner that would not do damage to this Organization which is so vital to the vast underprivileged  as yet developing  population of the third world. 7.	For millions of such peoples throughout the world  the United Nations provides an indispensable forum for bringing to world attention  some of the problems that plague the world  and for which  all too often  no other means of solution are apparent. The United Nations can and does bring to bear the moral weight of world opinion on many a controversial issue. That explains its great value to the smaller nations and to the dispossessed and downtrodden peoples of the world. For example  it is clear that without the moral pressure exerted on colonial Powers  principally by this Organization  the struggle for self-determination and independence would definitely have been more difficult for many of the nations that are today proud Members of the United Nations. Nor can we ignore the invaluable services rendered by the Organization and its specialized agencies in the vital areas of health  literacy campaigns  child welfare and the championship of progressive labour legislation on a world-wide basis.8.	It cannot be over-emphasized that the primary purpose of the United Nations is ""to save mankind from the scourge of war"". Unfortunately  we have not always attained this lofty objective. There have been breaches of peace  such as in Korea  and Viet-Nam  with consequences no less dismal and harrowing for those affected. However  since 1945  there has been no global war such as mankind experienced to its horror during the first half of this century. It is to the credit of this Organization that  even when conflicts do occur between nations in recent times  peaceful intervention by the United Nations has succeeded in arresting them. In other areas of the world  the United Nations continues to play a key and vital role in providing physical stability and preventing a deterioration of unhappy and unstable political and social conditions. It is  therefore  not unjustified that we should look back on the 28 years of the existence of this Organization with some degree of satisfaction. The little measure of stability and hope that the world and its many peoples have been given these past 28 years has been worthy of the long hours spent in this hall as well as in the chambers of the Security Council and other organs of the United Nations.9.	Of course  to acknowledge these areas of achievement of the United Nations should by no means lull us into a sense of complacency. As in every human organization  there are areas of United Nations activities that cry out for urgent attention and improvement. Among these is the imperative need to correct the structural and institutional deficiencies that hamstring some of its operations. When the Charter was framed  five nations were entrusted with the responsibility of ""policing"" the whole world. In the prevailing circumstances of those days such an arrangement might have been justifiable and acceptable. It is no longer so today. An urgent review of the decision-making processes in the United Nations system  taking into full account existing political realities  is long overdue. I need hardly say that one area of immediate concern is the increasing use of the veto in the Security Council in support of causes which seem to be in conflict with the noble objectives of the Charter. In this connexion  it must be emphasized that African nations  and indeed most nations of the world  have been distressed at the constant use of the veto to block meaningful initiatives in matters relating to fundamental human rights  freedom and human dignity in many areas of the world and  in particular  in parts of Africa still under foreign or minority regimes. It is our hope  therefore  that the nations which at present enjoy the privileges of veto power should use it responsibly in furtherance of world peace and the progress of mankind.10.	The Secretary-General has  in the introduction to his latest report on the work of the Organization  invited us to participate in a ""constructive debate"" about the future of this Organization [A/9001/Add. 1  p.l]. It is my hope that in responding to this invitation all Member States would advance proposals that would ensure that the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations are implemented by all Member States.11.	It is a matter for great relief that in the world today preoccupation with outmoded rivalries and enmities on the one hand  and ideological distrusts and suspicions on the other is now being progressively replaced by the spirit of accommodation. The admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic into the United Nations justifies the expectation that before long there will be genuine universality of representation in this Organization. I congratulate them  as well as the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  on their admission.12.	While commending the important steps towards ending the legacies of the Second World War in Europe  we must state that steps towards normalization of the situation in that continent should be matched by the continuing search for peace  understanding and co-operation throughout the world. The search for peace and security must be in a global context and must involve the active participation of all countries. We welcome agreements between the superpowers inasmuch as these agreements lessen the fear and threat of nuclear warfare. However  we are compelled to call on the super-Powers to resist the temptation of limiting their negotiating spirit only to such issues as are of narrow interest to them and their people. We must insist that their negotiations and agreements which affect the fate of others should take account of the views of those concerned. For every nation and every country  great or small  rich or poor  has a stake in peace and security. It is therefore essential that each should participate  on the basis of sovereign equality  in resolving issues of concern to the whole world.13.	A few months ago the Organization of African Unity [OA U\ celebrated its tenth anniversary. I had the great privilege of presiding over the ceremonies and the tenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU. I should like to express the deep appreciation of OAU and all the people of Africa to the United Nations for the co-operation  inspiration and assistance that have continued to characterize the relations between our regional organization and this world body. We highly appreciate the constant interest of the United Nations as an institution  and the unfailing concern of the Secretary-General and the various agencies in developments in Africa and the progress of OAU. All this is in keeping with the spirit of Article 52  which encourages regional organizations ""consistent with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations"".14.	The Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights contributed significantly to the basis and the charter of OAU. Permit me  therefore  to make some observations about how our regional organization has been addressing itself to the many problems confronting our continent.15.	The birth of OAU in 1963 was a great act of faith  and its response to the challenges of modern times has filled all Africans with joy and immense pride. After only 10 years we have overcome some of the earlier impediments and difficulties in our way. Independent countries from all parts of Africa  with a variety of historical  political  linguistic and social backgrounds  are now united in our organization  which has come to be recognized as the voice of our continent.16.	Of course  when we reviewed the various activities of OAU at that meeting we acknowledged that we had not achieved all our objectives. Indeed  it would have been difficult to achieve every single one of our aims and objectives in a short decade  given the uncertainties and unforeseen contingencies of world events. However  we have succeeded in consolidating our national independence  and in settling among ourselves and without distracting attention from outside Africa  many such intra-African disputes that have arisen. We have launched many economic and social programmes for improving the quality of life of our peoples in a spirit of self-reliance.17.	We have brought the meaning of African unity and co-operation much nearer to each African's heart. We have continued to uphold  as central to the problems of our continent  the spirit of self-sacrifice  of compromise  and of reconciliation. We have pledged to redouble our efforts with a view to eradicating all forms of colonialism and racism from our continent  and thus assume control of our continent's destiny. Above all  OAU has symbolized the collective effort of the Governments of Africa and their peoples to uphold for ever the dignity and stature of the African in this world.18.	The problem posed by the continuation of colonialism  racism and apartheid is the most intractable problem that has confronted us on the continent. Not only do colonialism  racism and apartheid constitute an unbearable affront on human dignity in the areas where those evils exist; they represent a great threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of independent African States and to international peace and security. Thirteen years after the adoption of United Nations resolution 1514 (XV) on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples  more than 30 million Africans  spread over about one-sixth of our continent  continue to be denied their human rights  exploited and subjugated under minority  racist and colonial regimes. In defiance of world public opinion and in contemptuous disregard of the decisions of all international organizations of African unity  those regimes have fanatically frustrated and resisted all attempts at introducing constitutional changes designed to involve  in simple justice  the majority of the inhabitants of those lands in the processes that govern their destiny and their daily lives. Thus denied constantly of their basic and legitimate rights  and bereft of all hope of change by an impervious and inflexible ruling class  is it any wonder that the voice of despair is turning reasonable men who desire nothing but peace and progress to their frightful alternatives offered by constant frustration and loss of hope? Can we wonder then that the people are attracted  in such a situation  to the painful alternative of force and conflict? For our part in OAU we have no choice but to give whole-hearted support to the efforts of our unfortunate brothers to restore their legitimate right to self-determination and independence. In the words of the Solemn Declaration on General Policy adopted at our tenth anniversary session:""... our support for the liberation struggle was adopted in response to the legitimate and profound aspirations of our peoples and should be viewed less as a circumstantial community of interests than as an awareness of the common destiny of all peoples of the African continent"".19.	At the same meeting  the African Heads of State and Government viewed with satisfaction the progress made in the decade since the establishment of OAU in the legitimate struggle of the peoples of Angola  Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands  Mozambique  Namibia  Zimbabwe  the Comoro Islands  the so-called French Somaliland  the so-called Spanish Sahara  the Seychelles Islands and the islands of Sao Tome and Principe. The struggle and the pressure will continue in Africa until the stain of this degradation of human dignity has been removed and until the African  everywhere on his continent  can raise his head proudly in independence and self-determination and thereby be able to contribute his quota to world progress.20.	In this regard  Mr. President  let me commend to you and to members of this honourable Assembly the bold and momentous step taken by the long-oppressed people of Guinea-Bissau and their political party in declaring their country independent. We in Africa believe that the struggle for final consolidation of the independence of this new nation will be much assisted by the practical support and co-operation which all men of goodwill and all who subscribe to the principles of the Charter of this Organization will extend  promptly and without hesitation  to the efforts of the rightful owners and peoples of Guinea-Bissau.21.	The declaration of independence by the people of Guinea-Bissau has received the overwhelming support of member States of OAU and of the friends of Africa. I should like  on behalf of Africa  to thank those friends for their prompt recognition accorded to that new State. It is our hope  therefore  that that new nation will shortly take its rightful position as a proud member of the international community.22.	What of the special case of Namibia? The situation in Namibia continues to be a source of considerable embarrassment and concern to this Organization. I do not need to go over the various steps that have been taken by the United Nations and its competent organs to bring some rational solution to the situation created in Namibia by the intransigence of the racist regime of South Africa which still occupies that country illegally. The United Nations has endeavoured to carry out its fundamental responsibilities to the hapless people of Namibia by repeatedly providing opportunities for a progressive and peaceful transformation of the situation in the country. It was the hope of many people in different parts of the world that the South African Government would  in its own wider interests  take advantage of the opportunities offered by the United Nations to fulfil its woefully neglected obligations to the people of Namibia.23.	But what have we found? The South African Government is intent upon defying the opinions of the world. Even after the International Court of Justice has expressed opinions which clearly indicated that the South African Government had no further moral or legal right to dominate Namibia  the South African Government continues to subject the people of that country to its Fascist social and political system.24.	One is entitled to ask why it is that of all the Territories that were entrusted to the colonialist Powers under the Trusteeship System  only in Namibia  the Territory entrusted to South Africa  has this international trust been betrayed. All the Territories are today full Members of the United Nations or on their way to independence. We in Africa strongly believe that the United Nations and particularly the permanent members of the Security Council have a duty and responsibility to use all means at their disposal to compel South Africa to withdraw from Namibia and thereafter to assume control of the Territory and to administer it until it attains full independence.25.	Side by side with the steady pressure and progress in the efforts of the liberation movements in various parts of Africa  we witness with dismay the support that continues to be rendered by some nations to two Member States of this Organization that have the dubious distinction in history of being the sole advocates of repression and colonialism and racism. Also  the illegal regime in Salisbury still continues because of the non-compliance by certain Member countries of this Organization with the unanimous decisions of the Organization and of mankind. Perhaps those who prefer to sell a few goods to such an illegal clique  or to buy such commodities as the racists of Salisbury wish to sell in order to maintain themselves in power  have made their own calculations and prefer their temporary material profit to their sense of honour and their position in history.26.	While on this subject  perhaps I should emphasize again the sadness of Africa in the face of the stubborn and unreasonable intransigence of those white regimes that continue to constitute themselves as enemies of Africa and of the third world. Nobody in Africa wishes to adopt the path of armed struggle and conflict against those minority regimes for the love of it. Nobody has asked that people who normally live in Africa and wish to consider themselves as part of Africa should  by any manner or means  be made to feel unwelcome. Those who are born among us and live and join us both in spirit and co-operation are welcome to live in Africa. For they are Africans. It is for this reason that we made genuine efforts to assure the world of our desire for. racial harmony on conditions of mutual respect and fundamental human rights of all the inhabitants of the continent. Is that not a message of hope for the colonialist and racist regimes? The Lusaka Manifesto  which was presented to this Assembly three years ago by my dear friend and brother  President Ahmadou Ahidjo of the United Republic of Cameroon on behalf of Africa   embodied Africa's effort to work out a peaceful solution to the colonial and racial problems of the continent — problems which are not of our own making. What was the response? The colonialist and racist regimes rejected out of hand our peace offer and rewarded us with intensification of repressive laws in the areas under their control  massacres of our people  inspired assassination of the authentic leaders of the African freedom movements  and attacks on independent African countries.27.	Viewed  therefore  against the background of our efforts to initiate peaceful solutions  and the response we got  we are bewildered that several countries which claim to be friends of Africa continue to give such material and moral support to the colonialist and racist regimes  and to strengthen them in their oppression of our peoples. Permit me to appeal again on behalf of Africa to those who give support to our oppressors. It is time for all of us Members of the United Nations to join hands in an effective and total isolation of the colonial and racist regimes in southern Africa. It is time for us to tighten sanctions against the rebel clique in Salisbury. In addition  I appeal to the United Nations and the international community generally  to extend to the liberation movements and to the millions of Africans under severe oppression and exploitation  such material assistance as would ensure fulfilment to the African peoples of the promise held out by the Charter of the United Nations.28.	Time is on the side of the African in the struggle against colonialism and apartheid. Victory is sure to be ours in the war against oppression and deprivation of individual liberty. But the United Nations and its Member countries can render the process less painful and can help to make the road shorter by taking necessary steps before it is too late. By so doing  they would be contributing to the increase of peace and progress  in place of unhappiness and pain and suffering in the world.29.	During our tenth anniversary session  the African Heads of State and Government adopted another document of considerable importance. I refer to the African Declaration on Co-operation  Development and Economic Independence. In the 10 years since OAU was founded  we have observed that the promise of substantial economic development  leading to the path of economic independence  as contained in the charter of OAU  has not been marked by encouraging progress. On the contrary  the pattern has been one of continuing deterioration in the economic and social conditions of African and developing countries generally. The gap between us and the developed countries continues to grow even wider. Measures adopted during the last decade  we found  have been frustrated by other developments in the world at large  over which we have little say and no control. The terms of trade have constantly gone against us. World monetary arrangements have been made without consultations with us and without adequate consideration of our interests.30.	Faced with this situation and firmly convinced that our economic destiny must be taken firmly in our own hands if noticeable improvement is to be achieved  African States solemnly proclaimed their determination to achieve the economic independence and development of the continent through the effective mobilization of Africa's own human and material resources. To this end  we decided to accelerate the implementation of the Africanization policy in each of our countries and to ensure effective and equitable African representation in international organizations.31.	Bearing in mind the loss which Africa has suffered and continues to sustain through the foreign exploitation of its natural resources  we resolved to defend vigorously  continually and jointly  the sovereign rights of our countries to exercise full and effective control over our resources.32.	We believe that the time has come for the rich in this Organization to ponder seriously on the danger of being surrounded by so many poor. In their own self interest  if not for the sake of humanity in general  the rich nations should at least give us an even chance of pulling ourselves up. It is no longer our intention to go cap in hand to the door of the rich. What we want and demand is the opportunity for our own people to be afforded a chance of acquiring those skills and those elements of technology without which no decent and progressive economic system can be structured and maintained in the modern world. We have learned that we cannot expect help  at least not of the order that would make a significant contribution to our own needs of development. But the older  more experienced and more technologically advanced countries can still do much to redeem the pledge they made to humanity and to this Organization by not putting impediments in our way  by making less selfish and lopsided marketing arrangements for our own produce and by facilitating our determination to utilize such resources as we have in the interest of our own peoples. I hope that this session of the General Assembly will approve a constructive idea which emerged from the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973  namely  that a special session of the General Assembly devoted to economic matters should be held in 1975  when we shall be half way through the Second United Nations Development Decade.33.	I shall conclude my address by referring to the urgent and serious problem of the Middle East  an area with which Africa enjoys strong and deep ties.34.	As if the situation whereby about 2 million hapless refugees have been dispossessed of their homelands and virtually condemned to live out their lives in tents was not bad enough  the conditions of ""no war  no peace"" compound the problem. Since June 1967 parts of the territories of States Members of our Organization have remained under foreign occupation by another State Member of the United Nations. When the Security Council adopted its famous resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967  it was widely accepted that the provisions of that resolution formed a balanced framework for an equitable and honourable solution to the crisis. It was the greatest hope for peace based on justice in that region. Not only has peace proved elusive; we are all witnesses to the unspeakable series of aggressions  heartless and mindless brutalities  harassments and massacres  not to speak of air piracies and hijackings  which dominate the news from the area. Needless to say  such conditions are a constant threat to world peace and security.35.	OAU has  in session after session  expressed great concern at the situation. We did even more. As will be recalled  in 1971 a mission of four African Heads of State paid a visit to Egypt and Israel. It was a great honour and privilege for me to have been a member of that mission. Our objective was to see how best OAU  since one of its member nations was involved in the Middle East conflict  could contribute  even if in small measure  to the efforts of the United Nations and others towards a just and peaceful solution or  at any rate  the reduction of the tension of the explosive situation.36.	During its tenth session  held in Addis Ababa-last May  OAU once again reviewed the seemingly intractable situation in the Middle East. It adopted a resolution and charged me  as its current Chairman  with the task of presenting its views to this Assembly.37.	Permit me  therefore  to read out the resolution which was unanimously adopted by the Assembly of African Heads of State and Government:""The OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government  meeting in its Tenth Ordinary Session in Addis Ababa  Ethiopia  from 27 to 29 May 1973 ""Having heard the statement of His Excellency El Shafei  Vice-President of the Arab Republic of Egypt  on the situation in the Middle East in general  and in particular on that resulting from the continued occupation of part of the territory of Egypt since the Israeli aggression of 5 June 1967 ""Recalling all OAU resolutions adopted in this respect  and especially resolution AHG/Res.67 (IX) of the Rabat Summit Conference ""Reaffirming resolution 2949 (XXVII) of the United Nations General Assembly  passed in December 1972 ""Aware of the danger emanating from the deterioration of the situation in the North-East of Africa as a result of the continued aggression perpetrated against the territory of Egypt and other Arab territories — a danger which threatens the security  territorial integrity and unity of our continent ""Noting with deep concern that despite the numerous resolutions of the OAU and the United Nations calling upon it to withdraw from all occupied African and Arab territories  Israel not only persists in refusing to implement resolutions  but also continues to practise a policy with a view to creating in the said territories a state of fait accompli aimed at serving its expansionist designs ""Deploring the systematic obstruction by Israel of all the efforts exerted to reach a peaceful solution to the problem at both the international and African levels ""Recalling in this respect the negative attitude of Israel towards the mission of the ten African Heads of State mandated by the OAU to work for the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967  which stipulated in particular withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the occupied territories  in conformity with the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territories by force ""Noting with satisfaction that the Arab Republic of Egypt has spared no effort to reach a just and durable solution of the problem  and that these efforts have beencharacterized by the constructive co-operation of Egypt with international as well as African forums ""Noting further that the intransigence of Israel and its systematic refusal to abide by the will of the international community constitutes a threat to the security of the continent ""Fully aware that the massive military  economic and other aid as well as the political and moral support granted to Israel by certain Powers enable it to pursue its aggression and encourage it to commit acts of terrorism  especially the tragic act of shooting down the Libyan civilian aircraft  which resulted in the loss of innocent lives ""1.

Calls once more for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied African and Arab territories;""4. Declares that all changes effected by Israel in the occupied territories are null and void  and pledges not to recognize any changes leading to a fait accompli or likely to jeopardize the territorial integrity of the countries which are victims of the Israeli aggression;""5.

Reaffirms in the name of African solidarity and by virtue of article II  paragraph 1 (c) of the OAU Charter its active and total support for the Arab Republic of Egypt in its legitimate struggle to recover entirely and by all means its territorial integrity;""7. Draws the attention of Israel to the danger threatening the security and unity of the African continent as a result of its continued aggression and refusal to evacuate the territories of the States victims of that aggression and declares that the attitude of Israel might lead OAU member States to take  at the African level  individually or collectively  political and economic measures against it  in conformity with the principles contained in the OAU and United Nations Charters;""8. Earnestly calls upon the big Powers supplying Israel with arms and military equipment of all kinds and granting it moral and political support that enables it to strengthen its military potential to refrain from doing so;""9. Strongly supports the Egyptian initiative requesting the United Nations Secretary-General to report to the Security Council on the explosive situation prevailing in the Middle East  and expresses the hope that the Security Council shall take every appropriate measure to implement immediately the relevant resolutions adopted by the United Nations  so that a just and durable peace may be established in the region;""10.

Entrusts the current Chairman of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government to present the views of the OAU on the matter at the next session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.""There is the unanimous voice of Africa on this issue.38.	Since then  the six Foreign Ministers designated by the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government have participated in the Security Council meetings that were specifically convened at the instance of Egypt.  The debate that ensued  though extensive  produced no results that could bring peace nearer to that region. OAU cannot condone a situation whose final determination can be decided only by the force of arms. We regard it as an intolerable provocation that part of Egypt  a member State  should continue to remain under armed occupation in spite of the unanimous expressions of international opinion against the acquisition of territory by force of arms.39.	Members of OAU desire peace in the Middle East —  peace based on equity; peace that does not insist on acquisition of other people's territory as a pre-condition; peace that acknowledges the right of all nations in the area to exist in security; peace that places a premium on respect for cultural diversity; peace that upholds the dignity of man and draws sustenance from the principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Charter of the United Nations. For all the inhabitants of the area have every right to expect that they should no longer be distracted from the urgent tasks of economic reconstruction and social development. They have every right to live in peace and to continue to contribute  as they have done in the past and in history  to the mainstream of human civilization. That is the Middle East that the people of Africa envisage and fervently desire to see.40.	This is my message. This is the solemn assignment entrusted to me by OAU."

Latin America has been honoured by this choice.78.	May I also congratulate Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski for the wise and efficient manner in which he presided over the session of the General Assembly last year.79.	I also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General  whose untiring efforts in favour of the purposes of the Organization deserve our full recognition and appreciation.80.	I come before this world forum as representative of a country that only nine months ago was the victim of a devastating earthquake  which almost entirely destroyed our capital city.81.	This painful tragedy was an occasion for an expression of human solidarity in the form of assistance rendered to us in such a noble  generous and timely manner by international organizations  Governments and private individuals alike. May I express to them all the profound gratitude of the people and Government of Nicaragua who will never forget those who lent them a helping hand in their hour of need?82.	I wish most especially to tell Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General  that the Nicaraguan people will never forget his interest  his efforts and his constant preoccupation with the tragedy that beset our country. We are also most grateful to him for his vision in choosing his able assistant  the Under-Secretary-General  Mr. Bradford Morse  to direct the assistance rendered to our country.83.	I could not come before this General Assembly without being the bearer of the expressions of gratitude of our people for all the co-operation extended to it without any discrimination in such tragic? moments.84.	Thanks to the assistance it received  the Nicaraguan people has been able to overcome its grief  and the work of reconstruction is well under way. It is  however  a hard struggle  and our people look to this Assembly for a resolution that will lay down the necessary norms in order that we may find in the United Nations greater facilities to help us out of our despair and assist us in the reconstruction of our destroyed capital city  without disrupting our economy  while at the same time assisting our people in its spiritual and material resurgence  and helping it to overcome the trauma that still has our children and adults in its grip. A sister country  a peaceful and friendly people  must not be abandoned  for now  more than ever  they need your co-operation  the co-operation I am requesting with the dignity and patriotism of which we Nicaraguans have always been so justly proud.85.	I believe that in our hearts we all harbour mixed feelings regarding the attitude of the international community and the behaviour of political groups and States.86.	On the one hand  the situations of conflict in the Middle East have not been solved  and there is not even a glimmer of hope for their solution  while the danger exists that violence may again erupt at any moment.87.	Moreover  we have been witnessing an increase in terrorist acts which are repugnant to human conscience and the only effect of which is the repudiation of those who commit such atrocities and of those who favour or allow such acts to be perpetrated.88.	On the other hand  we are extremely pleased with the turn of events in the relations between the larger and more powerful countries on earth. They have abandoned the cold war policies and  setting aside ideological differences  have reached agreements that augur greater co-operation among them for the benefit of world peace. It is not that we intend to leave to the great Powers the exclusive responsibility for peace  for all of us  large an; small  must co-operate towards that end. But we must be realistic and recognize that  while all co-operation efforts have the same intrinsic value  they do not carry the same weight.89.	It is only fair to recognize that such concrete achievements in the search for peace as the end of the fighting in Viet-Nam and the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin have been the result of diplomatic negotiations between the great Powers  rather than of the efforts of smaller countries or deliberations in the world forum of the United Nations.90.	And yet  rather than discourage us  such achievements should encourage us to support this Organization  to correct its deficiencies and strengthen its authority and prestige.91.	In addition  we must never forget that true peace is not based on the absence of violence alone; it must be founded on justice — not only justice for individuals within States  but justice for States within the international community. And just as internal peace cannot be achieved while social injustice continues  so  too  there can be no international peace while there are irritating differences  such as the existence of highly developed countries  on the one hand  and  on the other  under-developed countries  whose populations not only struggle against poverty  disease and ignorance  but are deprived of the right to an equitable share in the natural wealth and resources of their countries. I sincerely believe that the United Nations can  and must  play an important role. We must all pledge our efforts to this end.92.	I must make special reference to the satisfaction with which we have welcomed the arrangement between the two German States which has made possible their admission as Members of this Organization. We believe that such an arrangement might serve as an inspiration to other countries that are in a similar situation and help them to settle their differences.93.	It is the foreign policy of my country to support any initiative aiming at the establishment of peace and security. But we believe that true peace cannot and should not be imposed. Rather  we must try to create a favourable climate for co-operation among States  and especially we must help to facilitate means of communications between States in conflict  so that it will be primarily those States that will seek mutually acceptable solutions to their differences. Resolutions which tend to exacerbate tensions  to intensify differences and harden positions will never benefit the cause of peace. Quite the contrary; by such means we would only be contributing to a prolongation of the conflict.94.	There is not a single State that does not pay lip-service to the cause of peace  but in many cases that dedication is not translated into deeds. When the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice is not accepted  or when it is accepted with reservations that make it inoperative  we are not working for peace. When manifestations of colonialism over peoples sufficiently prepared to choose their own destiny continue  we are not working for peace. When obstacles are raised to disarmament  and particularly to the elimination of chemical  bacteriological and atomic weapons  we are not working for peace. When human rights are not respected  and when due support is not given to international co-operation for development  we are not working for peace.95.	I believe that the consideration of the question of the economic and social consequences of the arms race and its highly detrimental effects on world peace and security [item 29] is of particular importance. Two years ago we welcomed with satisfaction a report on this subject prepared by the Secretary-General.  We must now keep this report before us  ponder its contents and use it as a source of inspiration in our deliberations on questions dealing with disarmament.96.	I stated earlier that  in my country's view  there can be no true peace without development  and that the achievement of that development calls for active international co-operation.97.	In accordance with the Charter of our Organization  the Economic and Social Council  under the authority of the General Assembly  should determine the international policies for co-operation in the economic  social  educational and health fields  as well as the co-ordination of such activities. My country is gratified at the large number of ratifications of the amendment to the Charter which was approved in 1971  and which has raised to 54 the membership of the Council.98.	My country believes that this increase in the membership  which will allow for a more equitable geographic representation for the distribution of seats  will strengthen the Council and help it better to discharge its functions. We may even hope that within the Council we may reach that much-desired agreement between developed and developing countries concerning their respective responsibilities in the field of international co-operation.99.	During my country's recent emergency  to which I have already referred  we received ample co-operation from the various United Nations development funds and programmes for development. May I again express my gratitude to the countries that contributed such assistance and the officials who administered it? Nicaragua believes that special priority should be given to the strengthening of such funds and programmes and to the creation of sufficient fund allocations to assist Governments in cases of natural disasters and similar contingencies.100.	We should also contemplate assistance for the forecasting and prevention of disasters  as well as measures aimed at preventing or reducing damage.101.	Particular importance should be attached to the United Nations Environment Programme adopted last year. The proposed United Nations Conference-Exposition on Human Settlements should also prove beneficial to mankind.102.	In the course of our deliberations we shall have before us the report of the Trade and Development Board [A/9015/Rev.l] of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD].103.	We fully understand that the debates in UNCTAD on the liberalization of trade were difficult  and we express the hope that this year's round of negotiations held under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will succeed in eliminating the barriers that prevent or hamper trade among nations  and in many cases unfavourably affect the developing countries.104.	The Trade and Development Board is seized of the proposed charter on rights and duties of States drawn up by a working group following on a proposal of the President ofMexico  Mr. Luis Echeverria Alvarez. Nicaragua believes that in the present circumstances of inflation  high cost of living and monetary instability there is an urgent need to accelerate the process which would make it possible to crystallize basic principles on this most important subject.105.	With reference to human rights as enshrined in the' Universal Declaration  the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of which is to be celebrated on 10 December this year  my delegation will support proposals aiming at the strengthening of international protection  particularly in the case of armed conflict  religious intolerance and racial discrimination.106.	As regards the legal questions before us for consideration  my Government believes that the items dealing with international co-operation in the peaceful uses  of outer space [item 30] and 'the preparation of an international convention on principles governing the use by States of artificial earth satellites for direct television broadcasting [item 31] are of particular significance. We believe that much progress has been made but that there is still much to be done and  in particular  that ye must lay emphasis on devising ways and means that will enable developing countries to share in the utilization of outer space  thus benefiting from the progress achieved in space technology.107.	But we consider the question of the law of the sea to be of even more immediate interest. Last year we agreed to hold the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  with preparatory meetings to be held in November and December of this year and a second stage to discuss matters of substance next year. In our view  this time-table should be maintained. Should the preparatory work require longer  I believe that the work could still be completed in the time available to us.108.	We are firmly convinced that the law of the sea must be updated  and the sooner the better  thus eliminating an' important source of actual and potential conflict. Should the present situation continue  those conflicts would be aggravated and would endanger world peace.109.	Nicaragua advocates the creation of a zone beyond the territorial sea of each State wherein that State would enjoy exclusive rights over the natural resources of the sea without impinging on the legitimate interests of the international community  especially as regards navigation. Only thus would it be possible for each State to meet its responsibilities for preserving its natural resources for the benefit of its people without infringing the rights of others.110.	As regards the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction  where the possibilities of commercial exploitation increase daily  every effort should be made to secure a consensus on a system of management leading to the utilization of this common heritage of mankind.111.	The agenda includes as items for deliberation a draft convention drawn up by the International Law Commission on the prevention and punishment of crimes against diplomatic agents and other internationally protected persons [item 90]  and ""Measures to prevent international terrorism which endangers or takes innocent human lives or jeopardizes fundamental freedoms  and study of the underlying causes of those forms of terrorism and acts of violence which lie in misery  frustration  grievance and despair and which cause some people to sacrifice human lives  including their own  in an attempt to effect radical changes"" [item 94].112.	Although these two items are not necessarily connected  they are closely related in practice. On this subject I	should like to quote General Anastasio Somoza Debayle  who addressed this Assembly in 1970 when he was President of Nicaragua  and said:""Our America also lives these upheavals. With the unwise granting of refuge to airplane hijackers  mankind is threatened; with the kidnapping and murder of diplomats and other persons  the most fundamental rights of man are violated; with the abuse of the right of asylum  the substance of a humanitarian American institution is distorted; and with mass exiling  political imprisonment and firing squads  the despair of peoples is increased. Until these activities are no longer indulged in  there can be no real peace in the world."" 113.	My country has ratified the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Acts of Terrorism Taking the Form of Crimes against Persons and Related Extortion that are of International Significance. It has also ratified the Conventions of Tokyo  The Hague and Montreal on air piracy and is ready to support any measure aiming at the prevention and repression of these crimes which are repugnant to the international conscience.114.	We believe that  rather than embarking on theoretical debates on the causes and definition of terrorism  which can be prolonged indefinitely  we should focus on concrete and practical measures.115.	We also believe that at the current session of the General Assembly we must consider the functions of the International Court of Justice and the reform of its Statute as far as its headquarters is concerned  subjects that have been before us for consideration on repeated occasions. It is very important to give that body of our Organization the greatest possible support so that it may better discharge its functions for the solution of international conflicts.116.	As I come to the end of my statement  I should like to reiterate the determination of my country to co-operate in the strengthening of peace and justice among nations.117 If we proceed thus  we shall have implemented the fundamental principle of our Organization and helped to bring happiness to the whole of mankind."
"83",5174,"NLD",28,1973,"﻿132.	Sir  on behalf of the Netherlands delegation I wish to congratulate you warmly on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. As a Latin American you will understand that my words are mingled with sadness: sadness about the death of a statesman from the continent you represent  Salvador Allende of Chile  who had earned the respect  and indeed admiration  of many peoples in all parts of the world; sadness because his death not only meant the end by violent means of this democratically elected President  but of a form of democracy which  once it had overcome its tremendous initial economic setbacks and the hostility it encountered  could have become exemplary for vast masses of peoples still longing for justice and for their share of prosperity  so long overdue.133.	The world  which is the subject of the general debate  is undergoing rapid change. Not only in my country  stress today is laid on well-being rather than on prosperity only. Increased importance is attached to the control of the use of raw materials with a view to slowing down the otherwise rapid depletion of the world's resources.134.	Also  greater importance is given to such control of the environment as will make the world a tolerably attractive place to live in. Emphasis is shifted from machine to man and-as everything we do is  after all  for man's benefit  —  ensuring him a firmer grip on the institutions which control the society he lives in.135.	We realize that both on the national and on the international level all the changes that recently have taken place and all the new priorities being set are creating new problems and new difficulties. We are still in the process of building new relationships with former adversaries. This  of course  is not an easy process and it may have caused an increase  internationally  in uncertitudes.136.	However  the ideological conflicts are becoming less obtrusive. What now is at issue is  rather  agreement on the balance of power. The decline of the preponderance of ideological conflicts creates an opportunity to establish new priorities. Those who have engineered this new development in the United States and China  in the Soviet Union and Japan  —  deserve our gratitude. They have unlocked new doors  and have opened up vistas of a new international order. In this context I wish to mention also Chancellor Brandt  who by his imaginative Ostpolitik opened a new era in East-West relations. His speech at this meeting provided impressive evidence that the Federal Republic  under his wise leadership  considers the promotion of peace  security and political detente as its primary aim.137.	One of the most important changes that the country I here represent has undergone has been that the generation which actually went through the Second World War has been succeeded by a new generation  which lived for years with the Viet-Nam conflict. This new generation gives highest priority to the strengthening of peace in the world. The Netherlands Government has embraced that view. An active peace policy occupies a central position in my country's foreign policy. The Netherlands will seek to prevent conflicts from arising and to assist in resolving conflicts. In the broader context  therefore  my Government will seek to remove anything that gives rise to strained relations; to remedy the injustices in the world; to combat the unfair treatment of man by man; and to help bridge the intolerable gap between prosperity and poverty  both in the world at large and within individual States. Needless to say  those who pursue such an active peace policy cannot stand idly by as tensions caused by colonialism rise to ever more dangerous levels  simply because colonialism is so slow to die.138.	From the focal point of our policy-the desire to place man squarely in the most peaceful setting possible — I propose to give the Assembly the views of my Government: on the position of the Netherlands as regards Atlantic co-operation; on the search for European security and a continued detente; on the progress of European economic and political integration; on co-operation with the third world; and  lastly  on the central role of the United Nations.139.	A peace policy is by necessity also a policy of stabilization; consequently the Netherlands is an active member of the body of co-operating Atlantic nations which have joined hands in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]. Perilous imbalances might develop were it not for NATO; the proliferation of nuclear weapons might  indeed  become an immediate danger. On the other hand  nothing should be rigid in a changing world. Accordingly  we are assisting in the search for ways in which to adapt and improve Atlantic co-operation. Relations between the United States and Europe have evidently been suffering from a certain erosion. We would not regard it in the interest of peaceful relations in cue world if the allies were to drift apart.140.	My Government believes the time has come for the reformulation of the aims of Atlantic co-operation and has submitted the following proposals to its partners.141.	We propose that it be stated categorically that the members of the alliance guarantee man's rights and freedoms.142.	We propose that the fate of the poor nations of the world be made one of the Atlantic nations' major concerns.143.	We propose that henceforth the furthering of detente be made paramount among the objectives of Atlantic endeavours.144.	The detente which we shall strive for must take the interests of the third world fully into account.145.	Indeed  any policy designed to strengthen peace is a policy of deliberate efforts to promote detente. It is for that reason that the Netherlands Government is endeavouring to be inventive as it plays its part in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. We are doing so with the firm desire to produce results  while remaining aware that the road will be long and difficult. Any adjustment takes its time.146.	For many a partner in that Conference in particular but not exclusively the group of East European countries  it will not be easy to subscribe to our views on the free exchange of ideas and information. None the less  our views on this subject are so fundamental and inherent in our way of- life and the structure of our society that we are prepared to bring it up time and again  annually if so required  and to continue the search for elements on which we can agree as the dialogue between the nations of Europe proceeds.147.	In the long run a European continent  divided by artificial barriers  behind which freedom of speech remains restricted  cannot be conceived. Every society is exposed to change.148.	Those who are in the creative vanguard of the arts and sciences usually are most apt to register the need for change. Their thoughts  if phrased in freedom  tend to become the forces of renewal and survival. To restrict their freedom of speech is to condemn society to stagnation and regression. We call on our partners in the present European dialogue to see these remarks not as an intervention in their internal affairs but as a reflection of the firm conviction that the cause of detente will be promoted by respect for human freedoms in all parts of Europe.149.	Pursuing a policy of peace also involves helping resolutely  and with initiative and confidence  to reinforce European co-operation. In my view  the European Community has for the time being reached its geographical configuration. The European union will be a reality. The question we are now faced with is what kind of European union we are going to build.150.	The first option is some sort of super-Power. The Netherlands would not feel at home in such a Europe. The second option is a Europe that would withdraw from the world into isolation and outdated neutrality. The Netherlands would not feel at home in such a Europe either. The third option  however  is a Europe in which the consequent gain in prosperity would be invested in an outward-looking community  with new civic norms and a new social policy.151.	Consequently  we hope to be part of a Europe that sets great store by mutual understanding  feelings of solidarity between the privileged and the less prosperous "" tolerance based on the various social groups which have a sense of social and economic responsibility towards each other. Only that kind of Europe can become a truly stable element in the world and thus consolidate peaceful relationships. Europe is moving along the road to that objective  sometimes fairly rapidly  sometimes with a certain hesitation. My Government is prepared to transfer national prerogatives to the European institutions as we proceed along that road. We and our partners in European economic and monetary co-operation are now seeking ways to expedite the establishment of an economic and monetary union  ways in which to integrate and harness this gigantic economic and monetary potential. I152.	The European Community has already embarked upon a policy of establishing new structural relationships with the outside world. My Government is ready to accept  together with its partners  considerable responsibilities for the promotion of the well-being of the third world  including the countries already linked to the Common Market by association as well as those not to be associated. All those countries must be enabled to overcome the curse of backwardness and economic discrimination if  as my Government desires  new foundations for lasting peace are to be built.153.	I need hardly say that all those major  fundamental problems can be solved only if the institutional conditions for solutions are satisfied. We need alert institutions capable of taking decisions quickly and capable of rendering an account of their decisions to the European Parliament in a democratic fashion. My Government will also be prepared to transfer national prerogatives within the framework of European political co-operation-today still largely of a consultative nature-once the cohesion between the partners has progressed to the point at which the community of interests returns more to us than the amount of self- determination we surrender. If this process could gradually gain momentum  the countries of Europe would be making a major new move towards creating international peace and security.154.	The situation in the third world has not improved. Economic growth and the achievement of prosperity are in stagnation. Today fewer people than 10 years ago are touched by the impact of the development process. Our development efforts have failed to change the structural relationship of inequality and dependence between the poor and the rich nations  as well as within developing countries. Development has failed to reach the lower strata of society.155.	That state of affairs cannot continue. We cannot accept this injustice of persistent backwardness with its grave  hidden tensions and consequent threat to world peace.156.	We shall have to review the situation. This Assembly must examine whether we should not radically modify our terms of reference  whether the priority of economic growth should not be supplemented by the priority of income distribution as an equal and concurrent objective instead of one consecutive to growth.157.	Our objective should be reformulated as ""growth plus structural change"". Consequently  my Government intends to put greater emphasis on problems of income distribution and self-reliance and on the structural relationship between developed and developing countries. Self- reliance and distribution of income and economic power  in fact  loom just as large in the domestic policy of my country as in our foreign policy.158.	Greater emphasis on these elements of development inevitably raises the question of national sovereignty of all countries  including the underprivileged. But in recent history  sovereign independence  important and indispensable as it is  has  in many cases and in many respects  remained an empty shell. I hope that the same will not be true of the problems of distribution and self-reliance.159.	My Government wishes to take an active part in the discussion of these matters. We believe that the radical shift in the development process to which these discussions should be directed should take place in a multilateral context  preferably in the framework of global co-operation and of a joint review and appraisal of our common efforts. We shall accord to this a high priority  because we accord a high priority to the consolidation of peace.160.	In the search for peace  an efficient world organization is indispensable. If I sound a note of criticism about the activities and operations of the United Nations at this stage  I wish at the same time to reaffirm the continuing loyalty of my country to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.161.	At present  the stars of the Organization are not very propitious. The political will of the Organization's Members to help create  strengthen and consolidate the conditions for peace throughout the world should find expression within the Organization. But  on the contrary  in the last few years we have witnessed increasing confrontation; delays in taking decisions  for instance  on disarmament; and a distorted use by various Members of the United Nations family through ever more frequent appeals to the specialized agencies for political action  for which  in fact  the political organs of the Organization are intended. We are not suggesting that there should be new proposals for amendments to the Charter to make the United Nations a more effective instrument for the fostering of world peace. Many improvements needed can be effectuated within the existing Charter  provided that there is the will to do so.162.	One improvement might consist in making the Organization still more universal; my Government is prepared to assist in achieving this. We further are of the opinion that improvement of the procedures and the implementation of international legislation are required. We hold the view that in international disputes Member States should more frequently have recourse to instiutionalized fact-finding. That would create a better basis for the rapid and effective settlement of those disputes. The International Court of Justice should be given a more authoritative part to play  all the more since the new rules of the Court may accelerate its procedures. The Court should not be made a forum in which to thrash out political differences  but it should provide additional opportunities for settling disputes by peaceful means.163.	There are still many strained relations that are a threat to peace. In particular  our attention should be focused on the problems of southern Africa. If we remain idle spectators  the problems and strained relations besetting that part of the world will inevitably culminate in conflicts  the world-wide consequences of which would be incalculable. The remnants of a colonial era are just as much out of keeping with today's world as is the policy of apartheid. Therefore  the Netherlands Government will apply the sanctions against the illegal regime in Rhodesia with the utmost severity  in the fervent hope of promoting self-determination in that country. Therefore  the Netherlands will give humanitarian aid to the peoples in the colonial areas of southern Africa via the liberation movements - preferably through the intermediary of international organizations-and will support the claims for external self-determination of the peoples of Guinea-Bissau  Angola and Mozambique. Recent reports emanating in particular from Mozambique have caused grave concern in my country.164.	My Government once more urges Portugal to come to an understanding with those peoples and thus to build up a new relationship. We address a similar appeal to the Government of South Africa on the Territory of Namibia and  in addition  we urge South Africa to turn away from the policy of apartheid. We believe that it should be possible to continue the discussions on the subject within the United Nations and that they should not be cut short by expulsion or the severance of bonds.165.	The other main threat to peace remains the explosive situation in the Middle East. At this moment I wish to touch only on one side of the problem which becomes increasingly important  the question of the refugees. The Netherlands is prepared to render active assistance with a view to relieving this source of tension  for example through an investigation of the extent to which the restructuring of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East or the creation of new organs  might help to alleviate the human suffering and economic disruption resulting from the Middle East's political quandary.166.	It need hardly be said that substantial progress in disarmament and the control of arms is a sine qua non for a peaceful world order. My Government favours the imposition without delay of a ban on underground nuclear tests. Although there is probably no infallible detection system as yet  the Netherlands regards it as essential to check the arms race  since the nuclear danger continues by means of qualitative improvement of nuclear weaponry. Next to that  we shall continue to press for a ban on chemical weapons. Considerable priority will have to be accorded to restricting the use of indiscriminate weapons and inhuman methods of warfare causing excessive suffering.167.	This General Assembly will be concerning itself more especially with institutional problems with regard to disarmament. We are prepared to approach every proposal with open minds in respect of both the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and the United Nations Disarmament Commission. We should also welcome a World Disarmament Conference  provided all nuclear Powers were willing to take part. But what is more important than any institution is the political will to go forward.168.	At this very moment in the context of a peace week  the combined churches of the Netherlands strongly call upon my countrymen to unite in the promotion of conditions for peace. As a consequence  the display of political will of those responsible for the furtherance of peace will be closely observed in my country.169.	The Charter of the United Nations establishes a clear link between the maintenance of international peace and security  the creation of conditions of economic and social well-being and the promotion of universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all  without discrimination. If we clarify this link in terms of peace and justice  it would seem that there is no peace in the true 14sense as long as there are situations of grave injustice in relations among the States and within the States. Peaceful co-operation between States will not mean very much if peoples and individuals remain the victims of grave injustices. After all  it is not the State as such  or an organization of States for that matter  but the well-being of human beings that is the ultimate object of our endeavours.170. For that reason the Netherlands Government wishes to reaffirm at this very session of the General Assembly  when we are celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the pledge contained in the United Nations Charter: the pledge that Members will take joint and separate action in co-operation with the Organization to promote universal respect for  and observance of  human rights and fundamental freedoms for all  without distinction as to race  sex  language or religion. The date 10 December 1973 will be not only the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration but also the beginning of a Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination. The still rampant practice of racism and racial discrimination has a devastating effect on the minds  the hearts and the fate of people and on the very essence of peace and justice. The United Nations has undoubtedly made great efforts to combat racism  racial discrimination and apartheid  especially by making people conscious of the inherent dangers of these grave types of discrimination. They  however  still persist as an evil against which all the forces of goodwill must be mobilized. If we consider the standards set forth in the Universal Declaration and in subsequent international instruments in the field of human rights  we can see an unmistakable gap between the ideals proclaimed and the realities of life in the world.171.	Lastly  I should like to call attention to a serious matter which is not often raised before this forum  namely  the disregard of article S of the Universal Declaration-and article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [see resolution 2200 A (XXI)]-that no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Reports from various parts of the world provide evidence that this appalling practice has become rife and is often used against people suspected of having committed a political offence. The Netherlands people and Government are gravely perturbed at this practice and wonder whether the United Nations could not take appropriate action. A strong appeal that such practices be stopped forthwith might have considerable moral impact  but I also press for the adoption of an expedient such as impartial inquiry  in order to bring the facts to light. The Netherlands Government is prepared to co-operate in any initiative of that kind.172.	The United Nations is to be  in the words of the Charter  a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations. Glancing back over the years  one cannot escape the impression that there is still much to be done in this respect. I do not hesitate to pledge once more my Government's dedication to the aims and purposes of the Charter and its willingness to make its contribution in this respect."
"84",5220,"NOR",28,1973,"﻿27.	On behalf of the Norwegian delegation I have the honour to extend to Mr. Leopoldo Benites our best congratulations upon his election as President of this Assembly. I can assure him of the full co-operation of my delegation in his important task.28.	We are meeting at a time when international relations are marked by a general trend towards rapprochement and detente. As a result of this process of detente and normalization this Assembly has just welcomed the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic as full Members of the United Nations. I should like to join the preceding speakers in expressing my Government's satisfaction that the two German States and the Bahamas will now participate fully in the work of our Organization.29.	The process towards normalization and detente has been particularly encouraging in East-West relations. Global as well as European trends  great-Power interests as well as European aspirations  have interacted to prepare the ground for taking up unsolved questions through talks in different forums and on different levels. The rapprochement between the United States and the Soviet Union  the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin and the treaties between the Federal Republic of Germany and States of Eastern Europe represent particularly valuable contributions to the process towards normalization of relations and relaxation of tension in Europe.30.	The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is a further confirmation that this positive process is continuing. My Government considers it particularly important that that Conference should enable all interested States in the region  large or small  to engage themselves actively in the work for relaxation of tension and for security and co-operation. We view the Conference not as an end in itself but as an important opening up of a new multilateral phase of East-West negotiations which we sincerely hope will progressively lead to more stable and co-operative relationships in Europe.31.	The process of detente in Europe is  however  only in its first stages. It has not so far had any direct effect on the high level of armaments  nor has it brought a solution to the underlying causes of conflict. Determination and strong political will indeed will be needed to carry forward the trend toward security and cooperation. There is a close relationship between political detente on the one hand and concrete measures for arms control and disarmament on the other. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the forthcoming negotiations on force reductions in Central Europe represent important steps in the right direction. My Government fully and actively supports those steps.32.	As to the broader question of the need for further efforts for arms control and disarmament  my delegation will at a later stage give a comprehensive presentation of Norwegian views on those vital issues. On this occasion I shall confine myself to underlining the importance which my Government attaches to the necessity of associating all States-and particularly all nuclear-weapon States-in both current and future negotiations on arms control and disarmament.33.	Reverting to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  my Government has repeatedly stated that the Conference should base itself on a generous and outward-looking philosophy and should see to it that the increased co-operation between the States participating in the Conference will also benefit the developing countries and the world community. It is my conviction that it is in the best interest of Europe and the world at large that the process which has been started in Europe should continue. It is my sincere hope that this process might serve as an example and contribute to more stable relationships  increased security and more comprehensive co-operation between all States represented here.3A. Unfortunately  those general trends towards detente and rapprochement are not reflected in all parts of the world. Today  at the sixth General Assembly since the six-day war  my Government strongly regrets that the situation in the Middle East has not yet been brought nearer to a peaceful solution. The international community should not allow this rather dangerous state of affairs to persist. We should all urge the parties directly concerned and the great Powers  which all have a special responsibility  to exert every possible effort in order to break the present deadlock and move towards a comprehensive solution  as anticipated in Security Council resolution 242(1967). My Government holds the opinion that the basic principles contained in that resolution still constitute the best basis for a lasting and just peace in the region; that the acquisition of territory by war cannot be accepted; that every State in the area should have the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries; and that due regard must be paid to the rights of the Palestinians.35.	While dealing with the situation in the Middle East I should like also to pay a tribute to the work done by the Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency [UNRWA] and his staff. It is important that all Member countries now contribute towards providing UNRWA with a more solid financial basis for its work  which is important not only from a humanitarian point of view but also in a political context. In Norway  we attach special importance to the forward-looking aspects of its work  particularly in the field of education.36.	Turning now to South-East Asia  my Government is deeply  disappointed that  despite the agreements reached  the parties to the conflicts in Indo-China have not yet created conditions which would secure the rights of the Indo-Chinese peoples to determine freely their own future. It is imperative that further efforts be made towards that aim. The uncertain destiny of the civilian political prisoners should be of deep concern to all of us. For humanitarian reasons we urge that all prisoners now be released and repatriated according to their free will.37.	The situation in southern Africa  where still large parts of the African population are denied their inalienable right to self-determination and independence  is another discouraging aspect of the present world situation.38.	In April this year Norway had the privilege of being host to the International Conference of Experts for the Support of Victims of Colonialism and Apartheid in Southern Africa  held at Oslo  and arranged jointly by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. The Conference itself did not formulate any formal recommendations  but it highlighted a number of proposals for a comprehensive plan of action for solving the problems of southern Africa. Those proposals will be before the General Assembly at this session. We hope that the Assembly will welcome the report from the Oslo Conference  and consider it in a positive way. The Norwegian delegation will participate fully in the following up of the Conference in a realistic and constructive manner.39.	My Government's general position as regards the problems of southern Africa is well known. We will continue to support the oppressed peoples who are struggling for independence  self-determination and liberation. Our humanitarian and other forms of economic aid to the liberation movements recognized by the Organization of African Unity will be increased.40.	In line with the general principles guiding our foreign policy  we should have preferred to see the process ofliberation of southern Africa taking peaceful forms through negotiations. We realize  however  that when one of the parties refuses persistently to negotiate  the possibilities for peaceful change are frustrated  and sooner or later armed struggle becomes inevitable. In cases where channels for negotiations are still open and available we would  therefore  strongly recommend that these be used before it is too late.41.	World opinion has been appalled by recent reports of atrocities committed by Portuguese forces in Mozambique. My Government deeply regrets that the Portuguese Government has rejected suggestions presented to it by a number of Governments — including my own — to let the reported atrocities be investigated by a broadly composed  impartial international commission of inquiry  preferably under the auspices of the United Nations. This rejection on the part of the Portuguese Government cannot but strengthen the concern caused by these reports.42.	These reports have -also strengthened our conviction that an end must be brought to this war and to Portuguese colonial rule. We find it difficult to understand thatPortugal  in this part of the twentieth century  in contrast to other former colonial Powers  does not realize the futility of fighting the colonial peoples' irresistible urge for independence and justice. We appeal to Portugal to abandon its colonial policies and to enter into negotiations with representatives of the liberation movements  recognizing the rights of the African peoples to self-determination in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.43.	Turning now to the Indian subcontinent  Norway welcomes the recent agreements between the three countries in the area on the repatriation of prisoners of war and the exchange of displaced civilians. The implementation of these agreements will demand substantial financial resources  towards which the international community should contribute. Norway will for its part assist in providing the necessary funds.44.	We hope the agreements concluded will pave the way for normalization of the relations between the three countries and also of their relations with the outside world. Such a normalization would serve the interests of the subcontinent itself and the world at large. We hope that Bangladesh will this year take its place in our Organization 45.	We take it that this Assembly will have a comprehensive debate on the Korean question. My Government holds the view that the two Korean Governments should be invited to take part in this debate without any pre-conditions. Although the results of the bilateral talks between North and South Korea have so far not been too encouraging  the direct contacts established between them and the general trend towards relaxation of international tension should facilitate progress in the Korean question. The role of the United Nations in Korea should now be adjusted in accordance with current developments. This should be done in an orderly manner which will not affect the legal and political basis for the policies pursued hitherto by the United Nations in Korea. We should also constantly bear in mind that the basic aim of our discussion and decisions is to promote peace and detente on the Korean peninsula.46.	Norway and the other Nordic countries have now normalized their relations with both Korean Governments. I should like to reiterate from this rostrum the wish expressed by the Nordic Foreign Ministers in the communiqués from their meetings in Oslo and Stockholm this year that as many States as possible should normalize their relations with the two Korean Governments in order that those Governments may play their proper role in the international community.47.	I should now like to turn to some of the more general problems confronting our Organization today.48.	The Secretary-General reminds us in his latest report [A/9001/Add.l] that Governments have a tendency to pursue their strict and narrow national aims in the United Nations without regard to the Organization as such. We should all consider ourselves addressees of this warning. We should no doubt devote more time and energy to strengthening our Organization. The objective must be a strong and vigorous world Organization as the main basis of an international legal system and a global collective security system.49.	Proposals have been made for a general revision of the Charter. That the Charter is far from being a perfect document is no doubt true. On the other hand  it is difficult to see any genuine need for a general revision. The Charter has shown itself to be a flexible instrument. Through a forward-looking and pragmatic interpretation of the Charter it should be possible also in the future to give a dynamic thrust to our Organization.50.	Norway has always supported the principle of universality. If the United Nations is today to play the role of an effective world organization it must be open and representative  not closed and exclusive. In our opinion no useful purpose is served by excluding any country from participation in the United Nations. This general consideration ought to apply even to a Member State which fails to fulfil its commitments under the Charter or under resolutions passed by the Security Council and the General Assembly. Also with regard to such countries it is essential that we preserve for the world community the important means of influence and persuasion inherent in United Nations membership.51.	In the many specialized agencies of the United Nations extensive technical co-operation is carried on which is of great value to all member countries. In recent years  however  we have experienced an increasing tendency to introduce political issues into the work. We realize  of course  that these organizations cannot isolate themselves from contemporary political currents and events. We must  however  see to it that progress in the many specialized agencies is not hampered by an inappropriate introduction of political issues. Such issues should not be dealt with in the specialized agencies but should be referred to the principal political body of the United Nations  the General Assembly  for discussion there.52.	The development of the United Nations has in many ways emphasized some fundamental contradictions and paradoxes in the structure of the Organization. I should like to draw the attention of this Assembly to one of them.53.	In principle the Charter prohibits intervention  in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of any Member State. At the same time the United Nations is committed to work for securing human rights for all. This cannot be done without some interference in what are traditionally regarded as ""domestic affairs"". Over and over again we see States invoking the argument of ""domestic affairs"" when attention is drawn to violations of fundamental human rights and freedoms. The Secretary-General has in his last report rightly pointed to the fact that the protection of human rights is an area where the credibility of the United Nations is especially at stake [A/9001/Add. 1  p. 5]. All States should realize that the impact of violations of human rights transcends national borders and influences in a rather negative way not only relations between nations but also the international climate in general. Such violations  wherever they occur  are consequently the concern of the international community as a whole and cannot be considered merely a domestic affair.54.	In this connexion I want to say a few words also about recent developments in Chile. Through free and democratic elections three years ago  Salvador Allende was given the mandate to govern Chile on the basis of a progressive reformist programme aiming at social justice. This has now been brought to an end through the use of force. Thus the hopes of millions of people have been frustrated. We deeply regret these developments and we appeal for democracy to be restored in Chile.55.	We are also concerned about reports of mistreatment and persecution of supporters of President Allende's Government in Chile. The international community has the right to expect that human rights will be respected and that all political prisoners will be released immediately.56.	I shall now turn to some specific questions which will be discussed at this General Assembly and to which Norway attaches special importance. The first of these questions concerns international terrorism [item 94]..57. The serious problems caused by international terrorism are of a global nature and should therefore be' dealt with within the United Nations or other world-wide organizations.58.	To be frank  we are disappointed with the outcome of the work so far done by the United Nations in this field. In our view the highest possible priority should now be given by the United Nations to the work aiming at effective measures for the combat of terrorism. Substantial progress towards co-ordinated international action should be made as-early as this session of the General Assembly.59.	We realize that it will be a difficult and time-consuming process to reach a comprehensive international agreement for the prevention of all kinds of terrorism. The best way of handling the matter would .perhaps be to deal with the different categories of acts of international terrorism and connected problems in separate conventions or other international instruments. Norway will support motions to give high priority at this session of the Assembly to the completion of a convention for the protection of diplomats [item 90]. Such a convention will  like the Conventions on safety in the air which have now been ratified or acceded to by the Nordic countries  form the basis for a global combat against specific acts of terrorism.60.	When drafting conventions or other international instruments in this field  we should also have the following points in mind: first  conventions must respect the exclusive competence of the Security Council with regard to sanctions; second  conventions must not lend themselves to the interpretation that they are directed against the legitimate struggle of the African liberation movements for independence and freedom. We fully agree that  in accordance with the decision taken by the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly  the underlying causes for international terrorism should be studied [resolution 3034 (XXVII)]. But I should like to emphasize that these studies or any other study of  for instance  the definition of international terrorism should not in any way be permitted to delay efforts to devise effective measures against international terrorism.61.	Let me now turn to another subject to which this Assembly should give high priority. I am referring to the question of human rights in armed conflicts [item 54].62.	Norway will continue to play an active role in the work"" of the United Nations and the Red Cross expert conferences for the reaffirmation and development of the international legal rules regarding the protection of human rights in armed conflicts. We support the initiative taken by the Swiss Federal Council in convening a first session of a diplomatic conference on this important question in Geneva in 1974.  New and complex conflict situations- guerrilla and counter-guerrilla  technological and electronic warfare-have made it imperative to study the question of an improved legal protection of civilians  prisoners and combatants in such kinds of conflicts. New legal restraints should be imposed on the use of weapons and weapon systems that may cause unnecessary suffering  have indiscriminate effects or lead to ecological changes. The applicability of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 should be confirmed as regards all kinds of armed conflict  including wars of national liberation.63.	The United Nations not only is an organization for peace and security  but is also meant to be an instrument for international economic and social co-operation and solidarity in a global perspective. The promotion of economic and social growth and the ensuring of access to resources and their consumption  thereby improving the standard of living for the have-nots of the world  should be one of the main tasks of the United Nations today. In this field  however  we must admit that the world community has so far only managed to make a very modest beginning. The gap between the poor and the rich in the world is steadily widening  and this state of affairs could in the future come to represent a very serious source of conflict. I think we should all be willing to admit that none of us in our practical policies has been willing to recognize the full consequences of this steadily deepening gulf between the industrialized and the developing countries as well as of the widening disparities between and within the developing countries. We are here faced with a challenge which seems to require a fundamentally new way of thinking  and sacrifices far beyond those that the industrialized countries and the privileged few in the developing countries have been willing to make so far. In the years ahead it will be an important task to convince public opinion in our countries of the necessity of such sacrifices.64.	Special attention should be paid to the least developed countries. Furthermore  due consideration should be given to the willingness on the part of the recipient countries to pursue a policy of economic and social justice.65.	Norway shares the view recently expressed in different international bodies — particularly in the Committee for Development Planning-that the development process should include  in addition to economic elements  certain basic social components  such as nutrition  health and education.66.	Norway has fully endorsed the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. With regard to the quantitative goal  my Government has decided to exclude private transfers from the 1 per cent target for total transfers  because such transfers consist of rather diverse elements and because governments have a limited influence on the volume of such transfers. Consideration of the poor countries' increasing indebtedness has played an important role in this regard.67.	The Norwegian Government has  with the approval of the Norwegian Parliament  established a new set of basic principles and a new quantitative target for our development co-operation. Norway intends to reach 1 per cent of gross national- product in official development assistance by 1978. A part of this goal is the achievement of 0.7 per cent of gross national product in 1975 as stipulated in the International Development Strategy. With very- minor qualifications  all of this assistance is to be untied and on a grant basis. Furthermore  Norway intends to continue to channel about 50 per cent of its assistance through multilateral organizations.68.	As regards the comprehensive multilateral trade negotiations officially opened in Tokyo recently  I would like to reconfirm my Government's full support for the aims of these negotiations. The benefits to the world economy as a whole of an expansion of international trade through reductions of tariffs and other barriers are obvious. However  the wider purpose of the negotiations cannot be achieved if we do not also consider the position of those countries which are not likely to benefit much from a general removal of barriers. For developing countries to achieve a reasonable balance of advantage  a new and imaginative attack upon commodity problems is definitely called for.69.	Next year will be the World Population Year. It is my hope that the forthcoming World Population Conference will lead to an action-oriented programme which can bring humanity closer to a solution of the fundamental problem of how to bring the population explosion under control. If we should not succeed in this task  our common endeavours to create decent conditions of life on this planet will probably be doomed to failure. The question also has a strong bearing on the individual human being's legitimate claim to a decent existence and to a minimum standard of nutrition  health  housing and education. In reality  we are here dealing with a question of human rights and of .the freedom and dignity of the individual.70.	In conclusion  I would like to address myself to the problems of the law of the sea. I shall not in my intervention today go closely into the substance of these problems. I would like  however  to emphasize the great urgency and the pressing need for solutions which characterize all the law of the sea issues. We must bear this urgency in mind when later in the session we carry out our review-as foreseen in last year's resolution [resolution 3029 A (XXVII)] -of the decision on the arrangements for the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.71.	The rapid advances of modern technology are increasingly posing new problems as regards the protection and distribution of the marine resources and the marine environment generally. These are problems with which all our Governments are daily struggling and which  in the absence of agreed international solutions  carry in them seeds of international conflict.72.	Seen in that context the forthcoming Conference on the Law of the Sea has a bearing also on world peace. It is therefore essential that the Conference should result in solutions which can command the broadest possible support and which can reflect and accommodate the needs of the various groups of States.73.	One such solution would  in the view of the Norwegian Government  be the adoption of the proposal for an economic zone limited to 200 nautical miles  in which the coastal State would have sovereign rights over the natural resources  while guaranteeing at the same time the right of freedom of navigation and over flight in the zone. Only a solution on these lines could  in our view  provide a sufficient basis for effective resource management- including the need to allocate the exploitation of the resources in a way which takes the interest of coastal populations sufficiently into account. The coastal State's rights under the treaty should  however  in our view  be coupled with a corresponding duty to exercise those rights in a way which ensures that the living resources are not endangered through over-exploitation  and which makes it mandatory for the coastal State to co-operate with the appropriate regional and global organizations to that end.74.	It is furthermore of importance to remember that a treaty on economic zones would not by itself establish such zones. All it would do would be to ensure a recognized legal basis for their establishment  and this only to the extent that it would not be contrary to regional or bilateral agreements. Whether and to what extent the individual coastal State would wish to avail itself of this right would be for each State to decide in the light of the totality of its interests and circumstances. There would therefore be room under the treaty for regional and bilateral agreements with a view to meeting the particular circumstances of each region.75.	As far as the natural resources on the ocean floor outside national jurisdiction are concerned  my Government believes that only the creation of a strong international authority with broad regulatory powers can answer the challenge which the situation gives rise to. Norway strongly supports the concept of the international sea-bed area as ""the common heritage of mankind"" and would like to see the new international machinery established in a way which would reflect that concept as fully as possible. And this must be done before an uncontrolled race for the resources concerned gets under way. Afterwards it may be too late.76.	In line with the general consideration that the coastal State should be given extended jurisdiction over the natural resources in the coastal area  the Norwegian Government has expressed understanding of the reasons behind Iceland's decision to extend its fishery limits. Given Iceland's overwhelming dependence for its livelihood on coastal fisheries  we have shown understanding of the fact that Iceland did find it difficult to await the outcome of the forthcoming Conference on the Law of the Sea. Today we welcome the fact that temporary agreements have been or are about to be concluded  through peaceful negotiations between Iceland and certain other countries  among them Norway. We sincerely hope that the necessary conditions will soon be created for the resumption of talks about similar arrangements between Iceland and the United Kingdom in order that a very unfortunate conflict which tends in fact to disturb the general atmosphere and stability in the area may be brought to is end."
"85",5265,"NPL",28,1973,"﻿178.	First of all  I should like to convey the greetings and best wishes of my Sovereign  His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Deva  for the success of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly.179.	I should like to convey to you  Sir  on behalf of my delegation  our most sincere congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly. We have great admiration for your qualities. I am confident that those qualities  together with your wide experience  will serve you in good stead in your high office. My delegation wishes you all success and offers its whole-hearted co-operation in your important task.180.	I also take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation of the distinguished services of the outgoing President of the Assembly  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  who discharged his functions as President of the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly in an exemplary manner.181.	Most of the speakers who have so far participated in the general debate this year have drawn the attention of the audience towards the growing detente among the major Powers of the world today. The spirit of co-operation and understanding that have prevailed between the two superpowers has been generally welcomed. The Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States has been lauded. The dialogues between China and the United States on the one hand and between China and Japan on the other have been rightly appreciated. The improved political climate of Europe has been noted with satisfaction.182.	My delegation also views these recent developments in international relations as positive steps towards the goal of international peace and security. No more does the fear of a nuclear holocaust haunt us every now and then. The cold war  it seems  has come to an end. But may I remind the distinguished audience that neither detente nor peace is in itself an end. We need detente for the sake of peace and peace for the sake of progress and development and for the happiness and prosperity of mankind.183.	It has  therefore  become incumbent on all of us  especially the small and developing countries  not to be swayed by the feeling of euphoria concerning the present state of world affairs into being complacent about the urgent problems that face most of mankind today. My delegation does not intend to create any misgivings in any quarter  nor does it doubt the sincerity of the big Powers which have worked towards bringing about an atmosphere of increased detente. What my delegation wishes to stress is the need to seize this present opportunity  which is characterized by a mood of co-operation and understanding  to work towards solution of the problems that exist in the world today. The momentum of detente should be allowed to gather greater strength and deeper meaning. The mood of detente should be harnessed to bear fruitful results to mankind everywhere.184.	What I have said just now will be all too clear and vivid when we look at the problems that still beset us in our world today. First  the continuing economic disparity between the developed and the developing countries is a very alarming feature of the present-day world. In spite of the declarations at the first and the second Development Decades by the United Nations  the gap between the developed and the developing nations is ever widening. The rich countries are getting richer and the poor countries poorer every year. The target of 1 per cent of gross national product as aid to the poorer countries remains a distant goal. Unless massive doses of technology and capital are injected into the developing countries  the economic disparity will continue to grow and the world will soon find itself polarized between the rich northern countries and the poor southern countries. My delegation  therefore  makes a strong plea to the industrialized nations to try earnestly to achieve the target of 1 per cent of gross national product in aid.185.	At the same time  the industrialized nations should provide favourable trade terms to the developing countries. The spirit of detente should prevail in the field of trade and commerce as well  in order for it to have any significant meaning to the developing countries. My delegation hopes that the present negotiations being held by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Tokyo will be able to come forward with some bold and substantive proposals towards granting more favourable trade terms to the developing countries.186.	The painful history of the colonization and economic exploitation of the developing countries has been a major cause of conflicts and war. So long as these conditions remain unchanged we cannot safely look forward to an era of peace. So long as three-fourths of mankind cannot achieve a minimum standard of decent living  peace and security remain threatened.187. Bearing these things in mind  I believe  the framers of the Charter of the United Nations adopted the goal of economic prosperity as one of the purposes of the United Nations.188.	Nepal has been waging a battle against the latent forces of insecurity. My Sovereign  His Majesty King Birendra  has recently said:"".. . the battle lies well within our territory- it is a battle against backwardness and destitution  to fight which I have exhorted the need for development... a crusade against poverty  however time-consuming and arduous it be  is a need and a moral responsibility we cannot shrug off our shoulders"".189.	While the urge to develop  the effort to develop and the problems facing the effort are very similar among the developing countries  the magnitude of these problems is much graver in the case of the developing land-locked countries. The land-locked countries  having been denied by geography the cheapest means of transport  sea transport  have to incur additional costs for transport in international trade. This increases their cost of production and makes their products non-competitive in the international market. This problem  having been recognized by the international community  has found expression in regional economic organizations  in the General Assembly  and particularly in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. All these international organizations have adopted various recommendations and appeals  and unless some effective way is found to subsidize the additional cost of transportation the efforts of the developing land-locked countries will be retarded.190.	Our interest in the United Nations Committee on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction and the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has been motivated by the desire to count the hidden wealth of the sea-bed and ocean floor among the arsenals of our war against poverty and under-development. For us particularly  we of a country which is full of young mountains but lacking in sufficient mineral resources necessary for industrial development  and with a limit posed by topography on the extension of more arable land to grow food for the growing population  the promise of mineral wealth and fisheries is of great importance. It is only natural that we should show our eagerness to guard our rights derived from the declaration of the common heritage of mankind. This causes us to defend the area beyond the national jurisdiction from being converted into an area which becomes economically meaningless or unfeasible.191.	While we are ready to accommodate the interest of the coastal countries  we expect the same reciprocity from them. We believe that the bigger the area belonging to all mankind  the bigger will be the benefit derived by mankind.192.	The United Nations resolution /3029 (XXVII)] has clearly laid stress on taking into consideration the interests of the developing countries. Nepal  as a developing country  is ready to contribute to the attainment of the purpose of the resolution for the benefit  of all the developing nations.193. However  the sharing of benefit and the utilization of the exploitation of the sea-bed and ocean floor and theenjoyment of the right of fisheries  and so forth  shall remain mere ideals for land-locked countries if they are not backed by specific provisions guaranteeing them free and unrestricted access to and from the sea. There should further be a specific provision for port and other essential facilities in order to make the land-locked countries able to enjoy these benefits with all the rest of the world. In order to narrow the gap of development  these essential features have to be accommodated in the convention on the law of the sea.194.	On the question of equitable sharing  while giving consideration to the needs of developing countries  further consideration should be given to the rights and interests of the land-locked countries which are least developed among the developing. What we urge is not to adopt any new norm that has not already been in practice among the international community. We only want the same norm to be applied judiciously.195.	My delegation is indeed very happy to welcome the Bahamas in our midst as an independent and sovereign country. The emergence of the Bahamas is yet another example of the decline of colonialism all over the world. But this evil has remained unmitigated in some parts of the world. In the southern part of Africa  the chronic problems of colonialism and racialism have persisted stubbornly as before. The people of Mozambique  Angola and Guinea- Bissau are still suffering from the worst type of colonialism practised by Portugal. My delegation strongly condemns the recent massacre of the defenceless and unarmed people of Mozambique committed by Portuguese colonialists. In utter disregard of world opinion and the various resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly regarding the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  the colonial rulers of Portugal are stubbornly perpetuating their old policy. The repressive and retrogressive policies of the colonial Powers are incompatible with the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Moreover  the Portuguese colonialists are exploiting the resources of those Territories while ruthlessly suppressing the independence movement waged by the freedom-loving people of the Territories.196.	The racist policy of apartheid followed by South Africa is a constant challenge to the ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This policy is not only the cause  of humiliation for the majority of the people of South Africa but also an affront to humanity and civilized behaviour. The South African regime is now trying to fortify itself further through its unholy alliance with Lisbon and Salisbury. Both South Africa and Portugal have been receiving assistance from their major trading partners  which  in turn  make huge profits at the cost of the indigenous population. The major trading partners of South Africa should stop their investment in that country so long as it does not give up the inhuman apartheid policy. My delegation has always supported the idea that the freedom fighters and refugees from the southern part of Africa should be given assistance to combat racism.197. The South African regime has continued its illegal occupation of Namibia even after the termination of itsmandate by the United Nations. This is a further affront to the United Nations. Furthermore  South Africa has extended its inhuman policy of apartheid to Namibia. The freedom fighters of Namibia are being subjected to great pain and torture in the prisons of South Africa. My delegation strongly supports the efforts of the United Nations Council for Namibia to discharge its function in accordance with the resolution adopted by the United Nations.198.	In Southern Rhodesia  the racist minority regime has continued the policy of discrimination and repression against the majority of the people. World opinion is overwhelmingly in support of the right of self-determination of the people of Zimbabwe. The mandatory sanctions imposed by the United Nations against the illegal regime remain ineffective.199.	This situation in the southern part of Africa constitutes a grave threat to peace. There must be a limit to the suffering and humiliation of a great number of people at the hands of a minority regime based on ruthless exploitation. It is incumbent on all States Members of the United Nations  including the major trading partners of these racist and colonialist regimes  to work sincerely for the implementation of the various resolutions on the subject adopted by the United Nations. We must all act in unison and sincerity before the situation becomes explosive  resulting in a violent bloodbath.200.	In spite of some encouraging developments in the field of disarmament  the arms build-up seems to be growing in alarming proportions among many nations. Even small and medium-sized countries are spending fortunes in trying to arm themselves. The big Powers  while trying to curb the armaments race among themselves  seem to have been seriously engaged in outdoing each other in supplying military hardware to various countries. The test-ban Treaty  remains ignored and neglected by some of the nuclear Powers. Nuclear tests have continued with total disregard for world opinion. There has been no progress towards the ban on chemical weapons. Huge amounts are being spent on the production and development of sophisticated weapons of destruction. Such activities  while creating an atmosphere of fear and insecurity  drain away vast sums of money which could have been utilized to alleviate the sufferings of the poor and needy people all over the world.201.	Lasting peace is not possible without achieving complete and universal disarmament. With that in mind  my delegation has been supporting the idea of a world disarmament conference  after adequate preparatory work  in which all nations of the world  including the divided ones  should be allowed to participate.202.	The Middle East problem remains unresolved in spite of the best efforts of the United Nations  in spite of the growing detente between the major Powers. That only goes to prove further that any lasting and durable solution to the problem can be worked out only by the parties themselves concerned. My delegation appreciates the initiative taken by the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  in going to the Middle East to assess the situation and consult with the leaders of Egypt  Israel and Jordan about solving the problem. My delegation would like to reiterate our belief that Security Council resolution 242(1967) of 22 November 1967 provides a reasonable basis for a just and peaceful solution of the Middle East crisis. There is ample scope for a just solution of the problem within the framework provided by that resolution. What is needed is the political will to implement it and to adhere to the formula which has already been provided. We have in the past pleaded for the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied territories. We are constrained  however  to find that Israel has not shown any willingness to do so; on the contrary  it is trying to bring about demographic changes in the occupied territories. We strongly appeal to Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories so that the tense atmosphere can be relaxed  which will be conducive to further negotiations.203.	There has been an alarming increase in the frequency of acts of terrorism  hijacking and other actions of reprisals and counter-reprisals. The wave of wanton killing  hijacking and kidnapping has become a matter of grave concern for us all. My delegation strongly condemns all such actions and urges that the main issue of terrorism should not be side-tracked and buried under verbose speeches.204.	1 have made a brief reference to the problems that face us in the world today. I might have sounded somewhat sceptical in my assessment of the world situation. Far from being so  I have only been suggesting that the present is an opportune moment to go to the depth of the real problems facing most of mankind today.205.	My delegation takes note with satisfaction of the encouraging developments which have appeared on the contemporary international horizon. The most significant among them is the end of the fighting in Viet-Nam. The Paris peace agreements on a Viet-Namese cease-fire were designed to end the untold misery and destruction suffered by the people of Viet-Nam for a long time. We hope that the terms of the Paris peace agreements will be scrupulously observed by all parties of the conflict so that lasting peace can be maintained in Viet-Nam. The withdrawal of American troops from South Viet-Nam is a welcome step. We reiterate our stand that the peoples of Indo-China should be left free and unhindered to decide their own future without any outside interference.206.	Another notable development is the admission of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to the United Nations this year. As a result of patient and skilful negotiations  the two countries have been able to sign a treaty on the basis of their relations towards the end of last year in Berlin. For us at the United Nations the admission of these two countries brings the Organization closer to universality. My delegation is happy to welcome the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany  both of which  with an aggregate population of 73 million  a surging economy and a highly-developed technology  will no doubt be a source of great strength and energy to the United Nations. Viewed from Europe  the admission of the German DemocraticRepublic and the Federal Republic of Germany marks the fulfilment of untiring efforts to bring about a spirit of co-operation and peaceful coexistence  which have been evading that continent for such a long time.207.	Nearer my country  India and Pakistan have been able to enter into an agreement regarding the repatriation of the prisoners of war and the exchange of civilians. My delegation heartily welcomes this step  which will go-a long way towards alleviating the humanitarian problem that had cropped up as a result of the 1971 conflict. My delegation hopes that the spirit of understanding and friendship will prevail in implementing the terms of the agreement. This agreement should further pave the way for the normalization of relations between India and Pakistan. This improved situation in the subcontinent should help Bangladesh to obtain its rightful entry to the United Nations.208.	My delegation would like to reiterate its support for General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI) regarding the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. Our support for this Declaration is motivated simply by a desire for peace in this sensitive area. My delegation hopes that concrete measures will be taken to implement the Declaration as soon as possible.209.	The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm in June 1972  was able to focus the attention of Governments and the public to the need for concerted action to preserve and enhance the human environment. The growing realization that protection of the environment is a problem being faced by both developed and developing countries  though in varying degree and nature  is a welcome fact. While for developed countries the problem of the human environment is a direct consequence of pollution and industrialization  for developing countries it has in its roots the unscrupulous use of natural resources and the inability to control the process of deterioration caused by nature. To give just one example  soil erosion has been posing a serious problem in my country. Vast tracts of fertile land are being annually washed away by rivers. We have not even been able to assess the damage caused annually as a result of the problem of soil erosion  much less to do something towards the solution of this problem. These and other such problems of the human environment should draw the immediate attention of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme.210.	In conclusion  I should like to stress that we have come to the United Nations to pledge our support and rededicate ourselves to the attainment of the noble ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We strongly feel that it is the only Organization which can bring peace and harmony in our world  which is divided between developed and developing nations and big and small nations. The States Members of the United Nations should work sincerely to make this Organization more effective to ensure lasting peace  to develop friendly relations among nations and to achieve international co-operation in solving various international problems."
"86",5329,"NZL",28,1973,"﻿60.	Mr. President  it is no mere duty but a real pleasure for me  in coming to the rostrum  to pay a tribute to you  the distinguished representative of Ecuador  and through you to the great Latin American community. I greet your country also as a good Pacific neighbour in the southern hemisphere  and we express the hope that every success will attend your efforts.61.	This is a session of the Assembly at which we will be assessing the growing relaxation of tensions and the breaking down of the old barriers between East and West.62.	The debates and the welcome action taken here on new Members are  of course  both a symbol and a practical result of these developments. But other results of the new relationship among the great Powers have still to be translated into practical benefits for the smaller countries and for this Organization. That new great Power relationship  that relaxation  has been brought about by a concert of convenience among the few. But we  the smaller nations  who need stable peace  co-operation and international order cannot rest satisfied with such a temporary and fragile situation. We have to find a way to build upon the relaxation  to bring it within a larger  more constructive and more permanent framework of international order.63.	A ""balance of power"" among the great Powers has doubtless contributed to the new spirit of relaxation in international affairs; and to that extent we of course welcome it. But we are not naive. ""Balance of power"" in the past has been merely another term for the continuation  in a different guise  of competition and rivalry. The great Powers have continued their efforts to shift the balance in their direction; and in due course they have miscalculated  the balance has collapsed and major wars have occurred. In so far as similar elements are inherent in the present situation the world will continue unstable and the detente will be fragile. For  let us not forget  the great Powers still remain free to undertake their unilateral actions. And some of those unilateral  often sadly misguided  actions have brought great suffering in recent years and set back the progress of wide sections of the whole human family. In this nuclear age unfettered freedom on the part of the more powerful members of the family of nations is too dangerous. The great Powers are beginning at last to show signs of recognizing this. We  and they  in their interests as well as ours  must move to repair the damaged structure of international order. They are establishing some sort of balance among themselves; our task is to build a framework for a healthier relationship between the so-called great and the small.64.	As the head of a newly elected Labour Government  I come to the international scene new; but the needs of the day seem startlingly obvious. Leaving aside the question of international security and international order  the chief need among nations is the same as the chief need within individual nations  —  that is  to achieve economic and social justice. That is the principal concern of my own Government at home; and I am convinced that it must also be the focal concern of the United Nations.65.	We view with profound concern and dismay a situation in which  more than a quarter of a century after the United Nations was founded  the most critical of issues show no sign of improvement. I refer to the immense and growing gap between standards of living in the industrialized countries and the developing countries. I refer to the world food situation  which is more difficult than at any time since the aftermath of the Second World War. I refer to the rapidly multiplying world population and the other pressures on available resources. These are the obvious ills of international society  complicated still further by an international monetary instability that jeopardizes the development plans of all countries  by the rapid price inflation in much of the world and  this year  by crop failures and famines.66.	We are in no doubt about the need to tackle more seriously the deepening division between the rich and the poor. It is depressing and deplorable  —  indeed it is intolerable  —  that most of the international conferences of the last decade or more have ultimately evolved along lines dividing the developed from the developing and in ways and with results in some cases which have reflected no credit on countries which were better off than others. Somehow-and sooner  not later  —  resources must be more equitably shared.67.	A few countries  a minority of the human family  are using the bulk of the world's resources-resources which we now increasingly realize are exhaustible. Yet  ironically  the ever-increasing consumption of these resources is steadily bringing less and less real enjoyment to the favoured few. An increasing number among them are realizing the dead end  —  the literal dead end  —  of a philosophy and a way of life favouring the accumulation of material things to the point of greed and senselessness. It is a philosophy that in its time brought immense material benefits; but the cost to society of its pursuit to excess is now being plainly revealed. Rich countries  at some time  must appreciate that enough is enough. The richer countries must turn consciously towards improving the more intangible qualities of life for themselves while making their energies and skills available to improve  to a far greater extent than ever before  the material level of life for the majority of poorer countries.68.	I mean  in other words  that a change in attitudes is required. If not  we run the risk that solutions will impose themselves by means of famine  pestilence  the exhaustion of resources and every form of social unrest and war. There is no need to manage so foolishly the resources of this beautiful planet. If this smacks of Idealism I make no apology for it. If there are no ideals there is no hope. We could do with more of the idealism with which we entered the post-war era  —  an idealism which has been pressed out by the weight of paper and speeches and resolutions and  yes  by the many sobering practical experiences of the last 28 years. One could  I can see it. be disillusioned and cynical. But it is imperative that we should act as if we believe the human race has a future. This may be idealistic  but I am not talking idealism  I am talking practicalities. The world has to move on to new courses if we are to survive. It is a matter of practical common sense.69.	My Government  since taking office  has been trying to put its convictions into effect  —  though I speak in no boastful way  for I am conscious of how small our efforts are when measured against the needs of others. But we are trying to translate into international terms the vision of a decent and humane society which motivates our domestic policies. We have reviewed our mutual assistance programmes against the internationally accepted targets which now form part of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. We did so because it seemed to us that there was no greater or more urgent priority confronting us in international affairs  —  at least among those priorities which we  as a non-great Power  were in a position to do anything about. We were especially concerned about the possibility of failure of the Strategy for the Second Development Decade implicit in the decision of many countries to maintain reservations about the targets of the Strategy. In a world where millions continue to go hungry New Zealand has not felt able to rest on its achievements despite a steady growth in the size of our aid programme in absolute terms.70.	My Government has therefore withdrawn previous reservations  on the Strategy targets. We shall seek to meet them. Notably  we have drawn up a programme of government aid which aims to increase more than threefold the existing flow of aid over the next three-year period. We hope to play our part through membership in the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme next year in ensuring expanded and equitable policies of United Nations aid for countries in need of it.71.	The process of working to improve conditions of life can never be one-sided; it is a mutual one. In the South Pacific in particular and in South-East Asia  which are areas of close interest to us  we look forward to continued co-operation with the countries of the region. Their resources and skills and the efforts of their peoples are an all-important factor and will deserve the major credit for success if the Second Decade's targets are gained. We have seen the way self-government and independence have drawn forth those skills in small South Pacific territories for which New Zealand was once responsible  —  Western Samoa and the Cook Islands. We look forward to the same constructive development and co-operation in the case of the island of Niue  whose representatives will be discussing their plans with you at this session.72.	What I have been saying grows out of my Government's strong feeling of the necessity-and  one can say increasingly  the inevitability-of social cohesion in the world today. This is not a unique notion of Labour Governments everywhere  but is rather the root idea of the United Nations Charter itself. We are all part of the one human family. Some of us welcome this  but the plain fact is that all of us have no choice but to adjust ourselves to this central fact of human existence.73.	Obviously a great deal more than aid is needed. Action has to be undertaken on many fronts. For instance  we heard with interest the proposal of the Secretary of State of the United States of America for a world conference on food [2124th meeting]. Such a proposal naturally interests a country like New Zealand  which is deeply involved in the production of food  and we welcome it. But immediately we consider such a proposal we realize afresh how interconnected all the problems of the world are. People are hungry  but in some countries farmers are paid not to produce  and land is taken out of production. Other food-producing countries  like ours  have difficulty in getting access to northern hemisphere markets  because agricultural arrangements have been established which have nothing to do with efficiency but a lot to do with politics and protectionism. Unless fanners can sell their products at fair prices more food is not likely to be produced. Without freer trade in agricultural products it will be difficult lo get Imore food to the people who need it. Thus we hardly start to talk of food before we are face to face with the fundamental issues raised by the new round of negotiations among the States parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). And the GATT round takes us to a series of other interconnected issues. Yet the basic problems are not really mysterious at all or incapable of resolution if the will is there. Somehow the resources of this planet and the needs of the human family have to be matched. It can be done and it can be done in a way that would benefit all and harm very few.74.	Both the proliferation of nuclear weapons generally  and the testing of nuclear weapons and devices in the atmosphere  notably in the. South Pacific  have caused New Zealand deepest concern. We view with disquiet the whole attitude of mind by which nuclear weaponry is preserved and indeed fortified as the years go by. In every way possible  —  by protests to the Governments concerned  by action in the General Assembly  by application to the International Court of Justice  —  we have made every effort to bring about the cessation of nuclear testing. But  the testing in the Pacific zone has still persisted.75.	In the more general context we have heard with dismay recently of the reported acquisition by the Soviet Union of a more advanced weapons delivery system which will increase the danger of a new round of nuclear weapons escalation. This news underlines the urgency of achieving further progress in disarmament.76.	This Organization has recently marked the tenth anniversary of the partial test-ban treaty. But there have been more explosions on the average each year since the Treaty was signed than in the years of the nuclear age that preceded the Treaty. Testing continues unabated. Two nuclear Powers have deliberately ignored the Treaty and have continued with intensive programmes of nuclear testing in the atmosphere  with scant regard for the environment in which we all live or for the growing outcry from world opinion. The remaining nuclear Powers which are parties to the Treaty have continued with underground tests  thereby affording the two Powers that are not party to the Treaty with a pretext for pressing ahead with their own programmes. There has been a lamentable lack of progress in the preparation of a Treaty which would impose a comprehensive ban on all testing  in spite of the undertaking contained in the preamble to the 1963 Treaty to work for such an agreement.77.	In the absence of a comprehensive agreement  accepted by all the nuclear Powers and backed by the overwhelming weight of world opinion  there must remain an acute and continuing danger that still more countries will seek to acquire nuclear weapons. The proliferation of nuclear weapons - measurably advances the certainty of nuclear war  and only a universal ban on weapons testing can eliminate this grave threat. I am convinced that the people of every country are sick of war and the threat of war. They do not want nuclear weapons and their attendant threats. They want peace and they want more progress towards it. Is it impossible for Governments to be moved by the desires of ordinary people?78.	Just as we shall not solve the problems of pollution  or the exhaustion of the planet's resources  or the growing gulf between the rich and the poor  unless we change our attitudes towards the accumulation of things  so we shall not solve the problems of war and of international order unless we change our attitudes towards power and the accumulation of power. Arms are the potential for war  for mass slaughter  for the human family to destroy itself. Let us keep in the forefront of our thinking a conviction that war is now unacceptable as an instrument for achieving national aims.79.	Might we not then deduce the consequences of this truth? Shall we continue to recognize nations as ""great Powers"" merely because they have the capacity to inflict greater damage than any other nation? Of course if they acted  under the Charter  as protectors of the human family  they might be so recognized; but in the last 28 years they have demonstrated convincingly their incapacity to rise to such a role; they have failed to match power with responsibility. Sometimes the shepherds have preyed upon the sheep. Might we not therefore respond by questioning the scale of values that puts power at the top? Might we not insist on a different scale of values  a human scale  a civilized scale  a scale based on the belief that the truly great country is the country which shows concern for the quality of life both of its own people and of its neighbours? We have to eliminate the very institution of war from international dealings. Let us therefore start adjusting our attitudes and bring that changed approach to this very Organization. In that way we might prepare the ground for the changes which are required if the United Nations is to meet the needs of human beings here and now and in the challenging years immediately ahead of it.80.	For-and do we doubt it? -so long as the old attitudes persist  so long will those nations that aspire to so-called greatness strain and swell themselves to reach the critical bulk and dignity. To attain the honour of sitting at the ""top table"" they will waste natural resources and cause damage and concern to their neighbours. But let us see for what it is the absurdity of a lonely few sitting at their top table with their obscene weapons which they can use only by committing suicide. That ""honour"" is surely now an empty one-if it ever was otherwise. Let us develop values that are relevant to the real world and get to grips with the real business of mankind.81.	In the case of at least one of the great Powers many citizens are realizing the basic truth about power in the nuclear age and are moving to work out its implications. But in the meantime  what do we  the smaller Members of the United Nations  do  —  we whose requests and pleas are arrogantly brushed aside  perhaps not even listened to?82.	The small Powers should demand a more effective voice in disarmament negotiations. Let us begin at this session of the Assembly with a concerted call for the earliest possible conclusion of a treaty to ban all forms of nuclear-weapons testing. If no significant progress is made through the existing machinery within one year  the Assembly should  I suggest  consider calling a general conference to draft such a treaty.83.	We have also to confront the simple fact that in the last 10 years or so international law and international organizations have been the casualties of the cold war. We face a desolate landscape within the United Nations. Some Powers have either ignored the United Nations or brought threats to it only when diplomacy had failed and it was too late for the United Nations to act effectively. How often have they then blamed the United Nations and justified their own unilateral actions by its alleged ineffectiveness? It is now for the smaller countries to take up the task of making this Organization work. If the great Powers will also show a change of approach  the United Nations  and mankind with it  will get back into business.84.	I have already mentioned the possibility of a concerted call for a treaty to ban all nuclear-weapons testing. The small Powers may also wish to consider carefully the possibilities of partial disarmament or demilitarization on a regional basis where circumstances and geography make it appropriate. One of my Government's first acts after election last year was to change New Zealand's vote at the Assembly in order to express its sympathy with the concept of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean. At the Conference of the Commonwealth Heads of Government in Ottawa in August  New Zealand joined in a unanimous endorsement of the action of the Foreign Ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations in adopting a declaration to make South-East Asia a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality. In the words of the Commonwealth communique of 10 August 1973  we regard that initiative as a positive contribution towards peace and stability in that region. New Zealand looks with favour also on the establishment by treaty of nuclear-free zones such as that accorded by the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco)  and we intend to consult with our Pacific neighbours about the feasibility of establishing a similar kind of nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific region.85.	In the field of the settlement of disputes the small nations could achieve gains by showing a readiness to submit disputes to the International Court or to arbitration. There is a disturbing tendency for some influential countries to pay lip-service to the importance of international law and the role of the Court  but in practice to take all possible steps to avoid its jurisdiction. The more countries that accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court the more internationally unacceptable such evasive practices will become and the greater will be the pressure for the unreserved acceptance of the Court's jurisdiction.86.	Small nations can help to prevent wars and to assist the peaceful resolution of tense situations by strengthening the peace-keeping role of the United Nations. They can do this by earmarking units on which the United Nations may call for peace-keeping purposes. My own Government has decided to train units of its defence services in readiness for participation in future United Nations peace-keeping operations. Small nations may  I believe  express justified disappointment at the lack of progress hitherto recorded by the Assembly's Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations. Recognizing the valuable contributions made by Canada and one or two other members  they should press for the completion of the Committee's mandate set out in resolutions dating from 1967. There is no doubt that the Secretary-General must be given moral and practical support in the initiatives he may have to take in the exercise of his responsibilities in regard to peace and security.87.	If we think of ourselves as a single family  and if we are going to work together for economic advancement  for the prevention of pollution and other ills  and to escape the threat of war  it follows that we must work together on racial discrimination  which is  justly  one of the major preoccupations of our Organization. This has been a year in which a number of situations affecting human rights have constituted gross affronts to the ideals of the United Nations. In some countries with serious racial problems great efforts have been made and substantial progress achieved in the direction of racial equality  as has happened  for example  in our host country during the lifespan of the United Nations. In other countries racial segregation continues  notoriously  to be enshrined in government policy. In still other countries members of a racial minority who wish to emigrate are subject to onerous conditions and delays  and in yet* another country  members of a racial group have been expelled at short notice and stripped of their possessions without compensation. To these and other situations the response of the United Nations membership has varied widely; some have virtually ignored them.88.	My own Government is opposed to racial discrimination and oppression no matter where it is practised  by whom  or in whatever form. We have been combing through United Nations resolutions and taking whatever action is appropriate to ensure that our own house is in order. Above and beyond those obligations we have voluntarily accepted a visit from a United Nations representative investigating the problems of indigenous populations. New Zealand is  as far as I know  the first country to show a United Nations mission all aspects of its internal racial situation. We hope that the report of this mission shortly to be presented  will be of value not only to New Zealand but to the United Nations as a whole.89.	In concert with others  New Zealand will work towards re-establishing the Organization as a protector of the interests of the majority of States  and in particular of the small States. The calls for justice and equity made by the huge new membership must be listened to and heeded. The aspirations of the smaller Powers  their fears  their determination to build a world without war  a world where the rule of law prevails  a world where the weaker will not be subservient to the political and economic interests of the stronger-these demands cannot be ignored. We agree with the Secretary-General that we need action  innovation and determination if mankind is not to be overtaken once again by the dark destructive or selfish side of human nature. We are eager to play our part in creating a true family of man."
"87",5374,"OMN",28,1973,"﻿243.	Mr. President  permit me to express to you on behalf of the delegation of Oman our whole-hearted satisfaction at your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its twenty- eighth session. Your many years of experience here among us at the United Nations  in the capacity of Permanent Representative of your noble country  will  I am confident  be much appreciated by my fellow representatives in the course of the coming session  and I take this opportunity to assure you of the full and utmost support and co-operation of my delegation in the execution of your duties.244.	I should also like to take this opportunity to convey  on behalf of my delegation and my Government  our admiration of the exemplary and able manner in which your predecessor  Mr. Trepczynski of the Polish People's Republic  guided the proceedings of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly.245.	My Government and delegation welcomes the new Members of the United Nations and their delegations to these halls. Their presence here among us constitutes one further step towards the achievement of universality in this noble Organization  and my delegation looks forward to co-operating with the representatives of those new Members. We also take this occasion to wish all success and happiness to the Government and people of the newly independent Commonwealth of the Bahamas.246.	Last year in his address to the General Assembly my Minister of State for Foreign Affairs expressed the hope of the Omani Government and delegation that the divided countries of this world would soon  after their success in reaching detente and mutually beneficial agreements  join us here as full Members of the United Nations. The applications and consequent admissions of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the German Democratic Republic so soon after expressing our hopes on this matter is therefore all the more welcome to us.247.	Not all of the hopes and aspirations that my delegation and many other delegations expressed at the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly have materialized as speedily and effectively as those in regard to those new Members-least of all in the Middle East. In fact the situation in that area  so critical to world peace and to the efficacy and credibility of this noble Organization  has only worsened in the course of the past year. Israeli intransigence has only further hardened this year  as it has every year since the 1967 Zionist aggression against three States Members of the United Nations. Israeli aggression and use of violence against Arab States in total defiance of our Charter  and of all international laws and standards of behaviour that are enjoined upon Members of this Organization  have in the course of the past year only e/.acerbatedthe situation. The tactics of terror and intimidation that have been the mainstays of Zionist policy since the beginning of Zionist aggression against the territory and people of Palestine have in the course of the past year reached new and unprecedented levels of violence and bestiality.248.	We need only recall here the frequent incursions by the regular armed forces of Israel into the territory and air space of neighbouring Arab States  when they have threatened the lives of if not killed or maimed  innocent civilians and passengers of civil airlines. We need only recall the premeditated bestial assassinations of the leaders of the heroic Palestinian resistance movement  the downing of the Libyan civilian airliner killing and maiming over 100 innocent passengers  the piratical hijacking over Lebanese air space of a Lebanese civilian airliner jeopardizing the lives of over 80 passengers  and the recent aggression by the Zionist air force into the air space of the Syrian Arab Republic.249.	Those and many other acts of aggression and State terrorism committed by Israel in the course of the past year have been widely condemned and censured by public opinion around the world as well as by the Security Council and the International Civil Aviation Organization. Furthermore  in the course of the past year many countries from Africa and elsewhere have shown their displeasure and condemnation of Israel's aggressive policies by cutting off all diplomatic and other relations with Israel  and an overwhelming majority of the States Members of this Organization have seen the need for more effective measures by the international community to ensure that Israel not only respects the numerous resolutions adopted by this body but also yields to an international consensus that is determined to establish a just and lasting peace in the Middle East  based upon the principles of our Charter and the tenets of international law. My Government and delegation strongly believe that the time has come for such effective measures  for as the Middle East situation worsens year after year  and as Zionist aggression and terrorism„ continue to increase year by year  the further and wider will the ramifications and implications of the situation spread  and the greater will be the threat to the peace and security of the whole world.250.	In that context my delegation welcomed the recent initiative of our Secretary-General to achieve a breakthrough in the present deadlock in the Middle East crisis  and we wish him every success in following up that noble and worthwhile endeavour.251.	I direct my appeal for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East especially to the super-Powers and the permanent members of the Security Council. Those Powers  because of their influence and their permanent seats in the Security Council  are particularly responsible for the peace and security of the world. They have a moral obligation in their policies to work for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East  both within the United Nations and outside it. Too often in the past have those Powers been motivated in their policies towards that area by short-sighted considerations of strategic advantage; too often have the Powers been motivated in their policies towards that area by short-sighted considerations of their own domestic politics.By so doing those Powers compromise the confidence that the peoples of smaller nations around the world place in the big Powers and shed doubts on the reliability  integrity and moral rectitude of the super-Powers.252.	For that reason we welcome any detente between the super-Powers  for it can be only through such detente and co-operation that the peace of the world can be ensured. The recent summit talks between the United States and the Soviet Union and other agreements achieved by those super-Powers are a source of genuine hope for peoples around the world  and we would all hope that as a result of this detente the super-Powers will be able to work co-operatively instead of competitively for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East  and in other troubled areas of the world.253.	The winding down of the war in Indo-China in the course of the past year has been a major achievement in our progress to peace. That achievement reflects the atmosphere of detente between the super-Powers  and it is the hope of my delegation that in the course of the coming year not only will all violence and hostilities in that troubled area cease but also the super-Powers will work within the United Nations and outside it to remove that part of the world from the arena of super-Power rivalry and to assist the peoples of Indo-China to embark once again on the course of progress and economic and social development.254.	My Government supports the just struggle of African peoples to achieve freedom and self-determination in South Africa  Zimbabwe  Angola  Mozambique  Namibia and elsewhere in Africa.255.	The policies of apartheid  racial discrimination and even deliberate massacres of indigenous peoples  as practised by the colonial regimes in Africa  constitute a flagrant violation of the spirit of our Charter and of numerous resolutions passed by the United Nations. The Government of Oman  which bans all commercial dealings with such regimes  believes that the continued existence of colonial racist regimes in this day and age poses a great threat to the international security that all countries  especially the developing countries of the world  need if they are to achieve social and economic progress.256.	This year my Government has continued to develop the domestic  regional and international framework for such security and stability  which is a vital prerequisite for all economic and social development not only in Oman but also in the entire region. My Government has also sought to work in co-operation with other countries in the region to establish the harmony  security and stability that we all need. In this context my Sovereign  His Majesty Sultan Qabus  has this year undertaken a series of highly successful State visits to various countries in the region to establish the framework for good neighbourly relations and regional co-operation.257.	In further pursuit of these international and regional policies my Government has this year become a member of the non-aligned group of nations. My country's adherence to that noble organization reflects not only my Government's commitment to its principles  ideals and objectives but also our deep faith in the actual and potential contributions that the organization can make to the cause of peace and progress for mankind  founded as it is upon the principles of co-operation and non-interference in the domestic affairs of other States. Those principles  especially that of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other sovereign States  ensure for the organization of non-aligned States the promise of great success in the future in meeting its noble objectives  for it has been shown that it is lack of understanding and interference in the domestic affairs of other sovereign States that have in the past been the causes of war and instability. My Government is strongly committed to the principle of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other States  and by the same token has resisted and will continue to resist all attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of our country by certain Powers and elements that seek to sow dissent and sedition in our country and thereby to retard our economic and social development.258.	In conclusion  I have spoken here today about my Government's position on various international issues and about the responsibilities and policies of the nations. In all this  the United Nations and its specialized agencies have a great and historic role to play  and I take this occasion once again to express the deep faith that the Sultanate of Oman has in the United Nations and in its capacity to work for peace in the world based upon its Charter and its principles  to which we in Oman remain deeply committed."

Mr. President  when my Prime Minister spoke  before the general debate opened [2122nd meeting]  he conveyed to you the congratulations of the Government and the people of Pakistan on your election to your high office. Allow me to add my own and those of my delegation  and to extend our good wishes to you in your task. I take this occasion also to recall the ability and skill with which your predecessor  Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Trepczynski of Poland  conducted the proceedings of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly last year  and in particular the remarkable role he played in putting to rest the controversy caused  during that session  by the application of Bangladesh for membership in the United Nations.138.	On 6 October war broke out in the Middle East  as many had foreseen that it might. Since then  we have heard an account of the situation from the countries directly involved and the great Powers have made statements in the Security Council. In the view of my delegation  it will serve no purpose to determine who fired the first shot. In any event  the Arabs would be fully justified  morally and politically  in taking whatever steps they consider necessary to recover their own territory. The reason why the fighting has broken out is plain enough.139.	For almost six years the Arabs and the rest of the world have waited for a peaceful settlement in the Middle East in accordance with resolution 242 (1967)  adopted in the Security Council in November 1967. Every effort made since then to resolve this conflict has been frustrated by the intransigence of Israel. More than that  by continuing to take action to consolidate its hold over the Arab territories it seized during the 1967 war  Israel has put the world on notice that it has no intention whatsoever to part with that territory. In other words  it has no intention to implement the resolution in question. At the same time  it has tried from time to time during these six years to terrorize its Arab neighbours into submission. Their patience has been exhausted  and considering that all peaceful avenues to settlement have been blocked  it is small wonder that the Arabs have taken up the challenge and decided to meet force with force.140.	War is tragic in that it inflicts suffering on innocent people as well. My delegation is shocked at the news that Israel has bombed civilian areas of Cairo and Damascus. The attack on Damascus appears to have been particularly vicious. The diplomatic quarter has also been hit and a number of embassies  including our own  have been severely damaged  and diplomatic personnel and their families have been killed or injured. This senseless act cannot be too strongly condemned. It can only lead to further escalation of this conflict.141.	The time has come for the United Nations  and in particular the great Powers  to assert themselves in the cause of peace. It is no longer enough that we think in terms merely of another cease-fire. The Organization has to find ways not only to silence the guns but also to allow the voice of reason to prevail. The elements of an equitable settlement are contained in resolution 242 (1967). It is time to begin in earnest to implement it by requiring Israel to withdraw from all Arab territories it occupied in the 1967 war. Once this is agreed to and the evaluation of the territory begins  a long-term settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict can be worked out on the basis of resolution 242 (1967)  tearing in mind that any settlement  to be enduring  must provide for the restoration of the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine.142.	I now turn to other matters. In the first place  we should like to welcome the admission into the United Nations of the two German States and of the Bahamas  the latest of the colonial Territories to achieve independence.We extend to the representatives of all three States to this Organization our warmest good wishes on behalf of the people of Pakistan.143.	Some delegations have expressed the hope that Bangladesh too will soon join the Organization. We share that hope. There are  however  certain impediments that stand in the way.144.	In Delhi recently an agreement was reached  nearly two years after the India-Pakistan war ended  that India will repatriate the prisoners of war. But not all prisoners of war: 195 of them are to be retained in India for possible trials by Bangladesh for criminal offences allegedly committed by those prisoners during the tragic happenings of 1971. We tried very hard — I myself was involved in those negotiations — to persuade India to release all prisoners of war  without exception  in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations and the Geneva Conventions  but we failed.145.	As pointed out by my Prime Minister recently in this Assembly [2122nd meeting]  the Government of Pakistan will abide by the letter and spirit of those resolutions and  in pursuance of those resolutions  will not resist the admission of Bangladesh to the United Nations as soon as all our prisoners of war  including the 195  have been repatriated to Pakistan.146.	The key to Bangladesh's entry into the United Nations clearly lies in the hands of India and Bangladesh. We hope that agreement on the repatriation of these prisoners of war also will soon be reached. In that event we will not only not resist Bangladesh's entry into the United Nations  but will warmly welcome it.147.	Despite India's inability for the time being to agree to repatriation of these 195 prisoners  the Delhi agreement is a major step forward towards an over-all settlement in the subcontinent. The three-way repatriation of the prisoners of war from India and of thousands of Bengalis and Pakistan nationals stranded in Pakistan and Bangladesh  respectively  is now under way. My Government attaches the highest importance to the speedy implementation of this agreement. As an earnest of our desire to implement it faithfully and speedily  we proceeded to repatriate Bengalis to Bangladesh 10 days before India started to repatriate the prisoners of war  even though under the agreement the repatriation of prisoners of war and of Bengalis had to be simultaneous. We also sent off the 203 senior Bengali civil and military officials we had originally intended to try for treasonable activities with the earliest batches of Bengalis repatriated 10 Bangladesh. We are hopeful that India and Bangladesh will also implement this agreement with the same dispatch and in the same spirit. We also hope that before long India will agree to repatriate the remaining 195 prisoners of war as well. The way will then have been opened for further moves for normalizing relations not only with India but. also with Bangladesh  with a view to strengthening the fabric of peace in the subcontinent.148.	I should like here to record our gratitude to the international community for the generosity and speed with which it has come forward with assistance  and to the Secretary-General for undertaking a massive operation  for the repatriation by air of an estimated 170 000 to 200 000 men  women and children. 149.	It was at Simla that for the first time in the post- independence history of the subcontinent the Governments of Pakistan and India resolved to put an end to the conflict and confrontation that had hitherto marred their relations and work for the establishment of a durable peace in the subcontinent. The Agreement signed at Simla on 2 July 1972 states:.. the prerequisite for reconciliation  good neighbourliness and durable peace between them is a commitment by both the countries to peaceful coexistence  respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty  and non-interference in each other's internal affairs..."".The two countries also agreed to refrain from the threat or use of force against each other's territorial integrity or political independence. We consider that the agreement between India and Pakistan to order their relationship on this basis was the most important achievement of the summit meeting at Simla. We are resolved to fulfil that commitment in every respect.150.	In fact  this has been the basis of our relations with all countries. In particular  the commitment not to interfere in each other's internal affairs on any pretext whatsoever has been the guiding principle of Pakistan's foreign policy in its relations with all of its immediate neighbours. We scrupulously refrain from interfering in their internal affairs  and we naturally expect from them the same respect for our sovereign rights.151.	Our quest for peace and stability in the Middle East  in the subcontinent and in Asia in general leads us to welcome the detente that is beginning to mark the relations between the major Powers. We welcome it in the hope that it may  as it must  eventually encompass also other areas and issues which at the moment may seem to those Powers as being of subsidiary importance but which are of vital concern to the smaller nations. As has been tragically demonstrated again by the recent outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East  there is no assurance whatsoever that despite the detente what are often casually referred to as local wars would not continue to erupt. Indeed  there is cause for some apprehension that in their anxiety to promote and preserve the detente  the big Powers might be willing to overlook or sacrifice the interests of the smaller Powers. We should like to see the detente so develop that the smaller countries also may be able to live in peace and harmony with each other.152.	Another disturbing feature of the present situation is that the major Powers continue to arm themselves in spite of the detente. Perhaps it is too early yet to see the detente reflected in the field of disarmament. The acid test of the genuineness of the detente will  in our judgement  be the readiness of the major Powers to disarm themselves  which may act as a catalyst for a world-wide move towards general disarmament. The present situation  however  involves a contradiction. For all the talk of a detente  the major Powers remain engaged in producing tools of destruction which are ever more sophisticated and ever more deadly. We fear that there is a basic lack of trust among the nuclear Powers. We fear for them and for the rest of mankind and the terrible price that all of us might have to pay if a major war were unleashed.153.	Born and nurtured under conditions of insecurity basically stemming from an imbalance of power  now greatly altered to its disadvantage  Pakistan's commitment to the goal of general disarmament can scarcely be doubted. Realizing that an arms race between India and Pakistan is senseless  largely self-cancelling  and involves an appalling waste of the scarce resources desperately needed for their economic advancement  Pakistan at one stage unilaterally cut its defence expenditure. Unfortunately  this action failed to evoke a suitable response  and in recent years in both India and Pakistan the diversion of resources to military expenditure has continued at a disturbingly high rate  to the neglect of their pressing economic needs. We consider that both India and Pakistan should seriously ponder whether the time has not come for them drastically to cut their military budgets and put their resources to better use in staging a war against their common enemy  poverty. As stated by my Prime Minister during his recent visit to this country  we will be ready to discuss this issue with India at an appropriate time in the context of our joint agreement to work for durable peace in the subcontinent.154.	It was the realization that the arms race that afflicts the world is dangerous and self-defeating that led Pakistan to propose  as far back as 1961  that a study be undertaken of the economic consequences of disarmament. The conclusions of that study are more than ever applicable today in view of the vast increases in military expenditures that have since taken place. The world is now spending something like $225 000 million a year on armaments. What a sad commentary on the ""Disarmament Decade"". What a macabre tragedy in terms of resources wasted when hundreds of millions of people on this globe live in abject poverty  haunted by the continual threat of starvation or death from malnutrition  when a mere fraction of this enormous expenditure on arms could help lift the pall of fear that envelopes this unfortunate segment of mankind.155.	The time has come to shift the current emphasis from world-wide military security to world-wide economic security. Constructive action in the field of arms control and disarmament could release substantial savings for development which alone could lead to the effective underpinning of a durable structure of world-wide peace.156.	The need for disarmament is universally recognized. And yet  after years of negotiations and numerous studies  hardly any real progress has been mad . Armaments continue to pile up at an alarming rate. In particular  delay in controlling and eliminating nuclear weapons could be fatal. The monopoly of a few could soon become the preserve of many  making the task of eliminating nuclear weapons even more difficult and the danger of a universal holocaust more real.157.	The existing ""balance of terror"" — which is in fact only a modern version of the old principle of ""balance of power"" in a nuclear garb — has so far prevented the outbreak of war on a world-wide scale. However  this could create a false sense of security. It should not make us oblivious to the dangers to peace posed by regional imbalance in armaments  by resurgent desires for hegemony or by the perpetuation of intolerable injustices  and by the rapidly widening gap between the north and the south  the white and the coloured  the rich and the poor. The mere prevention of a major war does not ipso facto mean the assurance of justice on the basis of which alone a durable peace can be built.158.	We see proof of this proposition in the recent flare-up of fighting in the Middle East and the situations prevailing in South and South-East Asia and in Africa.159.	It is a matter of great regret and disappointment that . after 28 years of its existence the United Nations should still be considering the questions of colonialism and racial discrimination. Those questions should have been resolved long ago in conformity with the provisions of the Charter. The shocking spectacle of millions of people still subjected to ruthless colonial domination and exploitation  and still suffering degrading racial discrimination  continues to weigh heavy on the conscience of mankind. The situation is particularly distressing in Zimbabwe  Namibia  the Territories under Portuguese administration and in South Africa. We may derive some satisfaction from the fact that the just struggle of the oppressed peoples themselves to achieve their inalienable right to freedom and racial equality is making steady progress. Temporary set-backs have only spurred them to rededication to waging this struggle even more relentlessly. Pakistan's known commitment to this struggle and its solidarity with all those who are fighting for freedom on the basis of their right to self-determination remains strong and firm. In this context I am happy to announce that my Government has recognized Guinea- Bissau.160.	These are some of the issues that in our judgement deserve consideration by this august body. There is one other issue which is exercising the minds of people everywhere. Whither United Nations? We believe that the effectiveness  and indeed the future of the United Nations  will depend not only on its ability to prevent war  but on its ability to ensure justice. It is on the distinction between justice and injustice that the Organization will founder or survive. The Charter accepts and makes clear that distinction  but does the membership of the United Nations? In December 1971  the General Assembly  expressing the voice of mankind  issued a clarion call by 105 votes to protect the integrity and sovereignty of a Member State. The Security Council  hampered by a procedure that has lost relevance to today's world  muted and suppressed that voice by a single negative vote.161.	That part of history is behind us. But is this to remain the pattern for the future? It is our profound hope that it will not. Our faith in the United Nations survives the vicissitudes of the past. It is a faith tempered by a keen awareness of its shortcomings. It is a faith that demands that the United Nations be made stronger and more effective: a United Nations which has the ability to settle disputes that threaten peace  an Organization under which the survival of the weak will find the same guarantee as that of the strong  an Organization guided by principles  not political expediency  where justice will rule instead of the dictates of power politics. Therein lies the hope of mankind and that of generations to come."
"89",5465,"PAN",28,1973,"﻿49.	Mr. President  first of all  on behalf of the Government and people of Panama  and personally  may I offer you our fraternal congratulations on your election to preside over this session of the world Organization. Your election to such a high post is a matter of satisfaction to Latin Americans. This is a doubly well-earned distinction because of your ability as a humanist and because you represent the supreme values of American culture as a spokesman of a country whose history has been written in pages of glory in the struggle for independence of Latin America.50.	We are also gratified to extend our cordial welcome to the representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany  the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas on their admission as new Members of the United Nations. We are convinced that these States  one of which in fact belongs to our continent  will make a significant contribution to the work of carrying out to the fullest extent the purposes and principles of the Charter.51.	I should also like to greet the Secretary-General of the United Nations  whose efforts to make the ideals and principles of the Organization effective have earned him the appreciation and acknowledgement of the Members of the Organization  as well as of world public opinion. I also wish to greet the staff of the Secretariat who so devotedly and efficiently work in the different spheres of the world Organization's activities.52.	My country  together with other small and medium- sized nations  has studied with great care the statements made by the eminent spokesmen of the world superpowers  who attach renewed importance to the work of our Organization and offer new prospects to mankind that the values and ideals of the United Nations will be sincerely and effectively put into practice.53.	The new attitude that can be read into the statements made by the Powers of the East and the West obviously reflect the transformations that are taking place in the disposition of world forces. One of the main aspects of this change is the increasingly important and legitimate participation in international decisions of the medium-sized and smaller nations  particularly those that in the last 25 years have gradually emerged from colonialism and dependency and have become independent and sovereign States.54.	It is an undeniable historic fact that admission to the Organization of new nations has increased the vigour of the United Nations potential to achieve fulfilment of the purposes and principles of the Charter  and particularly that of ensuring the true sovereign equality of States. Gradually  a new international order has gained ground and force  based on the true and effective development .of the purposes and principles of the Charter  which safeguard the right of the countries that lack war power and economic strength  and respect their sovereignty and their right to exploit their natural resources to benefit their economic and social development. The position of these countries in the international concert of nations is well-defined and the recently adopted Declaration of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-aligned Countries  held in Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973  stresses the point that I am trying to make. In that Declaration  they reaffirmed the decision to base their international relations on the principles of sovereign equality and respect for territorial integrity  to avoid the threat or use of force in international disputes; and to work out peaceful settlements in accordance with the principles of the Charter. The Declaration also appeals to all States to act in accordance with such principles.55.	The Republic of Panama has based its international policy on firm adherence to the principles adopted by the non-aligned nations and is therefore committed to the task of achieving world-wide respect for the right of peoples to self-determination and to the task of bringing about decolonization  which is one of the categorical imperatives of our day.56.	However  the small nations still have some misgivings with regard to the apparently encouraging statements made by the great Powers. The good faith underlying these statements has to be proved with concrete facts. Events take place daily which vitiate the professions of openness on the part of certain Powers. The gigantic economic and military power of some of these nations constitutes a danger to the sovereignty  independence  and territorial integrity of the smaller nations  and this is particularly so for those Governments that are endeavouring to change their old economic and social structures in order to benefit the great masses of the population. There are still retrograde sectors and multinational economic cartels that refuse to agree that every country has the right to decide its own future for itself.57.	As far as we  the small countries  are concerned  the strengthening of the United Nations is one of our major hopes. In point of fact  it is the sole hope that we have of strengthening our independence and wiping out colonialism and all forms of oppression that still subsist in large areas of the world and this fact is brought home to us in our international relations.58.	Our national sentiments are offended by the brutal fact that on Panamanian soil jurisdictional limitations still exist that weigh heavily on our national existence. Since part of our objective is to free ourselves from this unjust situation  we undertake to make known our cause to all the sister Republics of America and to put it before the peoples of the world  because the persistence of a colonial situation in Panama is of concern to the community of nations.59.	Pursuant to these plans  the Panamanian Government  at the beginning of this year  called for the holding of Security Council sessions away from Headquarters so that that body might consider ""measures for the maintenance and strengthening of international peace and security in Latin America in conformity with the provisions and principles of the Charter""  to use the words of Security Council resolution 325 (1973).60.	My country had the honour of acting as host to the Security Council in Panama City from 15 to 21 March 1973. At that historic series of meetings  the question of the Panama Canal was thoroughly debated and we made it clear that we no longer wished to be a divided country bisected by a colonial enclave set in the very heart of the Panamanian isthmus.61.	These legitimate Panamanian aspirations  which have been recognized in official documents of the two countries concerned  without any real action being taken  can be summed up briefly as follows: first  to abrogate the Isthmian Canal Convention of 1903 that was agreed to in perpetuity and all the amendments thereto; second  to convene on a completely new  equitable and just treaty regarding the present Panama Canal; third  to respect the effective sovereignty of Panama over the totality of its territory; fourth  to ensure the reintegration of the so-called Panama Canal Zone in the Republic of Panama  so that it is no longer subject to the United States jurisdiction; and fifth  to lay the groundwork for the assumption by the Republic of Panama of full responsibility for the efficient functioning of the interoceanic Canal.62.	My presence in this Assembly hall is due inter alia to my desire to repeat to the members of the Security Council  to the brother Republics of Latin America  and to the nations from other latitudes that supported our efforts and continue to encourage us  our undying gratitude and thanks. These deeply rooted feelings of gratitude are extended also to the illustrious representatives of Austria  China  France and the Soviet Union  who all voted in favour of a joint draft resolution that was submitted to the Security Council.63.	In the statement that the President of the Security Council read on behalf of his colleagues when he adjourned the meeting in Panama   the justice of our cause was set forth. According to that statement  the majority of the speakers at the Panama session stressed the fact that all States have the inalienable right to full jurisdiction over the totality of their territory. They also stressed that it is essential for all States to abstain from any act that might undermine the national unity and the territorial integrity of any other State. And on this point they stressed that the denial to Panama of its intrinsic right to full sovereignty and jurisdiction over the entirety of its territory  including the Panama Canal Zone  is a constant source of tension and  as such  constitutes a threat to peace and security in Latin America. They said that  in order to eliminate that threat  Panama must be given full sovereignty over the so-called Panama Canal Zone and the foreign military bases must be dismantled.64.	Practically all speakers expressed the opinion that without any doubt Panama has the right to make the maximum use of its main natural resource  namely  its geographical position  so as to benefit its own economic development; they pointed out also that the situation in the Panama Canal Zone constitutes a flagrant violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We are particularly grateful for the decision taken by Peru  Guinea  India  Indonesia  Kenya  Sudan and Yugoslavia to sponsor with Panama a draft resolution on the question of the Panama Canal.  In accordance with that draft resolution  the Security Council-after having taken note of the willingness shown by the Governments of Panama and the United States of America to reach a just and fair agreement with a view to the prompt elimination of the causes of the conflict between them and to establish in a formal instrument agreements on the abrogation of the 1903 Convention on the Isthmian Canal and its amendments  and to conclude a new treaty that would fulfil Panama's legitimate aspirations and guarantee full respect for Panama's effective sovereignty over all of its territory —  would have urged the two governments to continue negotiations in a high spirit of friendship  mutual respect and co-operation and to conclude without delay a new treaty aimed at the prompt elimination of the causes of conflict between them.65.	However  that draft resolution was not approved because of the negative vote cast by one of the permanent members of the Security Council. Yet the result of the vote was that  of the 15 members of the Council  13 voted in favour; one — the United Kingdom — abstained; and the United States cast a negative vote.66.	I shall not prolong this statement by commenting on the political  diplomatic and psychological consequences of that outcome  but I cannot avoid repeating that it is obvious that the case of Panama requires a just and equitable solution without delay.67.	The Secretary-General  with his usual competence and dignity  described the correct approach to the solution of the problem. He informed the members of the Security Council at a meeting of that body that: ""This problem awaits a solution which can only be based on the respect for law and the search for justice."" And he added: ""A solution will have to take into account the basic principles which are enshrined in the Charter such as the principle of territorial integrity  sovereign equality  the obligation to settle all international disputes by peaceful means and the principle which by now has become an accepted common standard  namely  that any State is entitled to put to full use and for its own account all its natural potentialities."" 68.	There can be no doubt that the support given to Panama by the Security Council and the views expressed by the Secretary-General evoked a positive response in important international circles. Proof of this can perhaps be found in the fact that President Richard Nixon in his annual report to the United States Congress on 3 May 1973  after referring generally to Latin America  specifically referred to the problem existing between his country and the Republic of Panama. In that message he pointed out that""Another important unresolved problem concerns the Panama Canal and the surrounding Zone. U.S. operation of the Canal and our presence in Panama are governed by the terms of a treaty drafted in 1903.""He later noted:""The world has changed radically during the 70 years this treaty has been in effect. Latin America has changed  Panama has changed. And the terms of our relationship should reflect those changes in a reasonable way.""And he came to this conclusion:""It is time for both parties to take a fresh look at this problem and to develop a new relationship between us — one that will guarantee continued effective operationof the Canal while meeting Panama's legitimate aspirations.""69.	Authorized representatives of the United States have repeated their readiness to abrogate the unjust Isthmian Canal Convention of 1903  a vestige of the ""big-stick"" policy and of the peak period of colonialism  an anachronism that has no justification in these days when we affirm the self-determination of peoples and the sovereign equality of the nations that proclaim the Charter of the United Nations as their international constitution.70.	In the time that has elapsed since the Council met in my country  the United States and Panama have come to an agreement on the methodology of the negotiations and  I repeat  have reaffirmed the commitment to abrogate the existing Treaty and to draft a completely new one that will be just and fair and designed to eliminate the causes of frictions that have thus far seriously upset our friendly relations. So that negotiations can continue  the United States recently nominated the well-known diplomat  Mr. Ellsworth Bunker  to head the United States negotiating team. We trust that Mr. Bunker will go to Panama very soon and that the negotiations will progress along the right lines — that is  that they will fully satisfy the legitimate aspirations of my country which  I am sure  are shared and understood by an overwhelming number of the States Members of this world Organization.71.	A few days ago  Secretary of State Kissinger  from this very rostrum  repeated that justice cannot be confined to the frontiers of a single nation. We want that justice to shine on Panama too. We want it to illuminate the oppressed peoples of the world as well. The readiness of the United States to abrogate the 1903 Convention is a step that we consider to be a positive one  but the gesture must go beyond the mere spoken word; it must be embodied in tangible facts that will encourage the prevalence of justice that we  a peace-loving people  desire.72.	My Government considers it an unchallengeable truth that the geographical position of the Isthmus of Panama constitutes the main natural resource of the national Panamanian State  and that the inter-oceanic Canal is one way of exploiting such a resource. Logically  the Republic of Panama has sovereign rights over the territory and full jurisdiction over the inter-oceanic waterway and its coastal region. At the same time we are primarily interested in its continued secure and effective functioning.73.	It seems obvious to us that  within a natural and legitimate relationship between our countries  the jurisdictional exercise claimed by the Republic of Panama as an expression of its own territorial sovereignty also contains within it the maximum guarantees that the international waterway will continue to serve the needs of trade and international transit and the maintenance of international peace and security.74.	As Panama has found sympathy  warmth and support in this hall for our just cause  so too my country is at one with all those who nobly and justly are struggling  in Latin America  in Africa and in Asia. In other words  Panama is true to the struggle against colonialism  neo-colonialism  imperialism and racial discrimination. Panama welcomes the decision of the liberation movement of Guinea-Bissau to declare that territory an independent State.75.	It is for that reason  too  that Panama maintains its adherence to the principle of a 200-mile width of the territorial sea and has made it part of its legislation. We have therefore joined all the countries in general  and particularly those of Latin America  that proclaim and defend that self-same principle. We consider it both necessary and urgent that an international agreement  widely accepted  should be drawn up in which would be set forth the legitimate aspirations of those coastal States for which the sea  the sea-bed and the subsoil thereof  including the continental shelf  straits and marine channels of communication  as well as the air space over those areas  are in fact important natural resources and  as in our case  their main natural resource. The location of the Panama Canal as a means of inter-oceanic navigation in our own territory and the fact that up to this moment  because of a profoundly unequal relationship  another nation has derived the benefit of the main natural marine resource of Panama  force us to attach capital importance to the question of international waterways and straits. We must press for respect for the legitimate interests of the coastal State without jeopardizing the need for world navigation and trade.76.	We note that there are many different situations and positions with respect to this problem and we hope that a positive result will be achieved by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  to be held next year.77.	The speedy progress of marine technology  the profound change in the concepts and the means of territorial defence  the accepted denuclearization of Latin America and the increasing need of the coastal peoples to exploit the sea for their own benefit and to utilize the vast resources of the oceans  as well as the inter-oceanic marine means of communication  all create new legal  political  economic and environmental problems. But  at the same time  the increasingly acute awareness of these problems by nations of the third world  whose coasts make up almost the total  or at least the majority  of the active coasts of the planet  make it inevitable that flexible agreements will be achieved with due regard for the diversity of existing situations  so that most of the aspirations of each coastal State will be met regarding its own coasts and straits  without curtailing the rights of other  land-locked countries.78.	As each developing country tackles the essential task of exploiting the resources of its geography for the benefit of its inhabitants  it is faced with a pattern of foreign economic domination which  sometimes subtly and sometimes with crude violence  stifles all efforts of true human liberation and creates and keeps alive certain sources of tension.79.	We whole-heartedly support the idea expressed in paragraph 19 of the Political Declaration adopted by the Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries that ""international security cannot be achieved if it does not include an economic dimension which guarantees to all countries the right to implement their development programmes  free from economic aggression and any other form of pressure"" [see A/9330 and Corr.l].80.	In this statement I have referred to matters that are of vital importance to the Republic of Panama. But this in no way signifies that my country lacks interest in and devotion to the other work of the United Nations regarding the many items on the agenda of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly.81.	Our mission to serve the cause of international peace and security has been proved by Panama both in the Security Council during our term of office and in the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism that we had the honour of presiding over in July and August of this year. Furthermore  our historic background stands us in good stead in the International Court of Justice  in the Economic and Social Council  in the International Law Commission and in the Commission on Human Rights  as it did in the many steps we took in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Nations  and in dealing with the question of the definition of aggression  the prohibition of genocide as a crime against humanity  decolonization and the eradication of discrimination and racial discrimination in the world.82.	The contributions we have made in this field are based on our unshakeable faith in the ideals which underlie the very existence of the United Nations and which are expressed in the many resolutions of the General Assembly on the principles of international law governing friendly relations and co-operation among States.83.	I believe that the statements that are made in good faith in the general debate of the General Assembly  in order to enhance the universalist mission of the United Nations in bringing together the great and small nations  must be brought to bear when we consider the report that the Secretary-General has submitted on the matter.84.	I think that the best tribute to and the most significant statement of support for the United Nations would be the full implementation of resolution 2925 (XXVII) in order to strengthen the role of the United Nations and to ensure that it will contribute more widely to the solution of international problems and increase the efficiency of the decisions and effectiveness of resolutions adopted by its constitutional organs."
"90",5510,"PER",28,1973,"﻿78.	 Mr. President  on behalf of the Government and the people of Peru  may I express my cordial congratulations to you on the fitting choice this great Assembly has made in electing you to preside over its twenty-eighth session. This election is a well-earned recognition of your outstanding qualifications as a diplomat and your brilliant career as a jurist and an internationalist. For Ecuador  a country with which we are very closely linked by fraternal ties of friendship  it is a just tribute with which all Latin America can identify. We are sure that with your abilities you will preside over this session of the Assembly with the necessary skill  capacity and firmness and that this will be a further success in your triumphant diplomatic career.79.	May I also express my friendly greetings to Mr. Stanistaw Trepczyriski  whose efficient handling of the last session confirmed the qualities that we all recognized in him and whom my Government had the pleasure of receiving in Peru.80.	I should also like to offer my sincere appreciation to our illustrious Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his effective and devoted efforts to bring about a full application of the principles and tenets of the Charter to the relations among our countries.81.	1 should also like to express our greetings to the new States Members of the United Nations — the Federal Republic of Germany  the German Democratic Republic and the Bahamas. The participation of these new Members will certainly be a valuable contribution to our endeavours to achieve fulfilment of the purposes and principles of the Charter and a manifest expression of the universality of the Organization.82.	The process of relaxation of tension encouraged by the great Powers has proceeded apace  reducing the risk of a nuclear confrontation. There are signs of improvement in the world situation. The Viet-Nam agreements  the International Conference on Viet Nam  held in Paris  the initial approaches between the two Koreas concerning reunification  the agreements between India  Pakistan and Bangladesh  the convening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the admission to membership in the United Nations of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic are so many proofs.83.	The East-West rapprochement taking place at present stands as a solution to the problems inherited from the Second World War  although basically limited to the developed areas of the world and the result of strategies of nuclear deterrence between the two greatest rival Powers.84.	However  the security and peace yearned for by two thirds of mankind — that is  the countries of the third world — is not included in the blueprint for detente  for aggression and intervention are still sources of permanent danger that thwart the liberation of peoples struggling for their freedom.85.	The Paris agreements are not being fully complied with in the countries of the Indo-Chinese peninsula  for foreign interference still continues and self-determination of the peoples is ignored. There is no reason to be encouraged about a solution to the Middle East question. The impasse persists without withdrawal from the occupied territories  respect for the existence and sovereignty of all the States of the region or recognition of the rights of the Palestine people. In sum  Security Council resolution 242 (1967) is not being carried out  nor is there determined support for the important efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.86.	The rivalry among the great Powers in the Mediterranean continues  and this aggravates the already existing situation in the Middle East. Tensions flowing from power politics create insecurity in the Persian Gulf.87.	Tension in the Caribbean countries continues; the persistence in keeping Cuba semi-isolated shows that. In the same region an anachronistic neo-colonial mentality stands in the way of the effective exercise by Panama of sovereignty and jurisdiction over the entirety of its territory.88.	In Africa  cruel and retrograde colonial wars and repressive policies of racial discrimination and apartheid continue to cause suffering to the peoples of Guinea-Bissau  Mozambique  Angola  Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa.89.	In the South Pacific  the pronouncements of international public opinion and justice are overlooked and atmospheric thermonuclear tests continue.90.	One of the principal tasks of the Organization should be to strive to extend the present detente to all regions of the world  thus eliminating the sources of stress that I have listed. Regions like the Mediterranean  the Caribbean  the South Pacific and the Persian Gulf must be constantly kept under surveillance by the United Nations so as to ensure in them respect for national independence  the renunciation of the use of force  the dismantling of military bases  the prohibition of nuclear tests and the development of peaceful co-operation in general. It will thus be possible to establish international security that will encompass all areas of the world and be equally applicable to all countries  both of the prosperous zones and of the third world.91.	The impoverishment of the populations of the regions outside the main centres of world power is increasing at an accelerating rate  and with it there emerge new forms of domination and dependency in economic  political and technological fields.92.	But within this general scene the absence of a nuclear conflict between the great Powers does not spell security for the third world. In the underdeveloped areas uncertainty and social unrest are rife  appearing in new shapes and forms. Security for the third world lies in an over-all and self- sustaining development  the basic liberating instrument for peace. It is for that reason that both here and elsewhere we have stressed the concept that security must be completed in a new and significant dimension that will define the reality of the developing countries. I refer to what I have already mentioned  that is  that in our revolutionary experience security and development have been shown to be aspects of the same reality  and for that reason security cannot be described only as the absence of warlike conflict.93.	By the same token  it is appropriate to recall thai of the 55 conflicts that have broken out since the founding of the United Nations and of the 255 subversive movements that have shaken world peace  95 per cent have had their roots in the third world  as the lamentable result of the imperialist policies and neo-colonial pressures on our countries. For this reason  any peace that overlooks that majority of mankind  any peace that ignores the liberation of the people of the third world  any peace that is merely the absence of hostilities among the great Powers is a precarious  unreal  unjust peace. It does not spell security or stability for us  much less justice for our development. It is peace in opulence — which is not that of the third world.94.	Security among the States Members of the United Nations must also include the concept of an economic security that will guarantee the right of the majority of mankind to a comprehensive development and prevent threats of economic coercion or pressures of any sort.95.	Collective economic security in international relations would imply the renunciation of the use of economic force and unilateral power politics and assure respect for the overall development of States. Collective economic security would also imply a commitment to take ""collective action"" to repel measures of economic force tending to oppress the sovereignty of States  and also united action to help meet emergency situations that cannot be resolved by the internal effort of a developing country  in order to provide the necessary assistance.96.	The Security Council meeting in Panama in March this year was proof of a qualitative change of approach regarding the use of force in international relations. The Security Council considered that in Latin America there did exist threats to international peace and security  not only due to armed aggression but also to structural situations of dependency  domination and colonialism. Resolution 330 (1973)  adopted by the Council at that meeting  is a significant step in the repudiation of the use of force.97.	We believe that resolution is a great contribution by the developing countries to the strengthening of the United Nations as a mechanism for safeguarding the development of the countries of the third world. Without doubt it will also serve as the foundation for the system of collective economic security under study that must urgently be set up  and for this reason it is imperative to accelerate the studies being done by the United Nations.98.	Aware of the changes taking place in the world today and of the situations arising from the constant emergence of new States  Peru joins those who contend that the Security Council  as constituted at present  is not representative of the aspirations of peoples. The present composition of the Security Council  in which a small minority of Powers wields the veto  is a situation that must be altered  since within the organ itself it allows the play of power politics by the great Powers.99.	The right of veto was intended to meet a political reality arising from the Second World War. For this reason we should weigh the need to devise a formula to avoid the paralysis of the Council in the exercise of its high functions due to an abuse of powers which in themselves violate the political and juridical equality of States and gainsay the true democratization of international relations. A first step might be to apply the provisions of the Charter itself which provide that the States parties to a dispute shall not vote. Likewise  as some have stated  the General. Assembly should be empowered to reject a veto cast by a single State against the votes of all the other members of the Security Council  who do in fact represent the international community.100.	Peru considers that a further indispensable step for strengthening international peace and security is the convening by the United Nations of a world disarmament conference with the participation of all States.101.	The objective of such a conference would be first to achieve a qualitative disarmament  that is  the suspension of all nuclear tests in all environments to forestall any improvement in such weapons. Secondly  the conference would go on to quantitative disarmament through the elimination of existing nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction.102.	Despite the pronouncements of the General Assembly  of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment   of the International Court of Justice and of the coastal States of the South Pacific  atmospheric tests on the atoll of Mururoa continue.103.	The Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces of Peru is aware of its moral authority to oppose such tests and considers that the United Nations should take up the request of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held this month at Algiers  that an end be put to the atmospheric nuclear tests in the South Pacific. 104.	We also consider it imperative that the United Nations strengthen the effectiveness of the Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation  so that it may be able to complete its work with the assistance of  and benefiting from the experience of  all peace-loving countries and provide information  as objective as possible  requested by the countries affected by nuclear explosions. The Committee can no longer continue to depend on information supplied by nuclear States  when it is very often unable to detect the explosions and the magnitude of the radiation.105.	True to the principles and purposes of the Charter  and in keeping with the evolution of the international situation  Peru considers it its duty to reinforce and universalize peace and security through effective and realistic inter-American co-operation reflecting the process of detente among the great Powers.106.	In the American region  the Organization of American States [OAS] has supplied the purely formal framework for political  ideological  economic and cultural institutions of intracontinental co-operation and solidarity. Although its charter  prescribes the principles and norms for international conduct ifi the hemisphere  we cannot overlook the fact that behind these stand countries possessing differing economic and social structures and at different stages of development. On the one hand  there is a world super-Power with its opulent and expanding market economy  and on the other  developing countries with disjointed  economically dependent societies.107.	From the very outset the basic standards of inter- American relations were warped because of the hegemony of the United States over the countries of Latin America. The creation of inter-American organs and institutions  such as the Interamerican Development Bank  though they are apparently multilateral  in no way changed this structural flaw in our relations. Thus  a lopsided and imperfect system has grown up based on domestic and foreign domination and within the context of the defence of spheres of influence of the cold war.108.	Recent developments in Latin America attest to the emergence of growing community awareness  the result of common and parallel histories  of shared conditioning from the outside and a common destiny which we now begin to see clearly. The restructuring of the inter-American system now taking place is a clear proof of the degree of awareness and compromise that our countries have achieved along these lines. It also anticipates the new profile we seek for our continent. The Revolutionary Government of Peru  together with other nations  called for the convening of a special commission for the restructuring of the inter- American system; that was an act which we believe clearly shows our dedication to a true America and for the effective application of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations in our region.109.	The work being done by that special commission in Lima and Washington should lead to the outlining of a restructuring that we trust will permit a true adaptation to the new inter-American reality. It could then become a regional system that would effectively serve the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.110.	In one word  we want an end in Latin America to all forms of imperialism  colonialism and neo-colonialism. We want a Latin America united on the strength of a genuine development with justice for its peoples  and  finally  the promotion of Latin America to the forefront of the international dialogue as full-fledged spokesmen and free actors in our own destiny.111.	The contribution of the third world to world peace is an objective reality primarily confirmed throught the non- aligned movement. The evolution of international relations has only gone to prove the certainty and permanence of the objectives of the policy of non-alignment.112.	The growth of the progressive forces of peace  independence and the progress of mankind is proved by the fact that more than half of the States members of the international community were represented at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  held at Algiers. Once again non- alignment showed its dynamism and pluralist vitality with the presence of Latin American countries in an evolving world  thus reaffirming their stand against all types of imperialism  colonialism  and neo-colonialism.113.	For the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces of Peru  its foreign policy of non-alignment is a correlative of the profound commitment of the Peruvian revolution to insuring the participation of our people in both the process and the benefits of development through a society in keeping with our national realities. Thus  we have devised a coherent ideo-politica! formulation that impresses its independent and autonomous personality on our revolution. Tlie goal of our revolution is to transform the economic  social and political system of our country. To do so our revolution draws its inspiration from the richest currents of humanism and socialism  which by nature are imbued with the concept of liberty and therefore imply a clear stand on dogmatism and totalitarianism. In practical terms our objective is to establish in Peru a pluralistic economy with full participation for all.114.	I should like to recall a paragraph from the message by the President of Peru  General Juan Velasco Alvarado  on the one hundred fifty-second anniversary of national independence:""The achievement of the great ideal of full participation  the very essence of the revolutionary humanism which we advocate  presupposes the gradual but definitive abandonment of manipulative behaviour and intermediary machinery that in the past deprived our citizens of the right to share in and decide upon all aspects of social life. It also calls for the equally gradual but also definitive break with paternalistic and authoritarian conduct that illegally presupposes a position of inferiority for those who are humble and poor. All this is in order to safeguard and defend the basic concept of dignity and the pre-eminence of man as a specific social being and as the forger of history and life.""115.	We are witnessing a qualitative shift in history; the contradictions of the opulent societies of the industrialized States have become obvious. The enormous concentration of capital  the disorderly use of technology  the greed for power and endless wealth are all producing dire situations which are manifested in the energy crisis  raw materials and the dehumanizing conditions of life. At the same time we are witnessing a growing inflation in the developed economies.116.	The countries of the third world are confronting immensely important political possibilities. It is within our grasp to achieve our total liberation and it is up to our political will to turn weakness into strength with our unity. Replacement of the strategy of claims by one of uniting for negotiation is a legitimate way to defend our national resources.117.	The non-aligned nations  and Peru among them  consider recovery and full exercise of permanent sovereignty over natural resources and control of the basic economic activities of those resources to be some of the immediate steps to be taken. The right of the developing nations to nationalize their natural wealth and to adapt the payment of compensation for them to their own domestic systems has been supported by the Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries meeting in Algiers.118.	Furthermore  exploitation and direct merchandising  as well as support for and creation of associations of raw material-producing countries  are very effective meats for strengthening our negotiating power and obtaining mutually advantageous international trade both for the producers and for the consumers. That will also strengthen our development. In this respect  the non-aligned nations have agreed to the convening in the near future of a conference of developing nations to co-ordinate a global strategy on raw materials in the light of the critical situation that could activate irrational exploitation of our resources and unjust price policies.119.	Two agreements which are examples of the increasing solidarity among the non-aligned nations and which allow of a certain optimism regarding the future of our countries are to favour the creation of a fund for development and solidarity among the non-aligned nations  to promote financial and technical co-operation among them; and the establishment of a system of consultations and emergency measures within the group for mutual assistance in cases of aggression in economic relations  such as pressures  coercion  economic blockade  the freezing of credit and any direct or indirect measures aimed at limiting the sovereignty of States and curtailing the right of all countries to their own autonomous development.120.	The controversy over the law of the sea has finally been understood as one of the basic chapters of the struggle against underdevelopment and against the hegemony of certain Powers that would confine the sovereignty and jurisdiction of other States to narrow limits while remaining free themselves to exploit the natural resources of distant seas.121.	The Algiers Conference saw more than 60 Heads of State or Government support the 200-mile limit without prejudice to the freedom of navigation or to the regime of the continental shelf. They also supported the notion of regional solutions  the elimination of threats to the security and sovereignty of States and the establishment of an international authority empowered to undertake the exploitation of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction as the common heritage of mankind.122.	For 26 years Peru has defended its maritime sovereignty and jurisdiction over the 200-mile limit  and therefore we are gratified by this support  which reaffirms the reasons and validity of a cause once deemed unrealistic and rash  and allows us to foresee  as set forth at Algiers  ""the establishment of a new regime governing ocean space which is based on the principles of justice  security  peaceful coexistence  development and well-being for all peoples.""1""123.	We trust that this new order will be established and that there will be an end to the obstinacy and shortsightedness of those who would extend to the sea the very imperialism we are fighting. Be that as it may  Peru will maintain its resolve to preserve its maritime sovereignty and jurisdiction with the unshakable and unyielding will of one who knows that he defends his own independence and destiny as a nation.124.	Co-ordination  co-operation and solidarity among the developing countries are characteristics of the present international situation  but together with this laudable effort on the part of the countries of the third world external conditions must also be created propitious to self-sustaining and independent development.125.	I cannot fail to mention the concern of the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces of Peru over the steadily deteriorating economic conditions of the developing countries caused by policies foreign to their own efforts. Interference in the sovereignty of States multiplies;I neo-colonialism in the developing countries and the unfettered activities of transnational corporations continue; trade and monetary agreements among the developed countries tend to diminish the participation of the third world in world trade and to flout the principles of international cooperation.126.	It therefore becomes imperative for the developed countries to realize that international co-operation for development is one of the basic components of a permanent  universal peace that will permit full security for all States.127.	According to United Nations surveys  everything seems to indie ite that by 1975 — that is  just half-way through the Second Development Decade — the trade and financial deficit of all the developing countries will amount to at least $17 billion. Half this amount  or perhaps more  will be to cover the flow of capital to pay for utilities from foreign private investment and invisible services and the other half to cover the trade deficit caused by the deterioration in terms of trade. We must therefore abandon our role as exporters of capital and importers of inflation.128.	This circle of domination that characterizes the structure of the economic relations between the third world and the industrialized countries makes it impossible to fulfil the modest objectives of the International Development Strategy. The countries of the third world  with 70 per cent of the world population  subsist on a meagre 30 per cent of world income  and by the end of this decade the average per capita income will be $3 600 for the developed countries and a paltry $265 for the developing countries. Surely we must all agree that the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade is failing thus far. International action is required  as called for by the Heads of State or Government of Non-AHgned Countries in the Action Programme for Economic Cooperation adopted in Algiers in order to convene ""a special session of the General Assembly at a high political level devoted exclusively to the problems of development "" including the achievement of the objectives of the International Development Strategy and the revitalization of the organizations of the United Nations system devoted to international co-operation.129.	Among the efforts of the developing countries to make international co-operation more dynamic  Peru supports the holding of the Second General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization in 1975  and we reiterate our offer of the city of Lima as the venue for the Conference.130.	The present international situation is characterized by the coexistence and convergence of the great Powers and by the multipolarity of the world. But this is the result not only of the bold diplomacy of the powerful nations but of the long historical struggle of new forces and social values emerging in the world of today. These new social forces have challenged the established order and set forth an undeniable need for world coexistence as a basis for ideological pluralism. The development of these progressive forces is manifested mainly in the regions of the third world and is embodied in the unshakable struggle of the peoples of those areas for more just living conditions and for their own autonomous solutions for freeing themselves from domestic and foreign domination. Because of the increase in world poverty and the just struggle against it  the centre of gravity of international relations and conflicts is shifting to the third world  thus giving our people considerable revolutionary weight which is making them new protagonists in contemporary history.131.	The new historic moment in which we find ourselves calls for a new approach on the part of the developed countries  an approach that must understand that the interrelation between development and underdevelopment required co-operation and solidarity.132.	Once again Peru reaffirms its faith in the world Organization as the forum most apt to know the problems affecting international peace  security and co-operation and as the appropriate institutional framework for just solutions to disputes occurring among States."
"91",5557,"PHL",28,1973,"﻿70.	Mr. President  fellow travellers on Spaceship Earth: it is with pleasure that the Philippine delegation offers its warm congratulations to you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Your many years of distinguished participation in the affairs of the United Nations is the best guarantee that you will guide this Assembly successfully. We are certain that under your able leadership our deliberations will proceed expeditiously and productively and that we will maintain the high standard of achievement of your eminent predecessors  the latest of whom was the distinguished Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland  Mr. Stanislaw Trepzynski.71.	A time of change  such as the present  should be a time of opportunity. When human affairs become fluid what has been impossible becomes possible. What could never be attempted can be accomplished. On the other hand  when old moorings are swept away and old approaches and patterns no longer work  a sense of disorientation and anxiety can overcome us. The question is how we meet change. If we utilize change  direct change  steer change into constructive channels  we can transform situations that have been intractable and we can build anew in better  more adequate ways. If we resist change  if we mourn the old ways  if we are unprepared and have no designs for a better future  then the tides of change will be blocked and futility and frustration will be the result.72.	That we are at such a ""fork in history"" is plain to all of us. Every field of human affairs is characterized by rapid and irreversible change. The wise guiding of change is ourmajor responsibility as we near the three-quarter mark of this century.73.	Even forms of government yield to change and adapt to the overriding needs and aspirations of peoples  aspirations whose fulfilment cannot be any longer delayed. Where there is no change  or where efforts are made to set the clock back  disaster is the result. Thus  in the Philippines  as in many other countries  change has become necessary and inevitable in response to the nation's imperative need for a better life.74.	At a time when many old  historically stable  democratic Governments are finding the traditional processes of democracy tarnished-I repeat  tarnished — and their stability uncertain  even more the Governments of newer and poorer nations are discerning  as the Philippines has discerned  that decisive and innovative changes are called for.75.	A year ago  President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines established what was aptly described as a New Society. In essence it was a realistic response to a compelling need for revolutionary change. The old political framework  transplanted from the West  had proved inadequate to satisfy the aspirations of our people for economic and social justice. Structural reforms were needed; indeed  the entire society had to be restructured. The paramount aim was full participation of the people in the responsibilities  as well as the benefits  of national development.76.	President Marcos said on the occasion of the first anniversary of the New Society two weeks ago:""Basically  what we have done was to lay the foundations of national civility that have been torn up by decades of bitter political strife and social anarchy. We have redressed the most urgent popular grievances. We have established a pattern of social  political and economic stability. From this new level of stability we must now launch our nation towards new heights of development.""The results are indeed noteworthy. Due to enhanced international acceptance  arising from greatly improved domestic stability  peace and order  foreign investments in the Philippines increased by 138 per cent-I repeat  138 per cent. The growth of domestic business has kept pace.77.	Even more significant is the change brought about by land reform  the historic cause of social unrest. In recognition of its importance  the first act of President Marcos under the New Society was to declare the entire country a land reform area. In just one year more than 100 000 land transfers have been accomplished  together with essential supporting measures such as the establishment of cooperatives and credit financing  and the development of farm infrastructure facilities. This exceeds the total number of transfers in the quarter century since the Philippines regained its independence.78.	The six-year land reform programme envisions the transfer of more than 1.5 million hectares of farm land to nearly 1 million tenant farmers.79.	Another significant change for the better is the increase of foreign exchange reserves. Starting at a very low point  our foreign exchange reserves rose by over 5 000 per cent-I repeat  5 000 per cent — under the New Society. In 1972  the surplus was near rock bottom at $10 million. During the first eight months of 1973 it went up to $531 million  and in September it rose to $759 million as against $10 million a year ago. There has also been a notable improvement in the balance-of-payments position  which' in the past year showed a surplus of $425 million as against only $6 million the previous year.80.	Tax revenues have increased by more than 65 per cent  reflecting the effectiveness of tax reforms and  more important  enhanced popular support for the New Society. Tourists are coming in ever-greater numbers  and a 30 per cent increase is projected for the coming year.81.	The economic gains under the New Society are matched by advances in the social sectors. Every aspect of national development has received a fresh impetus. The New Society has acted as a catalyst  releasing the creative energies of our people. Dynamic self-help is being maximized.82.	In this great undertaking of transforming a society that had been stunted and malformed by centuries of foreign domination  we have received invaluable assistance from friendly countries and various agencies of the United Nations family. Almost by definition  poor  developing countries  particularly former colonies like the Philippines  cannot attain self-sustaining growth by self-help alone. There are critical gaps in technology  modern equipment and capital funds that can only be filled with external aid.83.	We are particularly grateful to the United Nations Development Programme [UNDP]  now the largest United Nations operational agency for development  for envisaging an increased indicative planning figure allocation in support of our four-year country development programme. The programme is being reviewed in the light of the New Society's development priorities. We intend to maintain close co-operation with UNDP in this exercise.84.	On the social side  the United Nations Children's Fund [UNICEF] continues to give us urgently needed aid  particularly in the vital fields of child health  applied nutrition  and education for under-privileged youth. Important and deeply appreciated technical assistance is being provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization  the International Labour Organisation  the World Health Organization  the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization and other specialized agencies.85.	But the greatest share of credit and responsibility belongs to our own people  who are now energetically working in unison under the inspired leadership of our President. ""The most important gain [of the New Society] "" said President Marcos  ""is the transformation of our people. It is here that our Democratic Revolution [finds] its greatest virtue.""86.	We are responding constructively to the challenge of change. Politically and economically we are striving  with growing success  to put our own house in order. But in our interdependent world there can be no security in isolation.87.	Our foreign policy therefore has also undergone significant change under the New Society. Among these is a new and sustained effort to open the windows towards the socialist and/or communist countries. Last year  the Philippines established diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia and Romania. And in the last two weeks  diplomatic ties were forged between the Philippines and the German Democratic Republic  the Polish People's Republic and the Hungarian People's Republic  respectively. Active negotiations are in progress to normalize relations with other socialist countries.88.	It is also natural that we should be deeply concerned about the situation in our own neighbourhood  in the Asian region to which we belong.89.	With the ending of the war in Viet-Nam  a new situation confronts us in Asia. One super-Power  the United States  is withdrawing its forces from the Asian mainland and generally reducing its military presence in the area. Another super-Power  the Soviet Union  is increasing its political and military presence in the region. Then we have China  historically and actually the most important Asian country. And modern Japan represents an unprecedented  perhaps unique  factor in the sense that it is a great economic power which thus far has renounced the traditional attendant trappings of military power.90.	The crucial question for us in Asia is this  What shape or form will this momentous convergence of events and forces assume? Will the change be constructive? Or will a new struggle for domination turn Asia once again into a battleground of competing great Power ambitions?91.	In Kuala Lumpur on 27 November 1971  the member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] -Indonesia  Malaysia  the Philippines  Singapore and Thailand — have adopted the ASEAN Declaration of South-East Asia as a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality.  This Declaration expresses their desire to see peace and stability prevail in Southeast Asia and indeed in the whole Asian region  through the observance of the principle of non-intervention in their domestic affairs. It' is supplemented by President Marcos's proposal for an Asian forum in which Asian problems could be considered in a spirit of amicable co-operation and Asian disputes settled by peaceful means.92.	Still a cause for serious concern is the continued fighting in Cambodia. Foreign interference is fanning the fires of conflict between the two contending national leaderships in the Khmer Republic. But however plausible the reasons may be  intervention in the internal affairs of a State is inadmissible. We believe therefore that the basic prescription for peace in Cambodia will be to allow the Cambodians to decide their own destiny without active and material assistance from outside. It is up to the Khmer people themselves to determine unmolested the leadership and Government of their choice. If it was possible in Laos to achieve a peace settlement among the contending parties  it is reasonable to expect that a similar accord could be reached in Cambodia. The adjudication of differences within nations and among peoples of the same race  of thesame culture and tradition  if left alone  should be easier to accomplish. Another aspect of the Khmer conflict is the claim put forward that the government in exile had remote control of that territory when it took flight. The United Nations should reject this claim as it is incredible and also fraught with dangerous implications for every Member State.93.	The ASEAN countries were heartened by the Shanghai communiqué of 27 February 1972  in which China and the United States agreed that no single Power should exercise hegemony in Asia. They are encouraged by the professed desire of Japan to play a constructive role in the peaceful development of the Asian region and they hope that the Soviet Union  in developing its policies and its presence in Asia  will take fully into account the Asian peoples' aspiration to peaceful progress.94.	While Asia claims our primary interest  we are no less concerned with the state of the world as a whole. In this larger context  change is also the order of the day. And so it must be with our own world Organization. The United Nations cannot afford to stand still. It must move resolutely toward the future in a sustained effort to bring into being a peaceful and equitable world motivated by justice and humanity. Building the future can be  and should be  a joyful process of co-operative construction. But if change is resisted  if nations are grudging in participating in the communal task  if they refuse to see the handwriting on the wall  then humanity will shed many more bitter and wholly unnecessary tears.95.	Our skills are not so lacking  our understanding is not so meagre  that Spaceship Earth cannot be managed  cannot be piloted successfully toward a better future. No  the ingenuity and imagination of men  the knowledge and wisdom we already have in hand are not so deficient that we can find an excuse in ignorance or a refuge in lack of vision  or in a failure to meet the urgent requirements of our times. The blame  if blame there is to be  must lie in the spirit of separatism and of insularity and in efforts to maintain the status quo rather than in exploring together and planning together for that future toward which we are inevitably travelling and in which we snail find that our common identity is the only workable  the only practical and the only functional reality.96.	There can be no secession from the world. No nation can return to former  less complicated  less interdependent< days. Instead  the implications of our new interdependence have to be spelled out and must  for survival's sake  be implemented without delay.97.	In many ways our world Organization has demonstrated remarkable adaptability  innovation and originality.In the passage of time  it has generated ""global departments"" for many of humanity's most urgent needs: among others  in the fields of health  food  education  economic assistance  atomic energy and  even more recently  in environment  population and soon  we hope  a regime for the sea-bed and ocean space. It can be said without exaggeration that these ""departments of planetary management"" are fundamentally sound  if inadequately supported. Considering the restrictions on their activities imposed by limited resources  they have to their credit many significant achievements.98.	Clearly  however  the United Nations is not yet receiving the support or the recognition of its centrality in the affairs of all its Members which is required for successful  joint  co-operative approaches to man's most pressing problems — problems which cannot be met and mastered except at the global level. The near-universality of the Organization  and the new steps achieved at the beginning of this session  suggest a growing realization of the essential and fundamental role the Organization will be required to play in the future.99.	I should like  at this time  in my turn to offer my congratulations and the warm welcome of my country to the three new Members of our Organization: the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. We look forward to the important contribution which we are sure they will make to the work of the United Nations. The roster is now nearly complete  and we look forward to the membership of the remaining divided countries at the earliest possible time.100.	We have already heard in this general debate several references to the encumbrances of an Organization which has not changed as rapidly as it should  which continues to be handicapped in its work by improvisation  ad hoc inventions and last-minute efforts to head off major disasters  a tactic which is foredoomed to failure. It is perfectly true that improving the structure and functioning of our Organization will not mean that it will automatically be used more effectively by its Members. At the same time  however  every improvement we make will remove one more excuse for the non-use of the United Nations.101.	Improvements in our pre-atomic-age Charter have been long  almost disastrously  delayed. The structure of the Security Council no longer accords with reality. It should be enlarged and made more truly representative. The human rights functions of the Organization seriously need rationalization and centralization. There is no standing machinery for conciliation in political disputes. The peacekeeping machinery is still ad hoc in character. We have heard earlier that it may now be possible to move ahead  finally  in the institutionalization of the peace-keeping function which is vital and indispensable to world peace. Our earnest hope is that renewed efforts will bear fruit in the near future.102.	It is plainly embarrassing to old and new Members alike that the odious phrase ""enemy States"" remains in our Charter. We must consider it a disgrace that we were unable to remove this anachronism before the admission of new Members this year.103.	It is high time indeed for deliberations on the ways to adapt our Organization more effectively to the increasingly heavy demands that will be  and because of the inevitability of future history must be  placed on the United Nations. Our distinguished and able Secretary- General  Mr. Waldheim  has raised for all of us the fundamental question in very clear terms in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization:""Do the majority of Member States really want an Organization which is more than a conference machineryand a forum for the pursuit of national policies? Do they really want an Organization which can play a useful and active role in focusing international efforts on the solution of the most difficult and controversial problems .. .? "" [A/9001/Add.1  p. 8]Those are the questions posed to us by the Secretary- General.104.	In my view  the answer to these questions is at the present time neither yes nor no. The Members are ambivalent about the United Nations. They begin to see the absolute and inescapable necessity for the Organization to perform functions global in scope that no States nor group of States can perform by themselves. At the same time  implied in implementing vital tasks for the world community is a major change  if one might say so  in gravity  a shift in focus from go-it-alone national attitudes and mechanisms to machinery for global co-operation  consensus and the common pursuit of collective solutions.105.	But we cannot expect to enjoy the fruits of collective action on common problems without prior commitment to a community approach. International peace and security  collective economic security  disarmament and universal human rights will always elude us unless the prerequisite commitments to common processes are firmly and finally made.106.	It is with those considerations in mind that the Government of the Philippines has resolutely stood for the improvement of our Organization. I wish to make it absolutely clear that we have taken this approach for no ulterior motives. We have none. We have not undertaken it from ambition for a special place in the Organization. We have none. We have not undertaken it as the agent for any super-Power or for any nation other than ourselves. Our concern is simply to help bring our Organization up to the highest peak of efficiency and effectiveness achievable at this critical time. We are well aware  like the majority of Members  that this is not the case today. As  during the coming year  we prepare for a sober consideration of the views and suggestions of Members for the improvement of the world Organization  we anticipate that all Members will be giving this important endeavour the serious reflection it deserves and requires. We look forward to co-operating again with like-minded colleagues from many countries as we recommence the work we began on the twenty-fifth anniversary of our Organization.107.	This  too  is an anniversary year — the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  one of the noblest  most far-reaching texts of man  and a testimonial to the essential soundness of mankind's vision and aspiration. The acceptance of a guide of planetary norms for the treatment of human beings is wholly without precedent. Its adoption marked a new ""coming of age"" of the human race. For the first time  man  the noblest of species  was called upon to respond and to respect the integrity of all of its own kind.108.	The intervening years have seen stumbling progress  halting progress  but real and substantial progress nevertheless. Yet the right to self-determination  the only basic human right enshrined in both of the International Covenants on human rights [see resolution 2200 A (XXI)]  continues to be defiantly denied to remaining colonies  particularly in Africa. And above all evils  the evil of apartheid and other forms of racial discrimination still divides us  still pits man against man  still inflicts wounds on the body of mankind.109.	We are embarking on a new effort to eradicate this most ancient evil. We all have our responsibilities in this regard. But some Members in a position to effect change have a particular and unique responsibility and  if I might say so  the opportunity to ring down the curtain on this aspect of man's inhumanity to man. Does the exercise of this opportunity cost something in terms of short-term strained relations or immediate benefit? Then we must ask  What is that cost  compared to the freeing of whole enclaves of humanity into their proper estate  and to the gratitude which will be universally felt?110.	We welcome the growing spirit of detente-as long as it bears fruits to be shared by all the world. It should  for instance  extend to the Middle East and inspire a new and determined effort to resolve that crisis on the basis of Security Council resolution 242(1967). And detente should be merely the prelude to renewed and intensified efforts within the larger framework of our Organization to find concord and to tackle the blights of our planet with resources released from strife. A detente that stops short will be a source of disappointment  and can even become a source of global danger. For detente is only the beginning of opportunity-opportunity to approach the neglected agenda of man's most urgent needs. The United Nations has recently been the birthplace of important new concepts of. the greatest .potential importance for peace and justice. In connexion with the Third United' Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  the concept of the common heritage of mankind was born. In connexion with the material disparities which are inflicting untold suffering on the ""southern world""  the concept of ""collective economic security"" is now under consideration and elaboration  together with the Mexican proposal for a charter of economic rights and  duties of States  which may ultimately become one of the means for the emancipation of man from want and hunger. Only when that comes to pass will the full dimensions of human creative energies become manifest.111.	In any case  we must begin immediately to plan together and to plan carefully for the equitable access of all peoples to the finite resources and benefits of our small   beautiful and irreplaceable planet. To protect short-term gains against the requirements of long-term global planning is to prepare the world for strife and the human race for suicide. While we have time  there is  as we have often been reminded  no time to spare. If we cannot plan for our collective future in the United Nations  then where shall we confront the task? Progress thus far has given only mild reason for hope and  in some areas  it has been plainly disappointing. For instance  which of the resolutions adopted at the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development have been honoured and implemented? Which? To what extent are the goals of the Second United Nations Development Decade to be achieved? The record so far has not been encouraging  and it sharply challenges complacency. History will judge harshly those that have the power  and thus the opportunity and responsibility to act  and yet have so far neglected to do so.112.	The importance of the Conference on the Law of the Sea is well understood by us all. In particular  the Conference will provide for archipelagic countries like my own the possibility of a much more adequate recognition of our special problems  which have been ignored in the past. The Philippines  in common with other archipelagic States  has a profound interest in this question  and we intend to take an active part in its detailed consideration by the appropriate Committee of the Assembly.113.	All States stand to benefit from the rationalization of the law of the sea. And  as cannot be said too often  the placing of the bulk of the resources of the sea under the auspices of a new United Nations regime will guarantee new economic benefits  equitably shared  and the preservation and protection of the ""common heritage of mankind"". To achieve that goal will require a high degree of restraint and a sense of community born of a truly enlightened self-interest. To fail to exercise this attitude at the forthcoming Conference would be to forfeit one of the major opportunities now open to the family of nations. The measure of joint planning and consensus for mutual benefit at the Conference will be the measure of maturity in the world community.114.	Not only will the Conference on the Law of the Sea be held next year  but  as we are also aware  the World Population Conference will convene during a year dedicated to a re-evaluation of the carrying capacity of the planet and of the responsibilities of each nation with regard to population questions  a field in which the United Nations Fund for Population Activities has been rendering exceptionally efficient and commendable service. Each of these major issues which has come before this Organization — as  last year  the vital question of preserving and enchancing the human environment was before us-serves to demonstrate the overriding need for effective world approaches and for effective world institutions to implement them. Thus  each passing year underlines the importance of our work and can serve to renew our determination to succeed in our endeavours.115.	In the light of those considerations  it is to be regretted that this year has not seen more substantial progress in halting and reversing the arms race  which  like a cancerous growth on the body of humanity  parasitically drains off so much of the world's material and scientific wealth not only into non-productive but into monstrously threatening channels. It is a matter of particular regret to the nations of the Pacific basin that the appeals of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly with regard to the end of all nuclear testing have gone unheeded. While we welcome whatever forward motion has been registered in the existing forums  the results are disappointingly meagre and slow  leaving humanity still in jeopardy and with an uncertain future. The acceleration of progress towards a ban on all nuclear tests should be the overriding consideration — not whether one or another forum at any particular time should be given eminence.116.	We fully realize that no single meeting or series of meetings  no single forum or series of forums will provideinstant general disarmament. Yet we believe that each avenue which offers some promise of greater understanding and progress should be most seriously considered. We would point out that progress made during the coming year will assist greatly in ensuring a productive review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)].117.	General and complete disarmament  in the long run  depends  as it always has  upon the simultaneous creation of a viable and just world order able to assume and discharge the responsibilities of peace-making and peacekeeping and the safeguarding of equity and justice that no nation or group of nations can ever again provide for themselves. It is thus urgent that we begin ""thinking in parallel"" — in designing provision for the parallel augmentation of our international institutions for global peace and security at the same time that we redouble our efforts to curtail and finally to end the nuclear arms race. Nor must the conventional arms races in areas of tension — which until now have been all too often overlooked-be neglected. Not only do they take on ruinous economic dimensions and threaten military disaster for the States concerned  but they can also serve as the fuses for general conflict. We would hope that the United Nations may be encouraged to assume a part of the task once performed by the League of Nations in the publication of available data on arms budgets and arms transfers. Such publication would be wholly without prejudice to the parties concerned  but would provide the world community with instructive information and perhaps. guide-lines as a basis for action in dealing with this extremely important problem.118.	In a related field  my Government takes a profound interest in the forthcoming conference on human rights in armed conflict   called at the suggestion of the International Committee of the Red Cross. We particularly applaud the efforts of those whose far-sighted and humanitarian endeavours are directed to limitations and restrictions on particularly indiscriminate or cruel weapons  and we remain hopeful of progress in this area.119.	Each year of the following decade  like the years of the past decade  is sure to be described as ""unprecedented""; and each time the statement is made it will be absolutely correct. Our annual meeting provides the opportunity for a trip to the mountain-top to broaden our perspective  renew our vision and chart a course of constructive change for the period ahead. At times  all that is required is course correction; at other times  major shifts in orientation and commitment are inescapable. No less than the best we have to offer will suffice to see us through the fateful changes of the period immediately ahead.120.	Its major characteristics will relate to the implementation of interdependence in new institutions and in adaptation of the best of the old; they will relate to the central fact of irreversible human convergence and to the need for securing the richness of human diversity as the accompaniment of human unity. It has been well said that we have no alternative but to enact our age-old ideals-for purely technical reasons. The planet cannot be steered savefrom the cockpit of Spaceship Earth on which  for better or for worse  we are all fellow travellers. The requirements of its passengers cannot be analysed or quantified adequately except from the central clearing-house. What our individual nations can perform adequately for their peoples can  should and will remain with them; what they cannot  must be pooled for accommodation and the hammering out of collective decisions. The road of conscious comity leads to a peaceful and harmonious future; the alternate road of separatism and self-defeating selfishness leads to disaster.121.	Our United Nations gains daily in importance in the discharge of our common task. May it gain daily also in the commitment of its Members."
"92",5663,"POL",28,1973,"﻿44.	During last year's general debate in this Assembly  a vast majority of Member States  including the Polish People's Republic  expressed their satisfaction with the improvement in the international situation  hoping for further and ever more tangible progress in the policy of peace and detente.45.	Yet another year has gone by. In the history of world progress it will go down as an important one. The world has speeded up its advance towards peace. The principles of peaceful coexistence of States having different systems are becoming an ever more universal basis for international relations.46.	""For many years "" said the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party  Edward Gierek  ""the Socialist States  including Poland  have beer< struggling for the victory of the idea of peaceful coexistence in inter-State relations. This idea is now becoming victorious.""47.	A development like this is consonant with the will of the peoples we represent  and with their aspirations to live in peace and security and to enjoy freedom and independence; it is consonant with their desires to enjoy an ever better material and cultural life-which entails progressive social transformations.48.	Positive changes in international relations and better prospects for the maintenance of world peace are a contribution of merit made by those States Members <?f the United Nations which  in their foreign policies  have for long consistently and with unfailing dedication advanced ""and worked for the consolidation of peace and international security  in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of this Organization. The Soviet Union  Poland and other States of the socialist community  belong among them.49.	The principle objective of the foreign policy of the socialist States  as was again pointed out by the decisions of the meeting of the leaders of the States of the socialist community in the Crimea on 30 and 31 July 1973  has been to ensure a just and lasting peace.50.	The Polish People's Republic is contributing to the policy of peace and detente  to the elimination of seedbeds of tension and to the promotion of relations of equality among all States  whatever their systems and standards of economic development. Our constant objective is to increase the contribution to this lofty cause. Thus motivated  we are participating in the work of the twenty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly.51.	The Polish delegation wishes to express its satisfaction that the desire to maintain peace is becoming the guiding idea of the foreign policies of a growing number of Member States. Thus the United Nations may become an ever more effective instrument for the maintenance of peace and the strengthening of international security.52.	Among important developments of the past 12 months the ending of war in Viet-Nam comes to the fore. This has been a great success of peace. The conclusion of the Paris agreements represented a milestone in the elimination of international conflicts and opened up possibilities for a political settlement of all the problems of Indo-China. From this rostrum Poland wishes the Viet-Namese people all success in their speedy recovery from the war-inflicted wounds. The Paris agreements should be fully implemented. As a member of the International Commission of Controland Supervision  Poland  within the scope of its possibilities  will continue contributing to the attainment of this goal.53.	I wish to express satisfaction with the progress in the normalization of the situation on the Indian subcontinent. The New Delhi agreement of 28 August last between India and Pakistan is an important step towards full normalization  peace and good-neighbourly co-operation between the States of the subcontinent. This is indeed a matter of satisfaction to us  as Poland is linked by friendly relations with India  Bangladesh and Pakistan. The Polish delegation hopes that the membership of the United Nations will be soon enlarged by the admission of Bangladesh.54.	The year that has passed has brought also a series of constructive initiatives with a view to consolidating detente and unreservedly accepting the principles of peaceful coexistence. These initiatives include multilateral efforts  such as the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and negotiations on arms and troop reduction in Central Europe  as well as momentous changes in bilateral relations between many Member States of the United Nations.55.	In our opinion  this new and justly hope-inspiring development is primarily expressed in the fact that the States of the European continent  regardless of their systems  size or geographic location  are making a collective effort to create the foundations of a lasting system of security and co-operation. This effort will find its practical reflection in the work of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  whose second phase is now being held at Geneva.56.	That effort is being made on the basis of the recognition of the fact that security in Europe can only rest on the inviolability of the political and territorial post-war realities. This has been evidenced in the bilateral treaties signed by the Soviet Union  Poland and the German Democratic Republic with the Federal Republic .of Germany  in the normalization of relations by most countries with the two German States  and in the admission of those two States to the United Nations.57.	On numerous occasions in the past the Polish delegation has had the opportunity to comment from this rostrum on matters pertaining to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and to present specific proposals  including the conclusion of an all-European treaty on collective security. The main task of the Conference we visualize as consisting of the creation of a system of collective security in Europe  the future overcoming of the division of Europe into two groupings opposed politically and militarily to each other  and the mapping out jointly of the course of a further peaceful development of the European continent. Peace means something more than merely a state short of war or even a situation in which war has been eliminated. We conceive of peace as an open  dynamic and steadily advancing process: a process into which a constructive programme has to be injected  one with positive ideas and values to be implemented by a joint effort. We feel that all the conditions are there for the Conference to make that goal materialize. Poland favours expansion of all-round co-operation withStates having different socio-political systems. The equitable development of such co-operation depends on nonintervention in the internal affairs of other States  observance of the principle of mutual respect for the rights and customs of individual nations  and respect for their cultural and historically formed national identity.58.	By virtue of its geographic location  Poland concentrates on Europe; but we do not see that continent as detached from the rest of the world. We believe that the most substantial contribution to the peaceful and progressive development of the world Europe can make will consist of the establishment of a system of collective security  of turning Europe into a continent which would pose no threat to any other region and which  through co-operation with the other parts of the world  would contribute to the growth of the well-being of the peoples of all continents and to a life in peace  freedom and dignity all over the world. In that way Europe would cease to be a hotbed of tensions and conflicts  involving other nations of the world  as has frequently occurred in the past. Europe would thus become a centre of stabilization of world peace and a model of relations between States with different socio-political systems  in line with the principles of peaceful coexistence.59.	It is our firm belief that the decisions of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will be of historic importance for Europe  for the security of other continents and for world peace.60.	The essential progress in the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States is of special significance. This is reflected in agreements signed during the visit of President Nixon to the Soviet Union in May 1972 and in the course of the visit paid to the United States this year by Leonid Brezhnev  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Their relations were established on the principle of peaceful coexistence  which is an important step forward along the road towards strengthening world peace and creating realistic possibilities for building relations among States on the very same foundations.61.	The agreements in question imply the intention of both Powers to have the political detente accompanied also by a military detente. It is with appreciation and hope that Poland views the agreements concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States and the prospects for a peaceful development of relations between the two great Powers; for we think that they resulted in the strengthening of world peace and security.62.	While developing and reinforcing relations with its allies  Poland is expanding its contacts on principles of peaceful coexistence with other countries. President Nixon's visit to Warsaw in the spring of last year resulted in an accelerated expansion of relations between Poland and the United States. Likewise  we have developed our relations with a number of West European States. Fresh content and new forms were added to our relationships with France as a result of the visit paid last year to Paris by the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party  Edward Gierek. We have entered a new phase of relations with the Federal Republic ofGermany. We are developing friendly relations with Italy  Belgium  Finland  Sweden  Norway  Denmark  Austria and other States. The time has come  too  to start talks on our mutual relations with the Vatican.63.	We are also strengthening our ties with States in other parts of the world. Such ties are especially animated with India and also  notably in the economic field  with Japan.64.	We lend our support to the efforts of the non-aligned States which  at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Algiers  adopted a number of resolutions [see A/9330 and Corr.] testifying to their determination to pursue a policy of peace and of struggle against colonialism and neo-colonialism. The Algiers Conference pointed out the urgent need for eliminating the remnants of colonialism and for fighting all forms of neo-colonialism. We for our part  express our solidarity with the struggle waged by the national liberation movements in Africa.65.	Against the background of positive developments and the emerging trends of detente and co-operation based on equal rights  the persisting hotbeds of tension and manifestations of the policy from a position of strength  vestiges of colonialism and other harmful phenomena in the international situation stand out in glaring contrast. The situation in the Middle East is fraught with the danger of the eruption of a military conflict. The present situation there should lead us into no complacent mood. Israel persists in ignoring the decisions of the Security Council and pursues a policy of aggression and terror towards its Arab neighbours. Poland's unswerving position is that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) should be promptly implemented. Occupied Arab territories ought to be restored to their rightful owners without delay. That is the basic condition for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. All peoples of the region  including the Palestinian people  should be guaranteed the right to an independent existence and a peaceful life.66.	Developments in Chile have shocked the world and Polish public opinion. The overthrow by force of the legal Government of the country  the assassination of the constitutional President  Dr. Salvador Allende  who only last year was a guest of this Assembly  acts of violence against and harassment of diplomatic missions and citizens of various States  as well as of foreign ships  depriving the Chilean people of its natural resources and surrendering them to international monopolies  mass terror in the country-all this cannot but have far-reaching international implications  endangering the atmosphere of peace and detente in the world. The people of Poland condemn with indignation the acts of violence and terror raging in Chile.67.	Nov/ that the policy of detente has scored many successes  there is a need for even greater efforts than ever before to reinforce these positive trends and to make them irreversible. The scope of encouraging changes has to be broadened so as to ensure that open conflicts and unsettled problems may not again bring a relapse into the cold war  or give rise to dangerous tensions. This will take vigilance vis-à-vis any forces which for their selfish ends might wish to obstruct the positive changes in the international situation  sow distrust or complicate the processes of international confidence-building.68.	In the present historical moment in the world situation the activity of these forces is a harmful and dangerous anachronism. Also more apparent than ever before is the bankruptcy of any attempts at solving international conflicts by war and by methods of the policy from a position of strength.69.	The United Nations  which now  owing to the admission of new Members  comprises almost all States of our globe  has an important role to play in the consolidation of the positive changes in the international situation. In my statements from this rostrum [2118th meeting]  I have already had the occasion to present the views of the Government of Poland as to the great significance for the United Nations and for the situation at large of the admission of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany into our Organization. We feel that the United Nations not only should provide a forum for political debates of a universal nature  but should also become a venue for practical construction of a system of collective security through  inter alia  universalization of the positive experience gained by various regions of the world.70.	We are entitled to expect that the United Nations will lend its active support to all efforts which are made on the bilateral as well as the multilateral plane  both on a regional and on a global scale  and are aimed at the normalization of international relations based on the principles of peaceful coexistence  the renunciation once and for all of the use of force  the peaceful settlement of disputes and the expansion of non-discriminatory co-operation in all fields. This is what will determine the prestige of the United Nations among the international community and the Organization's place in the history of mankind.71.	The United Nations efforts to consolidate detente and to make it an irreversible process have to entail specific measures in the field of military detente and disarmament. First of all we have to do away for ever with the danger of a nuclear war. That is  in fact  the basic task of this Organization.72.	We feel that in order to eliminate the threat of a nuclear war it is of special necessity and high priority that all States ratify the Treaty on the partial banning of nuclear-weapon tests  and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)]  and  subsequently  that further steps should be taken towards the complete elimination of nuclear arms.73.	Two days ago [2126th meeting]  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union  Andrei Gromyko  presented in this hall an extremely important proposal on reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries. The practical implementation of that proposalwould not only produce immense material advantages but would also have an impact upon the improvement of the atmosphere of trust in international relations; we are also aware of the new vistas that would open up for further disarmament measures. The Polish People's Republic welcomes this important initiative and lends it its full support.74.	Poland is consistently guided by the desire for general and complete disarmament. Hence  we favour the speediest possible convocation of the World Disarmament Conference. We trust that in the course of the present session  on the basis of the record of work heretofore of the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference  established under resolution 2930 (XXVII)  we shall take further decisions concerning the preparation of the Conference. The Conference could become a turning point in the efforts aimed at freeing mankind from the tremendous burden of armaments  strengthening world peace and promoting the successful socio-economic development of the nations of the world.75.	The consolidation of the processes of detente and the building of world peace are inconceivable without broad economic co-operation among the States of the world.76.	The quest for stimuli to economic co-operation between all States is all the more important to the United Nations inasmuch as there is a feed-back relationship between the development of the political situation and that of the situation obtaining in international economic relations. For political co-operation provides a propitious climate for promoting economic collaboration  which in turn becomes a solid basis for and a factor of intensified development of political intercourse. Moreover  advanced economic collaboration can in many instances lead to the establishment of co-operation on the political plane  and vice versa.77.	I dare say that the historic record of accomplishment of our generation will to a large extent depend on the conditions which we shall be able to create .for the development of economic co-operation on a global scale. They include very broadly conceived questions of economic collaboration on a scale much wider than has so far been the case in the work of our Organization.78.	The conditions which we should create for the expansion of economic collaboration ought to take account ' of the legitimate interests of all States. They should be oriented towards the fullest possible utilization of the opportunities offered by the international division of labour; they should ensure a scale of production and exchanges to each State  so as to make goods accessible to all. First and foremost they should ensure proper participation in the international division of labour to those States which in the early stages of the formation of the division of labour were not able to secure an appropriate place for themselves and their share in it79.	It therefore becomes urgent to work out a new machinery which will intensify the expansion of multilateral economic co-operation and take account of the interests of all States and regions of the world. The principal mechanisms governing international economicrelations were formed immediately following the Second World War at a time when political co-operation between individual States and regions was on a rather small scale. Besides  only a small number of States had a share in the setting up of those mechanisms.80.	With international detente and growing political collaboration  with a more advanced development of productive forces and a considerable growth in the number of States participating in world economic co-operation  the earlier mechanisms governing international economic relations fail to meet the present day requirements.81.	In many areas the situation is disquieting. Broad segments of international opinion call for proper action regarding  in particular  the following questions: the aggravation of the crisis of the capitalist monetary system  which adversely affects the entire international trade exchanges; the unequal and often discriminatory attitude of certain States and groupings of the West vis-à-vis trade exchanges with the socialist countries; the absence of mechanisms to stimulate the expansion of collaboration in science and technology  as well as industrial co-operation; and the absence of effective mechanisms which would assist the developing countries in taking their place in the international division of labour.82.	The United Nations should play an essential part in providing solutions to those problems. We offer our support to the efforts being made in this direction  inter alia  within the framework of the United Nations Development Programme  the functioning of which we highly value.83.	Poland attaches great importance to the expansion of economic co-operation with all countries of the world. The economic decisions we have been taking in recent years are so designed as to fit our economy into the international division of labour on a wider scale. It is our desire to make full use of the opportunities arising from participation in all-round international economic co-operation.84.	The economic record of Poland over recent years substantiates the practicability of our plans. Last year alone  Poland's gross national income increased by 10 per cent  industrial production rose by almost 11 per cent  and foreign trade turnover grew by over 19 per cent. The figures I have' just quoted eloquently testify to the importance my country attaches to the expansion of economic collaboration with other countries  which is best illustrated by the measurable index of the rate of growth of our trade exchanges.85.	All nations of the world want to live in peace. All nations of the world want to live in freedom. All nations want to live better  more prosperous  more cultured lives. The United Nations can play a very important part in the attainment of these noble objectives. That  however  calls for the co-operation and dedication of all Member States. The delegation of Poland will spare no effort to that end."
"93",5734,"PRT",28,1973,"﻿124.	 I should like to direct my first words to you  Mr. President  in order to express the most sincere congratulations of the Portuguese delegation on your election to the important post of President of the General Assembly. Your reputation as a distinguished jurist and a respected figure in Iberian-American culture  which we fraternally salute  make us certain that you will preside over this Assembly with impartiality and respect for the rules of law.125.	Twenty-eight years ago  the San Francisco Charter was signed  dedicating the United Nations to its main task — the maintenance of peace and international security. This is understandable because peace and security constitute the prerequisites necessary for the attainment of the Organization's further objectives. In a world which had just seen the end of a long and cruel war  it was only normal that the desire for peace should assume a special significance and intensity.126.	To a certain extent we can see that this original aim of the Organization has been attained. Effectively speaking  in 28 years — seven more than those which separate the two great wars of this century — there has been no major global conflagration.127.	Nevertheless  it is necessary to recognize that conflicts have arisen regardless of the United Nations and that the mechanisms provided by the Charter for the maintenance of peace have either not been allowed to function or have not performed effectively.128.	The last few years have witnessed the appearance and development of a new element of major importance in the maintenance of peace. I refer to the call for a policy of detente  the positive results of which cannot be contested any more. This policy not only has the merit of reducing the danger of war  but also has permitted the establishment of certain forms of international co-operation  benefiting all  which would never have taken place in a climate of the cold war.129.	We have a notable example of this new attitude in the policy followed during recent years by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany. The admission of the two German States to this Organization constitutes a stage  to a certain extent symbolic  of this new political climate. Thus  it is with satisfaction on our part that we view the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic to the United Nations Organization. We also commend the admission of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.130.	If is also appropriate to make a special reference to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which we hope will result in the growth of a new climate of relations among the countries of Europe  and to which the Portuguese Government has given  and will continue to give  full co-operation.131.	In contrast to the climate of detente which characterizes some aspects of international relations  we witness with increasing frequency daily examples of the use of force for the resolution of conflicts or disputes. And  what is more striking  we see that some of those who proclaim the virtues of the policy of d6tente loudly and eloquently  attempt at the same time to find reasons and arguments which would justify the use of force whenever such a step would serve their own interests.132.	How can we claim that certain general principles which are declared to be fundamental in some areas are not valid for the entire world? How can we explain that the interpretation of these principles varies according to the latitude  the continent or the level of economic development of the areas in question?133.	Certain Governments that  on the one hand  defend the inviolability of European borders  that claim the right to crush any form of subversion within their countries  and that condemn the terrorism which victimizes their citizens  on the other hand support subversive movements in Africa  finance terrorism and assert the right to violate the boundaries of southern Africa. Such an orientation leads to the conception of a world divided into two zones  subject to principles not only different from each other  but even antagonistic. In one zone — the economically developed area — the principles of non-intervention  respect for national sovereignty  territorial integrity and peaceful coexistence would be held valid.134.	In the other zone  that of the less-developed and poor nations  intervention in the internal affairs of other States would be allowed  subversion and terrorism legalized  and violence held not only justifiable  but worthy of praise and of outside support. That is to say  we would arrive at an international law of the rich and an international law of the poor  which  undoubtedly  is an extreme form of neocolonialism.135.	Approximately a year ago  the United Nations established a committee to study methods of combating terrorism.  But certain parties promptly sought to use this opportunity in a political manner  m order to enable them to combat more effectively acts of subversion directed against themselves  while  at the same time  continuing to foster terrorism whenever advantage could be gained from it. Under these circumstances  the possibility of attaining the objectives initially proposed by the Committee was doomed from the outset. In fact the Committee was unable to achieve any progress at all.136.	One of the major exceptions which certain parties insist on attaching to the principle of the non-application of armed force concerns the so-called ""liberation movements"". Since these groups are formed through the process of self- selection  it becomes fairly easy for them to establish themselves as ""liberation movements"" once they are able to command the sympathy of the majorities that dominate international organizations. But apart from being easily achieved  their establishment is profitable also  a fact which helps to explain the rapid appearance of some of these movements. It may seem strange that a group presenting itself under a self-chosen label and counting on the support of certain sectors only can obtain privileges and advantages. But this is the truth.137.	An examination of certain conditions in the recent past can help us to understand how such a situation has arisen. The principle of self-determination came to acquire a very special meaning in the post-war period  a meaning that is reflected in the United Nations Charter itself. It became advantageous for one party in a conflict to be able to identify its cause with the defence of this principle. In the international community such a party would then be regarded as on the side of reason and justice. However  since we are dealing with a principle whose practical application is of great complexity  it is clear that such a principle could be used according to the will of the majorities  which would grant  or refuse  the status of ""liberation movements"" to dissident or subversive groups on the basis of their own self-interest.138.	Similarly  the nations which in number dominate the international assemblies use these groups in order to serve their own interests  and to try to secure for the liberation movements an extraordinary right to use force  including the practice of acts of terrorism and the receipt of external assistance.139.	In an international society of States — a reality on which the Charter of the United Nations is based — there is no possible justification for the bestowal on groups lacking an international juridical identity  of rights more ample than those granted to States.140.	The situation has become so absurd that the exceptions which some tried to introduce in this area  and which are supposedly justified by the principle of self-determination  do not even provide any guarantees for the defence of this principle. In fact the truth is just the opposite.141.	Let us consider m example. A group of citizens of a given nation enters into conflict with the authorities and attempts to secure for itself the rule over all or part of the territory. It is obvious that without external interference  the degree of success of any such group of individuals would depend on the amount of support received from within the country. However  if the same group receives assistance from the outside  its degree of success will depend on the amount of assistance thus provided. And  if such support from outside is great enough  the domestic support may even become irrelevant; we would then have an operation entirely sustained and directed from abroad — obviously benefiting interests alien to those of the indigenous population — which would necessitate the collaboration of only a minimal part of the population to justify foreign interference.142.	In other words  to allow grants of external assistance to the liberation movements would be to pervert entirely the reasons given to justify the actions of such movements. While the principle involved may be that of self-determination  the truth is that what we are confronting is the pursuit of objectives and interests privy to certain Powers or group of Powers. Unfortunately  the example given is not merely theoretical. And many movements that emerge within the international community as paladins of the right to self- determination do not command any significant popular support. Their actions  either military  terrorist or pseudo- diplomatic  within or outside national borders  are the result of support received from abroad.143.	It is contrary to the principles of the United Nations Charter to accept a norm whereby States can grant assistance to groups without international juridical identity  operating within other nations and resorting to violence to attain their objectives. It is even more abhorrent to attempt to justify such actions by involving the principle of self- determination. Actually  we are faced with a mere expedient by which certain Powers attempt to achieve their policies or to ensure their hegemony in areas where no other pretext can explain their presence.144.	The Portuguese Government accepts  and reaffirms emphatically  its support of the principle of self-determination. But it cannot allow this principle to be used as a means to legalize violations of such basic principles of international law as the non-use of force and non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations.145.	The influence of the African States in the debates and resolutions of the General Assembly is held to be dominant. And in fact  it is. Their votes are decisive in the resolutions that are approved  not merely because of their numbers  but also because of the influence they have upon other countries  which keep them company in an alignment  whose roots  however  are unfortunately not to be found in a conviction of the justice of the causes defended  or in the merit or efficacy of the resolutions approved  but in barefaced opportunism and convenience. Votes which are cast with Africa  in order to please Africa  are votes against the real interests of Africa. It has been said here  with some truth  that  should this tendency continue  the United Nations would soon turn into a mere branch of the OAU. Such a situation would certainly be very degrading to the United Nations  which would thus find itself reduced merely to repeating and to echoing timidly resolutions and decisions adopted in other forums. But such a situation would  at least  be a boost to the prestige of the OAU. It would be a success and a triumph for Africa. The influence of the African States in the resolutions of this Organization would not have  in itself  anything that is pernicious or deserving of criticism. But does the voice of its representatives really express the true aspirations of Africa? Does their influence coincide with true African interests? That may be the case in some matters but it is certainly not true when one considers the campaign and the attacks against Portugal. The concentrated attacks against Portugal both in this Organisation and outside it are a pretext  a smoke-screen and an excuse: a good pretext for displaying a fictitious solidarity among Africans and towards Africans; a smokescreen for concealing from the eyes of the world the true problems and the real drama of Africa; and a convenient excuse for justifying omissions towards Africa and towards Africans.146.	The OAU  in a racist orientation that has no justification and with an utter lack of knowledge of our realities  today contests the legitimacy of Portugal as an African nation. The OAU considers Portugal an enemy of Africa  a threat to the security  independence and territorial integrity of African States  a challenge to the unity of the continent and an insult to the African man. We have followed with surprise  and even with indignation  this false and artificial campaign  so contrary to the real truth of the matter. The anti-Portuguese doctrines of the OAU deserve deeper reflection and an analysis of their fundamentals and significance. There is no real basis and no real motive for a conflict between Portugal and any other African State. .There is no clash of interests  no divergence of destinies that separates us from the rest of Africa. Why should we be the adversaries of any African country or of the entire continent?147.	The gravest accusation levelled against us  and one which is linked in a special way to the competence of this Organization  is that we constitute a threat to the independence and to the integrity of the African countries. It is even asserted that we are a threat to international peace and security. That is a strange  not to say an astounding  accusation  which time alone ought to have rendered baseless by now. For over 12 years that same accusation has repeatedly been made against us. But I ask you  Where are the African countries that have been invaded and conquered by Portugal? Where are the territories of African States annexed by Portugal? Which part of any African country has at any time been claimed by Portugal? Which frontiers in Africa do we seek to alter in our favour?148.	We may be repeating statements already made  but perhaps it would be pertinent at this time to affirm here again  and solemnly  that we have always been  and still are  prepared to give all the necessary juridical and political guarantees on this matter which are in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Are there African States which consider their security threatened by Portugal? Why do they not sign non-aggression pacts with us  or take part in bilateral or collective declarations renouncing the use of  or the threat to use  force  just as the European States are doing among themselves  amid the applause of the entire world? We too are prepared to take initiatives or to respond favourably to initiatives with regard to renouncing offensive and aggressive armaments in Africa. Africa does not have a more sincere  a more convinced  a more unwavering defender of the principles of paragraph 1 of Article 1 and paragraph 4 of Article 2 of the United Nations Charter  —  upon the principles of which rests the entire edifice of international peace and security — than Portugal. We are attacked from States bordering upon our territories. Those attacks are considered legitimate and Just. On the other hand  our defence is considered illegitimate and threatening. And yet such defensive action on our part is strictly contained within the frontiers of our territory and marked by a spirit of moderation and conciliation of which perhaps no other Member State of this Organization — I repeat  no other Member State — would be capable of giving proof.149.	But behind the escalation of violence and threats against Portugal  the spectre of a vaster and more generalized conflict is raised. One frequently hears expressions such as the ""Viet-Namization of southern Africa""  and attempts are made to feed the flames of ""a gigantic racial conflict"". ""Viet-Namization of southern Africa""? ""A gigantic racial conflict""? Perhaps that indeed might be the case if the Portuguese Government were to change its present defensive policy in Africa; if it were to withdraw the armed forces ensuring the protection of all the populations in the face of terrorist action; if it were to abandon to their fate the various ethnic communities of Angola and of Mozambique; if it were to permit these communities to segregate themselves along racist lines; if it were to let the territories of Angola  Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea cease to form the basis for the unification of the different ethnic groups inhabiting them; if it were to allow 'them to be fragmented at the pleasure of forces and influences which would immediately dispute them and convert them into the battlefield for the declared or potential ambitions of their neighbours and a theatre of operations where territorial claims and defence strategies would certainly clash. Those who persist in calling for the destruction of Portugal in Africa would do well to meditate a while on that perspective.150.	Attempts are made to justify the intervention by African States and by the OAU in Portuguese Territories in the name of African solidarity. That solidarity  it is said  transcends frontiers and does not have to respect either traditional juridical principles  or rules of universal law  or the Charter of the United Nations. Thus  emotional appeals are made  calling for recourse to the use of force and violence  and aggression is given legitimacy. It is good that Africans should feel a spirit of solidarity among themselves and that they should treat one another as brothers. Brotherhood is a powerful weapon in the fight against injustice and against oppression. But it ought not to be blind or based upon fictions.151.	The African man has already discovered his true dimension and dignity  the consciousness of his rights and the force of his aspirations  the value of his culture and the significance of his history  his importance in the contemporary world and his fundamental role in the future. We salute with respect the struggle carried on by the leaders of the young African States  in their own countries and on the international stage  for the progress of the continent and the fight on many fronts to combat under-development and foreign domination. All the Portuguese of Africa are no less conscious of their position as Africans. The blacks among them and those that are of other races or of mixed blood do not feel any less closely related to the problems  the dramas  the conflicts  the aspirations and the future of Africa.152.	But if the leaders of the OAU fell a solidarity only with those of their brothers that are of the same race as themselves  they should think  for instance  of the many thousands of black-skinned Portuguese who fight in the ranks of the Portuguese armed forces. They call them mercenaries. But why  I ask you  should anti-Portuguese elements who are paid from abroad be called patriots and freedom-fighters  and money from the capitals of Eastern Europe and Scandinavia be considered so pure? It is ridiculous that those who have subjected themselves totally to the discipline and organization of parties  whose ideologies and doctrines are alien to the African continent  and who serve imperialisms foreign to Africa  are praised for their patriotism; whereas those that defend their African villages and accept the prospect of being able to build their future peacefully within their own country are called mercenaries and collaborators.153.	But who will believe that in any country mercenaries can be more numerous than patriots? Count  on one side  the terrorists of FRELIMO   those that sow mines along the roads and in the African villages as well as those that obtain them in Moscow  in Prague  in Stockholm or in Oslo. Count  on the other side  only the Africans that fight against them  those integrated in the regular army units or in the rural militia in Mozambique. The same is true in Angola and Portuguese Guinea. Those Africans constitute the overwhelming majority as compared with the invaders sent in by the so-called liberation movements. An entire population made up of mercenaries — what an extravagant theory!154.	The millions of inhabitants in Portuguese Africa  whether farmers or factory workers  technicians or public servants  students or professors  are no less conscious of their quality as Africans than their brothers from the rest of Africa. And they do not think they are betraying that quality when they peacefully continue their activities and participate in increasing measure in the political  social and economic development that is taking place in their countries. But they will have reason on their side in thinking that it is the rest of Africa that betrays them whenever it provokes and incites violence that victimizes them  when it seeks by all means to render difficult or to impede the setting up of factories or the construction of dams on which depend their lives and their progress  and when it condemns all political reforms that bring them advantages — when in fact it strives to hamper the conditions that promote their true and authentic self-determination.155.	I spoke here a year ago [2048th meeting] about the many reforms and development/which have occurred in Portuguese Africa. The armed attacks against Portugal have not prevented us from implementing them with speed and determination. In March of this year elections to the legislative assemblies of the States of Angola and Mozambique and of the remaining Portuguese overseas provinces in Africa took place. Foreign journalists who were present during these elections attested  some of them with surprise  to the  enormous  peaceful and eager participation of the' voters. How could oppressed populations behave in this fashion? The majority of the voters were not white. In Angola  for example  whites numbered no more than 20per cent of the entire electorate. The results of those elections sent a very large percentage of native-born candidates to the various legislative assemblies.156.	An important step was taken towards giving a larger and increasing autonomy to our African provinces  and also ensuring a progressively greater participation of the entire population in the political direction of their respective territories. Efforts will continue to be made in the future to increase the numbers of voters among the local populations. This will be a direct result of the stupendous increase in the school-going population at all levels of education. How will it then be possible to continue saying that Portuguese Africa is subject to the domination of a white minority?157.	Simultaneously  the representation of the overseas provinces was increased in the National Assembly  or central Parliament  of the Portuguese State. We cannot foresee the future  but if the present trends should continue  and taking into account the make-up of our population as well as the progressive acceleration of the economic and cultural advancement of its African component  the Portuguese nation is heading towards a great Euro-African state  with the black majority in political dominance. Yet the concept of a white majority or a black majority has no meaning in our multiracial society  in which men and votes do not group themselves or are counted according to the colour of skin. Could the prospect of such a situation be repugnant to the OAU and to the United Nations  which make these concepts their banner and their objective?158.	Today it is possible to compare the statutes of the States of Angola and Mozambique and those of the units of a federation. Even though the autonomous regions of the Portuguese State may not be juridically federated in some fields  such as economic planning  Angola and Mozambique enjoy an autonomy which surpasses to a great extent that which is generally attributed to a state belonging to a federation. Much is said of the great projects in execution  like those of Cabora Bassa and Cunene River development schemes  both of which have been condemned by the United Nations. These schemes are already great realities on the ground  which will have incalculable effects on the economic and social progress of vast regions and numerous populations  and will have beneficial repercussions beyond the frontiers  and also in countries having a black majority. But the economic progress in Portuguese Africa is not limited to them  for it is disseminated throughout the Territories and embraces all sectors  from agriculture  to industry  and the services. The economic relations among the Portuguese Territories are established on a basis of equality and of solidarity  and there is no element of exploitation and of predominance present in the plans or in the realities. Whoever will take the trouble to study the facts in depth will reach the conclusion that  in the over-all balance of the economic and financial flows  the positive balance belongs to the African part and the negative to the European. This is a fact that it is hard for some of our friends and advisers from northern Europe to understand. But how can we pretend that the racists of Scandinavia or members of the Dutch Parliament  saturated by centuries of colonialist mercantilism  would be able to grasp the spirit of a people that created Brazil and gave orientation to what is known as a Luso-tropical civilization?159.	What more glaring example can I give of the solidarity between the different parts of my country than that of the assistance provided by metropolitan Portugal to CapeVerde? The drought  which today appears to be nearing its end in Cape Verde  was the longest in memory  lasting for over five years. In the meantime  thanks to the measures taken that drought has not resulted in graver consequences. No one has died of famine  the population has grown and there has been no stagnation in the development of the archipelago. The gross national product has grown at an average rate of 4 per cent per annum in the course of the last few years. The total of non-repayable financial aid furnished in the last three years is more than 30 million dollars and the aid for 1973 represents 25 per cent of the total value of the production originating in Cape Verde. In addition  technical and other forms of assistance were provided by metropolitan Portugal.160.	Thus  a country with a modest economic potential  to which the international community extends ""negative assistance""  has been able to find  thanks to the solidarity of its inhabitants  sufficient resources to avoid in one of its African territories the dramatic and catastrophic consequences which an identical natural phenomenon has provoked in various countries situated in the same geographical zone. And yet it is we who are called the colonialists.161.	We do not constitute a closed society in Africa. We do not raise political  juridical or social barriers among classes or among ethnic or religious groups. We do not set aside lands for the white and lands for the blacks. We do not distribute study courses  jobs and political positions  economic and social opportunities  on the basis of race or of colour. All the seeds of evolution and progress are to be found intermingled in our African societies. How  then  is one to justify the violence that leads nowhere and can only retard progress and make evolution difficult?162.	Violence is lamented and condemned  its victims are pointed out. And in the campaign against Portugal no hesitation is shown in inverting responsibilities  in a scandalous fashion  with the instigators of the crimes showing themselves up in the role of accusers. And similarly no hesitation is shown in seeking recourse to the most astounding calumnies  to inventions and to the grossest falsifications of the truth. The Portuguese Government repudiates energetically accusations of massacres of civilian populations. As the Government of a civilized country and of a sovereign State  it considers it its exclusive responsibility  which it will not abdicate whatever may be the pressures to which it is submitted  to investigate and to punish the crimes and abuses perpetrated in its territory  whoever may have been the perpetrators. And how long is the list of the crimes and atrocities committed against the Portuguese civilian populations  especially the Africans  by the terrorists morally and financially supported by the Governments and institutions that seek to appear before world public opinion as defenders of peace and of human rights. And the only thing that is much greater than that list is long is the hypocrisy of those who level accusations against Portugal  based on suspect testimony of individuals politically compromised with anti-Portuguese movements  forgetting all the contradictions into which they let themselves fall and spurning the testimony of numerous journalists who have freely travelled around the area of the supposed massacres. And amid the artificial clamour thus raised  will those who make these accusations claim that the world will forget  among many others  the massacres which have occurred in recent times in places such as India  Nigeria  Bangladesh and Burundi  or the hundreds of thousands of dead  victims of tyranny in the Sudan  in Ethiopia  in Uganda or in Rwanda?163.	Certainly there is a vast difference between an imagined number of some hundreds of dead whose death might have been  in any case  the lamentable consequence of terrorist activities  and the tens of thousands of victims resulting from the deliberate and systematic extermination of an entire ethnic group  such as is the case in Burundi  with the complacent and opportunistic silence of the same Governments and organizations which point an accusing finger at Portugal.164.	Are there innocent victims and useless destruction in Portuguese Africa? Certainly there are. But who are those responsible? Not solely those who disturb the peace  committing aggressions of which the Portuguese populations are the victims and against which they have to defend themselves. Equally responsible are those who support these aggressors  at times under the fallacious pretext of providing humanitarian assistance. Humanitarian assistance? Here is a fiction similar to that of the so-called liberated areas which are used as a pretext to justify such aid.165.	Where are the areas liberated by the terrorist movements  whose non-existence the organs of the United Nations continue to fear having to recognize  refusing as they do the persistent invitations addressed to them by the Portuguese Government with a view to clarifying the truth? Those areas can only be located where the headquarters and the bases of those movements are to be found  that is to say in the neighbouring territories. Are there  then  areas in the territories of the Republic of Guinea  or of Senegal  or of Congo-Brazzaville  or of Zaire  or of Zambia or of Tanzania  liberated from the control of the authorities of those countries? This is a problem which concerns the Governments of these States but whose resolution in no way alters the illegitimate character of the operations of those movements and of the assistance which they receive. But how is it possible to imagine that international organizations and responsible governments should base their conduct on fictions and fantasies? And shall we now have to add to the terminology of the fictions in vogue a new meaning of the expression ""illegal declaration of independence""? How many imaginary declarations of independence are going to ensue in all the continents following the example of the terrorists installed in Conakry? The so-called PAIGC  has its headquarters in the Republic of Guinea/Conakry. It is there that its organization is established and its leaders and its cadres reside. If it exercises any control over populations or territories  these are all situated in the Republic of Guinea or in other countries that consider themselves sovereign and independent States. Must we suppose that a few days ago a secession in the Republic of Guinea took place and that the activities formerly carried out in combination by the Government of Sekou Toure and the PAIGC have now' been separated and apportioned? Here is a question which the Government in Conakry may have some interest in clarifying in relation to the States with which it maintains relations.166.	The situation is irrelevant to Portugal  and in no way affects the territory and the populations of the Portuguese province of Guinea  which is subject in all its extent to the sovereignty of the Government of Lisbon and which is under the effective control of the Portuguese authorities. For this reason  only the Portuguese Government will be able to continue assuming and exercising  in relation to that Territory and in relation to those populations  responsibilities at art international level. It is to be foreseen that the populations of Portuguese Guinea will unfortunately  continue to be attacked from foreign territory by terrorist organizations based there. But these attacks will have the same criminal nature and the same illicit character in international law whether they originate in a Guinea/Conakry No. 1 or in a Guinea/Conakry No. 2.167.	Although no international juridical norm compels us to do this  and although we naturally cannot accept resolutions of the United Nations that are contrary to its own fundamental statute  however great the majority that has approved them  we have never hesitated to clarify before this Organization or before world public opinion  with honesty and realism  the true situation pertaining to Portuguese Africa  our problems and our difficulties  our possibilities and our successes. Is it that we have already achieved all our objectives of the political  economic  cultural and social promotion of all our people? No  certainly not.168.	But is the general position of Africa in the contemporary world in harmony with the aspirations and the possibilities of its sons? How many Africans exert influence on the direction of the interests of Africa and on the fundamental  political  economic and monetary decisions that are taken in international life and on which depends the lot of its peoples? How many participate effectively in political life within their countries? What is the share of Africa in total world income? How many Africans still die of hunger or from unsanitary conditions? How many doctors and professors has Africa? Where does the fight for the liberation of Africa and for the dignity of the African man really begin and end? Here are some subjects for reflection concerning the solidarity of the African brothers.169.	And whether the OAU will or will not recognize this  Portugal has a natural solidarity with the rest of Africa. Some of our neighbours  who in difficult circumstances have not hesitated to seek our aid — which we have never refused nor made subject to political conditions — would have to agree with this. It is not among the lesser contradictions of this Organization that a mission set up by it had to count on the support and collaboration of Portugal for the solution of the problems of an African State  while at the same time  in the committees of the United Nations or in a conference promoted by it  resolutions were being approved which would have rendered that collaboration impossible. But was it not in this conference  called a conference of solidarity towards Africans  that once more all the projects in an extensive region of Africa that can contribute to a substantial increase in the production of food materials were condemned  at a time when millions of the continent's inhabitants were threatened with death from famine?170.	We are at a moment in history when  side by side with the legacies of over-population and under-development  the menacing prospect of a scarcity of cereals raises its head. As one of the world's most prestigious personalities solemnly affirmed here  ""morally  it makes no difference whether a man is killed in war or is condemned to starve to death by the indifference of others"" [2128th meeting  para. 48]. Would this  indeed  be the appropriate moment to assign priority in Africa to violence as compared to peaceful co-operation?171.	On various occasions and in many forms we have proposed conversations and negotiations with the African countries. We renewed these proposals about a year ago for talks with the OAU or with the African group in the United Nations  without prior conditions and with no limitations regarding agenda or subject matter. Although all our proposals have been rejected without any explanation  we still maintain them as valid172.	It is said that we seek to gain time. This is true. Every hour that is lost in Africa for the tasks of peace and progress creates tremendous responsibilities towards future generations. And why  one should ask  should it be feared so much that time may prove Portugal to be right?"
"94",5781,"PRY",28,1973,"﻿154.	 On behalf of my delegation  and with the greatest pleasure  I greet the President of this Assembly  the most illustrious universal gathering  to assure him that Paraguay is happy to see this enlightened personality of a brother people  Ecuador  presiding over this session  so rightfully  so impartially and so brilliantly.155.	We know what a difficult commitment this honour entails. We know what a responsibility it is to preside over this General Assembly. We feel sure that the vast experience of Mr. Leopoldo Benites  his talents placed at the service of his country and of the peoples of the world  and his recognized international erudition and sagacity will make it easy for him to discharge the task so honourably given to him. Paraguay  in congratulating him and wishing him every success in the task assigned to him by the world  promises him full co-operation.156.	The United Nations was built on the ashes of a world in material and moral ruin 28 years ago. Not in vain have waters run under the bridges of life! in that period of history. The evolution of things has meant a logical and substantial change in the characteristics of the world  as compared with 28 years ago. Prosperity has reached some-relatively few — countries while the just aspirations of the majority to achieve development rise day after day like an uncontainable tide. The then warring nations  destroyed by war  have today recovered their economic splendour  their industrial potential and their possibilities for permanent expansion  and they forget the priority needs of giving integral assistance in creating a better and more humane world so that economic and financial relations with the developing countries may be organized through a just system of equity which will make possible the progress of all countries.157.	All peoples and nations anxiously seek international peace and harmony. All men and women dream of a calm and fruitful world  where man will sing hymns in praise of labour  creative labour  with no asphyxiating clouds on the horizon. With the advance of technology in those 28 years the world has become small and relations between men and peoples have become so close that a conflict in one part of the world is a burning-point which touches one and all equally and undermines the desire for peace at its roots.158.	The United Nations has become ecumenical and in the course of time many nations which have at last attained a free and sovereign life have joined it. This universality of the Organization's membership requires work which in the field of peace and its strengthening has not been completed. The man of our world knows that  despite all the labour of the United Nations in so many areas of concern linked to man and his habitat  peace is in daily and horrifying danger. And there is the daily sadness of the universal citizen at the inextinguishable hotbeds of violence and aggression which  while they may appear to cool down at times  require only two or three accidents for a return to the initial explosive stage.159.	This world  so deeply concerned by the possession of nuclear weapons and devices  has not lost its faith in the Organization but looks upon it with critical eyes  permanently awaiting from it and from nations  especially the super-Powers  the definite resolution  through United Nations bodies  of all conflicts which may endanger peace.160.	We do not believe that life and the world have left the Organization behind. We believe it still has a far-reaching role to play in creating peace and for the development of peoples; and in the ensuring of collective peace  which is the supreme desire of mankind  it has total responsibility. But this cannot be achieved successfully unless all nations beginning with the great world Powers  come to the halls of the Assembly in a suitable frame of mind.161.	Multilateral diplomacy must be used  with bilateral diplomacy placing its sometimes spectacular achievements at the service of such diplomacy. All countries  starting with the super-Powers  must be definitely prepared to submit to the rules of international coexistence as required within the Organization. If is not fair or advisable to praise peace universally by every means of social communication when interests other than those which are strictly basic for just and lasting international harmony prevail  regardless of what pretexts are adduced. United Nations meetings must be attended without prejudices or mental reservations  without ill-will or objectives determined in advance which admit of no reconsideration. Without a genuine dialogue of communication and good will there will be no peace-or if there is peace it will be only a weak flame which the first gust of wind will extinguish  so that night will again envelop the earth. There will be no lasting light without the final elimination of hatred between men  races and nations.162.	The multilateral action of the United Nations will never be a barrier to bilateral diplomacy. On the contrary  it is its indispensable complement. Any successful action by the Organization not only solves an international problem but gives greater prestige to the entity established so that man will have more faith in a world of peace  justice and liberty.163.	To arouse happy hopes among men in this century which is so heavily laden with disillusion and disenchantment is in itself a start towards building a better future for our anxiety-ridden mankind.164.	The world of today  rightly concerned by many collective problems  such as those of the environment  natural resources  improper distribution of wealth  both nationally and internationally  the conquest of outer space and the utilization of the resources of the sea  must still bear the asphyxiating fear of war or of an explosive lack of harmony between peoples and nations  when everything tells us that the integration of national economies and the obvious interdependence of countries are the basic resources to be used for a good future.165.	We must mention some notable achievements with legitimate satisfaction. Positive contacts between the great Powers have brought about a page of relief demonstrating at the same time that the quest for new means for the good of mankind is never-ending  that there are steps which have always to be taken if we have a sincere desire to shorten distances without thinking of prejudices  seeking solely understanding between peoples and countries which appear at first sight to be spiritually far apart.166.	Freezing the long and sad war of Indo-China has been another valid step on the rough road to peace.167.	We hope that the countries involved in this problem will find a final solution based on respect for the substantive values of mankind  without which even life is not worth living.168.	We must not seek a solution for its sake alone  sacrificing the moral values which perish in the attainment of an easy success. Peace needs form  solid and definitive foundations  for today  for tomorrow  for ourselves and for the children of our children.169.	Let us hope that the solution of international conflicts will always be based on respect for the free and sovereign existence of nations  the self-determination of peoples  the impossibility of waging war for military  economic or ideological conquest and on the elementary principle of coexistence and non-intervention in the internal affairs of sovereign States.170.	The unflagging work of the Organization in the quest for peace is praiseworthy. In all explosive places-Cyprus  the Middle East or southern Africa-its presence is an effective action which the world itself undertakes to find a solution to the problems which overwhelm it. As I said  this is a ray of hope on the difficult but irreplaceable road to peace.171.	My country  Paraguay  wishes to make public a positive affirmation of its faith in peace and in the work of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. My country appreciates at its full value that daily  silent  sometimes thankless task  which has no substitute  in the common good of nations.172.	The opening meetings of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe which were held in Helsinki are another milestone which is worthy of mention. A united Europe  above all one clearly aware of its vast international responsibilities  both political and economic  is of concrete assistance towards a just and lasting peace.173.	We anxiously hope to see better horizons in the conflict  by now almost classical  of the Middle East. It is a thorny and closed dilemma which places on trial not only the United Nations actions but its very existence  because the layman in every region judges the reality of the United Nations by the positive achievements in situations of conflict which are daily in the news.174.	Paraguay believes that  subject to two governing principles — express recognition of the full and sovereign existence of the State of Israel and the right of the Palestinian people to their own country-the application of resolution 242(1967) of the Security Council of the United Nations has to be the way to a happy solution which all men of goodwill hope for.175.	There can be different formulas to win peace. All of course require a spirit of dialogue  that is to say  a simple willingness to be receptive to reason  even though it comes from the other side  so as to be able to understand the objective realities which constitute every human conflict  and even more obviously the cooling of passions which reveal shady corners of opprobrium and lack of dignity in the very place where only good judgement should prevail.176.	Among our hopes  we have already pointed out the achievements of the great Powers and the relaxation of tensions among them. We hope that this will be final  so that they will co-operate among themselves in the solution of problems and in positive international action.177.		Will these achievements eradicate the obscure and terrible problem of the accumulation of arms? Will mankind continue to invest thousands of millions of dollars in weapons of every kind? Will common sense and a lasting sense of responsibility finally prevail so that the multimillion figures will be reversed and used to improve the standards of living of the developing peoples?178.	It is up to the great and powerful nations to set an example  so that the freezing of conflicts and relaxation of tensions will bring forth fruit in a real limitation in the manufacture and sale of arms.179.	It is impossible to understand the arms race of some developing countries whose people so urgently ask for the satisfaction of their priority and elementary needs. Such attitudes defy the hunger and poverty of millions of human beings. There are developing countries which ask of the world more credits to give impetus to their progress. In the meantime  paradoxically  they invest millions of hard currency in the acquisition of ultra-sophisticated or obsolete weapons.180.	The roses of peace and international understanding cannot bloom along the route of an arms race. Any excessive growth in the might of military installations arouses suspicions  fears and rivalries among nations. The mere accumulation of weapons and the rivalry among States for their possession are already a beginning of war  which can lead us to painful experiences. It is best not to play with the elements of death  hatred  pain and destruction.181.	Paraguay has for many years struggled arduously while lacking greater financial assistance and  above all  more flexible and generous assistance  in an ardent quest for better days. The philosophy of labour and production prevails. The infrastructure moves forward at a rapid rate in every area. Education  housing  health  production  export promotion  energy-these are vital concerns of a Government which seeks only peace and thereby the progress of our nation. Its people  which in its history was viscerally torn apart several times by war and internal anarchy  embarks on these undertakings with faith and firmness. Its armed forces  which are subject to the Constitution  to order and to the law  have been placed at the service of communities and at the service of creating a better world for all without any kind of discrimination. The army  the navy and the air force are inspired by this desire for peace and development and work side by side with the people in works of national interest. Schools and public buildings  roads  new means of communication  telecommunications  the merchant marine  local and international air services  health centres and agrarian reform testify to the concern of the glorious armed forces of Paraguay  which are the legitimate pride of its people.182.	My country and its armed forces invest in these patriotic and progressive tasks monies which could have been invested in the purchase of arms.183.	Based on these convictions  my country will continue to advocate in this great forum the need to contain the arms race and to support a policy of an honest and honourable disarmament which would be the result of a fruitful dialogue between all countries  starting with the super-Powers.184.	If there is one scourge which is characteristic of our times  it is the rise of terrorism. The hijacking of aircraft  the taking of innocent hostages  indiscriminate violence  horrible murders  the mutilation or killing of people without any valid motive constitute cankers which are a denial of civilization.185.	This is the most cruel and heartless of crimes.186.	In cold blood  in a calculated way  deliberately  in silence and in secret  terrorists prepare their destructive and nefarious activity which sometimes reaches  kills or destroys people who are tragically powerless before such refined evil.17187.	What have these innocent human beings to do with the causes which are cited as the reasons for such spurious criminal action?188.	Where will our civilization go  and where will our ethical values go  if this dark and clumsy course continues?189.	Is there really honesty when in every national and external forum we speak of peace  of tolerance  of justice  of collective well-being and yet do not put an end to or punish this heartless type of activity which is repudiated by all men throughout the world  regardless of their colour  language or religion?190.	Paraguay wishes to affirm that this chapter of our memory must be added to the list of the major collective frustrations. The committee of our Organization which is studying terrorism  arrived at no concrete results in weeks of study and debate.191.	The evil is everywhere. The illness stalks every day the entire geography of our planet. It is not from a definite country. At the current rate  terrorism has become international and its consequences explode in any place  at any hour  at any time  without respect for the life of anyone. There is not even any definite place for the activity  itself: today it is the point-blank assassination of a man in his home  tomorrow the painfully amputated hands of a modest employee of the post office.192.	The basic solution is to be found in the eradication of the generating causes. Let us study the problem and find a prompt and final remedy. Here I have in mind: the oppression of peoples who seek their autonomy  their own independence and national identity; the pessimism of many men and women who see in the work of the United Nations no solution to the chronic problems which afflict their countries; the obsolete colonial status of communities which are ethnically different from the metropolis or their oppressors  which are not able to express themselves freely in order to state their sovereign will; the unjust and immoral exploitation by oligarchic groups of majorities maintained in racial or economic discrimination  or both at the same time  maintaining people in an inhuman status and persecution for ethnic  social  religious or political reasons.193.	Without questioning the right of these peoples or communities to seek their own way towards liberation or autonomy  we should make practical efforts to put a halt to the present wave of terrorism which is making our own world impossible to live in.194.	Mankind  in its perennial quest for greater well being  is setting its sights on and devoting its most advanced technology to the rational use of the resources of the sea.195.	Food  energy and processing industries hope to find within the sea almost magic sources  the yield of which is as yet unknown but may reach unexpected figures and derivations.196.	Without going into detail as to the value of the sea as a provider of resources and minerals  we must also mention its vast usefulness in the field of transportation and communications between peoples and men.197.	Paraguay  because of an unfortunate historical determinism  not only has been deprived of a coast but is within the heart of South America bereft of the benefits which a sea coast would have given it.198.	This fact explains  to quote my predecessor  Mr. Miguel Solano Lopez "". . . our firm determination and our constant fight in all forums and in all organs to obtain endorsement of the principles of an increasingly enlightened international law which  through international justice  compensates for the obvious disadvantages deriving from a land-locked position.At the meeting held on 17 April 1971 in San Jose  Costa Rica  during the first regular session of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States [OAS]  the illustrious Minister for Foreign Affairs of my country  Professor Raul Sapena Pastor  referred to the question of the breadth of the territorial sea in order to express the point of view of Paraguay. This is what he said:""The Republic of Paraguay is ""an inland land-locked country  and geographical and historical circumstances have deprived it of the extraordinary benefit of having a coastline. None the less  Paraguay has the right to enjoy freedom of the high seas and unlimited navigation and to have access to fisheries  the underlying resources and the airspace over the sea. To the extent that the States with coastlines arbitrarily increase their sovereignty by widening their territorial sea  they are also arbitrarily limiting the rights of the Republic of Paraguay and of all inland or land-locked countries.""The breadth of the territorial sea can be fixed not by national precepts  whether they are derived from law or the Constitution; but through the consent of all States  ' including those that are land-locked and those that have coastlines  a consent expressed in the form of international agreements"".199.	Mr. Jorge Espil  who is a member of the Inter-American Council of Jurists  affirms:""Within the American continent we must bear very much in mind the situation of the land-locked countries such as Bolivia and Paraguay  which have expressed their disagreement with the extension of the territorial sea to 200 miles  because this implies a limitation of their rights over the high seas. Without these two countries one cannot speak of a uniform regional agreement"".200.	In taking up the common elements in principles and rules on the question  the Inter-American Juridical Committee  on 9 February of this year  stated that:""The coastal States shall authorize the land-locked countries which are part of the region to exploit the living8 See Official Records of the General Assembly  Twenty-seventh Session  Plenary Meetings  2062nd meeting  para. 11.resources within the zone from 12 to 200 nautical miles and grant them preferential rights in comparison with third States and in accordance with criteria which will be stated in multilateral  regional or bilateral conventions"".201.	These common elements are the ones which the Committee recommends to the American States so that they can be taken into account and submitted to regional or world-wide conferences on a new regime for the seas.202.	Elementary international justice requires that the land-locked or the shelf-locked countries have a right to exploit the living resources in the zone  whatever the name given to it  on a footing of complete equality with the nationals of the coastal States; and not only the living resources but also the mineral resources must be reserved for the exploitation of States in their respective regions  without taking into account their geographical location.203.	In regard to frustrations  one chapter deserves special treatment  and developing countries continue to hope that the declarations and recommendations made at international gatherings and conferences will become a reality. Their economies continue to suffer from the continuous deterioration in the terms of trade in their trade with the highly industrialized countries  to the direct detriment of the future of their peoples.204.	The countries supplying raw materials and exporting primary goods continue to suffer the unfavourable impact of the unstabilized prices of their export goods and the revaluation of certain currencies  which is a punishment impossible to foresee and one that has a harmful effect on the return of credits and international loans  with an increase in the prices of goods which our countries must of necessity import to satisfy their consumers and their plans for expansion and industrial development. The rich become richer and the poor become poorer.205.	It is not possible that only a few countries should participate in reforms of the monetary system when the consequences have a repercussion on all nations and a special impact on the economies of the developing countries.206.	Development is not an exclusive commitment of each nation; it is a responsibility for all nations and requires co-operation within the measure of the possibilities of each  with complete respect for the principle of non-intervention. Logically  the powerful and prosperous countries are obliged to co-operate more  quantitatively and qualitatively  in this ecumenical crusade. Technology  which is the key to expansion  can no longer be a closed club  the price of admission being the price of gold. Technology  trade problems  investments  financing and the opening of new markets constitute instruments which are essential for countries to progress.207.	Peace is not only an absence of armed conflict; it is also an attitude of understanding on the part of the highly industrialized countries and just co-operation for the development and well-being of our peoples. Justice  in economic relations  monetary decisions  the policy of general preferences  the granting of credits and financial assistance  the use of technology and investment policy is the only possible vehicle by means of which to arrive at a world which will be more humane  fair and just.208.	Disillusionment  discontent  extreme poverty  the rise in privileges  the unjust and unequal distribution of international labour and the scarcity of financial assistance for development will never be a help towards peace  stability or international understanding. If we wish for neither war nor conflict  let us see that the great countries  in the first place  put their shoulders to the wheel so as to change economic relations with a view to giving just treatment and genuine assistance to the developing countries. Their progress ultimately will be a triumph for our world and our institutions  a factor of good economics and harmonious and fruitful trade relations. The well-being and prosperity of all countries will ensure the well-being and prosperity of each.209.	Paraguay  which is a founding Member of the United Nations  has long since emerged from a long process of political anarchy and lives under the guidance of a genuine patriot  General Alfredo Stroessner  and we live a life in which republican institutions are paramount. We have left behind us the cruel confrontations between brothers so as to devote our days completely to the tasks of fruitful labour. We have swept away hatred so as to march ever forward towards the goals of collective well-being and national development. We have superseded the provisional institutions and we work under the rule of peace and progress  with the powers of the State and public opinion functioning fully. Today  we are concerned with peace  egalitarian public education  health  housing  the opening up of new markets for exports  a policy to create employment and an efficient development of the resources of the country. That is to say  we are concerned with that which interests man and the development of peoples.210.	Within that spirit Paraguay would reply to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Waldheim  that we wish to have a United Nations which is ""more than a conference machinery and a forum for the pursuit of national policies"" [A/9001/Add. 1  p. 8].211.	Paraguay wishes this to be a dynamic Organization above the emptiness of verbalism  something far more than a simple forum: an entity of solidarity  a solidarity where the great and the powerful will genuinely assist in advancing the world and its peoples. Paraguay wishes the light to shine at every dawn for every man in every region  -with no privileged States and no countries cast into oblivion  with no foreign intervention  exploitation  economic dependence or ideological domination."
"95",5845,"QAT",28,1973,"﻿90.	 Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to extend to you my warm congratulations on the trust bestowed upon you by the General Assembly through your election as President of the twenty-eighth session.91.	I should also like to join my colleagues who paid a tribute to your predecessor  who  by his impartiality in exercising his responsibilities and his tactfulness in steering the discussions  has added further respect and dignity .to this noble post. Wishing you  Sir  the best of success in the execution of your high mission  I should also like to welcome the new States which were admitted as Members of our world Organization at this session. I hope that their presence with us will have a positive influence on the strengthening of international peace and co-operation.92.	This is our twenty-eighth annual session  and it once again confronts us with an increasing number of international issues and problems  for which we hope the Organization will find practical and positive solutions that befit the Organization's role and the sublime values embodied in its Charter. Despite the fact that my country is a relatively new Member which has only lately begun participating in the work of the United Nations  its deep faith in the Organization's principles and Charter has been from the very beginning identical with its faith in a future dominated by a spirit of peace and in an international community whose relationships are governed by justice and mutual understanding. We still have in mind the glorious image of the international Organization which was set up after the bitter years of destruction  murder and horror which cast their dark shadows over the world during the Second World War  in the hope that it might put an end to wars and grant mankind its right to dignity and freedom and relieve it from oppression  aggression and exploitation.93.	More than a quarter of a century has now elapsed since the establishment of the United Nations. During this time we have discussed many issues and adopted many resolutions and this hall has heard hundreds of speakers. Words like ""peace""  ""justice""  ""international security""  ""peoples' right to self-determination"" have resounded in each resolution. Nevertheless  we still ask ourselves whether we have accomplished within the framework of this Organization and in the light of its Charter a part of the role for which the Organization was established. Has peace been established? And have all signs of war which should have been eliminated when our predecessors signed the United Nations Charter actually vanished?94.	We are not here to spread pessimism; but war  aggression and exploitation in all forms are still allowed to devastate the lives of human communities in Asia and Africa and to cast their ugly shadows on the whole world. Should we continue  none the less  repeating the words ""peace""  ""justice"" and ""peoples' right to self-determination"" without allowing the international community to enjoy these privileges in reality when we would destroy the world's dearest hope and allow this Organization to dwindle into impotence and bankruptcy?95.	We notice with great relief the end of war in Southeast Asia  as it is high time for that region to enjoy real peace. We welcome the detente which has reflected its effects on the situation in Europe and Asia  resulting in positive progress in economic relations and in conferences held for disarmament and European security. Yet there is one region in the world which still maintains a state of permanent tensions; there is one issue which has been allowed to remain on the agenda of this Assembly since 1948 and one specific subject which is continuously debated in the Security Council without being allowed to benefit from the relaxation of international tension or the prevalent optimistic spirit.96.	The situation in the Middle East has been and still is a chronic problem for the United Nations. It has become an impediment on the road to peace  despite the recommendations issued by this Assembly and the resolutions adopted by the Security Council. I need not reiterate here those recommendations and decisions  but I am sure that most of them include clear condemnations of Israel. It is a strange irony that Israel should be the object of the greatest number of convictions issued by this Organization  which created Israel  because it still maintains its occupation of the territories of three Arab States  denies a whole nation the right of self-determination and  moreover  strives to disperse it and to liquidate its national entity and human structure.97.	A Member State  whose representative sits with us in this hall  constantly declares that it will annex by force the territories of three other Member States; that it will defy the decisions of the Security Council and the General Assembly prohibiting it from changing the characteristics of Jerusalem and thereby violate the sanctity of the Holy Places and challenge the feelings of both Moslems and Christians all over the world. Israel has announced its refusal to receive a three-member Committee of the United Nations delegated by the Council to investigate Israel's violations of human rights in the occupied territories.  It has shamelessly admitted that it committed attacks on civil airliners and that it would continue such attacks in the future. To sum up  Israel declares that it will challenge any such decision adopted by this Organization which does not bless its aggressive expansionist policies.98.	The State of Qatar voted for General Assembly resolution 3034 (XXVII)  asserting its faith that terrorism and aggression still threaten the security and stability of nations. If the constant aggression of Israel against three Arab Member States and its liquidation of the Palestinian people is not to be branded as terrorism  then what is terrorism?99.	Israel  like other imperialist and racist States in Africa  endeavours to mislead the world concerning its policy based on terrorism and belligerency by trying to depict movements for national liberation as if they were an exercise in terrorism while in fact certain means of struggle carried out by the above-mentioned movements are merely aimed at directing world attention to the justice of their causes. In contrast  a State Member of this Organization which undertakes to explode some civil aircraft in the air and hijack others  to assassinate individuals and communities and to uproot millions of people from their fatherland or subject them to the most vicious forms of repression inside their occupied and usurped homeland  a State whose whole conduct is dominated by terrorism and a fierce demeanour  is actually the party which deserves denunciation  conviction and punishment.100.	My Government  while submitting these facts to the Assembly  declares that the time has come for this Organization to take positive and effective measures that would secure the cessation of acts of aggression committed by Israel against States Members of this Organization and effect its withdrawal from Arab lands that it has occupied by force  guarantee the Palestinian people's right to self- determination and put an end to the Judaization of Jerusalem and the defacing of its historical landmarks and aggression on the properties and freedom of citizens in the occupied territories.101.	While we duly esteem the great role played by Ambassador Gunnar Jarring  the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to the Middle East  in his attempts to work out a peaceful solution to the problem  we deplore Israel's obstruction of his mission and its non-co-operative attitude towards him. Meanwhile  we appreciate the good offices of the Secretary-General during his last tour of the region  which Israel attempted to render void of any practical sense  thus challenging Security Council resolution 242 (1967).102.	In this connexion I should like to express  on behalf of my country  our great thanks and gratitude to President Mobutu of the Republic of Zaire for his deep and wise understanding and support of the vital Arab cause  especially of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian Arabs  hoping and wishing for more Arab-African solidarity in the crucial issues that concern the African and the Arab worlds.103.	The small  non-aligned States are the real beneficiaries of peace. Hence  on the basis of this realistic evaluation my Government supports the non-aligned countries and upholds the resolutions adopted at the recent auspicious Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973  and at previous conferences.104.	My Government also maintains a similar attitude towards OAU and welcomes its decisions. Africa still suffers from the exploitation  aggression and attrition exercised by Portuguese colonialism in Angola  Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau. Millions of Africans still moan under the yoke of imperialist rule imposed by colonialists in Rhodesia and South Africa.105.	The non-aligned countries members of OAU are States that work for peace. Would the world Organization  then  turn a cold shoulder to their legitimate aspirations and positive yearning for peace  justice and freedom?106.	My Government feels that the policy of nuclear armaments and. their proliferation still poses a direct threat to humanity and  consequently  we deem it extremely necessary that a conference for nuclear disarmament should be accorded serious attention and care so that it may finally become possible to arrive at the stage of substantive negotiations on universal disarmament. Hence  my Government highly commends the General Assembly's wise resolution declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)\ As a State directly concerned with this resolution  we hope that it will be implemented at the earliest possible opportunity.107.	Our appreciation of the important role of the United Nations in fields of development makes us feel that the world community has to exert utmost efforts to create stronger and more meaningful ties between developing and developed countries and to establish close and equitable co-operation between them. Commendable as they are  the efforts exerted by the United Nations Development Programme  the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development are still below the level requisite for bridging the gap between the developing and the developed nations. This gap will further widen and endanger world peace unless the United Nations seeks fresh horizons and takes larger steps in urging developed nations to redouble their assistance to developing countries with a view to enabling them to surmount backwardness and to bring about a balance between the prices of raw materials and industrial products.108. Finally  the State of Qatar hopes that this session will be more successful in realizing the aspirations of the peoples of the world for peace  freedom and justice  and in ensuring a prompter implementation of United Nations resolutions and enforcement of the principles of its Charter."
"96",5891,"ROU",28,1973,"﻿19.	 Mr. President  the high responsibility which has been entrusted to you as President of this Assembly  in acknowledgment of your own merits which fully qualify you for this position  as well as the homage paid to your country  gives us the opportunity to congratulate you as an outstanding representative of Ecuador  a country with which Romania maintains cordial relations of friendship and co-operation. That was vividly brought to the fore on the occasion of the recent presence in Ecuador of the President of the Council of State  Mr. Nicolae Ceausescu  during his visit to several Latin American countries.20.	I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland  who directed with competence and distinction the proceedings of the last session of the General Assembly.21.	I take this opportunity to express again to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our sincere appreciation for his devotion to the cause of the United Nations  for his activity in the service of the Organization  for his endeavours to strengthen the role of the United Nations in international life. His visit to Romania — an event to which the Romanian Government attached great importance — enabled us to know better and to appreciate highly his preoccupations and efforts.22.	The present session of the General Assembly meets against the background of a process of detente  cooperation and rapprochement among peoples. That process is the result of the combined effect of a number of factors such as the social revolution which brought about profound changes in society  the technical and scientific revolution  as well as the desire and the determination of all peoples to live in peace  understanding and cooperation.23.	In the complex world of today  the will of peoples to be masters of their fate and to act as independent nations receives an ever stronger impetus.24.	Vitally interested in the expansion of international co-operation  the small and medium-sized countries  irrespective of their social and political systems  are carrying on a consistent activity and are determined to make their contribution to directing international life on the road of progress  co-operation and understanding.25.	A telling example in this respect was the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  held recently at Algiers. At this Conference the top representatives of a large number of States playing an important part in international life were assembled. The Conference reviewed the essential issues of man's endeavours for co-operation and peace  and for the establishment in relations between States of the principle of equal rights and mutual respect  national independence and sovereignty  non-interference in internal affairs  and the right of peoples to decide their own economic and social development for themselves. Present-day developments in Latin America  Europe and other continents speak for themselves.26.	The rise and progress of the forces that stand for detente  co-operation and peace demand the development of inter-State relations in keeping with the realitiesand requirements of the day  and the assertion of a new  democratic spirit in international life.27.	All this requires that the settlement of the great issues facing mankind should be the outcome of the active  direct contribution of all States  irrespective of their size  potential  level of development or social and economic system. The progress achieved in the way of detente in Europe and other areas of the world proves the significance of the role that all States should play nowadays  the necessity that they be able to voice their will and that the legitimate interests of all peoples be taken into account in the settlement of the vital issues of the contemporary world. In this lies the actual guarantee of the adoption of those solutions which would respond in the highest degree to the will and aspirations of all nations  to the cause of co-operation and peace. It is only thus that such solutions may prove their worth and durability.28.	As Mr. Nicolae Ceaucescu  the President of the Council of State of the Socialist Republic of Romania  has stated:""Drawing the right conclusions from the .changes that have taken place and from the new balance of forces throughout the world  it is necessary to secure the participation of all States in the settlement of the important international problems. Life has demonstrated that nowadays no problem can be solved without the participation of all interested nations. Hence the need for the countries that have set out on the road of independent development  the small and medium- sized countries  to act in ever greater unity in order to play an increased role in international life.""29.	A strong influence on international life is exerted for the growth of the political consciousness of peoples and their responsibility for safeguarding peace. The broad masses of the people are nowadays more active than ever. Human solidarity  complex in form and broad and profound in significance  now prevails over force.. Public opinion has become a factor that everybody should take into account.30.	A great contribution to those processes has been made by the socialist countries  the working class and the progressive  democratic  anti-imperialist forces all over the world.31.	As is proved by the latest developments  and particularly by the resumption of military hostilities in"" the Middle East  the new trend in international life  which responds to the aspirations of all peoples  does not assert itself spontaneously.32.	At the same time  one must not ignore the fact that in the world today there are still reactionary forces hostile to co-operation and detente and to the establishment of new principles in the relations between States — forces that conduct a policy of domination of some States by others. The existence of such forces requires continuous vigilance  intensification of the struggle of the broad masses of people everywhere and of all anti-imperialist forces  so that the new reality may grow into a lasting reality in our world.33.	The United Nations has an important role to play in furthering all progressive trends  in asserting the new course in relations among States and in introducing new principles into international life.34.	It is in the context of these important shifts and of the changes taking place in the international political arena  and in the light of the role our Organization should play  that I should like to deal with some of the problems of concern to the Romanian people and its Government.35.	1'he period that has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly has been characterized by a multiplication of contacts  exchanges of views and negotiations between various large  medium-sized and small States  by a normalization of relations among a great number of States and by the conclusion of important agreements on co-operation in various fields. It is the desire of Romania that these agreements may bring about concrete results in promoting peace  security  cooperation and friendship among all peoples. For its part  Romania  too. has embarked on such activity.36.	As a socialist country  Romania has expanded and deepened the relations of friendship and multilateral cooperation in the political  economic  technical  scientific and cultural fields with all socialist countries and is acting to strengthen and further promote new kinds of relations among them.37.	We attach particular importance to the broadening and strengthening of our relations with the countries that have embarked upon the path of independent development  on the basis of the common struggle against imperialism  colonialism and neo-colonialism. Romania maintains good relations with those States and will also expand them in the future  doing its best to forge links of co-operation that rest upon mutual advantage  and to ensure the general progress of each country and the increased well-being of each people.38.	Continuing the contacts made in the past few years with a number of States in Africa and Asia  the recent visit of the President of the Council of State  Mr. Nicolae Ceausescu  to six Latin American countries is a telling proof of our State policy of developing and strengthening multilateral co-operation with all these States  and gives a new impetus to the expanding course of bilateral relations. -Following the visit to the Latin American countries  the foundation for lasting co-operation has been laid  and we have come to the conclusion that we should add the new relationships to the age-old traditional relationships that bind our peoples of Latin origin. We realize also the necessity of strengthening our solidarity in the common struggle for economic and social development  in support of independence and sovereignty  for a better and more righteous world  and for friendship and peace among all the peoples of the earth.39.	Tangible progress has been made also in Romania's relations with the Western European Countries  the United States  Canada  Japan and Australia  which were conducted in the spirit of active peaceful coexistence in the mutual interest of our peoples.40.	A concrete token of my country's preoccupation with contributing to the process of detente  to the promotion of the new course in international relations and to the establishment of inter-State relations on a new basis is the wide- ranging international activity pursued by the President of the Council of State  Mr. Nicolae Ceaucescu  and the solemn joint documents signed by him on the occasion of the exchange of visits with the highest representatives of over 20 countries in all continents. In those documents the respective parties expressed their common will to base their bilateral relations  and their relations with other countries  on the democratic principles of international law and justice required by the present and future realities of international life  as well as to affirm their commitment to develop and deepen the co-operation between themselves  and with other States  in the interest of peace  understanding  detente  co-operation and friendship among all peoples.41.	Romania highly appreciates the development of bilateral co-operation  between all States. The wider and closer that co-operation becomes  the more lasting will be the peace and the more difficult its violation. Such cooperation also causes reason to prevail in international relations.42.	But  as we have already stated  issues of general interest cannot  in our opinion  be solved bilaterally  within a narrow framework  but only by the participation of all States and the taking into account of their individual viewpoints. Any obstacle preventing States from exercising their right of contributing  on an equal footing and in keeping with their own interests  to the settlement of these issues should be eliminated.43 The United Nations is the universal forum that  under present circumstances  can offer the most suitable framework for the fulfilment of these requirements. In Romania's view  universality does not mean only that the Organization should include all States as its Members  a goal which has been almost achieved; it also implies the submission of international issues to the Organization  their examination and the search for their solutions with the participation of all the countries concerned  as well as the observance of the same rules and principles with respect to all members of the international community  at all times and everywhere. Such universality is a prerequisite for real co-operation  as required by the purposes of the Charter.44. The firm establishment of relations among all States of the world on a new basis — that is  on full equality of rights — requires the strengthening of international rules of law  the key-stone of which is respect for national independence and sovereignty  non-interference in internal affairs  mutual advantage  renunciation of the use or threat of force and the right of each people to decide its own fate by itself. Nowadays  those principles acquire ever greater strength and ever wider recognition in the international arena. That is precisely why firm steps should be taken for their implementation so that they may become constant guidelines for the conduct of all States in their mutual relations. Any violation of those principles  any interference in the domestic affairs of another State  should be considered an act against peace and humanity and an assault on the cause of international co-operation.45.	The United Nations  which has made a noteworthy contribution to the progressive development and codification of international law  could  as a natural development  promote the implementation of the declarations  resolutions and other documents adopted in this field by giving them compulsory force.46.	The elimination of the use or the threat of force from relations among States necessarily implies the duty of States to settle their differences by peaceful means only.47.	Adherence to the purposes and principles of the Charter in the implementation by the Organization of its main task — that is  the prevention of conflicts — involves full use by States of United Nations machinery and of the peaceful means provided by the Charter for the settlement of international disputes.48.	The new trend in international life makes it imperative that all vestiges of the system of relations founded on political and economic subjection and discrimination should be wholly and urgently extirpated.49.	The United Nations  which has made an important contribution to the process of decolonization  must act more vigorously and firmly for the full implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and the programme of action adopted at the twenty-fifth session [resolution 2621 (XXV)] as well as the other resolutions concerning the liquidation of colonialism and the policy of racial discrimination and apartheid. It should take effective measures for multilateral and direct assistance to the national liberation movements of colonial peoples.50.	In full accordance with the sense of history and the general goals of the United Nations  the Romanian Government upholds the necessity of international recognition of the national liberation movements in colonies — including bilateral acts of States — as the only legitimate and authentic representatives of the peoples concerned. They should be granted a status enabling them to be directly represented in the United Nations  the specialized agencies and other international forums in order to defend and promote the rights of their peoples.51.	Romania extends material  political and diplomatic assistance to the liberation movements in African countries and considers that the conditions exist for the liberation struggle in those countries to be successful in the years immediately ahead. Significant for Romania's stand is the signing on 27 June 1972 of the joint communiqué on the occasion of the visit to our country of the delegation of the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [PAIGC] —  the first international document signed by that party. Amilcar Cabral emphasized its historic importance as an act of recognition of his party in the international arena.52.	That is why we experience a feeling of sincere satisfaction at the proclamation of the independence of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. Romania has recognized that State  and we take this opportunity to reaffirm our determination to expand and deepen the relations of solidarity and friendship with PAIGC  to lay the foundations of wide co-opeation between the Socialist Republic of Romania and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  and to continue to support on a multilateral basis the righteous struggle for the liberation of the Republic's whole territory  for the independent economic and social development of that country  for the quick elimination of the consequences of colonial domination.53.	In the year of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights we cannot but reaffirm our profound adherence to one of the Organization's aims — that of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights. The significance and the topicality of protection for human rights is emphasized by the fact of their wide-scale violation. We strongly condemn the policy of apartheid and racial discrimination pursued by the racist minority regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia.54.	The campaign of repression and persecution of the progressive and democratic forces  the violation of constitutional rights and freedoms and fundamental human rights in Chile give rise to deep concern. We express from this rostrum our solidarity with the progressive forces and the Chilean people  and we are confident that it will succeed in re-establishing the constitutional and democratic order and in imposing its will.55.	The President of the Council of State of Romania sent messages to you  Mr. President  to the Secretary- General of the United Nations and to the heads of State of many countries of the world calling for their intervention as quickly as possible with the authorities in Chile so that the lives of Luis Corvalan and the other Chilean fighters for progress and democracy may be saved. We are grateful for the widely expressed manifestation of human solidarity aroused by President Ceausescu's message and believe that the General Assembly could adopt a resolution calling upon States  taking account of their obligations under the Charter and in the spirit of humanity and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms and in keeping with the progress of history  not to resort to repression against persons struggling for progress and democracy  for peace and co-operation among peoples.56.	It is the Romanian Government's view that the continuation of situations and sources of conflict and tension  of opposing military blocs  of huge arsenals of weapons  is incompatible with the requirements of the democratization of international life  of the elimination of war from relations between States  of securing peace and security in the world.57.	We are deeply concerned about the outbreak of military hostilities in the Middle East  which inflicts great loss of human lives and material damage  aggravates the tense situation in that area and gives rise to further dangers to general peace and security. The present developments prove that continuation of the occupation by Israel of the Arab territories seized by force Is a source of permanent tension  posing an endless clanger of the resumption of military hostilities.58.	The seriousness of the situation prevailing at present requires the cessation of the military hostilities forthwith and the restoration of peace in the area. Romania consistently stands for the settlement of the conflict in the Middle East by political means  on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  so as to bring about the withdrawal of the Israeli troops from the occupied Arab territories and the establishment of a fair and just peace which would secure the recognition of the right to sovereign and independent existence of all States in the area; the problem of the Palestinian population should be settled in accordance with its own national interests and aspirations.59.	It is the Romanian Government's view that all nations throughout the world have the duty and high responsibility to act firmly in suppressing the hotbed of tension in the Middle East and for a quick settlement of the conflict there  in conformity with the supreme interests of the peoples  the principles of international law and the interests of international peace and detente.60.	World public opinion has welcomed with unanimous satisfaction the cessation of the war in Viet-Nam and the conclusion of the Paris peace agreements  as well as the Agreement on Restoring Peace and Achieving National Concord in Laos. The Romanian Government is of the opinion that everything should be done to put an end to foreign intervention in Viet-Nam and all over Indo-China  so that the Viet-Namese  Laotian and Cambodian peoples  which experienced great hardships because of the war  may devote all their power to reconstruction and to their independent economic and social development.61.	The political initiative taken by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea made possible the conclusion of agreements that pave the way for the normalization of relations between the North and the South of Korea. The Romanian Government has warmly welcomed the new proposals made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  which provide measures designed to contribute to rapprochement between the North and the South  to prevent the division of Korea  and to ensure the fulfilment of the lawful aspirations of the Korean people to live in a single State set up through the efforts of the whole nation  by peaceful and independent means  with no outside interference. We believe it is the duty of our Organization to take into account such positive developments and to give them its full support. The United Nations should uphold the idea of Korea's national unity  since that unity is a factor of economic  social and political progress  of peace and understanding among peoples. This requires  first of all  the renunciation of institutions which  under the aegis of the United Nations  make possible the continuation of a situation at variance with the interests of the Korean people and prevent that people from deciding upon its own fate in accordance with its own will.62.	We therefore support the principled stand of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the creation of favourable conditions for the acceleration of the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea  which is an item on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly [item 41 (b)].63.	As the representative of a European country  I cannot but take the present opportunity to express the Romanian Government's satisfaction at the positive trends now prevailing on our continent  reflected also in the admission to the United Nations of the two German States  an event which we welcomed a short time ago.64.	The idea of convening a general Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe — which was launched seven years ago  in the Bucharest Declaration by the socialist countries of Europe  including Romania — gradually gained the adherence and approval of the States and Governments  of public opinion and of the peoples of the continent; following intense ""and successful preparation this Conference has become a concrete reality of historic importance for the political life of Europe. A remarkable victory of the European peoples and  indeed  of the peoples all over the world. The general European Conference — whose first stage  at the Foreign Minister level  was completed successfully — provides an appropriate political framework for an approach by the representatives of all participating States  on the basis of the full equality of rights and the sovereignty of all nations  to problems of major importance for the consolidation of detente  understanding and co-operation among the peoples of the continent  in order that lasting security may be guaranteed.65.	The Romanian delegation to the Conference has been instructed to act consistently for a greater contribution by Romania to the success of the proceedings of the Conference  to obtaining good results in the settlement of the vital problems of the continent  to promoting the trend towards detente  co-operation and peace in Europe and throughout the world.66.	European security is not an end in itself: it is part and parcel of the general effort of setting up world security  an aim which will also be attained as a necessity; that is why it is not directed against anybody.67.	We express from this rostrum  too  our satisfaction at the good relations Romania has with all the Balkan countries  and we reiterate Romania's desire to ensure the turning of the Balkans into a zone of good- neighbourliness  co-operation and peace  free of nuclear weapons; of particular importance for the attainment of that end would be the holding of a meeting of the representatives of the Balkan States  in which other interested countries may also take part.68.	A matter of the greatest importance for the future of human civilization is that of freeing mankind from the burden of armaments and the nightmare of a nuclear war.69.	The two reports prepared in the last few years by the United Nations  namely Economic and social consequences of the arms race and of military expenditures  and Disarmament and Development   emphasize the enormous waste of human values and material assets  which amounted in 1971 to $216 000 million  and also the serious danger represented by the arms race for the peace and security of all peoples. At the same time  the talks on disarmament have not achieved results commensurate with the urgency of that question  nor have they met the expectations and hopes of the peoples.70.	The United Nations  the most representative international forum  has  along with the heads of all States and all political leaders  a great responsibility to the peoples for halting the arms race. The United Nations  in the spirit of its own resolutions  including the one proclaiming the decade 1970-1980 as a Disarmament Decade  should play an effective part in the negotiations on the halting of the arms race and of military expenditure  in the working out of a concrete programme for the reduction of those budgets  starting with the heavily armed countries  and of effective measures for disarmament and  above all  for nuclear disarmament.71.	It is from this angle that we approach the recent proposal of the Soviet Union [A/9191] as well as other similar proposals on the reduction of military budgets; they confirm the need to consider and take concrete actions towards that end which could be a start to measures for the reduction of military budgets.72.	It is imperative that a firm beginning should be made in the banning of nuclear arms and all other weapons of mass destruction  in the cessation of their production  the reduction of the existing stockpiles and the elimination of the whole arsenal of nuclear  chemical  bacteriological and other weapons  towards the attainment of the final goal — general disarmament.73.	In order to continue the intensive negotiations within the United Nations  the Romanian Government supports the idea that the United Nations Disarmament Commission should be reactivated.74.	The waste of huge human and material resources for military purposes appears even more irrational when related to the economic and social situation of the world  dominated as it is by the dramatic widening of gaps  by the persistence of under-development in wide areas of the earth  which in itself also affects international security. The economic and social purposes of all nations is indivisible and constitutes an acute requirement for the stimulation of the trend towards detente  rapprochement and understanding among States.75.	Romania itself follows the process of developing and modernizing its national economy The Romanian people make consistent efforts for the building up of a multilaterally developed society through the more effective use of the country's human and material potential for the acceleration of the development and modernization of the productive forces  the improvement of the management and organization of the society  the deepening of democracy and the laying of new premises for raising the standards of life and civilization of the whole people.76.	Romania  a socialist developing country  stands for the intensification  widening and diversification of international economic  industrial  technical and scientific co-operation  through the system of the United Nations as well  with the aim of accelerating the economic and social progress of all countries and  first of all  of the developing countries.77.	The Romanian Government conceives of cooperation as an essential means for strengthening international security and securing the economic and social progress of all peoples.78.	Increased attention will have to be paid to the expansion of co-operation in particularly important fields  such as energy resources  raw materials  environment  outer space  the sea-bed  information systems and electronic computers  so that all nations may be able to benefit from the epoch-making achievements of modern science and technology. It is necessary that the United Nations should undertake concrete measures in favour of developing countries in the fields of transfer of technology  know-how and patents  the training of specialists and the creation of the structures needed for the development  assimilation and application of science and technology at the national level.79.	The United Nations has a vital role to play in harmonizing assistance activities in support of the efforts of all developing countries to accelerate their economic and social progress  strengthen their economic independence and bridge the gaps existing in the world. That is why the Organization should activate the whole machinery at its service for the total implementation of the projects and measures in the field of development  among which an important place is held by the programmes of technical co-operation of this Organization. It is also absolutely imperative that the resources at the disposal of those programmes  which nowadays represent only an eight hundredth part of the expenditure for military purposes should be substantially increased  particularly by the most developed countries. Those resources should be directed to the implementation of complex projects bound to promote directly the economic growth and social progress of the developing countries.80.	It is also necessary that international co-operation for social development be expanded. The Organization should permanently focus its attention on the complex problems of the younger generation  and the necessary framework should be created for young people to make an effective contribution to the people's progress towards peace  understanding and well-being  under conditions of greater freedom.81.	The United Nations is nowadays faced with a great number of complex and complicated problems to which it is called upon to offer solutions.82.	The strengthening of the role of the United Nations with regard to the maintenance and consolidation of international peace and security  the development of cooperation among all nations and the promotion of the rules of international law in relations between States  is a primary preoccupation of the whole international community. The examination of that problem at the last session on the initiative of Romania and the adoption by consensus of General Assembly resolution 2925 (XXVII) show the urgency and importance of this problem  which should become a constant concern of the Organization. In the view of the Romanian Government  it is an objective necessity that all States act to implement the provisions of that resolution and contribute to the identification of the ways and means likely to permit a strengthening of the role of the United Nations. Of particular importance for the discussion of that item on the agenda [item 25\ are the final document of the Algiers Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries [A/9330 and Corr.l] and the ideas contained in the introduction to the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add. /].83.	The strength of the United Nations and its potential for action undoubtedly reside in its capacity to adjust to the realities of the contemporary world. That is why we share the view expressed by the Secretary-General that:""If the United Nations is to become the organization which the Governments and peoples of the world require and which their problems demand  we have to make a continuous effort to assess the challenge of the radical changes in the world  to make the necessary adjustments and  where needed  to develop new machinery and methods."" [Ibid. p.2.]84.	It is inconceivable that the United Nations should not keep peace with the progress of mankind and should not reflect and support the positive processes in international life.85.	It is in this spirit that we support the need to secure an increased participation of the small and medium-sized States in all the activities of the United Nations. That means  for instance  giving the plenary body of the Organization  the General Assembly  a role corresponding to its representative character  making a reality of its competence under the Charter to examine and settle the major issues of international life in the interest of all peoples. The United Nations is by no means the only possibility in the struggle for peace  co-operation  progress and understanding among peoples. But we have to acknowledge that it is only in this forum that the great fundamental issues of the world  of international relations  facing all the peoples of the five continents  can be discussed and settled  with the participation of all Member States and of all interested parties.'86. Experience shows that attempts are sometimes made to avoid the United Nations or that decisions taken here are not implemented. The time has come for us to examine in a responsible manner the activities of this Organization  to strengthen its role in international life  to make the provisions of the Charter a reality. The time has come for all the major problems of today's world to be debated here by all the Member States  and the solutions adopted should represent everybody's contribution and express the will and the interests of all Members of the United Nations.87. The efforts we are making are aimed at strengthening the role of the United Nations  reinforcing the purposes and principles of the Charter  making fuller use of its resources in order to adapt the Organization to the requirements of the day  bringing it into the process of detente  co-operation and democratization of international life as a fundamental instrument at the disposal of the forces of peace and progress able to repel any manoeuvres of the reactionary and imperialist forces — in brief  to enable the United Nations to fulfil in the world today the mission entrusted to it by the peoples.88.	Voicing the will and aspirations of the Romanian people  the Government of the Socialist Republic of Romania will make an active contribution  in the future as in the past  to strengthening the capacity of the Organization to fulfil the purposes of the Charter. It is our profound conviction that  by acting in this manner  we shall contribute to the strengthening of peace all over the world and to international security."
"97",5937,"RUS",28,1973,"﻿1.	 Mr. President  on behalf of the Soviet delegation I should like to congratulate you on your election to the post of President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. In discharging your duties  you may be assured of our firm intention to help make this session a successful one. The Soviet Union seeks to ensure that every session of the General Assembly yields practical results in strengthening peace and the security of peoples.2.	The past year has been crowded with major international events. Some of them  even if viewed separately  represent historic milestones. However  what chiefly characterizes this entire set of events is the development and strengthening of the shift from an extended period of tension in the world to detente and business-like co-operation. From this standpoint  the past year can in a sense be described as having marked a turning-point.3.	The war in Viet-Nam was brought to an end. The flames of one of the most dangerous breeding grounds of war were stamped out. The just cause of the Viet-Namese people gained a major victory.4.	In southern Asia  steps are being taken to bring about a further easing of the tension which several times in the past has led to open hostilities. It is gratifying that all three of the States on the subcontinent-India  Pakistan and Bangladesh-are involved in this process.5.	The positive changes in the situation in Europe are even more clearly apparent. The task of normalizing relations between the States of Eastern and Western Europe is virtually complete  and we hope that no one will create artificial obstacles to the completion of this process. The convening of the all-European conference'' marked the opening of a new and extremely important stage in the work of guaranteeing security and organizing peaceful co-operation on a continent-wide scale.6.	The danger of a global clash between the two world-wide social systems which would inevitably result in a terrible catastrophe for all mankind has been lessened. That is how the entire world views the Agreement between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America on the Prevention of Nuclear War   which was concluded during the visit to the United States by L. I. Brezhnev  tire General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.7.	Today  the principle of peaceful coexistence is not only recognized as the only possible basis for relations between the socialist and capitalist countries but is increasingly being given practical effect and embodied in treaties and agreements. The process of detente is a broad and deep one which is involving an increasing number of States and affecting more and more important areas of the relations between them.8.	This gives us reason to hope that  as Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev noted in a recent statement  ""the present detente is not a temporary phenomenon but the beginning of a fundamental reorientation of international relations"".9.	The changes for the better in international affairs arouse particular satisfaction in the Soviet Union. Not  of course  that other peoples are any less interested in peace than the Soviet Union  It is just that to us the increasing trend towards detente and co-operation is also confirmation of the correctness and consistency of the foreign policy pursued by the Soviet Union.10.	Peace and friendship between peoples have always been the watchword of Soviet foreign policy and its unchanging goal. That goal was defined by V. I. Lenin  the founder of the Soviet Socialist State and head of its first Government. It has been and continues to be the basis of the foreign policy guidelines laid down at all Congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Our country has taken this position under all circumstances  regardless of the configuration of the international situation. It must be clear by now to any unprejudiced person that this is the long-range  permanent policy of the Soviet Union and is not merely a response to immediate circumstances. It is determined by the very nature of our social system.11.	The shift in the course of international events in the last few years indicates clearly that ensuring a lasting peace on earth is not simply a noble but remote ideal; it is  rather a completely attainable goal of practical politics.12.	Another fact is no less obvious. The positive results that hive been achieved up to now did not come about of themselves.13.	A great deal of intensive effort has gone into the various international measures which led to detente. Sometimes the result is a treaty of agreement drawn up on a page or two of official stationery  but how much labour has gone into every article and paragraph! These agreements are generally preceded by an intensive process of feeling out  by discussions and intensive negotiations. A State visit or international conference lasting no more than a few days crowns the labour of many years.14.	Obviously  there is no Government that will not say it wants peace  lasting peace  indeed eternal peace. If such pronouncements are not to remain an idle dream  however  they must be backed up by unremitting efforts that go on day after day.15.	The Soviet Union exhorts its allies as well to follow this course. Indeed  we go beyond exhortations; acting in close co-ordination and in the light of international developments  we take concrete initiatives. At the recent Crimean meeting of leaders of the Communist and workers parties of the socialist countries  it was emphasized that all the States concerned must now join efforts in consolidating the favourable changes that have come about in international affairs  must consistently give practical effect to the treaties and agreements that have been concluded and must advance steadily towards the main objective  which is that of ensuring a lasting peace.16.	It is a secret .to no one that detente has its enemies whose resistance must not be underestimated. There is also a certain inertia to be overcome. After all  what we are trying to do is to solve problems that have built up over a period of years or even decades.17.	However  the supporters of detente are more numerous  and what matters is that their efforts should increase and not slacken.18.	In a number of capitalist countries  a trend towards broader co-operation with socialist States has emerged and is becoming increasingly apparent. Far-sighted political figures in those countries  taking a realistic  responsible view of the world situation  show a willingness to join efforts in working out solutions which give equal weight to the interests of all concerned. It goes without saying that this benefits not only the States directly concerned but the entire cause of peace.19.	Detente gives the non-aligned and neutral States a greater opportunity to exert a positive influence on international developments  A good many useful ventures  including some within the framework of the United Nations  got their start because of the political influence which these countries exercise. The results of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries at Algiers showed once again that when the Conference participants speak out in favour of detente and co-operation and against the forces of aggression and oppression of peoples  their voice is convincing and authoritative.20.	By its very nature  detente cannot simply be a matter of improving relations between a few States or certain geographical regions. If it is to become irreversible  it must be a matter of concern to all States and ultimately become universal.21.	The United Nations has 135 Member States  all of which  when they joined the Organization  assumed an obligation under the Charter to maintain international peace and security. If that entire potential for peace was translated into action  it would indeed give powerful impetus to the advance towards a reliable system of security for all peoples.22.	One sometimes hears it said that now that the Soviet Union and the United States are improving their relations and concluding important agreements which help to lessen international tension  there is nothing left for other States to do but to stand by passively. Some go further than that and try to foster the false notion that all of this damages the interests of other countries.23.	Apart from the fact that such assertions   whether intentionally or unintentionally  distort the actual state of affairs  their practical effect can only be to paralyse initiative and hamper detente.24.	Is it possible to conceive of a broader sphere in which energies can be brought to bear than that of peace? Peace offers vast scope for all countries. Every State  large or small  bears responsibility for maintaining security throughout the world. The whole question is where its policy leads to — whether it helps detente or hinders it.25.	It is important to mark out the political paths to further detente. However  it is no less important that meaningful activities should be undertaken. These efforts cannot remain shut up in government offices. They must be supported by broad  tireless work on behalf of peace by the most varied social forces. Parliamentarians and businessmen  political parties and trade-union  youth  women's and veterans' groups  scientists and artists-all can play a part if there is a determination to work for peace. Millions upon millions of people must be drawn into the movement for a lasting peace.26.	Yes  the situation in the world has definitely improved in the past year. It is incomparably better than 5 or 10 years ago. But does that mean that all is bright on the international horizon? No  not by any means.27.	In several parts of the world  the danger of war still exists. In some the guns are already speaking  while in others the finger is poised on the trigger.28.	The situation in Indo-China is still a complicated one. Military operations are now of a relatively limited nature  but tensions cannot be completely cleared away in that area unless the political settlement if fully implemented in keeping with the legitimate rights and interests of all the peoples of Indo-China.29.	The key to this lies in strict compliance by all parties to the Paris agreements on ending the war and restoring peace m Viet Nam. in respect for the agreements reached in Laos  and in permitting the people of Cambodia to settle their internal affairs as they see fit and without foreign interference.30.	True to its internationalist convictions  the Soviet Union will continue to give the necessary aid and support of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and to stand beside the patriotic forces in Indo-China.31.	Again and again we find ourselves returning to the situation in the Middle East  which  it must be stated bluntly  presents a danger because of the continuing Israeli aggression. Surely we cannot lake comfort in the fact that right now the breeding ground of war is not aflame but merely smouldering. The flames of war may shoot up at any moment  and who can say what the result will be'?32.	The aggressor seized foreign lands before the eyes of the entire world and is holding on to them by force. In doing so  he is flagrantly violating the rules of international law. One need only recall the latest acts of provocation against neighbouring Arab countries  which were just recently the object of renewed condemnation by the Security Council. Furthermore  all this is not simply a gesture of recklessness or desperation by a handful of people  but the calculated policy of the State of Israel.33.	No Arab can be made to believe that he must reconcile himself to the existing situation. The Arab States  which have been the victims of imperialist aggression  want only one thing - the restoration of what was taken from them by force -and they are right.34.	The Soviet Union remains convinced that the Middle East problem can be solved. The basis for a solution exists in the form of the well-known Security Council resolutions  which as was confirmed once again by the recent discussion of the Middle East question in the United Nations are supported by an overwhelming majority of Stales Members of our Organization. The aggressor is becoming increasingly defiant in his refusal to agree to a settlement.35.	Every effort must be made to see that Israel and the countries and circles that support its present policy understand at long last the need for a more sober approach and that they truly *et out on the path leading to a solution of the problem.36.	As far as the Soviet Union is concerned  its position is clear  the situation in the Middle East must be resolved un the basis of the complete I repeat  complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from occupied Arab territories and of respect for the independence and inalienable rights of the States and peoples of the area  including the Arab people of Palestine. Our main  decisive interest in the Middle Fast is to promote the achievement of a just and lasting peace. The Soviet Union wishes to state tins once again from tins rostrum in the most categorical terms.37.	In order to obtain a proper perspective in a situation characterized by the extreme complexity of the interplay of various factors  one must appraise events in all their fullness and constant flux. That is particularly true at the present stage of the situation  which is dynamic and full of contrasts.38.	If one views unsolved problems without reference to the positive results that have already been achieved  it is easy to take an extreme position and deny the very possibility of resolving acute  controversial issues. In our opinion  however  there is no place for this approach to international phenomena  including the activities of the United Nations.39.	Equally unproductive is the other extreme that of presenting the situation in rosy hues and failing to see that what remains to be done is far more than what has already been accomplished.40.	Both extremes are bad. All States  all Governments and all political figures must  if they are conscious of their responsibility  regard it as their first duty in (he international arena to work actively for peace.41.	A whole series of problems are clamouring for solution. It cannot be said that the United Nations is not dealing with them. It may well be asked  however  how many of them are really being solved  and the answer is not a comforting one. It must be acknowledged that some problems become harder rather than easier to solve as time goes by  but they may become even more difficult if they are put off further.42.	The problem of problems is that of the continuing arms race. The development of techniques of mass destruction and the stockpiling of weapons have long since gone beyond the point where using them becomes an absurdity  for  as V. I. Lenin foresaw half a century ago  this process is ""undermining the very conditions for the existence of human society"". It must be obvious to all how ruinous it is to go on replenishing the arsenals. Yet. only in recent years has it become possible to take the first I repeat  the first step towards limiting the arms race.43.	It would be wrong to underestimate the importance of the measures that have already been taken. These measures serve to impede to some extent the unrestrained proliferation of armaments  particularly the most destructive types.44.	Ten years have passed since the signing of the Moscow Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water  which was the first in a series of agreements. The fact that some countries have not acceded to the Treaty does not nullify the indisputable fact that it is beneficial to the peoples of the world.45.	The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  has gained wide recognition  and it has also been extremely helpful in curbing the unclear arms race.46.	Success has been achieved in preventing of the emplacement of nuclear weapons in several important natural environments  namely the sea-bed and the ocean floor and outer space. Bacteriological weapons which are among the most deadly  have been banned and eliminated.47.	 Just recently  an important frontier was crossed when  as a result of agreements reached between the Soviet Union and the United States  mutual limitations were imposed on strategic arms and principles were formulated for negotiations on further such limitations. In conjunction with the historic conclusion of the Agreement between the Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America on the Prevention of Nuclear War  these accords contribute significantly to an improvement in the international atmosphere.48.	However  further efforts are needed  and they cannot  of course  be confined to two nuclear Powers  even though those two may be militarily the mightiest in the world. We could  in particular  find it gratifying if other States were willing to adhere to the principles jointly laid down by the Soviet Union and the United States for renunciation of the use of force and decisive action to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war; that would be of exceptional importance in ensuring lasting peace throughout the world.120.	Huge sums continue to be spent for military purposes  and military planning goes on.121.	Since the United Nations first began to function  the Soviet Union has consistently sought to turn events in the direction of disarmament. We have always urged that it is of the utmost importance to ban nuclear weapons and ensure that nuclear energy is used exclusively for peaceful purposes. I might recall that back in 1946  the first year of our Organization's existence  the Soviet Union placed on the negotiating table a draft international convention to prohibit the production and employment of weapons based on the use of atomic energy for the purpose of mass destruction; it did so in the belief that the aspirations and the conscience of nations called for such a convention.122.	How much discussion there has been since that time  and how many resolutions have been adopted by the Security Council  the General Assembly and various committees and commissions! If this were not such a serious matter  one could speak sarcastically about the mountains of paper that have been used up in the process. The essential point  however  is that there has been little change in the situation.123.	It would not occur to anyone to deny that the solution of the problems of disarmament involves great difficulties. And yet the international questions which have been successfully resolved up to now also appeared forbidding at the outset. Consequently  references to objective difficulties do not reveal the main point. The crux of the matter lies in political considerations. And responsibility for political considerations rests primarily with the people who are invested with power  those who stand at the helm of government.124.	There is hardly any point in digging about in the past  in analysing all the proposals which have been made or in dwelling on the positions of individual States. All that is quite well known. The walls of the United Nations have heard many speeches on the subject of disarmament.125.	Today  however  we all have more experience in settling international problems than we had yesterday. And it suggests to us that even in the field of disarmament real progress can be achieved in some areas. All that is needed is to follow in practice a truth which in theory is certainly recognized by all: not to proclaim ""all or nothing""  but to single out one after another those problems on which agreement can be reached even at the present stage  and then solve them. Experience has shown that this approach can prove its worth even in such matters as vital to the security of the State as that ultimate weapon  the nuclear missile. Is that not demonstrated by the Soviet-American agreements dealing with that matter?126.	Neither can there be any doubt about another matter. Those agreements would not have been possible if they had put either side at a disadvantage  if the principle of equal security had not been scrupulously observed.127.	But if  on such a basis  two countries have been able to achieve a limitation of arms  then why cannot  say  five Powers act similarly  provided  of course  that there will be no threat to the security of any of them? And if that can be done  what is there to prevent such a method from being applied to a wider range of countries? The greater the number of States that participate in a practical solution of the disarmament problem  the more tangible will be the benefit for the security of all peoples.128.	Furthermore  we believe that the successes achieved on the path towards detente already make it possible for considerable additional resources to be made available to assist the developing countries.129.	In view of all these considerations  the Soviet Union wishes to propose that the question of the reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations by 10 per cent and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries should be included in the agenda of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations as an important and urgent item.130.	If our proposal meets with general agreement  and if the General Assembly adopts an appropriate resolution  a beneficial and useful step can be taken.131.	The States which are permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations are known to have the largest military budgets. This is taken into account in our proposal.132.	In our view it would be appropriate to take as the starting-point for the proposed reduction the level of military budgets for the current year  1973. That proportion of the funds made available by such a reduction which would be used to benefit the developing countries could  for example  amount to 10 per cent.133.	Needless to say  such a step would require ""the participation of all the permanent members of the SecurityCouncil without exception. It would also be desirable for other economically and militarily powerful States to reduce their military budgets.134.	We suggest that the funds made available for economic assistance to the developing countries should  first of all  be granted to those countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America which have experienced great difficulties this year because of grave natural disasters such as drought and floods.135.	The distribution of these funds should be carried out on an equitable basis. The amounts to be granted to individual countries  and the time-limits within which they are to be provided  could be determined by an international committee appointed on an ad hoc basis from among representatives of the developing countries  the States which are permanent members of the Security Council and other countries which reduce their military budgets.136.	It is obvious that the reductions in military expenditure would also benefit the States carrying out such reductions. They would be able to channel considerable funds towards the non-military needs of their own people and an improved standard of living.137.	The United Nations has laid the groundwork for fruitful activities on behalf of peace in a number of important fields.138.	Specifically  at last year's session  the General Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of the settlement of two major problems: the non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVIII]  and the question of a World Disarmament Conference [resolution 2930 (XXVII].139.	But has this clearly expressed will of the peoples of the world  this opinion of the overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations been taken into account by all States? Unfortunately  that cannot be said to be true. It is a known fact that the Governments of some States have taken a position which prevents those decisions from being put into effect.140.	The Soviet Union believes that the earliest possible implementation of the solemn declaration of the General Assembly  speaking on behalf of the members of the United Nations  concerning their renunciation of the use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons  would be an effective means of ensuring that one of the principles of the United Nations Charter was laid down as a law of international life. To that end  a forceful decision in the matter must be taken by the Security Council.43. For its part  the Soviet Union is ready to negotiate and to formalize reciprocal undertakings with all -and I stress  all — the nuclear powers on the non-use of force  including  at the same time  prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons.44. The time has come to undertake practical preparations for the convening of a World Disarmament Conference. Arrangements must finally be made so that the Special Committee provided for in the General Assembly resolution relating to preparations for that Conference can carry out the functions entrusted to it. There is no need to prove how desirable it is for all the nuclear Powers to take part in the Committee's work.145.	There are some who contend that the World Disarmament Conference could not be productive because of the large number of participants. But who ever said that complex problems must necessarily be settled by two or three States  or that a large-scale international conference will not reach agreement?146.	We harbour no illusions that the World Disarmament Conference will do away with all problems at one stroke. Let it go on for several months  or even several years. How can there be any objection to that if the Conference makes a contribution to the practical solution of urgent disarmament problems?147.	It is also argued that the Conference might hamper the efforts at solutions involving a smaller number of States. We feel that such fears are unfounded. Multilateral efforts can only help bilateral ones  and vice versa.148.	Although detente and the development of peaceful co-operation are measured  not in decades  but merely in years  into this short period of time there have been compressed events which are significantly changing the face of the world.149.	Memories are still fresh of a time when relations between the Soviet Union and the major capitalist countries were marked by tension and  in the case of some of them  by outright hostility. The fact that those times are now behind us is not welcomed by all. But all who are concerned for peace welcome the fact that those relations are now on a new track.150.	The Soviet Union and France have been dealing with each other in a consistent and serious manner for a number of years. Both countries have acquired useful experience and are using the favourable trends of detente to develop both their bilateral ties and political co-operation in international matters  and especially European matters. The Soviet Union values that important achievement.151.	The radical changes achieved by the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany in their relations demonstrate that the two States are guided not by considerations of expediency  but by the long-term interests of their peoples and the interests of peace in Europe. A spirit of realism has also prevailed in the approach of the Federal Republic of Germany to questions which had long divided it and the Polish People's Republic and the German Democratic Republic. Many obstacles to the establishment of normal relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the other socialist countries of Europe have been removed  although in the Federal Republic of Germany itself  from all indications  such a policy is not to everyone's liking. The influence of forces clinging to old  outworn policies can still be felt there even today.152. A few days ago the General Assembly congratulated the representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany  two independent sovereign States  on their countries' admission to membership in the United Nations. This is one of the most important indications of the changes which are taking place in the world. We warmly welcome the presence in this hall of the delegation of the fraternal German Democratic Republic  and we are also gratified to see here the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany.153.	It is not difficult to gauge the significance of the historic fact that the General Assembly of the United Nations  pursuant to Security Council recommendations  enthusiastically adopted the decision to admit these two States to membership in the United Nations. That fact shows merely that such a decision was long overdue. It is in keeping not only with the interests of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany  but also the interests of all States throughout the world.154.	In a mere 18 months or two years an enormous distance has been covered in relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. As a result of Soviet-American talks at the highest level — during the visit of President R. Nixon to Moscow in May of last year and the visit of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet union  Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev  to the United States this year — a firm basis has been laid for the development of relations between the two countries in a way which is fully in keeping with the principle of peaceful coexistence and which opens up vast possibilities. A number of agreements in various fields have been concluded. All these agreements have been made public; they speak for themselves. And they have not remained mere pieces of paper; much work has been done to give them concrete expression.155.	It is of fundamental importance that the improvement in Soviet-American relations is being achieved on the basis of mutual recognition of the opposition between the two States' social systems and ideologies  and on the understanding that the rapprochement between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America is directed against no one and threatens no one's interests.156.	The Soviet Union is convinced that if both sides unswervingly carry out all the obligations they have assumed  including the strict observance of a cardinal principle in international relations  that of non-interference in each other's internal affairs — a principle on which our whole approach is based-then Soviet-American relations will be a permanent favourable factor promoting international peace-a point which is of historic significance.157.	Relations between the Soviet Union and Japan are not at a standstill. The Soviet Union intends to continue to work to ensure that these relations become relations of genuine good-neighbourliness and co-operation. That is quite feasible if both countries constantly bear in mind the fundamental long-term interests of peace and security in the Far East.158.	The Soviet Union is ready to expand its relations of mutually advantageous co-operation with all countries ofEurope and the other continents which so desire  whether in the search for solutions to current international political problems  wide-ranging economic agreements  joint efforts to use the benefits of scientific and technological progress or the exchange of spiritual values.159.	On the first day of the present session of the General Assembly the second phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe began. This is a great and unprecedented endeavour. For the first time all European States  together with the United States and Canada have sat down at the same table in order jointly to determine measures that would help to assure the peoples of Europe a peaceful future for as long as can be foreseen.160.	The Soviet Union views the prospects for the work of the Conference with considerable optimism. Its participants have already to a certain extent found a common language; there are  at least  no differences between them in agreeing that the Conference faces tasks of great importance which will require business-like and constructive consideration. If such an approach prevails to the end  the participants in the Conference will be able to place their contribution to the strengthening of general peace in the scales of history with a sense of satisfaction. That will benefit not only States directly concerned with European affairs  but all peoples of the world.161.	There is a possibility of achieving a good and  in terms of its potential consequences  even a historic success as a result of the Conference. All that is necessary for this is for all participants to display a responsible and serious approach to the problems before them. Nobody should yield to the temptation to teach others how to manage their internal affairs. It must be admitted that some would like to try to impose their own internal practices on others. No  internal practices  internal laws  represent the line before the threshold of every State at which all others must stop.162.	Were we to embark on a course of imposing our own practices on other countries  whether in the field of economic life or ideology  it is probable that those who are trying to persuade us to adopt the laws .morals and customs of others would disagree. And that is understandable and justified. If States and their representatives to the United Nations tried to act in that way  none of us here would advance one step in important matters and people would  not without justification  draw an analogy between the activity of the United Nations and the Biblical legend of the Tower of Babel  where those involved ceased to understand one another and failed to complete what they had intended to build.163.	Meanwhile  some in the West are not averse to launching noisy propaganda campaigns and even to resorting to the methods of blackmail in order to cover up their own attempts to interfere in the affairs of other countries. Matters have gone so far that they are attempting to arrogate to themselves the right to dictate right and left by whom and how the question of emigration from this or that country should be handled  how many emigrants there should be and when and just where they should go. In doing so  they do not hesitate to praise to the skies those who represent no one but who  whether deliberately or inadvertently  are merely an unwitting weapon in the hands of the forces opposed to the relaxation of tension in the world.164.	The Soviet Union decisively rejects such an approach and condemns it. We will not allow anyone to interfere in our internal affairs.165.	The question that inevitably comes to mind is this: do the organizers of these campaigns seriously think that only the Soviet Union  only the socialist countries are interested in international detente and in the development of trade  scientific and technical and other forms of co-operation and that others are merely doing them a great favour by agreeing to hold talks on these matters?166.	Anyone who is interested in the slightest degree in seeing an improvement in the international situation is well aware that this is not the case  that this is a reciprocal process governed by the mutual interests of the parties concerned and  above all  by the interests of the people.167.	The main thing now is not to let the basic  truly important problems facing States be overshadowed by a poisonous atmosphere deliberately cheated over trumped-up questions.168.	The Soviet Union considers it desirable to supplement political detente in Europe by military detente. This cause may be served by yet another major undertaking by a number of States: the talks opening on 20 October 1973 on the mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in central Europe.169.	As a result of the positive changes in the international situation  it is also becoming possible to view the situation in Asia in a new light.170.	In Asian affairs  as in international affairs in general  the policy of the Soviet Union is a policy directed towards peace  security and co-operation. The Soviet Union extends its hand to any State which shares these goals. A shining example of this is the uninterrupted development of relations between the USSR and India  a great  peace-loving Asian Power. It is further demonstrated by the history of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and many other Asian countries. Our fundamental belief is that there are no problems in relations between the Soviet Union and the States of Asia which could not be solved at the negotiating table.171.	The Soviet Union is the initiator of the concept of collective security in Asia. This idea is constantly gaining strength; scepticism is being dispelled and the unfounded suspicions are disappearing.172.	In a recent speech in Alma Ata  the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  L. I. Brezhnev  said that we support collective security in Asia because ""we are seeking to eliminate war  armed conflicts and imperialist aggression on the continent of Asia; we want the conditions for unhampered development and national revival to be guaranteed every country and people; we want a spirit of trust andmutual understanding to prevail in relations between the countries of Asia"".173.	The Soviet Union is in favour of equitable participation in the system of collective security by all Asian countries  without any exception. Any intention of directing collective security in Asia against any State is totally alien to us  despite allegations to the contrary.174.	The positive changes which have recently become apparent on the Asian continent also include the emergence of new  constructive factors in the situation on the Korean peninsula and this is  first and foremost  to the credit of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. That being so  it would be all the more inadmissible for new  artificial obstacles to the peaceful and democratic unification of Korea to be added to the old forms of outside interference in the internal affairs of the Korean people.175.	There is  of course  no need to recall in detail in this Assembly the consistent support which the Soviet Union has given and continues to give to the developing States of Asia  Africa and Latin America. On more than one occasion the United Nations has been the arena for fierce political battles with colonialism of every kind  and the Soviet Union has always resolutely defended oppressed peoples and given all possible support to their struggle for national liberation.176.	We are well aware that this is a difficult and grim struggle  and some very recent events remind us yet again that it may take tragic turns.177.	In Chile  as we know  the lawful Government has been overthrown. The elected President  Salvador Allende  his country's most outstanding patriot  has been killed. The forces of reaction have struck a blow at the Chilean people's desire for true independence and freedom.178.	There was serious provocation of another Latin American State  Cuba  whose embassy and one of whose ships were fired upon. Surely the heads of the military junta realize that such acts can only be described as international brigandage and acts of aggression?179.	An anti-Soviet campaign has been stirred up in the country; there are instances of arbitrary and violent action against Soviet institutions and citizens who were sent to give friendly assistance to the Chilean people at the request of the lawful Government of the country.180.	What can one say about this? There can be no doubt that history will bring to account those who attempt to prevent the peoples from breathing the air of genuine independence or to drown in blood their right to national freedom.181.	For its part  the Soviet Government could not remain indifferent to the intolerable situation that was developing and took the decision to break off diplomatic relations with Chile  or  more precisely  with the regime of the military junta.182.	There is no doubt that the just cause of the Chilean people will triumph in the end  despite the current tragedy.183.	States which have embarked on the course of political independence have always found and will continue to find in the Soviet Union a friend ready to aid them in consolidating their economic self-sufficiency  to share its knowledge and experience and to assist them in their moments of difficulty. Expansion of co-operation with developing countries is an integral part of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union.184.	It is our conviction that the relaxation of international tension is conducive to a situation where young States can  in peace  devote all their efforts and resources to economic and social progress  to raising the living standards of their people  and to shaping their own future without fear of outside interference.185.	The healthier the over-all world atmosphere becomes  the more anachronistic are the remaining vestiges of colonialism and the reserves of apartheid and racial discrimination  the stronger is the condemnation they merit and the more vigorous must be the struggle to bring about their complete elimination. It is the clear duty of the United Nations to contribute to the speediest possible elimination of these shameful survivals of colonialism wherever they still exist  be it in Angola or Mozambique  Bissau or Southern Rhodesia  South or South-West Africa.186.	It is our aim that the voice of the fighters should be clearly heard here  within the walls of the United Nations  that the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples adopted by the fifteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly [resolution 1514 (XV)] should be fully implemented and that the racists and colonialists should be finally deprived of the opportunity to receive support from outside  in particular from certain Member countries of the United Nations  something which is still a feature of current international life.187.	Those who struggle against colonialism and racism for their national liberation and for their inalienable human rights and dignity enjoy the unwavering support of the Soviet Union. Let there be no doubt that the Soviet Union will continue to do its utmost to ensure that this struggle ends in a decisive victory.188.	In the struggle for peace  the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community are one with the developing States and we value this highly. With some of these countries we have well established relations; with others  relations are only now beginning to develop. But apart from this  the platform of the struggle for further detente offers ever-greater opportunities for co-operation. We believe that the fullest possible advantage should be taken of them.189.	Throughout its history  the United Nations has operated in varying political weather  and so far the fine days have been far fewer than the bad ones. What has enabled it not merely to survive but also to do many useful things? The fact that it was founded for the purpose of maintaining international peace. And this task remains permanently relevant. From another point of view  the United Nations Charter contains adequate provisions for the fulfilment of the Organization's lofty mission. TheUnited Nations has demonstrated its strength in those cases where the purposes and principles of its Charter have been strictly observed  and its weakness when departures from the Charter have been permitted. What matters is that this world Organization should remain in the mainstream of international politics  contributing to the solution of crucial problems.190.	This does not in any way imply that the Soviet Union is inclined to neglect even one aspect of the diversified activities of the United Nations  whether of an economic  social  cultural or humanitarian nature. It actively assists in putting into practice everything of value-1 repeat  everything of value — that the collective wisdom and experience of States can produce.191.	Indeed  a few days ago  the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR ratified two important international legal instruments pertaining to respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms and the protection of human dignity and the interests of society as a whole. These documents were carefully and thoroughly elaborated in United Nations bodies and were subsequently approved by the General Assembly. I am referring to the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI)  annex] and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [ibid.]. These two Covenants do not merely contain wishes or recommendations of a declaratory nature  but provide for quite specific obligations on the part of States parties to them. We appeal to countries which have not yet signed or ratified these Covenants to follow our example and to take steps to ensure that they come into force as soon as possible.192.	The peoples of the world expect from the United Nations measures which will contribute to a further improvement in the international situation. With favourable changes taking place in the world  opportunities are increasing for the United Nations to make its own  major contribution to the consolidation of detente and to making it stable and irreversible.193.	For its part  the Soviet Union is sparing no effort for the triumph of the cause of peace on earth. This is the essence of its peace-loving policy and its peace programme  launched by the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Every State  every statesman can be confident that he will continue to find in the Soviet Union a faithful partner at all times and in all cases where action is taken to prevent the danger of war and contribute to peace."
"98",5984,"RWA",28,1973,"﻿104.	Sir  your election to the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly constitutes a resounding tribute to your brilliant qualities as an enlightened politician and diplomat in whom the sense of duty yields nothing to that of compromise and moderation. Such qualities  combined with long experience in. international affairs  are guarantees of the full success that will crown the work of the present session under your presidency. In addition to greeting you  my delegation wishes to greet Ecuador  that noble country of which you are a worthy son  a country that is honoured by a very old humanist tradition  like the rest of the Latin American hemisphere  of which it is a part and which shares with our African continent the vibrant accents of joie de vivre  of warm welcome and hospitality as well as of faith in the future and the will to action.105.	Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski rendered great service to the international Organization by the remarkable manner in which he presided over the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. His sense of equity  his absolute respect for divergent opinions  his desire for efficiency and his lofty views have won him the esteem of us all.106.	My delegation wishes at the same time to reiterate its high appreciation and renew its full support to the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose outstanding courage and dynamism combined with his unshakable faith in this Organization will make of it  we are convinced  a more effective instrument for safeguarding international peace and security  so dear to us all.107.	Rwanda  moreover  is very happy to extend a very warm welcome into the concert of nations to the new Member States.108.	Among them we see the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic  two States which  we hope  will one day again become one nation  the great and noble German nation  the fatherland not only of Goethe  Beethoven  Kant  Leibnitz  Marx and so many other illustrious persons who have made of Germany one of the greatest centres of culture and civilization  but also the fatherland of Count von Goetzen  that resolute and strong-willed young man who on 2 May 1894 crossed the Kagera upstream from Ruvubu and built a bridge between Rwanda and his own country that still exists. The admission to our Organization of that Germany  which is today reconciled with itself and has recovered its grandeur and to which we are tied by so many historic links and fruitful co-operation  gives us the greatest pleasure and satisfaction.109.	Each year at the same time the community of nations gathers together to consider its fate: to take stock of the past and to establish its programme for the future. Such an examination  if it is objective  must be placed over and above the elegance of style and language which at times  regrettably  is no more than a mask for ulterior motives  and must be focused closely on the realities of our time.110.	It would be idle for me to repeat here that when we assess the successes and failures of the international Organization  we must first of all convince ourselves that it can be no more than what its Member States wish it to be. In fact  their degree of loyalty to the objectives laid down in the Charter must be the only yardstick to which we can refer to assess its effectiveness.111.	The preamble shows us that  after the indescribable sufferings engendered by two world wars in the space of one generation  the main concern that dominated the gathering in San Francisco in 1945 was precisely to preserve future generations from other  similar catastrophes  by establishing a structure of peace and collective security founded principally on the spirit of tolerance and good neighbourliness  the sovereign equality of States  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  unconditional respect for human rights  non-recourse to force  and the peaceful settlement of disputes  as well as international economic and social co-operation.112.	A cursory glance at the present state of international relations entitles us  happily  to assert that the current session begins in a climate of detente and more resolute co-operation among States. It may be recalled that the climate of understanding-from which certain ulterior motives were not absent-which reigned at the time of the signature of the Charter was followed by a whole series of discouraging events for mankind  dominated mainly by the cold war between the Powers possessing weapons of mass destruction  many hotbeds of tension in the world  and regional wars here and there on almost all continents.113.	Without allowing ourselves to be blinded by foolish optimism  we must congratulate ourselves on seeing today an ever greater abandonment of the recourse to force in international relations and the birth of a process of appeal to negotiation as a means for settling conflicts  and greater co-operation among States in several areas  especially the economic  cultural and technical areas. This new physiognomy of international relations accounts for an attitude of renewal on the part of Member States which prompts them increasingly to adjust their conduct to the principles laid down in the Charter.114.	It is in accordance with the same principles that Rwanda  for its part  intends to define and apply its policy  both internal and international.115.	Although it is true that we step into the future with our burden of the past  the Rwanda of today is not the feudal Rwanda explored by Count Goetzen in 1894  nor that colonized country which ceased to be a colony on 1 July 1962 and which was succeeded by the country which  after many changes  is the one I represent today. It is a changed and new Rwanda which seeks jealously to defend the fundamental freedoms of its people  as well as its national sovereignty. Everyone knows that national sovereignty and the rights of citizens — which are never served on a gold or silver platter but almost always in difficult conditions fraught with suffering and heroic struggle-are also preserved with difficulty  for they are continuously threatened by many enemies  among them imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism  the greed of leaders who unscrupulously exploit their people  and by under-development with its sequel of misery  ignorance and disease.116.	It was precisely to consolidate that national sovereignty  threatened as it was on the inside by a group of leaders who hatched a diabolical plot for the division and devastation of the country  and to ensure for each Rwandan citizen or foreigner living in our country the free exercise of the fundamental freedoms of the human person  that on 5 July 1973  the High Command of the National Army  under its brave and courageous leader  Major-General Habyarimana Juvenal  President of the Republic and Chairman of the Committee for Peace and National Unity  took the major decision to take  the fate of the nation into its hands.117.	The events of 5 July 1973 were ineluctably inscribed in the very logic of affairs  for the famous words of Georges Clemenceau had found their field of application:""It is absolutely impossible for a man in power not to yield one day to the forces of disruption. The very best minds sooner or later have to confront circumstances where the advantages of the unknown outweigh the adversities of life's changing fortunes.""It is neither the forces of disruption alone  nor the many advantages of the unknown in the adversities of fortune  but also that neo-colonialist conspiracy of destruction and national devastation which decided the position to be taken in such hard circumstances.118.	The accession of the country to independence  with the weight of the responsibility stemming from and the many needs which a poor country like ours must face up to  very soon stifled the impulse of our best leaders in the past who  lacking the imagination to find the solutions demanded by circumstances  found refuge behind the facile policy of ""divide and rule""  and division by the cynical promotion of hatred  tribal and racial struggles  regional divisions elevated to the rank of doctrine and by mobilizing national public opinion against the menacing spectre of an imaginary enemy  in this case the neighbouring sister States of Uganda and Burundi. Such an attitude ran counter to the very principles of this Organization and of the Organization of African Unity. The person who incarnated the State  short of being a god  had become a true myth. As was said by an Arab philosopher  Ibn Khaldun:""Men always regard the man who has subdued and dominated them as a higher being. Inspired by a reverential fear of him  they see in him every perfection  or they attribute perfection to him so that they will not have to admit that they were subjected by perfectly ordinary means.""While this was the general attitude of the average citizen  there were many enlightened men in the retinue of the Prince who were aware of the dictum of Pascal:""To say the truth is useful to the person one says it to  but disadvantageous to whoever speaks it because it earns him hatred; those who live with princes love their interest better than the prince they serve; and they will not give him anything if it is harmful to themselves.""As Abraham Lincoln said  ""You can fool all of the people some of the time  and some of the people all of the time  but you cannot fool all the people all of the time.""119.	Corruption and intrigue in the entourage of the old leader fatally would lead to the fall of that government and the birth of a new generation desirous of saving the nation and consolidating the peace and unity of the country. The national forces of security  under the peaceful guidance of the valiant leader  Major-General Habyarimana Juvenal  President of the Republic and Chairman of the Committee for Peace and National Unity  took the fate of the country into their own hands without bloodshed and proclaimed the advent of the Second Republic. To bring back peace and internal unity  to re-establish good relations with neighbouring and sisterly States  to strengthen understanding and economic and social co-operation with all nations  to co-operate with the international organizations  to support the just and legitimate struggle of the national liberation movements  this is the challenge of the new Rwandese Republic.120.	But while Rwanda wants peace and proclaims respect for the rights and fundamental freedoms of its people  it wants other people to enjoy the same rights and freedoms.121.	Members are no doubt aware of our grave concern at the anachronistic and explosive situation prevailing in southern Africa  where the law of the jungle and that of the strongest have replaced the law of nature  which  in fact  compels men to live together in peace. It is humiliating to see the human condition of the African trampled underfoot on his own African soil.122.	In Angola  Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau  Portugal brings death and desolation. Recently  the Government of Lisbon became guilty of unprecedented genocide by proceeding to the systematic extermination of peaceful and innocent Mozambican populations because they merely expressed aloud their desire for self-determination.123.	In Southern Rhodesia  Ian Smith has established a pseudo-government under the complacent eye of the United Kingdom  which in the eyes of my Government is solely and fully responsible for the situation prevailing in that African territory. In South Africa -the authorities of Pretoria have relegated to second place the imperatives of universal morality by establishing racism and apartheid as the religion of the State. In Namibia  the same Government of Pretoria continues to exercise an unlawful authority  illegitimate and illegal because that Territory has been repeatedly declared to have been placed under the authority of the United Nations and it is the right of that people to march towards self-determination and independence.124.	The sad triple alliance between Lisbon  Salisbury and Pretoria continues scornfully to trample underfoot the relevant resolutions of the international Organization and to create on the African continent the last vestiges of militant imperialist resistance. It is also regrettable that certain States Members of this Organization  among them the NATO group  should fail to comply with the complete embargo placed on the supply of weapons to those three countries  thus sanctioning the immoral causes for whose defence those weapons are destined.125.	The Governments of Pretoria  Salisbury and Lisbon attempt to justify their monstrous crimes by claiming that they are fighting against subversion and insurrection. In so doing  they forget that  as so rightly was said by Condorcet: ""Insurrection is the last resort of oppressed peoples; it is a sacred duty when there is no other means of saving oneself'. It is useful to recall  as was so rightly said by Mao Tse-tung: ""In the fight for complete liberation  the oppressed peoples rely first of all on their own struggle and then  and only then  on international assistance. The people who have triumphed in their own revolution should help those still struggling for liberation"".  In sacrificing themselves for their people the vanguard of the liberation movements will have found death for a noble cause. It is true that men are mortal  but the death of African martyrs for the liberation of their peoples carries more weight than the highest of mountains.126.	It is high time that the international community should find ways and means of improving the explosive situation in southern Africa  but the situation is no better in the Middle East.127.	After six days of war which led to the present situation  six years of ""no war  no peace"" have elapsed. Rwanda recommends strong measures to arrive at a climate of peace in that area and is profoundly convinced that the only valid solution to that conflict  which has thrown so many families into mourning and created so many orphans  lies in the integral application of Security Council resolution 242(1967) and in sincere negotiations among the parties concerned. My country condemns categorically all annexation of territory by force  by whatever Power.128.	If peace has not yet entirely come to Indo-China  Rwanda is however gratified at the Paris agreements which crowned the laborious negotiations begun there and put an end to a long and cruel war in Viet-Nam. May those agreements become a reality and serve as an example to solve the acute problems existing in other neighbouring territories. The problem of Cambodia is of concern to us. A nation must decide its future  if necessary by force; it also has the right freely to choose its leaders and the system that is best suited to it.129.	I cannot pass over in silence the question of Korea  all the more so since the international Organization has been closely associated with its development. As a representative of a country which maintains normal diplomatic relations with the two political entities of the Korean nation  I am in an even better position to express our satisfaction with the fact that the two Koreas themselves have opened a process of rapprochement without pressures or external interference. We congratulate them and encourage them to persevere in that path  the only one  far from the sound of battle  that can lead to peace between their two States and to the happiness of the Korean people as a whole.130.	A desperate political situation nourishes man's imagination and sometimes inspires him with solutions which are original but often rich in disastrous consequences. That in our eyes is the fundamental explanation of what today is called international terrorism.131.	At the twenty-seventh session from this high rostrum the delegation of my country did not fail to condemn most categorically that form of piracy sui generis of modern times. Our conscience;  unless it is obscured by passion  cannot remain silent in face of the cries of those defenceless innocents who frequently die under the rubble of hijacked planes; no human being can close his ears to the atrocious sufferings that Portugal  South Africa and the Ian Smith clique impose daily on the populations of southern Africa. My Government condemns such practices that are equally terroristic and incompatible with universal morality. We should like to repeat that in our country the end does not justify the means and it is not enough for a cause to be just for it to be necessarily justified to the extent that every possible means may be used to defend it.132.	Would the granting of independence to colonial peoples  the extinction of points of hot and cold war and the abolition of international terrorism be enough to give mankind hope for the future unless States at last realize that they must abandon the old adage ""he who wants peace prepares for war""?133.	Undoubtedly we must congratulate ourselves on the trend we see emerging in the world towards the settlement of conflicts by negotiation and not by force  but this is no more than a trend and the reality is that the infernal spiral of armaments on which States have embarked is far from being halted. Each year billions of dollars are earmarked for armaments and for the payment of experts in that field. Is this not a genuine misappropriation of the fruits of the labours of mankind  which should be used for his development but are used for absolutely negative purposes which may destroy the whole human race?134.	Man must become aware of this anguishing reality and sheathe the sword of Damocles which is suspended over the head of the whole human species.135.	Disarmament? Yes. As the most disarmed country in the world  our weakness commands us to propose it; as the most undeveloped country  our poverty inspires us to request those who have a surplus of material means to stop their arms race and to turn those enormous resources wasted in preparing the destruction of our planet towards more humanitarian uses which would help to close the gap between the wealth of the rich countries and the poverty of the under-equipped countries.136.	The developing countries  among them my own  encounter many obstacles in seeking to ensure the development of their economies. In fact  in most of these countries the economic structures that were established by the colonial Powers were laid down solely in their own interests. It is undeniable that colonialism is one of the major causes of under-development  since  as Yves Lacoste has said ""The dissemination of modern economy throughout the world is not based on relatively equitable economic exchanges but is closely linked with the establishment of direct or indirect political domination. The exclusive system was for a long time the codified expression of the old colonial pact  which  although abolished in law at the end of the nineteenth century  has not in fact disappeared Transformed into a servant  the colony had to supply what the metropolitan country could not or did not wish to produce  and could only trade with the metropolitan country. Such a division of labour had the effect of reserving the benefits and rights to the colonizers  the losses  duties and obligations being supported by the colonized.""137.	The old colonies have today become for the most part sovereign States and Members of this Organization  but they have not altogether recovered their economic independence. And we must say  as Diderot said two centuries ago  that ""what is intolerable is not to have slaves  but to have slaves and to call them citizens"".138.	The political independence of the developing countries will not be fully achieved  therefore  until those countries once again become masters of their own economies and can talk on a footing of equality with the developed countries. The third world possesses enormous natural resources which could justify such claims. Unfortunately thus far the raw materials exported by those countries do not get a fair price in international markets  which are still controlled almost entirely by the industrialized countries. And yet  ironically enough  it is those same raw materials that are used to manufacture the finished or semi-finished goods which are then imported by the developing countries. The prices of those products are very high  vis-à-vis the earnings derived from the sale of raw materials  and the developing countries are therefore faced with a chronic deterioration in their terms of trade. Moreover  the manipulations of international exchange rates by the rich countries aggravate further this already alarming situation. The important Fourth Conference of Heads of State and Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Algiers from 2 to 9 September 1973  tackled these  problems with anxiety. The time has come for the members of that movement to agree on solutions to these problems.139.	Moreover  in a number of developing countries the gap between the demographic growth and the economic development is so great that we are bound to consider that some of these countries are heading for a catastrophe. In my own country  for example  the annual rate of population growth is 3 per cent; that population has already attained 3 896 000 persons in a small continental territory where the annual income per capita and volume of investments is one of the lowest in the world. Unless there is greater international solidarity  my country  like manyothers sharing these same problems  will reach a critical stage in the near future. But all these difficulties must not hinder our freedom of choice in the assistance we request. It is in this context that the President of the Republic of Rwanda  His Excellency Major-General Habyarimana Juvenal  clearly laid down the orientation of our policy vis-à-vis foreign aid in his address of 1 August 1973  on his programme. He said:""The economic progress and even the stability of production conditions cannot be maintained and confirmed without a sustained effort to provide appropriate vocational training in all fields and at all levels. That vocational training must be truly carried out in a conscientious  active and concrete manner. The Government will count on the goodwill of its main leaders and the cadres of technical assistance for the realization of this primary objective. The Government attaches particular importance to having foreign technical assistance really benefit Rwanda and its people through the material realization of the projects undertaken and the true enhancing of the technical qualifications of our nationals who co-operate with foreign experts within these programmes. It would1 be essential at the end of each mission for Rwandese counterparts to be able not only to continue without difficulty the projects undertaken but even to acquire the necessary technical knowledge to ensure that they themselves can assume responsibility for subsequent extension of those projects. Control over the effective realization of assistance must be carried out in a more serious manner. The same goes for the co-ordination and the management of the assistance. To ensure the envisaged development programme  the Government will need even greater assistance from friendly countries and regional and international organizations.""140.	In the same context  Rwanda wishes to express its profound sympathy with the sister African countries bordering on the Sahara desert which have been cruelly struck by the scourge of drought. It expresses its sincere thanks to all the African countries and those other countries and international organizations which  in an effort of human solidarity  have come to their assistance. For its part  it has made its own effective contribution within the limits of its possibilities.141.	In science and technology  man has progressively become the master of the depths of the seas and outer space  which daily become more familiar to him. Natural under-water reserves and the enormous possibilities that may be opened up by the use of solar rays are increasing the common heritage of mankind. It is believed that the planet earth can  theoretically at least  ensure the subsistence of 15 000 to 20 000 million persons and that the world population increase would only be dangerous if resources failed to increase at the same rate. But the population is increasing enormously  and never thus far has the world run as many risks as today. It has never been so difficult to foresee the future. In fact the world population increase  which was relatively slow in past centuries  has accelerated since the beginning of the twentieth century. For many centuries the average rate of growth was lower than 0.3 per cent. It was 0.5 per cent towards the end of the 19th century. It rose to 1 per cent in 1940. It is at present estimated at 2 per cent. Strict deduction shows that more than 300 000 years were necessary for the world to be peopled by 3 000 million persons; the doubling of that figure will take only 30 years. The figure of 3 000 million was reached in 1960  and it is estimated that in 1962 alone the World population grew by 63 million.142.	Now  the developing countries alone encompass 2 400 million persons  that is to say  three-quarters of mankind  but they unfortunately possess only 15 per cent of the world's revenues.143.	Rwanda sincerely hopes that in the exploitation of the new resources of the sea-bed and the ocean floor and the utilization of the possibilities of the cosmos for economic and social purposes there will be no room for unconscionable contracts which will bind the third world  already so poor and highly exploited  to a material situation of no return.144.	The material construction of a world without frontiers progresses with gigantic steps. Means of communication are so perfected today that a banal event that takes place anywhere in the world is simultaneously known by all. But  despite this physical rapprochement between men  national selfishness still sows warfare for conquest or preservation of spheres of influence; races try to exterminate other races in the name of the law of numbers or of the sword; the provocative luxury of the industrialized world exists arrogantly side-by-side with the deep material poverty of the third-world countries.145.	If man has already eliminated some of the obstacles that have arisen in the way of his progress  there are still many over which he has not yet triumphed; the most important of these is the estrangement between the rich and the poor countries.146.	The United Nations has been and continues to be for my country not only a body to which the Charter attributes a number of responsibilities in the interests of mankind but also a privileged place for the exchange of experiences which may bring about the creation of a deeper understanding of our common destinies. My Government hopes that this Organization will receive the full and unconditional support of all Member States. It sincerely hopes that in this international Organization the group of non-aligned countries  representing over three-quarters of mankind  will adopt a more coherent position and a more effective strategy in order to strengthen the role and effectiveness of the Organization  which to us is the ideal framework for the harmonization of all international relations.147.	Rwanda proclaims once again its faith in the international Organization and its unconditional loyalty to the work designed to base all relations between States and individuals on sincere negotiations."
"99",6030,"SAU",28,1973,"﻿In the name of God  the merciful and compassionate.5.	It is indeed a pleasure and privilege to express to you  Sir  on behalf of the delegation of Saudi Arabia  my whole-hearted congratulations on your election to the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. As you hail from Latin America  I cannot but refer with pride to the kinship between the Arabs and the people of Latin America on account of the common culture that flourished in Andalusia prior to the discovery of the new world.6.	It is fitting that I should recall the efficiency and dignity with which your predecessor  Mr. Trepczynski  presided over the last session of the General Assembly.7.	It also behoves me to pay a tribute to our Secretary- General  Mr. Waldheim  not only for his dedication to the purposes and principles of the Charter  but also for his unremitting efforts to establish direct contacts with many leaders of the States Members of this Organization.8.	Notwithstanding the apparent detente which continues to prevail amongst the super-Powers  the established spheres of influence amongst them in many regions of the world still hamper serious endeavours to find just solutions for major problems besetting this Organization.9.	His Majesty King Faisal ibn Abdul Aziz has repeatedly declared since 1947  when the partition of Palestine was wantonly effected at Lake Success  that no peace without justice could be secured in the Middle East.10.	Year after year we have  with other Arab and Moslem leaders throughout the world  made abundantly clear our position that so long as the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people are not restored and so long as the Holy Places in Jerusalem  sacred to Moslems and Christians alike  are usurped by the Zionists  turmoil in our region may inadvertently trigger a world conflict.11.	Zionism has insidiously permeated the socio-political systems of all the countries where it has been allowed to thrive. Furthermore  Zionism has brought pressure to bear on certain Powers to open the gates of immigration for the ingathering of as many Jews as it has been able to indoctrinate by deluding them into believing that Palestine was their ancient homeland. All this is happening to the detriment of the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people and renders this problem more insoluble than ever. It is a well-known fact that the Zionists control and manipulate the mass media of information in many countries of the world.12.	It seems that the establishment of Israel in the heart of the Arab world was for the purpose of serving the interests of the major Powers  regardless of the fact that those Powers  by establishing that State  flouted the principle of self-determination which is enshrined in the Charter. We would like to ask the major Powers which claim to have vital interests in our region whether they are so afraid of subversive Zionists in their respective countries that they do not dare to influence the leaders of that artificial State they created to come to reason and recognize that they are playing with fire which may set the whole world aflame. Do not the major Powers which claim to have multifarious interests in the Middle East understand that the people of the whole Arab world are in political ferment  the cumulative effect of which may one day push them to the point of no return  where common interests might be swept away by the winds of regrettable hatred and a desire to revenge the tragedy that has been perpetrated on them at large? Or is it that the leaders of major and smaller States have learned hardly anything from the mistakes of the past  such as those that were committed at the Versailles Conference after the First World War?13.	It is high time that wisdom should prevail  lest dangerous situations in various parts of the world  and especially in the Middle East  further deteriorate  beyond repair. Therefore  we should not be carried away by what might be called the euphoria of detente among the major Powers so long as those Powers continue to play their antiquated game with the destiny of oppressed peoples  whether they are to be found in Asia  Africa or other parts of the world.14.	We decry racial discrimination no less than we do the colonial oppression of peoples.15.	Developing countries cannot thrive so long as the spectre of fear forces them to spend huge sums on armaments and thereby enrich the merchants of death who manufacture their lethal wares in the highly industrialized countries. Even the industrialized countries themselves are becoming insolvent by squandering a large portion of their revenues on the instruments of war. How paradoxical it is that these highly industrialized countries claim that they are the world leaders of civilization and the promoters of a better way of life while their leaders spend the substance of the taxpayer on lethal weapons that could  by miscalculation  bring an end to the human species on this planet.16. Hence  it becomes understandable why rampant inflation has spread like an epidemic in most parts of the world. These major Powers  and those who ape them  are spending astronomical sums  well beyond their means  on diabolical weapons in the name of self-defence  which quite often is a camouflage for waging wars to serve spurious national interests.17.	We are indeed at the cross-ways of either opting for the establishment of justice as defined in our Charter or' surrendering to despair which  inevitably  will push all of us into the chasm of destruction.18.	Last but not least  I would be remiss were I to keep silent about the policy of my Government regarding the question of energy  especially since much of what has been disseminated about this question in the international press and other mass media of information has quite often distorted the truth. In spite of the fact that the question of energy is within the scope of our domestic jurisdiction  nevertheless it would be appropriate to state that His Majesty King Faisal has defined the guidelines which shape the policy of Saudi Arabia concerning oil production. His Majesty's last declaration on this subject is self-evident and constitutes our policy. I hardly need repeat what His Majesty made clear pertaining to the question of oil  as all he actually said has already been quoted by the various mass media of information.19.	Finally  I pray God to inspire all of us to do what is just so that true peace may prevail in this troubled world."
"100",6066,"SDN",28,1973,"﻿194.	Mr. President  your opening remarks [2117th meeting] were worthy of the civilization you represent. The ethical and legal principles on which that civilization is based are today's most needed commodity. It was refreshing to hear you present your views in the light of those principles. It was about time we all did. Those principles are flouted by many every so often — in the name of national interest sometimes  in the name of self-defence at other times  and many other times out of wooden logic. All have paid you compliments. I sincerely join them.195.	Ours is one of those periods in history which you have so aptly depicted as ""stormy periods when [man] can find no haven in which to pitch his tent"" [2117th meeting  para. 93]. The problems holding man by the scruff of the neck  enumerated by speakers before me  give authenticity to this view and corroborate the vision you put to us. I crave your indulgence and that of my colleagues to sound as grave as I do. I have my reasons.196.	Recently I accompanied my President on a tour of some western and northern African countries. We have not been to all the drought-stricken areas; we have been to some and as near as a person could be to the others. The experience was unwholesome. Never before have I felt the need for international co-operation. The misery of famine and disease one could visualize from world press reports and photographs. What struck more was the scanty relief given by the world. Valiant Nigeria  among many other African countries  offered all it could in the way of airport space and labour; but the use the world community made of the facilities at its disposal was depressing. I saw a solitary cargo aircraft waiting to be used  while hundreds of people in Africa were turned into fainting forms.197.	What I heard from Africans nearer the misery and suffering was to do with the present. The tales were distressing; they left me with a dismal feeling. In this age that prides itself on its technological achievements  that part of the world is in for an even worse predicament. It is not the short-term problem of relieving the stricken but the urgent need for long-term ecological strategies that seemed to disturb the peoples of the region. How to reduce and eventually eliminate future droughts?198.	It is not only the periphery of West African Sahara; it is also the area lying between Senegal in the west and Ethiopia and Somalia in the east  some 4 000 miles. The Sahara  after all  is a creation of uncontrolled natural forces; left unchecked  it may extend farther south. Superior intellects have warned us before  but we did not heed their words. C. P. Snow was one of them. Long ago he put the poverty problem in plain everyday words:""We know it is happening. We see people starving before they die. We know they are going to die. We know so much and do so little. We draw what in England we call curtains  and we try to make an enclave of our own.""199.	Professor Prosierman will not go the same way of the late Sir Charles Snow — I hope. He reckons that over the coming 12 months between 10 and 30 million additional deaths in Africa and Asia might occur because of starvation and because of disease rendered fatal by malnutrition. He goes further and marks the egotism of the countries which can do something to avert the oncoming disaster and says:""America's garbage over the next year will contain a large enough amount of thrown-away food to prevent a significant proportion of the famine deaths that will otherwise occur in Asia and Africa.""200.	The situation is one of tragic pauperdom on one side and insolent surfeit on the other. The poor nations in question are 2 billion people who lose 25 per cent of their children before their fifth day; 800 million of them live on the equivalent of 35 cents a day.201.	The problem is no longer one of inequities and inequalities. It is becoming a threat to the very fabric of human society. Edgar Faure  in his brilliant introduction to the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization report on education — the first international survey of the geography of ignorance — has put it sc ably:""The great changes of our time are imperilling the unity and the future of the species  and man's own identity as well. What is to be feared is not only the painful prospect of grievous inequalities  privations and suffering  but also that we may be heading for a veritable dichotomy within the human race  which risks being split into superior and inferior groups  into masters and slaves  supermen and submen. Among the risks resulting from this situation would be not only those of conflict and other disasters (for present-day means of mass destruction might well fall into the hands of destitute and rebellious groups) but the fundamental risk of dehumanisation. affecting privileged and oppressed alike. For the harm done to man's nature would harm all men."" 202.	There is need for a mental revolution  a revolution that defies the origins of contemporary social and political thought. The poor of the world  some 800 million of them  cannot be wildly interested in peace in the world  which preoccupies the big Powers. They own nothing to lose; they arc unaware of this preoccupation of some of us here. Detente  dialogue and accommodation are but vacuous utterances. The poor nations are not cynical  but how can a skeleton of a man have the wits to be bothered about anything but a bowl of rice and a calabash of water. On the contrary  even an empty stomach can be a menace without knowing  a factor of instability at home and abroad. Indeed  it was as early as 1912 when Woodrow Wilson said — and right here in New York — that no one can worship God or love his neighbour on an empty stomach.203.	One cannot escape the feeling that a considerable part of the food crisis is largely artificial. It is ironic indeed that extensive means for production of food are at our call while people die of hunger and fall victims to prolonged droughts. We in the developing world have generous potentialities that could lend a hand to the combat of hunger beyond the limits of the boundaries of under-development. This potential has not yet been exploited  save certain partial efforts. The example of my own country is striking in this respect. The arable land in the Sudan is estimated at about 50 million hectares  but only 6 million hectares have been developed. Some would perhaps wish us to accept penury and pestilence  in the best Malthusian tradition  as a destiny that must visit the human race.204.	It is in this sense that we note with interest the call for a world food conference in 1974. This call tallies well with the resolve of the developing countries  as expounded in the decisions of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973 to convene a world meeting on food and trade.205.	The proletarian nations of the world  exhausted by monstrously frequent internal upheavals  can well join the President of this Assembly in saying:""With few exceptions  the industrialized countries amassed their wealth as true colonial or neo-colonialPowers. In one way or another  they rely upon exploiting the natural resources of the less developed countries —  whether or not they were politically independent — since they provided cheap raw materials in return for costly manufactured goods."" [2117th meeting  para. 84.]That is a truism  and one hopes that none of us will be driven to bickering and recrimination.206.	But let us not forget that in our world progress and the well-being of man are not segregated variables; they are an integral part of world peace and international tranquillity. That is not only an incontrovertible proposition; it is a peremptory truth. History points to that with an infinity of examples. So we need peace to develop  to make progress and possibly to surpass ourselves. In our clamour for peace and liberty we are neither trouble-makers nor ""noisy riders of great causes""  as some would like to think. We are plain and simple fighters for the reconquest of our independence and the affirmation of our dignity  and this we do at a very heavy cost in life and property. Nobody knows that better than people who are conversant with Africa's past and present.207.	It is in that spirit that I now turn to some events in Africa and the Middle East in this year that marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.208.	The happenings in the Middle East cannot help anybody who is pondering over a formula for restoring peace and stability. I shall deal briefly with three developments that have started to vitiate the air  and even more so since the Security Council's special meetings in June 1973.209.	First  I would mention the irresponsible talk about occupying the oilfields in the area. It may be loose talk  but it is widespread. We have recently been hearing and reading about an Israeli professor who declared that his country might occupy Kuwait  there being no force capable of standing up to Israeli power. Senator Fulbright must have sensed the folly prevailing when he indicated that it was not unlikely that the United States might go out to control the oilfields through Israel  a militantly potent surrogate. What gives credibility to that sort of plan is Israel's view of itself  brazenly put to American television audiences by Mr. Teddy Kollek in 1967: ""You are supporting Israel"" — he said — ""only because it is in your self-interest to do so and not because you are doing us any favour"". One trusts that these voices of insanity will be silenced in time  good time. Let loose  they are not unlikely to get their way. If they do. that ""will make Viet-Nam look like a picnic""  to use the words of Elmer Bennet.210.	Second  in spite of all pleas to Israel not to change the face of the land and implement the policy of ""creating facts""  Israel is planning a $375 million scheme to develop the West Bank — ""develop"" being a euphemism for ""annex"". The Israel Land Authority says it will acquire land on the West Bank and in Gaza for new Jewish settlements. It is worth noting that since 1967 some 4 000 Israelis have been settled in territories occupied then. The present plan is to bring in a further 10.000 Jews by the end of the four-year scheme. The idea is prompted by the race for power inside Israel  and not because of any tender-heartedness about the Jews living outside Israel.211.	With that in his mind and in his heart  Mr. Ariel Eliav commented at the last meeting of the Israeli Labour Party:""... this programme is brought before us with the lashing of the whip of time and the scourge of haste and panic. There are many in this land whose souls weep in silence because of this document. I will be the voice of the ideological Jewry of silence and never  at any price or in any form  will I ever vote for the document.""Such emotions did not appeal to the Prime Minister and the most eligible contenders to the throne  and Eliav had to be chided and pilloried for entertaining such sentiments.""I have lived through 50 years of political activities"" —  the Prime Minister said to him — ""and never before have we had a comrade who set himself up as a Messiah.""The Israel Land Authority  she went on to say  ""will acquire land by every effective means"". Benjamin Disraeli must have been the mentor. ""Damn your principles. Follow your Party""  he once said.212.	In 10 years there will be a different Jerusalem. The sane Israelis can take it or leave it  and the world will have to lump it  along with statements like that made on 3 October  and right here from this rostrum  that Israel's policy ""is not unilateral annexation"" [2139th meeting  para. 79]. Sanity must live in the shadows  unheard and unseen.213.	Third  there is a current rush of propaganda against ""the gnomes of Araby""  as a senior senator in Washington referred to oil-rich emirs. King Faisal is quoted and misquoted almost daily. The publicist twists both his words and his intentions. I personally detect a deliberate campaign to belittle the importance of the writing on the wall  as well as the man's diplomatic pragmatism and his capacity to influence events. Attributing to him obliquely ideas never put forward by him  some publicists are working hard to create hostility between him and the people of the United States. How far can mischief go? Some want to assume that ""the ""gnomes of Araby"" are an unthinking bunch of tribes  given to histrionics — an image that might lull the untutored into false comfort but would not change the facts which will ultimately determine the settlement.214.	But what are the facts? David Hurst  whose knowledge of the Middle East cannot be improved upon  put them in a simple way:""... as a result of the energy crisis  never have America's vital interests in the Arab world seemed so precariously   exposed by its commitment to Israel as they do today —  never has 'bastion Israel' seemed quite the glaring fallacy it is.""215.	These are no dead facts or unfounded views. They need the urgent attention of this Organization. The machinery existing at the moment has not been able to check the wiles of Israel. That is a fact. To wait until it is improved is no intelligent counsel either. Let us admit it. There are Powers that could do more than they say they can. They must move. The United States of America and Europe have the means. If they are intimidated by the hell Israel can raise in face of any State that goes counter to its wishes  as witness the case of Austria  then we have nothing to say to them except ""What of the peace on earth that you say you serve?"" They would do well to remember the African voices raised yesterday and today by two of our dynamic leaders  prompted by nothing but a sense of justice. I should like us to contrast them with the hollow rhetoric indulged in the other day by Mr. Eban  who did not budge an inch from the position taken after the June 1967 hostilities. I refer to the recurrent theme of ""negotiation between the parties"". The United States and Western Europe have the means to advice Israel to come out of the quagmire it has drawn itself more and into which it is about to pull the whole world. There is no point in wailing about being alone and outvoted. Israel must produce something other than rhetoric  or must be made to do so. It is no use quoting Al Akhbar and Al Gumhuriya often out of context  deluding itself and tormenting the world.216.	The African scene is another case of peace thrown to the winds  and barbarity rampant. Three aspects of the tragedy presently played on the scene there need to be brought to the fore: first  the commendable role of the Church in unravelling the brutalities of Portuguese armies in Mozambique; second  the inhuman manner in which hundreds of men and women are languishing in the detainee camps: and third  the indifference of world conscience to the tragic drama played out there by South Africa  Portugal  and Rhodesia.217.	It is our duty as the voice of the world here to recognize. in some formal manner  the part now being played by many priests  bishops and cardinals of the Catholic Church in Portuguese Territories. Some young men and women not only are bringing the details of massacres to world public opinion  but are also risking their lives: indeed  some of them are in gaol. We shall be failing these brave souls if we do not take up their case seriously  see to it that those in gaol are released  and that those who had to leave their flock go back. I am certain there are ways of achieving this. It is the will that is needed.218.	The Church has definitely set itself on a new course. Let us contemplate the words of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Umtali  Ms. Donald Lamont  looking into the origins of racism. It is  he says:""... a pernicious heresy  deep-seated in theological origins and disastrous in the conclusions it could lead to. If the Christian Church were to seem by its silence to give ' its consent to a system of government inspired by racial prejudice  any discrimination against men  or harassment of them on account of their colour  condition of their life  or religion  it would be contrary to the mind of Christ.""Noble words in the true tradition of the sacred books  but never before brought to light as forcefully as this.219.	Equally forceful in encouraging to men and women in the bush lighting for their freedom is Cardinal Bernard Albrink. He is no less a man than the Archbjshop of Utrecht and  at the same time  the international president of the Pax Christi movement  a man to reckon with. In a letter to Bishop Ferrcira de Silva he calls upon him ""to take all necessary measures and probably make a public protest. ...Wc have a duty to show every African citizen that he can count on our solidarity in securing his right to self- determination"". At long last the All-Africa Conference of Churches is not alone. Surely these men are rejuvenating the Church  injecting into it a spirit that centuries ago impelled a few similar souls to petition the Pope to intervene with secular authorities for the purpose of prohibiting slavery. According to press reports  Father Martin Hernandez and Father Alfonso Valverdi have been in gaol since early 1972.220.	There must be others because several missions have been closed for fear of missionaries informing the world. And inform it of what? I can tell you. Vania's story is too well known now to recount. Zostin's story is too gruesome not to mention. Portuguese soldiers asked Zostin whether she knew the sex of the child inside her. They opened her stomach with knives  violently extracting her entrails  showing her the foetus which throbbed convulsively. They told her that she then knew and were chucking like maniacs. What little Serina  a 13-year-old girl  told reporters about the massacre of her family is as horrifying. Vania  Zostin  and Serina should find their way to sainthood. The hundreds of churchmen we honour  but must not content ourselves with honouring them.221.	To begin this process  the Sudan joins with those who call for an investigation of the atrocities in Wiriyamu  Mucumbora and other areas. The investigation conducted by Portuguese authorities cannot be convincing. Evidence is in the shaky words of Prime Minister Caetano. Here they are: ""The competent authorities will seek those responsible  in order that justice may be done"". The result of what he called ""rigorous enquiry"" is  in his own words  ""a total absence of the alleged facts in the places alleged by the accusers"".222.	The second question is that of the fate of the hundreds of detainees in South Africa and Rhodesia. The world knows about Father Sithole and Joshua Nkomo in Rhodesia  Nelson Mandela and Alexander Neville in South Africa  luminaries who have been silenced behind bars for a decade or so. We do not know about the others. We call upon this world community and other international institutions to take up seriously the matter of those men and women whose sole guilt is standing up for their inalienable right to independence and freedom to determine their future. It is also setting a pattern for life under the racist Governments of that region until the day of deliverance comes. The obtaining pattern is desperate and therefore unaware of decisions it takes. Mr. Smith has recently gone so far as to ban churchmen from preaching in their own Church. No one will be surprised if  under strain because of his many political and economic defeats  he locks them up. Some action is needed. In what form? Let us think together. After all  this year we are celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.223.	Thirdly  recent developments go to show the near- maniacal eagerness of the white settler regimes to use armed suppression against the African population in order to entrench their rule and prevent the African from participating in government. The murder of Amilcar Cabral  the massacre of 400 defenceless civilians at Wiriyamu  the massacre of African mine workers in Carletonville  illustrate the length to which those minority regimes will go. Yet  despite brutality  African resistance in southern Africa not only has remained undaunted but has risen to unexpected heights. The recent labour strikes in South Africa have gone to prove how prophetic Nelson Mandela was when he said at his Rivonia trial:""Government violence can do only one thing and that is to breed counter-violence. We have warned repeatedly that if there is no dawning of sanity on the part of the Government the dispute between the Government and my people will finish up by being settled in violence and by force.""224.	It is against this background of terror that Africa has repeatedly pointed to the gathering storm south of the Zambezi  a storm that threatens to engulf the whole of Africa and the world beyond.225.	But South Africa  Rhodesia  and Portugal are not the ones to read the writing on the wall. Large portions of Mozambique and Angola are already in the hands of freedom fighters. The South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] has plunged into the fray with indomitable gusto  after the miserable failure of elections in Ovamboland and the arrest of five of its leaders as the culprits who prevented a turn-out to the election booths. Mr. Smith is sending his bombers  jet fighters and helicopters to subjugate the Tete Province in Mozambique because  according to him and his followers  ""the Portuguese have lost the stomach to hunt out FRELIMO guerrillas""  as reported by newsmen who managed to get into the area. This is a logic for which we have only infinite scorn. The thickest writing on the wall is the triumph of the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde in announcing the independence of Guinea-Bissau only days ago. That lesson will also be lost on the racists in South Africa  Rhodesia and Portugal. It will not be lost to the Africans. After all  one cardinal point announced by independent Guinea-Bissau is that it will help to liberate other Portuguese Territories.226.	We of the OAU shall  of course  soon take steps to help Guinea-Bissau to stand on its feet by making available to it whatever resources every single member of us can afford — and that apart from what the rest of the world can do at this stage.227.	It is useful to note that we have voted into our community some 130 million people in this particular year when we are seriously grappling with the improvement of the United Nations. To the representatives of those peoples  the German Democratic Republic  the Federal Republic of Germany  and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  I bring the congratulations of my country and its people. Our work in this Organization is incomplete without their industry and inventiveness. They will bring in a breath of fresh air  I hope. Some of those who have been at it for a long time have taken positions in the light of their own national interests  I am afraid. The steely muscles of the Organization need oiling. Some of us preach a ""don't-rock-the-boat"" philosophy: a conservative view that hopes to keep the status quo. Some preach the dismantling of the whole edifice as un- suited to our current needs and the construction of another that would be in tune with the times — a radical view that fails to take stock of the realities of international life. The dialogue started by the Secretary-General's notes and your own remarks  Sir  should end up in a serious endeavour to look into the matter and present recommendations to our next session.228.	Those remarks and particularly your views of the General Assembly  so perceptively outlined  Mr. President  cannot be served by Olympian aloofness. These are not times for any one of us in a position of authority to shy away from creative leadership. To halt the tendency ""to underrate the powers of the General Assembly"" you need daring souls on your side. Many of us demonstrated this morning that we are ready to do so.229.	We appeal to you  Mr. President  not to be hemmed in by the stern rules and practices that have reduced the highest office of the General Assembly  our collective voice  into an honorific position. Worse still — they have even led us into the contented acquiescence in and acceptance of the presence in our midst of such political obscenities as the spokesmen of apartheid.c230.	The social and economic establishment of the United Nations cannot be left unchanged either. The United Nations can pride itself on many of its economic assistance programmes where differences among States have been effectively conciliated in the pursuit of common goals. Such programmes can materialize in limitless benefits if the necessary requirements for successful performance are made available.231.	Apart from the primordial requirement of resources there is a need to increase the efficiency  effectiveness  and economy of the United Nations economic programmes. The implementation of those programmes demands a degree of emotional commitment beyond what is normally acceptable. And for such a change to be effective  all partners in the process of multilateral co-operation — and more particularly the recipients — should take part in the rationalization of procedures and modes of operation. What is needed in the prevailing conditions of international co-operation for development is a forward-looking perspective to development assistance and a dedicated spirit of performance at all levels. Nothing less will meet the pressing needs of the developing countries.232.	The Assembly had a taste of this from President' Mobutu of Zaire [2140th meeting]. His was a message of Africa pure and simple  freed from the trimmings of diplomatic niceties  and armed with the philosophy of his ancient land. His concept of aid is our concept — and not on the abstract level either. His country's experience of Chinese co-operation happens to be my country's experience too. It is the possible ideal of aid. I could go on and tell an identical story. The President's words were clear enough  yet one would like the ""better-equipped"" countries  as he prefers to call the richer members of the international community  to draw the moral. In my humble thinking  he was calling upon this Organization and upon the rich of the world to reconsider ways of co-operation witt us  in the light of the Chinese experience our two countries have  and to improve on it. Why not?233.	It is in that light that we say there is a need to review the Charter  to infuse the rules of procedure with a breath of life  to modify antiquated modes of operation  and to rejuvenate the administration with a timely blood transfusion. The Charter of the United Nations is not Holy Writ  however revered. It is a document reflecting the consensus of nations at a certain juncture of history. It will have to change with the changing times. The Organization is not an oracle. It is a political institution. And political institutions that tend to perpetuate themselves become reactionary. What use is a reactionary United Nations?234.	The resolutions of the non-aligned summit Conference at Algiers on the reorganization of the United Nations [see A/9330 and Corr.I] should not be passed over in silence  even by those who have a vested interest in the status quo. The change is necessary if the United Nations is to beat all efficient  efficacious  and truly representative of the infinite diversity of the world's culture and beliefs.235.	In order to achieve that change  we do not intend to fly in the face of prevailing facts. That does not do the job of strengthening this world forum. To be their prisoner  if they prove to stand in the way of new ideas  does not do the job either. There will have to be a golden mean between realism and idealism. To discard one or the other is to invite paralysis. It is not beyond our intelligence to be pragmatic idealists.236.	Africa is keen and willing to put its genius at the service of a machinery of reform. That is the meaning of the presence of four of our leaders here  one of them the current President of the OAU  General Gowon  who devoted a substantial part of his address [2141st meeting] to this question. It is not that they need the Organization more than any other continent in the world; it is that they realize only too well that Africa is the hope of peace and equitable distribution of the resources of the world. Africa is young and has not yet accumulated the cynicism that comes with old age and flabby wrinkles. Africa sees less of the seamy side of man and can speak up as the leaders you have heard this morning and yesterday did."
"101",6112,"SEN",28,1973,"﻿149.	The delegation of Senegal associates itself fully with the friendly words uttered by the many heads of delegations who have preceded us at this rostrum  and  although it is not necessary to stress the matter  wishes to present in its turn its sincere congratulations to Mr. Benites on his unanimous election to the office of President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly.150.	We wish to associate ourselves also with the tribute already paid to his eminent predecessor  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczyriski.151.	Finally  we express to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our profound gratitude for the activities he has carried out in so little time in the service of peace and justice throughout the world.152.	I wish to take this memorable opportunity also to hail on behalf of the Government and people of Senegal the admission to membership in the United Nations of the German Democratic Republic  the Federal Republic of Germany  and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  an event which concretely expresses  over and above the reduction of tension throughout the world  the universalist mission conferred upon the Organization by the founders of the United Nations.153.	In the short period which has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly positive signs heralding an atmosphere of detente  which is the first essential step towards universal peace  have shown themselves in international life. This trend finds its clearest expression in the priority given by the great Powers to rapprochement and harmonization of their relations  whether this involves the strengthening of co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union or a mutual accommodation between China and the United States  which is a prelude to the normalization of their relations  or the installation of a climate of detente in Europe  which takes the form in particular of the basic agreement between the two Germanys and the opening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.154.	At first sight  all these events would tend to show  were this to be necessary  that in international life there seems to be taking form a trend towards new bilateral relations inspired by political realism  thus increasing the possibility for peaceful solutions to the controversial questions which have so far been postponed from year to year.155.	But since the reduction of tensions and coexistence are not always synonymous with international peace and security  the positive trend which has partially taken place in international relations cannot completely allay our misgivings at the rapid and complex evolution of our world  which frequently exceeds its own understanding  in the face of the fierce competition which is taking place there and of which the third world all too frequently is the theatre when it is not the stake.156.	Too many countries are interested in the United Nations only in so far as this Organization can serve their interests and fulfil their aspirations  instead of seeing in the Organization an active  vital and universal mechanism  making it possible to build a more just  more democratic and more human world.157.	As it is  in the field of economic and trade relations the proletarian nations are unceremoniously relegated to the outer reaches of the world market and of the international division of labour. The situation for some of them is deteriorating from year to year as the result of various factors  among which the frequent occurrence of natural catastrophes of all types is one phenomenon.158.	As you are aware  our region has been the victim of one of those natural catastrophes. Indeed  the cycle of drought which has prevailed for seven years in the Sudano-Sahelian region became aggravated last year and has reached catastrophic proportions  affecting  directly or indirectly  more than 20 million human beings in Upper Volta  Mali  Mauritania. Niger  Chad and Senegal.159.	And yet  as early as August of 1972  the Senegal Government had brought to the attention of friendly States and international organizations the food shortage which was going to result from the drought. On 9 October the President of the Republic  His Excellency Mr. Leopold Sedar Senghor  called the attention of the World Bank to the deterioration of climatic conditions in the Sahelian zone.160.	I might also point out that the struggle against the spreading desert in our regions through the rational use of surface and ground water has for years been the principal preoccupation of the States bordering on the Senegal River-Mali  Mauritania and Senegal-which are today regrouped in the Organization for the Development of the Senegal River  known as the OMVS.161.	Faced with the devastating consequences of this scourge  African solidarity and international assistance have not failed. To brother States  friendly countries  the United Nations and other international organizations I convey the sincere thanks and profound gratitude of the Government and people of Senegal. One can regret in passing that some  in helping us  have thought it fitting to address unjust reproaches to us  as ii this natural calamity could be ascribed to the negligence of the Governments of the six countries involved.162.	It remains for me to hope that the General Assembly will take into consideration item 101 of its agenda  entitled ""Consideration of the economic and social situation in the Sudano-Sahelian region stricken by drought and measures to be taken for the benefit of that region""  in particular  to seek ways to deal with a repetition of the dramatic consequences of such a catastrophe by providing-as it is invited to do by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1797 (LV)-for concrete measures equal to the scientific resources and technological capacity of industrial civilization.163.	Within this scheme of things  the Senegal delegation firmly supports the proposal of the Secretary-General to provide funds under the regular United Nations budget for emergency operations. It goes without saying that such an initiative would constitute an important contribution to the implementation of resolution 2717 (XXV)  by which the General Assembly recommended the adoption of measures designed to strengthen the capacity of various United Nations organs to contribute assistance and secure a rapid mobilization and effective co-ordination of international aid.164.	At a time when man  by setting foot on the moon  has achieved one of mankind's long-cherished dreams  it seems to us that the great task confronting the international community now more than ever is the solution of the problems of economic  cultural  social and political development-in a word  the integral development of man.165.	And yet  what do we observe today?166.	The Committee on Review and Appraisal  charged with assessing the progress accomplished in the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade  reveals that the experience of the last two years is particularly discouraging.167.	The situation of developing countries  already precarious  has further deteriorated  of course  because numerous poor countries do not always do enough for the less-favoured classes  as will be seen from the reports of the World Bank  but especially because the rich countries do not implement the measures contemplated in the Strategy.168.	Such a situation  in the present state of affairs  can only widen the huge gap between the rich and the poor countries  and this may bring about a feeling of profound frustration  the consequences of which  it may be presaged  will be serious for international peace and security.169.	In order to ward off such a possibility  the United Nations will have to refrain from the magic of words and simple declarations of intent and resolutely bend its efforts towards more concrete co-operation and the search for just solutions to questions of natural resources  trade and development.170.	It is only very recently that the developing countries have begun to intervene directly in international discussions on the law of the sea  whose evolution had formerly been subject to the criteria of only the industrialized countries.171.	No precise international agreement having been concluded in order to fix the limits of national jurisdiction  to ensure the necessary protection of the resources of the sea and guarantee the preservation of fisheries  my Government  by a decree of 3 June 1971  has denounced the Geneva Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone   as well as the Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources of the Sea. 172.	At the same time  our country has opened a dialogue with other African States in order to co-ordinate the various interpretations with a view to presenting a common front at the different international conferences that are to take place soon and in which Senegal will participate  with the object of contributing positively to the new formulation of maritime law.173.	The major lines of the African position as reaffirmed at the Algiers Conference fits in perfectly with the claims of my country concerning specifically the exclusive economic zone and the sea-bed.174.	In the case of the exclusive economic zone  we claim an adjacent zone of essentially economic utility not stretching beyond 200 nautical miles. Within that zone the coastal State would exercise exclusive sovereignty over all the biological and mineral resources existing in the waters  the soil and the sub-soil  without prejudice to freedom of navigation  overflight  the laying of cables and pipelines  etc.175.	Of course  land-locked and partially land-locked countries will be acknowledged to have rights concerning participation in the exploitation of the living resources of the zone on the basis of bilateral  regional or multilateral agreements.176.	As for the sea-bed and ocean floor  as well as the sub-soil thereof  beyond the limits of national jurisdiction  that constitutes a zone proclaimed to be the ""common heritage of mankind"" by the famous Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor  and the Subsoil Thereof  beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction.111. We consider that the exploration and exploitation of that zone should be entrusted to an international agency administered in common by all States  or else to a specialized agency such as the World Bank.178.	In this same context  the Senegal delegation approves  as of now  Economic and Social Council resolution 1762 (LIV) designed to create a revolving fund for research on the development of natural resources.179.	It is quite natural that I should now come to the fundamental claims of the third world relating to trade and development  to which neither UNCTAD no* the General Assembly have managed to find just and acceptable solutions.180.	These days  when a certain number of countries that have achieved industrial and technical over-development are seriously envisaging putting a brake on economic growth  four fifths of mankind continues to endure living conditions incompatible with the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter and with the present state of civilization and the norms of coexistence as established in recent years.181.	I should therefore wish to recall that my country has for many years proclaimed the necessity of transforming the unfair economic structures of our day by a triple plan of action.182.	First of all  there is the agonizing problem of commodities. As has already been stressed by President Leopold Sedar Senghor in his outstanding plea at the fifty-sixth session of the International Labour Organisation:""Therefore  we believe that the most urgent question is to revise the relationships between us-between affluent countries and proletarian countries-by guaranteeing a fair remuneration for the products of the emerging countries through a more rational and  consequently  a more humane organisation of international trade . . ."".11183.	In this spirit the developing countries forcefully call for the regularization of production and the stabilization of prices at a remunerative level so as to increase export income considerably  taking into account the need to increase the financing of the development of countries and to offset the disastrous effects of the implacable continuous deterioration of terms of trade  euphemistically called ""the law of supply and demand"".184.	In this connexion I am very pleased with the decision of the. European Community's commission concerning future relations of the Community with the Associated African States and the developing countries of the Commonwealth  contained in its memorandum of 4 April 1973  to guarantee to each associated country  as part of the Eurafrican Yaounde Association  export incomes in order to take into account any possible climatic catastrophes and the deterioration in the terms of trade.185.	Hence  in the field of aid my Government continues to call upon the developed countries to attain the goal of 1 per cent of gross national product in the transfer of financial resources  of which 0.70 per cent would be from public resources for the benefit of developing countries. It goes without saying that within the framework of the over-all goal of 1 per cent of the gross national product  which unfortunately does not take into account reverse flows representing payment of interest and dividends  greater attention will have to be concentrated upon the priority goal of 0.70 per cent deriving essentially from public resources.186.	Lastly  in the case of debt  the developing countries call for an improvement in financial conditions and the alleviation of debt servicing.187.	In this respect it should be noted with satisfaction that there has been a decision by the UNCTAD Committee on Invisibles and Financing Related to Trade whereby a special group of governmental experts would be establishedto examine problems of the debt of developing countries  amounting to $75 000 million for a group of 80 countries  and any possible measures to be prescribed internationally.188.	In truth  these questions are so closely tied to the international monetary situation that if this serious problem is not resolved it will practically be illusory to attempt to accelerate exchanges and increase the net volume of aid provided to the communities that are not properly equipped in world competition.189.	With that in view  Senegal  for its part  will provide its unqualified support for any proposal or formula submitted with a view to establishing some machinery for collective economic security which might form an over-all framework for solidarity between rich and proletarian nations.190.	However  these events depend first and foremost upon the progress that is achieved towards general and complete disarmament. As of now  I am happy to proclaim from this rostrum that my delegation firmly adheres to the Soviet Union's proposal to reduce by 10 per cent  the military budgets of permanent members of the Security Council [A/9191 J. It would  moreover  be desirable for that proposal to apply likewise to the other States possessing a large economic and military potential. The resources thus liberated would finance the fund for special aid to development  establishment of which has so urgently been called for by the non-aligned countries. For it is with considerable misgiving mixed with powerlessness that we note that military expenditures annually amount to $200 000 million-in other words  more than the cumulative revenues of Africa  southern Asia and the Far East.191.	The atomic Powers are indefinitely strengthening their military arsenals  whereas others are engaging in nuclear tests in the atmosphere and underground  threatening our world with the spectre of an atomic war capable of engulfing our fragile planet.192.	Does that mean that the Disarmament Decade might in turn prove to be only a snare because for 10 years now the United Nations has adopted only partial measures which are  as a matter of fact  limited to the field of ""non-armament""? Well  no. Thus my delegation notes with satisfaction the recent agreement in Washington between the United States and the Soviet Union concerning the limitation of strategic arms. 193.	Moreover  my Government  which on numerous occasions has registered its disapproval of nuclear explosions  is particularly gratified at the adherence of the People's Republic of China to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) prohibiting nuclear weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean  as well as France's decision to adhere to it in the near future. In a sector as crucial as this for the future of the whole of mankind  that is assuredly a historic development which I am sure will gradually spread.194.	In that perspective  the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which met in Helsinki  already constitutes an irreversible trend towards the transformation of the old continent into a zone of peace and thus towards the convening of a world disarmament conference  for which my Government yearns with all its heart.195.	Will it  then  be possible to hope at last for an era of progress and peace in the world?196.	For the moment  we have welcomed with gratification the Paris agreements which put an end to the horrible war in Viet-Nam. Therefore  my Government  after a clear-headed and objective analysis of the situation  has drawn the necessary conclusions from these agreements by recognizing the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam and  at the same time  placing both parties on a footing of equality so as to promote their progress towards unity.197.	In the case of Cambodia  where peace depends solely on the return to legitimacy represented by the Royal Government of National Union  I remain convinced  in the light of the events that have taken place recently  that our Organization  in this respect basing itself upon the Algiers Conference  will at the present session raise the problem of the restoration to the regime of Prince Norodom Sihanouk of its legitimate rights.198.	Similarly  in Korea the United Nations should establish conditions favourable for accelerating the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea  supplementing  by a radical revision of the role of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea and by a decision to withdraw all foreign forces  the present negotiations between the Governments of Pyongyang and Seoul  with which Senegal maintains diplomatic relations.199.	But it is more by favouring establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East that the United Nations will recover the prestige that has been seriously undermined by the despair of some and the bellicose arrogance of others-not to mention  of course  the actions of certain great Powers which seem quite reconciled to the aggravation of tensions in that already tense area.200.	The more the Israeli Government accentuates its aggressiveness  as evidenced by the recent acts of reprisal and air piracy  the less its behaviour is likely to be understood by international public opinion.201.	The Israeli leaders would make a very important contribution to the coming of peace to the eastern shores of the Mediterranean if they really agreed strictly and fully to apply the relevant provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and if they were to proclaim publicly their policy of non-annexation of occupied Arab territory.202.	Such a conciliatory and unambiguous attitude would undoubtedly help the United Nations to give a new impetus to the efforts made with a view to the restoration of peace in that part of the world and would also contribute to the elimination of colonialism and apartheid in Africa.203.	Great is our bitterness and profound our disappointment at seeing the collective will of the United Nations to put an end to colonialism and racial discrimination come up in Africa against a solid wall of arrogance  defiance and contempt.204.	Portugal  a European country which would seem  after all. to be in a good position to avoid the errors of colonial conquest  refuses to comply with the obligations of the Charter and continues with impunity to trample underfoot the decisions of the principal organs of the United Nations.205.	While millions of men have  over a period of 15 years  recovered their right to assume responsibility for their own destinies  Portugal continues to seek shelter-and how blindly-in the superstitions of the past and to follow a merciless policy of oppression of the populations of Guinea-Bissau  the Cape Verde Islands  Angola and Mozambique. This inhuman Portuguese policy is expressed most tragically  as will be seen from the report of Father Adrian Hastings [see A/9023[Rev. 1  chap. IX  para. 28]  in the odious massacre of more than 400 men  women and children  ignominiously perpetrated on 16 December 1972 in the village of Wiriyamu in Mozambique.206.	And yet we have very much present in our minds the particularly reasonable proposals of Amilcar Cabral  former Secretary-General of PAIGC - assassinated in a dastardly manner on 20 January 1973 - proposals which the General Assembly was to endorse last year by recognizing the liberation movements of territories under Portuguese administration as the authentic representatives of the peoples of that Territory and inviting Portugal to enter into negotiations shortly with these movements.207.	In the face of the arrogance of the Portuguese Government vis-à-vis the injunctions of the international community  what is left for the United Nations if not to assume its responsibilities in order to have its decisions applied?208.	For its part  the people of Guinea-Bissau has taken the historic decision to take its destiny into its own hands by proclaiming a few days ago the independence of its Territory.209.	I should like  on behalf of the Government and people of Senegal  to hail warmly the accession to international sovereignty of the republican and democratic State of Guinea-Bissau and to express our best wishes for the happiness and prosperity of its people. And I wish to take this memorable occasion solemnly to invite the Members of the United Nations to recognize the new State without delay  to admit it to our Organization as soon as an application is made  and to ensure to it as of now their co-operation as well as their active solidarity in its struggle against Portuguese colonialism.210.	But our Organization has another specific duty: that of aiding the populations in Southern Rhodesia and Namibia to achieve their independence on the basis ofequality of rights for all. Unfortunately  in spite of the rather significant efforts made by the majority of the Members of the United Nations  the minority regimes in power in this tormented region continue to base their retrograde policies on racial segregation and discrimination.211.	In Southern Rhodesia eight years have elapsed since the rebellion-eight years of suffering and martyrdom for the Zimbabwe people-without any satisfactory results being recorded. On the contrary  the illegal and racist minority regime is growing stronger from year to year in spite of economic sanctions  or perhaps because of attempted negotiations conducted by the British Government.212.	In fact  the report of the Security Council's Committee on sanctions  informs us that Rhodesian trade increased in 1971  the mandatory economic sanctions having largely been ignored by Members of the Organization-and first among these  certain permanent members of the Security Council.213.	At the same time  tension is constantly growing in view of the acts of provocation of the Zimbabwe people by the Southern Rhodesian army. Thus  in January 1973 the Zambian Government was forced once again to come before the Security Council as a result of the unilateral decision of the illegal regime to close its common border with Zambia  thus imposing upon that country an economic blockade in retaliation for the support given by the Zambian authorities to the just cause of the Zimbabwe people.214.	It is obvious. We note there  on the part of the rebellious Government  as was pointed out last year appropriately by the representative of Somalia  ""the same disregard for the authority of the United Nations  the same withdrawal from responsibility on the part by those most able to take effective action  and the same drift towards support for the racist regimes. .. .""215.	Concerning South Africa  my Government rejects out of hand the thesis according to which normal economic relations  as well as financial and cultural relations  with that country might bring about changes in the policy of South Africa  or at least the humanization of the abominable regime of apartheid  which is both an ideology and an iniquitous system of Government based solely upon complete contempt for non-white races. More serious still  the South African Government calmly pursues the integration of Namibia into its own territory  denying the populations concerned the right to self-determination and imposing upon them the sordid policy of separate development of races.216.	That is why Senegal  in this respect complying with the resolutions of the Organization of African Unity  considers that an end must be put to contacts between the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the South African Government concerning Namibia  since these contacts are exploited by Pretoria in an effort to have the Organization endorse its retrograde policy of the dismemberment of Namibia.217.	It is felicitous  in the view of my Government  that the Ovambos  the largest ethnic group  have resolutely rejected the policy of dismemberment of the Territory by refusing to take part in the elections organized on 1 August 1973 by the South African authorities.218.	It may be possible for us  at a time when we are about to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  to adopt effective and appropriate measures for the safeguarding of human dignity  and to bring our world into harmony with the necessities of the planetary age. From this point of view  the time has come to put a final end to the relegation of the United Nations to the diplomatic sidelines through a process of mutual accommodation and alleviation of tensions: on the contrary new vigour must be infused into the Organization and it must be enabled to take into its own hands the control of improvement in relations between States.219.	The time has come to entrust to the United Nations the full requisite responsibility and all the necessary authority to increase its normative capacity and to build the basis of an equitable mechanism of international co-operation  as part of the democratization of international relations.220.	This democratization postulates-and the non-aligned countries anticipated it in Georgetown  and have just proclaimed it in Algiers-that at the present stage no durable world-wide system can ignore the constructive and creative contribution of the small and medium-sized Powers to the solution of problems of world-wide interest.221.	Finally  I wish to formulate the ardent hope that the present session will constitute a historic landmark on the difficult road towards strengthened tolerance between nations and the realization of the legitimate aspirations of peoples for freedom  economic justice and peace."
"102",6158,"SGP",28,1973,"﻿ 1. First of all  may I  on my own behalf and that of my delegation  extend our felicitations to our President on his unanimous election to preside over the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Undoubtedly  it was his deep knowledge of the ways of nations and his wide experience of procedures derived from his close association with our Organization that commended his election to his high office.2.	I would also like to join other speakers in paying a tribute to his predecessor  the distinguished Deputy Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of Poland  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  for the skill  and understanding with which he directed this Assembly.3.	A frequent but very pleasant task is the welcoming of new Members. It is a salutary reminder that prognostications about the growing irrelevancy of the United Nations are not all that widely shared and that  for all its many shortcomings  most nations believe that international relations would be fraught with even graver perils without it.4.	This year we have admitted three new Members. The first  the Bahamas  enters our ranks by virtue of having gained its independence  and I would like to congratulate the Bahamas and its people on their new status.5.	The admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic marks the happy resolution of what had for over two decades been a delicate and intractable European problem. For the first time in centuries peace is now more assured than ever before at any time in Europe's strife-torn history. Conflicts and profound disagreements there certainly will be  but their resolution by recourse to arms is a fear that appears to have receded into the realm of the implausible. For all practical purposes Europeans believe they have at last outlawed war among themselves.6.	I wish I could be assured of as happy a prospect for the third world. The killing  the dying and the destruction have yet to come to an end in the less-developed world as they have in Europe. Since 1945 much of the third world has been plagued by violent conflicts. It has been estimated that 95 per cent of the major and minor wars since 1945 have been in the under-developed countries. They have ranged from anti-colonial wars and wars of intervention to insurgencies  civil wars  wars of liberation and disputes between third-world countries. These  far from diminishing  have tended to increase during the past decade and have been and are being fought largely with increasingly expensive weapons supplied by  or bought from  the developed world.7.	Some of the crucial items on our agenda  which' have repeatedly come before us  year after year  relate to disputes involving violence in the third world. The most serious of these is the Arab-Israeli conflict. The detente between the big Powers  though it has enhanced immeasurably the prospects of global peace and eased cold-war pressures on weaker nations  has however not in any way enhanced hopes for peace in the Middle East.8.	I have on previous occasions reiterated my Government's position on the Middle East conflict. I do so again  but with a growing feeling that reiteration of one's position will not materially affect the steadfast positions of the parties directly involved in the conflict. Since the detente of the big Powers precludes the Arab-Israeli dispute from ever becoming  or being allowed to become  a casus belli between the great Powers  they are not under the same pressure as they were in years past to take any major initiative in regard to this protracted conflict.9.	The initiative must therefore come  as it has in the case of the two German Republics  in the case of Viet-Nam and in the case of big-Power conflicts and rivalries  primarily from the parties to the conflict. What these new Middle East initiatives should be only the parties concerned can determine  and all that we  conscious of our limitations  can do is to ensure by our demeanour that we do not exacerbate this protracted and tragic conflict.10.	However  before such initiatives can be seriously taken  two barriers need to be cleared. The first is psychological. As long as the parties to the conflict believe. - that war and not negotiations will ultimately resolve their problem  peace will remain as elusive as ever. The second relates to basic principles. Before there can be any serious negotiation there must be a clear assurance that settlement would be in accordance with principles basic to our Organization. The territorial integrity of the States concerned and their security cannot be qualified as the price of a settlement. Any negotiations postulated on the basis of victors and defeated is doomed to failure.11.	In the case of South Africa  Namibia  Rhodesia and Portuguese possessions in Africa  the other unresolved items on our agenda  the white minorities have yet to be convinced that the alternative to coming to terms with the dispossessed black peoples is eventually a Viet-Cong type of involution. Until that alternative becomes credible  persuasion and resolutions by this Assembly  though they may make the transgressor cautious  will not convince the dominant white minority that accommodation of the aspirations of the black peoples is the only rational solution.12.	Those  then  are some of the perennial issues plaguing the third world  issues which accord between the great Powers has  for the most part  left unresolved and is unlikely to solve. While we welcome the accord as a positive contribution to world peace and a rational ordering of international life  we should not forget that it is what it says it is-merely a detente between the big Powers to ensure that their conflicts do not escalate into mutually annihilating confrontations  and that their global interests and the delicate balancing of forces are not upset by the problems and disputes of smaller nations. That beady-eyed approach is a necessary corrective to the euphoria that the big-Power accord appears to have generated in some of us. The accord is not concerned  except perhaps incidentally  with sorting out the difficulties and problems of small nations.13.	True  the accord decreases the cold-war pressures to which many small nations were subjected during the past two decades  pressures which they unwillingly succumbed to or which they evaded by necessary  though not always commendable  deviousness. In that sense the accord gives the third world countries a respite from cold war pressures and greater freedom to find their own remedies for their accumulating problems.14.	Our problems  namely the problems of the third world  are multiplying to near unmanageable proportions and many of them overshadow in importance and significance many other problems that have occasioned as much inspired rhetoric in the past. Today  for example  the spectre of famine haunts many parts of the third world. The rising hopes that the ""green revolution"" would assuage hunger in the developing world appear to be receding. Something like half of the world's population today is said to be hungry at a time when possibly another billion will join the human race during the next 10 years. Most of the increase in population and hunger is in the third world and it is there too that population increase  made possible through economic  social and health improvements  has also multiplied the sum of human misery. Despite creditable growth rates  unemployment is many steps ahead of economic growth-as much as 20 per cent in many countries. Despite an impressive performance in the spread of literacy  there are today 100 million more illiterates in the third world than there were 20 years ago. The third world's rural crisis is aggravated by a spreading urban crisis. The advanced countries  too  have their urban crisis but it isof a different order from that confronting third world cities. The third world cities are becoming refugee camps for the rural poor whom the land can no longer sustain and for ambitious rural youths who bitterly discover  too late  that cities provide only limited opportunities for people with general rural skills. The cities demand specialized urban skills and those that lack these skills turn to crime and violence as possible alternatives. The third world cities are what might be called accidental cities. They have size without a corresponding economic function. Politically and socially the cities of the third world are political time- bombs.15.	All these problems derive principally from uncontrolled population growth which  paradoxically  is aggravated by unplanned but progressive social and economic measures  by increased food supply  and by modernization of institutions without modernization of minds. In a free contest the dismal fact is that population can always outstrip economic growth and so  unless the third world drastically restrains population growth  economic growth and humanitarian measures could well result not in greater happiness but in increasing misery.16.	The reprieve we have from cold-war pressures could give us an opportunity to consider more single-mindedly than we have in the past those fundamental problems without the resolution of which all other problems remain intractable. Admittedly there is less drama involved in considerations of economic and population problems. Such problems do not lend themselves readily to mind-arresting rhetoric  but for the hungry billions today speculating where their next meal is to come from  and for the other billion waiting in the wings to greet the thirty-eighth session of this Assembly  our rhetoric may be no more than food for despair and fuel for sweeping anger.17.	But the fact remains that our population is increasing catastrophically and that could be the genesis for a new cold war as intense and possibly more dangerous than the ideological cold war which we have tried to cope with in the past three decades and which we have now left behind us. The increase in population and the insatiable needs of developed countries have raised the spectre of near exhaustion of natural resources. There is a wringing of hands over the so-called energy crisis  over a water crisis  and over possible shortages of meat  fish and grain and of a number of strategic raw materials. It is  of course  open to dispute whether we have already reached or will reach such a crisis. It is sufficient that many nations believe that with rising populations they are entering an era of scarce natural resources  and so long as that belief persists it will be real and that will affect their political behaviour.18.	Since the conquest of other peoples' land to acquire and control resources  as in the past  is no longer practical or  in the long run  economical  the sea  covering more than 70 per cent of the earth's surface  is increasingly seen as the new El Dorado. Some claim that there is more wealth in the sea than on the land. This  though unsubstantiated by facts  is indicative of the sort of fever the scramble for the wealth of the sea could generate. Today  mankind gets from the sea about 25 per cent of its protein  about 17 to 19 per cent of its oil and 6 per cent of its gas. Though minerals now extracted from the sea-bed account for only 2 per centof the ore produced on land  there are mind-spinning estimates of many trillions of tons of ooze and nodules containing manganese  iron  copper and nickel.19.	Undoubtedly the sea may be tomorrow's economic frontier and a possible source for as many bloody conflicts as the carve-up of the earth's surface has generated throughout mankind's history. Hitherto  the ocean has for the most part remained no-man's-land  and therefore all-men's land  simply because mankind had not the means effectively to seize and occupy the sea. Today  many nations have the means  or think they have the means.20.	So it is this contention that mankind  whose ancestors abandoned the sea millions and millions of years ago  is turning towards the sea again  possibly to reproduce all the foolishness and madness entailed in the carving up of the land. Not many people are aware that the first skirmishes have already begun in the battle for the sea. Gunboats have steamed off the shores of Asia  Africa and the Americas to assert or contest claims of possession. Far more serious disputes have occurred off the Icelandic coasts. There are also disputes pertaining to over-fishing and the possible annihilation of certain species of marine life-in particular  whales. The International Court of Justice was recently called upon to adjudicate on France's right to test nuclear weapons in the Pacific. Pollution of the sea by shipping  the discharge of industrial waste and the burial of nuclear waste-in fact  the growing tendency to treat the sea as humanity's garbage can-are potential sources of conflict.21.	These are in addition to the importance traditionally attached to the sea for communication  trade and war. The trade routes that link nations are still primarily sea routes. Marine transportation accounts for 78 per cent of the physical volume of foreign trade freight and 68 per cent of freight in terms of cost. Sea transport is still the cheapest form of transport and is likely to remain so with the development of super-tankers and containerization.22.	It is also noticeable that in recent years the great Powers are once again emphasizing sea-power as a more effective way of manifesting strength and exercising influence in times of peace. Since the sea is for the most part unencumbered by national frontiers  this is one arm of power which can circumscribe the globe in relative freedom. This includes nuclear-powered submarines  equipped with long-range multiple-warhead missiles and fortified by silos and military installations buried in the sea-bed and directed by sensitive electronic devices.23.	So I believe we have already entered the era of ocean politics and ocean economics. The stakes are enormous  and the conflicts arising from ocean politics may be the more important issues that in future will harass the United Nations. The law in regard to the sea has not developed beyond the vague simplicity of the decalogue. There is practically no law for exploration and exploitation of its resources beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. The law in regard to the extent of such national jurisdiction is founded on nothing more convincing than arbitrary proclamations and new papal bulls.24.	At the same time it is recognized that the simple concept of the freedom of the seas as enunciated by eminent jurists and scholars in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries  like that of Hugo Grotius  requires reinterpretation and elaboration in the light of present-day reality.25.	Ocean politics and economics are essentially new manifestations of power which we have to learn to cope with. They are untrodden territory  where paths can lead to dead ends and dangerous precipices as well as to reassuring pastures and woodlands. There is a Chinese saying that every journey begins with the first step and that the first step determines the destination. So if the first step we take at the forthcoming Third United Nations conference on the Law of the Sea  scheduled to start this year  thrusts us into the jungles of sterile contention and even open conflicts  then  as with the dividing up of the land  the carving up of the seas may well be history written in blood. If the trendy thing is for each coastal State to grab what it can on the basis of the principle of ""finders  keepers""  then the sea must eventually become the possession of a handful of rich and powerful nations having the technological capabilities and the requisite armoury successfully to assert the dismal proposition that ""might is right"".26.	The other approach is to treat the oceans as the common property of mankind-of coastal States and land-locked States  of poor nations and rich nations and of the most developed and the least developed. I realize that the translation of this same ideal — in the long run  a practical ideal — into detailed policies tailored to suit the different and special interests of so many nations will not be all that simple. But it will be in the real and long-term interests of smaller and weaker nations not to lose sight of the fact that if the wealth of the sea is not made available fairly to all  then in the nature of things it must go unfairly to the few who are rich  strong and technologically equipped to enclose the seas as private property or to those who claim special rights and privileges over the riches of the oceans merely through the accident of geographical location. The rational approach to the problems of the sea is not without risks and difficulties  but they are far easier to cope with than those arising in a free-for-all scramble to carve up the seas. "
"103",6238,"SLE",28,1973,"﻿141.	Standing here today addressing this great Assembly for the first time I am deeply conscious of the honour my President  His Excellency Dr. Siaka Stevens  has conferred on me by conveying through me his personal warm greetings and salutations  as well as those of his Government and the entire people of Sierra Leone. We congratulate you  Mr. President  on your assumption of the presidency of this twenty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We doubt not that you will guide our deliberations here admirably.142.	We wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor  the Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  under whose active  energetic and wise leadership the twenty-seventh session tackled seriously so many important African issues.143.	We wish also to commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  for his heroic efforts in the Herculean task of being our Secretary-General. Under his aegis the influence of the United Nations has been brought to bear on the many areas of conflict  particularly in the Middle East  Asia and Africa. His efforts demand our admiration and  even more so  our support. His participation in the recent deliberations of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned States provides reassuring evidence of the co-operation between the United Nations and other organizations with similar objectives. Sierra Leone wishes him well and hopes that his efforts will be crowned with ever-increasing success.44. It gives me  personally  particular pleasure to extend our warm welcome to the new Members of the United Nations: the Federal Republic of Germany  the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. The bonds between Sierra Leone and each of these countries are strong  but I can and do feel the joy of this great occasion more particularly for more personal reasons.145. Sierra Leone is a small country but a nation totally committed to the ideals of this Organization. It is our belief that the strength and saving grace of this institution is that nations  irrespective of size  can  rightly motivated  contribute adequately and effectively to this world body. It is our view that in the United Nations lies the only reasonable hope for the peoples of this world. It is for that reason that I am happy and proud to pledge in all sincerity the fullest co-operation of my delegation towards the attainment of the ideals  purposes and principles of our Organization. It is our view that there is a duty incumbent on each and every Member State to work towards a truly harmonized community of nations. To do so we must folly appreciate that we belong to a community of nations. We must appreciate that irresponsible pursuit of what we misguidedly consider to be our nation's self-interest is short-sighted folly; that at best the result of such an endeavour is a balance of fear and at worst an unimaginable holocaust. It should not be difficult for thinking men to appreciate that  in a world as tiny as ours-and getting tinier every day-to ask  ""Am I my brother's keeper? ""  is to ask the obvious.146.	We believe the time has come for every Member State to eschew propagandist slogans and to work diligently towards the goals of our Organization  for an ordered world dedicated to the pursuit of the goals of peace — the mounting of an effective assault upon the diseases that still ravage mankind  and an improvement of the poor standard and quality of life at present available to 90-odd per cent of the world's population.147.	Is it not high time we stopped talking interminably about the gap between the haves and the have-nots? Is such talk an end in itself? Are we going to continue talking about it and doing nothing else? The reduction of the gap  I suggest  not only is worthy of the attention of the galaxy of talent available to this Organization but should be one of our association's priority action programmes. Therefore  Sierra Leone proposes that the following be included on the agenda of the twenty-eighth General Assembly session as an important and urgent item: Reduction of the increasing gap between the developed countries and the developing countries. 148.	It is for reasons such as those just mentioned that my Government welcomes the detente of recent years. This positive trend  we are confident  will manifest itself in a wider measure of agreement and co-operation  not only among the super-Powers  whose individual interest dictated this mutual accommodation  but also among all States  because the welfare and survival of humanity depend on continuing peace  continuing stability and continuing international understanding.149.	We cannot hope in the brief span of one statement to this Assembly even to review  let alone pretend to solve  all the world's problems. We can  however  highlight some of the more disturbing  and this I intend to do during the next few minutes.150.	The misery that has recently plagued 10 million people of the Sahelian region on the continent of Africa as a result of drought is still not a past event. While we must express our sincere appreciation and thanks to the various Governments and international institutions  not least the specialized agencies of our own Organization  for quickly rushing aid to the millions of starving victims  I would make an appeal to the Member States of this world body for this disaster to be given even greater publicity through the mass media so as to elicit greater short-term and long-term relief  as well as rehabilitation programmes  from the entire international community.151.	On the African continent the problem of decolonization continues to manifest itself in its most atrocious forms.152.	The Rhodesian problem has grown increasingly worse over the past eight years  and  in spite of the persistent efforts of OAU  this Organization and other progressive forces of liberation  the intransigence of Mr. Smith and his racist oligarchy are making it almost impossible to arrive at a peaceful solution of this explosive problem. By a systematic introduction of racist legislation and practices  by oppressive rule accompanied by the bullets of madmen  by blatant disregard of the voice of the masses  this illegal regime continues to entrench itself  contrary to the wishes of the vast majority of the international community. Recently this intolerable situation has been exacerbated further by the closing of the borders with Zambia  an act which can justly be described as economic aggression. It is now all too evident that the British Government cannot or will not by itself resolve this issue. It is thus only by the determined action of all members of this community  both individually and collectively  that we can hope to achieve any meaningful results by means other than conflict and bloodshed. Unhappily  the sanctions on which this Organization has decided are being imposed either partially or half-heartedly by those whose compliance is likely to make the greatest impact on the Rhodesian economy. Unless there is a change of heart in this direction  the only other possibility-a solution by force of arms — with all its attendant horrors and inevitable high cost in terms of human life  will be the personal responsibility of each and every one of us who failed to support faithfully this Organization's call for sanctions. Let not the blood of the Zimbabweans be on our hands and on the heads of our children.153.	We recommend and continue to urge a widening of sanctions both in scope and in intensity  to include  in particular  travel  communications  sports and all other economic  political  social and cultural activities  because we are convinced that  in a world in which nations have become so increasingly interdependent  political  economic and cultural isolation are bound to make a corrective impression on even the most intransigent regimes.154.	In Namibia  history appears to have stood still or to be moving backwards. It is deeply regretted that in spite of the decision and the subsequent actions of this body to assume the administration of that Territory and free its inhabitants from the clutches of the South African Government  we are witnessing instead the dismemberment of Namibia into homelands in preparation for the wholesale importation of apartheid.155.	The Namibian issue is a test of the efficacy of the United Nations. No Member State therefore can treat it with indifference without betraying the principles that give this Organization its meaning. It is the sacred obligation of every Member of this Organization to co-operate fully in the search for a just solution of this problem. My delegation would therefore support whomever this Organization considers fit to appoint as its Commissioner for that hapless Territory.156.	In order to ensure that the measures decided upon at this session will meet with a greater measure of success  we once again call upon the South African Government  as a Member of this world Organization  to recognize its obligation to co-operate with the United Nations Commissioner for Namibia so that we may bury once and for all one of the last surviving skeletons from the League of Nations. Failure to heed such a call must be taken as disrespect for and lack of interest in our Organization.157.	In Angola and Mozambique  the Portuguese colonial war continues with unabated intensity  punctuated now and then by episodes of wanton massacres of women and children and acts of blatant aggression against neighbouring African Territories.158.	The most recent example of this was the revelation of the massacre of 400 men  women and children in the village of Wiriyamu in the Tete Province of Mozambique. It will be recalled that the Special Committee stated that Portugal could not escape responsibility for its ""barbarous acts"" against the oppressed populations of the Territories under its domination and declared that the evidence gave further proof of the regime's total disregard for human life and basic human values.159.	We would like to endorse fully the Committee's consensus that all individuals representing Portuguese military and civilian authorities involved in the reported atrocities must be placed at the disposal of United Nations representatives for systematic interrogation. 160.	We have seized every possible opportunity to point out that  although the military initiative is Portugal's  yet without the economic and military support of its NATO allies the Portuguese colonial dream would long ago have been abandoned. Consequently  those who give comfort and assistance to the perpetrators of the bestialities of this colonial war must  of necessity  share the blame for its horrible consequences. On this occasion we salute the brave freedom fighters who  against overwhelming odds  are holding high the banner of liberty  and we shall continue to give them every encouragement and support in their just struggle.161.	Closely linked with these colonial problems is that of the policy of apartheid practised by the South African Government.162.	In condemning apartheid we need only to look back to the recent repetition of Sharpeville to establish the fact that time has not improved the position. Unarmed miners were brutally killed in cold blood because they simply asked for better conditions of work. They were not even asking for their lands of which they have been unjustly deprived. How then can we hope for a peaceful solution to apartheid when its perpetrators are also wanton killers.163.	With unrestrained ferocity the South African Government is systematically eradicating all enlightened opposition to its policy of racial segregation and racial oppression  completely insensitive to the feelings of the world community and the aspirations of the vast indigenous majority. It is common knowledge that we have repeatedly appealed to the South African Government  through the Special Committee against Apartheid  the Security Council  OAU and the non-aligned movement  to liberalize its policy of discrimination on the basis of colour. The Manifesto on Southern Africa in particular proposed  in unequivocal terms  an honourable basis for the solution of a most dishonourable problem. In spite of all these endeavours  however  we are again compelled  from this rostrum  painfully to review this unhappy story of man's extreme inhumanity to his fellow man.164.	Given the history of the situation  it is obvious that we can no longer expect any positive voluntary response from the South Africans. Our only hope  therefore  is to appeal to the rest of humanity to redouble its effort to eradicate the stain of apartheid and racial discrimination from the face of the African continent. If we fail to do this  the ghosts of Sharpeville and the blood of the innocent miners will forever haunt the conscience of the world  and the South African situation itself will pose an increasing threat to the peace and security of southern Africa and the world at large. We appeal for a total boycott of South Africa  because again  as with Rhodesia  we feel that the effects of isolation — military  economic  diplomatic and cultural-can only be salutary. We also ask ourselves  however  despite the fact that we believe fervently that membership of our Organization must be as universal as practical  can South Africa  with its blatant disregard of the fundamental principles of our Organization  remain a Member?165.	On the Middle East situation we express the deepest possible concern that the Government of Israel has not to date recognized the wisdom of complying with Security Council resolution 242(1967). Sierra Leone cannot support the acquisition of any territory by any country through force.166.	Earlier in the year we welcomed with great relief the news that armed conflict in Viet-Nam  with its tragic toll of lives and property  was finally being brought to an end through the Paris peace Agreement. Conflicting reports suggest  however  that the embers are still glowing  and we would like to take this opportunity to appeal to all the parties in that conflict to exercise responsibility and restraint if lasting peace is to be restored to the people of that troubled and divided country.167.	In Korea  the continued division of that once united country represents a most delicate situation. As we debate this question for the last time in the General Assembly  we wish to lay great emphasis on the need for the Korean people themselves to be allowed to work together for the reunification of their homeland.168.	In the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent the news of reconciliation among the combatants provides the refreshing evidence of responsible statemanship. we trust this spirit of reconciliation will continue and that before long we shall witness the release and exchange of all remaining prisoners of war  as well as the admission of the new state of Bangladesh into this community of nations. Unhappily however  dark clouds continue to hover over Asia  as evidenced by the Cambodian conflict. With the Vietnamese experience so vivid in our minds  it seems hardly necessary to dwell on the unwisdom of pouring in arms and men in order to try to subdue the determined will of the Cambodian people. 169.	While we welcome the progress made so far in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks  we cannot be complacent about the whole disarmament situation. Nuclear arms continue to pose a very real threat to peace  and the continuation of nuclear tests  particularly in the atmosphere  10 years after the signing of the partial test-van Treaty gives cause for great concern. It should by now be clear to all that nuclear confrontation cannot guarantee universal peace  because the balance of terror can only provide a sense of insecurity. Moreover  the increasing cost of the arms race is such a constant drain on the limited and diminishing resources available for development that its continuation can only perpetuate and widen the development gap and provide evidence of misguided motivation. We have noted with satisfaction the efforts being made by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space to involve the developing countries in the use of benefits of space application.170.	The convening of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  scheduled for Chile in April and May 1974 is becoming more and more uncertain. My delegation supports the holding of this Conference not least because the existence of varying national stands particularly on the question of limits of territorial waters demands consultation and negotiation to harness and exploit man's common heritage for the benefit of all mankind.171.	It is my country's view that the resources of the sea must be exploited like all the other resources of this earth for the benefit of all mankind and that the industrially developed nations must not seek to seize the opportunity of their technological advancement to monopolize the exploitation and utilization of the mineral and living resources of the sea and the sea-bed. Any such attempt would be hazardous in the extreme  for in this day and age it would be stoutly resisted even by the smallest and the poorest of the developing nations.172.	In a rightly motivated world we would not need to be told that the strong must not trample the weak nor the rich exploit the poor. But  alas  this is what obtains today.173.	In 1970  Member States unanimously adopted an International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)]  which aimed at diminishing the gross inequalities in economic growth and material welfare among the nations of this world  and attacking poverty in ways that would improve the conditions of the poorest groups within the poor countries. 174. Three years have now elapsed and the gap which that strategy sought to bridge seems on the conrary to be growing wider every day. Indeed  it is ironical that with the growing entente among the industrial nations  there has developed an attitude of nonchalance towards the poverty-stricken areas of the world. The developed nations have been able to meet neither the goal of a net transfer of 1 per cent of the their gross national product nor the 0.7 per cent target set for the United Nations development decade. 175. My country notes with satisfaction the recent discussions on a new international monetary order and the establishment of a committee of 20 under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund  whose aim is to enlarge the representation of the developing countries. we are convinced that such a step would be useful in remedying the present world monetary crisis and altering the direction of the flow of finance.176.	We are  however  much concerned about the growing protectionism practised by the developed countries against the primary products of the developing nations.177.	My country is quite satisfied with the outcome of the deliberations of the first session of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme  held this year in Geneva. It still maintains the position that the application of technology should be adapted to the realities of the developing countries especially in the field of agriculture and the solution of other environmental problems. During the discussions it became more than evident that whereas the developed countries have been concerned with pollution caused by affluence  the developing countries are groaning under pollution engendered by poverty.178.	Moreover  whereas the developed nations have envisaged the problems of the human environment in terms of scientific and industrial progress  the poorer nations explain them in terms of economic and social inadequacies like unemployment  malnutrition  poor sanitation and shanty towns.179.	Let me end as I began  by reaffirming Sierra Leone's faith in the United Nations. The past contribution of the United Nations to the peace and security of the world has been inestimable. Unique is its future role in evolving a true community of nations  in harmonizing the interests of all  in utilizing the world's limited resources for the benefit of all  and in settling disputes by peaceful means. Sierra Leone pledges to do all in its power to assist the United Nations to achieve its full potential. To do this we are convinced that the situation where one nation can by the exercise — arbitrary or otherwise — of a veto frustrate the wishes and often the collective wisdom of the rest of the entire international community is totally unacceptable. It is also our position that now is an appropriate time for a review of the entire question of the permanent membership of the Security Council.180.	We shall  within and outside this forum  along with any and all other peace-loving nations dedicated to the betterment of the lot of all mankind — especially the underfed  the under-privileged and the oppressed — search for the solutions to our many problems  always conscious that we are our brother's keeper. Sierra Leone undertakes to heed the Secretary-General's reminder in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add.l] that Governments tend to pursue their strict national aims in the United Nations with regard to the Organization as such and we shall seek to take corrective action.181.	The Secretary-General has also pointed out that this body will not develop through ritual public statements of approval and support not backed by inner conviction and he left us  in his closing words  to consider just what kind of world organization we need and are prepared in reality to accept. It is the view of the Sierra Leone Government that the kind of world organization we need is one growing rapidly and steadily from an ineffective world debating forum to an embryonic world parliament with all necessary ancillary legal and physical powers. To this end we stand ready and willing to surrender as much or as little of our national sovereignty to such a world body as is necessary to give the latter reality and meaning.182.	Those are the views of my Government that I have been privileged to present. We state again that one of the fundamental tenets of Sierra Leone's foreign policy has always been support for this Organization. We will continue to follow that tenet  particularly in accordance with the above-mentioned principles."
"104",6284,"SLV",28,1973,"﻿145.	Mr. President  I have the honour of beginning this statement by conveying to you the warmest congratulations of my Government and my delegation on the unanimous agreement reached by the General Assembly in electing you to preside over its twenty-eighth session. Your presence at the head of this Assembly as a distinguished citizen of Ecuador and  in addition  a representative of true Latin Americanism  is a full guarantee of the efficient and harmonious development of its work  since we all recognize that you are a person who possesses in the highest degree the qualities of intellect  experience and broad-mindedness that we need. We should also  in order to be fair  associate ourselves with previous speakers who have recognized the meritorious work of Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  in so ably guiding the work of this General Assembly at the last session.146.	I take pleasure in extending an exceedingly warm welcome to the new Member States of the United Nations  the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. One of the sponsors of the draft resolution for their admission [A/L.698/Rev.l]  as this Assembly knows  was El Salvador  in deference to the spirit of universality which should prevail in this Organization and as a gesture of recognition of the efforts of both Governments to overcome their differences by means of an honourable understanding. Their example is worthy of emulation. My country will always be prepared to support such initiatives which tend to overcome existing problems.e147.	We also wish to extend a welcome to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  with which we shall maintain close relations.148.	This year some aspects of overriding importance command our attention. Some pertain to the structural nature of the Organization itself and others deal with the problems of exceedingly topical importance because of their impact on the foundations of peaceful coexistence among nations  and we shall try to deal with some of those aspects  emphasizing the views which my Government  as a result of continuing detailed consideration  has formulated on these problems.149.	In 1972 the minorities succeeded in blocking the intentions of the significant majorities  thus demonstrating that sometimes  more than numbers  the determination with which causes that are being defended are advanced is more important. The proposal for the revision of the United Nations Charter received an honourable burial in resolution 2968 (XXVII)  which held over to the twenty- ninth session the consideration of the report that the Secretary-General was to prepare on the communications of Governments that had been received before 1 July 1974 concerning the ""desirability"" of a revision of the Charter. The productive section of this resolution is the request to the Secretary-General to bring up to date the Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs.150.	The procedure adopted with respect to the revision of the Charter is obviously a dilatory tactic and in harmony with the interests and intentions of those who  because they find themselves very comfortable  do not wish to change one iota of what has been established which  of course  is frankly contrary to the dynamic nature of modern-day realities.151.	None the less  at the outset of this stage of general statements we have heard raised in this hall the voice of an eminent representative of an influential country authorized to fight for a position which unequivocally implies a modification of the United Nations Charter  in claiming- and we believe that this is intended for the not-too-distant future  —  a change in the composition of the Security Council. While El Salvador  basing itself on the political logic on which this attitude is founded  shares this approach  I should like  following this same logic out to the very end  that the modification should not be limited to a single aspect  the importance of which is self-evident but which of course does not exhaust the series of problems of the Security Council and much less those inherent in the Charter. In accordance with this approach we could offset the spirit of those who consider that it is possible to anticipate that by 1974 new dilatory tactics will be witnessed and that if  finally  the General Assembly takes the appropriate decision  which would be the creation of a special committee with an adequate mandate to consider the revision of the Charter  there will be no dearth of countries that will hesitate to become members of that committee  following the precedent that was set down by the Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference. The way marked out can be followed again by other figures in order to avoid any activity which might be a source of irritation. The revision of the Charter would then  as of today  if this prevailing natural pessimism is not overcome  seem to be doomed to failure.152.	If we postpone the analysis  the alternative would be to examine the establishment of the global action strategy of the United Nations. That involves the spelling out of specific objectives and intermediate goals by stages of achievement of the lofty aims which were adopted in the Charter with their corresponding pace and means of realization. This is to say that it will be appropriate to substitute for the annual improvisation an annual application of stages and goals set down for a certain number of years  and exert every possible effort to ensure that the measures called for in the economic  civic  administrative  social and juridical fields are converted into plans.153.	This exercise would not be theoretical but practical; it would not be a laborious exposition of ideas but a reasoned and reasonable forecast of possible goals in terms of means and foreseeable time-periods. In this era of projections  the United Nations should  at least over the medium range  set up its own system of forecasts. It is paradoxical that what we hope that the United Nations will do in the next five years cannot be forecast with certainty except by guesswork and premonition  while the United Nations  through its specialized agencies and its own bodies  emphasizes the advantages of planning.154.	To the question  ""What do we expect of the United Nations and what can the United Nations offer with regard to political crises? "" it is logical to answer that such matters would not be involved in this exercise because these crises derive from forces  the control of which is beyond the international organizations; but for these contingencies the United Nations should prepare means of action. Thus it is well known that this highest world Organization is lagging in the important area of peace-keeping operations. In respect of many other activities it is possible-and  more than possible  necessary-to bring to bear the experience and the techniques of organization  planning  forecasting and evaluation that the United Nations possesses. And if we follow this course of action which we are recommending  we are sure that it will have its beneficial effects in the similar treatment of the most critical problems that can come before the United Nations for decision when we least expect them to crop up.155.	Moreover  the United Nations must put in order and centralize its human rights activities which at present are widely scattered  and it needs to consider the creation of a council on human rights which would take charge of these matters since  owing to their exceptional importance  they require unified treatment. As the work of the Trusteeship Council diminishes for lack of subject matter  the council on human rights should take its place.156.	We also consider that the Economic and Social Council should have more well-defined powers so that it can carry out its function of co-ordinating activities of specialized agencies by means of consultation.157.	Turning to another activity  the United Nations relief operations  we have noted that these tend to grow and therefore should have their own structure. Just as we have given thought to an organization for the preservation of the human environment  which is limited in many aspects  particularly in regard to the number of staff members and employees  we should think of a relief unit which would organize international assistance in case of natural disasters. To this end  unfortunately  the historical frequency of natural disasters makes it advisable to establish an organism along the lines that I have sketched out which would have a broader organizational structure than that inherent in the function of mere co-ordinator. Accordingly  within the existing Charter we could  in administrative terms  readjust certain activities as a means of working out the global strategy to which I have already referred.158.	The United Nations has maintained a consistent policy against discrimination on the basis of race  sex  religion or nationality. Its work in this respect can be described as positive  because it has helped to strengthen world opinion and to influence national legislation and State policies in order to ensure that every possible vestige of arbitrary discrimination is eliminated. The commissions and committees of the United Nations which are working in this area have shown great energy  which  however  has never been sufficient  inasmuch as discrimination often appears in subtly concealed and stylized forms.159.	Discrimination  which has deep roots in history  is somewhat similar to the legendary hydra of Lerna  because when you cut off one of its seven heads another one grows. The attitude of vigilance and denunciation is necessary in order to keep this disturbing force in the international and internal social order on the defensive.160.	The twenty-fifth anniversary of the International Law Commission marks a milestone in the gradual legal organization of the international community. The book entitled The Work of the International Law Commission sums up the activities of this important Commission over its 25 years of existence. My country  through me  wishes to express its deep appreciation of the Commission and its work.161.	In addition  El Salvador is particularly satisfied because this year one of its most outstanding jurists  Mr. Alfredo Martinez Moreno  was elected a member of the International Law Commission. We wish to offer our thanks to the members of the Commission and their Governments  and on this occasion we should like to restate our intention to contribute in a thoughtful  calm and continuing way to the analysis of the great subjects under discussion in legal circles today. It is relevant to point out here that  among these items  the item on aggression  first discussed by the General Assembly at its fifth session in 1950  was referred to the International Law Commission.162.	This problem  which is indeed a difficult one  last year gave some indication that it was closer to meeting with the proper treatment than had been the case previously  and we should welcome these remote and uncertain signs of light which will break the monotony of years of repetitive meetings and arguments. But we cannot conceal the concern we feel at the fact that the Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression has concentrated its efforts on the definition of direct aggression-which is precisely the type of aggression that tends  relatively  to be less frequent-and has side-stepped the true problem of our times  which is indirect aggression. The United Nations would be rendering very little service to this cause if it were to succeed in defining direct aggression. We can assume as of today that if we could agree on defining direct aggression  we would leave indirect aggression completely untouched  because the great Powers probably would have no interest in a solution to that issue.163.	With respect to aggression  the direct and indirect elements are interconnected in real political life. The fragmentary treatment of the problem  apart from the fact that it would complicate the finding of solutions  creates ambiguous and mistaken values in the development of international life. In any event  what the small countries fear from the great Powers at this time relates more to indirect aggression than to direct aggression.164.	The proclamation of a charter of economic rights and duties of States would undoubtedly be a very important step by the United Nations. Among its first concerns the United Nations wished to finalize a document on the rights and duties of States  drafted within the framework of the legal thinking which was then in vogue. In 1947 the General Assembly entrusted this declaration to the International Law Commission  but in 1951 the Assembly decided to postpone the question indefinitely because  purely and simply  the phraseology of resolution 596 (VI) of 7 December 1951 boils down to this and little more.165.	Today the item has cropped up again  but within a more clearly defined scope  in the sense that it deals with economic rights and duties  and this connotation defines the crucial facet of the problem as it occurs at present in international relations. El Salvador wishes to express its deep interest in this item and its desire that a rational agreement which would be fair to all countries should gradually emerge.166.	GATT and UNCTAD are seeking new models and instruments for international trade. The Bretton Woods monetary system is going through an obvious crisis. The gap between the developed and the developing countries is growing; and if the present state of affairs continues  the historical trend will be perpetuated. The monetary devaluations are accentuating the imbalance in the terms of trade. The integration schemes have encountered great barriers   —   many of them mental   —   and we have learnt with shock and disappointment that what works on paper has great operational drawbacks. The division of labour on a world scale encounters indifference on the part of the developed countries which are powerful competitors in all fields of production. The world development panorama continues to be one that is experimental and in the testing stage  and offers scanty results. But we cannot give up the struggle  and one way and then another must be tried  and renewed inventive efforts will have to be made. In our favour we have the fact that the vital characteristic of mankind is struggle  a course on which the contemporary world is embarked  following the magnet of the guiding principles of justice  freedom and respect  combining these in international relations with the principles of co-operation and solidarity.167.	Political security  although questionable in respect of its efficiency  has a system  namely  economic security  which the Economic and Social Council began to discuss this year but which is still in the planning stage. International justice is barely an idea which is beginning timidly to make its way in international forums. But it has time in its favour. The future international community will have to be governed by international justice  and the great items of the day  such as security and development  will flow from that great fundamental regulating principle.168.	The feeling of the interdependence of the economies of all the countries of the world  in the light of the facts  is totally inadequate and must be supplemented by a definite policy which will reverse the dominant trend of such interdependence  according to which the poles of development and the poles of poverty are becoming more concentrated while moving farther away from each other.169.	It is true that we hear talk about collective economic security  but at the same time we indefinitely postpone the^definition of indirect aggression  one of whose clearest manifestations is economic aggression. Collective economic security must  among its fundamental elements  have the principle which prohibits economic aggression  and to this end we will have to know what economic aggression is  either in general terms or through the enumeration of historically documented cases.170.	Collective economic security entails complicated conditions and elements  such as that concerning the sudden dumping of massive quantities of surplus stockpiles of goods; and this depresses prices.171.	Another vital element of this scheme of security could be the regulation of the exploitation of. the mineral wealth of the sea in order to avoid unfair competition and the economic deterioration of those countries which are producers of minerals on land.172.	The report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Collective economic security: preliminary consideration of the concept  its scope and potential practical implications""13 may serve as a policy of departure for the United Nations to undertake an examination of the important question of collective economic security. To this end  the functions spelled out in the document  such as evaluation of conditions  emergency cases  principles of impartiality and justice  and operational rules  constitute a framework of simple indices for the treatment of this promising field.173.	In a very short time multinational companies have come to the forefront of the world's attention. Their political adventures have led to a rending of the thick veil which covered their quiet  discreet and efficient economic operations  and at present Governments and international organizations find that almost inadvertently these economic giants of multifaceted political loyalty have grown up in their midst. These multinational companies are a reality of modern life. Their structure and operations  and particularly their administration and decision-making centres  differ from those international businesses through which  for example  the Suez Canal was built. First of all  we should get to know them and dispel the relative mystery that surrounds them  and in due course they could be subject to regulations through laws and conventions in order to reduce their role as competitive giants against States and convert them into genuine tools of international economic co-operation and a means to balance the level of development of those States. Thus  the study of these businesses being made by various United Nations bodies is very important. We trust that the study will offer practical guidelines for Governments  both for their domestic legislation and for international conventions. This is an item the consideration of which should be carried out regardless of the time required and the efforts and resources involved. El Salvador is particularly interested in the information that will result from these studies since  because of its high population density and limited natural resources  it sees in the rationalization of the international division of labour a good prospect of development  and in the multinational companies which respect the rules of the game a vehicle for bringing about that rationalization.174.	We also have to give thought to the question how the developing countries could use the pattern of multinational companies by creating their own. For example  it would be worth-while exploring multinational coffee-exporting companies. In other words  we would have to sketch out a two-way street with respect to multinational companies. To this end  as a basic element  nothing can replace the importance of a proper knowledge of these companies. The United Nations  which has produced objective  detailed and thorough technical studies  has here another field in which to show its objectivity and its abilities.175.	El Salvador has supported speedy and effective action by the United Nations in respect to terrorism. Nevertheless  last year we abstained in the vote on the relevant resolution [resolution 3034 (XXVII)] because at that very late hour of the twenty-seventh session  on 18 December 1972  the failure of the resolution would have led to an absolute vacuum and  therefore  resulted in inaction for a year. At least the matter was kept alive and a committee was created  whose mandate is to present recommendations. Those recommendations will serve as the point of departure for the General Assembly to take up this problem with the  calm and determination which are inherent in its high status.176.	At this session the Assembly is not studying item 94 on terrorism as a means of antagonizing anyone in particular  nor as a concealed recourse to support this or the other party in any particular dispute  nor to detract from anti-colonialist struggles. The Assembly is studying its international aspects  its aspects which concern relations between States  to the extent that it can swell the rampant forces of hate  vengeance  and merciless conflict and  therefore  contribute to a mental climate of tension and even crazy actions and reactions. The Assembly must consider this problem at the political level  but in addition it must judge it also from the moral and humanitarian standpoint. Indeed  this Assembly  although eminently political  cannot and should not remove itself from the basic principles of international morality and humanitarianism.177.	The Secretary-General proposed the inclusion of this item in the agenda of the twenty-seventh session  in response to a general clamour. The objectivity which the treatment of this delicate question demands begins with its sponsorship by the Secretary-General. For indeed  the Secretary-General  who is a political functionary  must renounce  in order correctly to discharge his duties  a comfortable passivity and a cold observation of the facts. He is compelled to analyse world problems and to submit relevant proposals to the competent bodies. In this instance his initiative was timely. The Secretary-General  deeply involved in the most burning problems  but in the interest of the defence of general interests  makes proposals and recommendations which deserve respect because of the high post that he holds  the confidence which he enjoys on the part of Governments  and in particular because of the intrinsic merit of such proposals and recommendations.178.	With regard to terrorism we must distinguish between matters relating to the internal affairs of States and matters of an international character. The United Nations is being asked to promote and organize co-operation against the scourge of terrorism in respect of matters within its competence  or  that is to say  in the aspects  projections and effects that this phenomenon has with respect to international relations. A study of the causes of this social phenomenon is very important  but we cannot wait until that study of the causes is concluded in order to organize preventive and defensive international co-operation. The dispute continues about the causes of crime  but meanwhile there are penal codes. The psychological motivations of aircraft hijackers are being studied  yet nevertheless we have enacted conventions protecting passengers and crews  which have been ratified by many States Members of the United Nations. A study of causes-however important-if transformed into a prerequisite for international action  would put off the treatment of the problem to the Greek Calends. If converted into political logic  this very respectable academic logic would function as a dilatory tactic.179.	We must point out that the General Assembly  in the aforementioned resolution  did not take any measures to study the causes of terrorism  perhaps because it understood that this is a job that is more appropriate for the specialized agencies  or because it considers such a complicated matter lies beyond its possibilities.180.	A year has passed and the question of the causes  which is still included in the item  has not been touched upon. This must be taken into consideration in dealing with the matter during the current session.181.	Terrorism destroys innocent lives  causes damage which exceeds that which normally belligerents are exposed to  disturbs the normal means of communication  sows distrust and uncertainty and creates an atmosphere of threat and fear which generates a chain of actions and reactions which can explode into a real holocaust because there is no force like fear in inciting men to commit so many irrational acts. The Preamble of the United Nations Charter recalls the essential values which are being trampled under foot by terrorism-namely  fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of the human person.182.	In order to discharge its responsibility in this area  the United Nations must set itself seriously to the preparation of a draft convention on international co-operation to combat terrorism. During the preparation of this draft there will be an opportunity to hear and take duly into consideration the positions of those who  with reason  wish to avoid having this item used as an instrument to infringe  limit or distort certain principles on which the general policy of the United Nations is based. But we must also point out that proper consideration of these principles should not be transformed in an opportunity to expose or distort fundamental human rights such as the right to life  or the dignity and the intrinsic worth of the human person.183.	The United Nations Charter establishes as the principal purpose of the United Nations the maintenance of international peace and security  and to that end  the taking of effective measures to prevent and eliminate threats to the peace and acts of aggression. In compliance with this very noble objective  the United Nations  on various occasions  has found itself compelled to adopt truly effective collective measures  such as the use of armed force.184.	The United Nations forces  in raising the noble standard of war for the restoration of peace  have had to act on the plains of Korea  in the deserts of Palestine  and in the fields of the Congo. Without having any contractual obligations on this point  these forces have endeavoured to adhere to the rules of civilized behaviour in time of war.185.	El Salvador considers that the United Nations  —  not only in order properly to discharge its mission of peace within the framework of juridical principles which are of permanent value  but also to set an example to Member countries that still have not done so-should in its capacity as an unquestioned subject of international law sign the conventions of The Hague and Geneva  in so far as is appropriate  because we cannot conceive how the Organization could exert force in order to preserve peace and halt aggression  have a Military Staff Committee and be able legitimately to use armed force  without at the same time having its armed force  formally and in a binding manner  made subject to this body of legal principles based on humanitarian concepts.186.	At the present time  war is prohibited under the law. None the less  it is a fact that there continue to be warlike disputes in the world. Hence  there is justification for principles which would make such conflicts less inhumane. The United Nations cannot remain outside the framework of principles which have acquired at the present time a basis which is largely humanitarian in nature.187.	With the creation and development of international organizations as a means for maintaining peaceful international coexistence and improving in all aspects the conditions of the life of man  it is no longer possible to maintain that only States are the subject of international law; rather  doctrine and custom have come to recognize the entitlement of international organizations to be subject to such law. The diplomatic privileges and immunities of international organizations  the power which some of them  or their subordinate bodies  have to request advisory opinions of the International Court of Justice  their international responsibilities and their capacity  —  which is inherent in their very existence  —  to sign treaties between themselves or with States all bear me out in what I say.188.	On this basis  El Salvador proposes to the General Assembly that it should study the most appropriate manner of ensuring that  as soon as possible  the United Nations should become a party to the international conventions which seek fair treatment for persons shipwrecked and injured in war  respect for war prisoners  the outlawing of unnecessarily destructive weapons  the safeguarding of the cultural and historical patrimony of a country in times of armed conflict  and the protection of civilians in time of war: in sum  this admirable group of conventions which constitutes the so-called humanitarian law of war.189.	It is high time that the United Nations should take a position in the vanguard of the observance of such noble principles  and in a short time it should  therefore  offer its unlimited adhesion to  and formal support of  the aforesaid conventions.190.	The date of the beginning of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is approaching  and we therefore have an opportunity to test the hopes and fear  the agreements and disagreements  the points of concord and conflict with respect to the seas  the last frontier for natural resources. Apart from the sea there remain no resources on a scale available for exploitation  at least in the present state of technology and the foreseeable state of this technology for a number of centuries to come. As the earth's non-renewable resources diminish  because of the increasing consumption day by day  the importance of the sea grows.191.	How the sea will be exploited in the next few decades and what will be the participation of each Government are questions which have to be answered by the Third Conference. A system of reasonable exploitation  of equitable co-participation  of judicious preservation of the marine environment and of international co-operation must be the subject of a great deal of thought  of wise negotiation and a sense of understanding and co-operation.All of the parties concerned can easily agree on general guidelines  that the discrepancies will prove to be very deep as soon as we consider the ways of putting into effect these broad general guidelines in dealing with specific and concrete subjects. The task of the Third Conference is  to say the least  impressive by the complexity of the subject matter  because of the divergence of interests which will have to be reconciled  and because of the very different economic and geographical circumstances of the participants in the negotiations.192.	The difficult problems that will have to be solved by the Third Conference do derive not from any particular will of any State  but rather from the coexistence of differing circumstances which give rise to opposing interests. The multifaceted issues which are potentially subject to regulation reflect the interests of more than 130 States which can nevertheless  broadly speaking  be reduced to a few groups: for example  coastal States and land-locked States; States located on the shores of seas whose limits exceed any of the rules under consideration now and States which are so close to each other that the application of these and other rules which have been considered give rise to problems of confrontation and conflict; States with broad continental shelves and States without a continental shelf; States with islands remote from their continental shores and States that are nothing but islands; States whose territorial waters span international straits and States interested in the use of such straits.193.	Land frontiers were established after centuries of fluctuations in which empires rose and fell. The desire for self-determination finds itself hampered by the will to hegemony. The distribution of land  therefore  has evoked a history of rivalries  discord and war  of maps that have been changed hundreds of times. But the distribution of the seas must be accomplished  —  considering the States to be arbitrators - by means of negotiations and conventions  that is to say  within a legal order in the structure of which all States will join freely and voluntarily. And this distribution  furthermore  must be made taking into account the general interest  as well as the special interests represented by States. States will be the principal subjects  but they will not be absolutes or absolutists; rather they will be subjects limited by the presence of other States of equal stature and also by the existence of interests which are those of all inhabitants of the earth. The distribution of the seas should not repeat the distribution of the land according to absolutist concepts of sovereignty; it must rather be based on the decentralized distribution of rights  obligations and responsibilities.194.	Some developing countries have defined their positions in the sense that an equitable distribution of real opportunities in respect of the sea must contain  inter alia  the recognition of a broad zone  not greater than 200 miles  in which the coastal States will have sufficient competence to use these resources as a supplement to their land resources. This national zone is consistent with local and regional arrangements-for example  with integrated maritime zones when geography makes this necessary-and with recognition of the equal rights and interests of the land-locked States  This national zone  which primarily would be economic in content  would have to correspond to reasonable requirements relating to the preservation ofthe marine environment and the ecological balance  and would be legally and politically compatible with the requirements of international navigation. Moreover  and inasmuch as we never legislate for all eternity  the arrangements to be worked out would be understood to be contingent upon the existence of the present circumstances obtaining in the international community. And  of course  to the extent that the economic and technological gaps between the developed and the under-developed countries would diminish-although this might still be a distant prospect  —  it would become necessary to revise the rules adopted  and  possibly to devise another regime of the seas.195.	My Government is and has been particularly concerned by the periodic carrying out of nuclear testing in the Pacific Ocean-both by the fact in itself and by the effects of such tearing on the natural environment. El Salvador joins with those States which have raised a loud protest at the repetition of these tests  and trusts that they will not be repeated in future.196.	To conclude  I should like to refer to a matter which is in the forefront of the concerns of our people and Government  and that is the progress of direct negotiations between El Salvador and Honduras.197.	On such an important question I can state that the present status of these negotiations is highly promising; since 15 September the negotiators of both countries have been meeting in Mexico  a country which generously  and doing honour to its traditions as a Pan-American nation  has been offering its good offices for a peaceful settlement ever since the inception of the conflict.198.	Moreover  the concern and the interest which have been expressed consistently on this question by other19brother countries of Central America have undoubtedly been decidedly favourable factors in the attainment of the present state of the negotiations. As the culminating factor I should like to point to the recent meeting of the Presidents of Honduras and El Salvador fostered by the gesture made in the truest Central American spirit by the President of Guatemala  General Carlos Arana Osorio.199.	The present conversations are being carried out in an atmosphere of great cordiality and with a sense of practical consideration  which leads us to trust that the results will be good.200.	El Salvador  at this time when a just and fair settlement of the dispute with the Republic of Honduras looms on the horizon  reaffirms in this highest world forum its spirit of true Central Americanism  based on human rapprochement and the collective will to rebuild our common nationality.201.	The problems of Central America are not of course only a question of improving a market or defining a frontier. On the contrary  to magnify this matter which is conducive to division would detract energy from the effort at a true and deeper integration. We cannot and must not avoid the concrete realities which circumstances impose on us  but it is counter-productive to convert them into essential factors for the historic future of the region.202.	My Government wishes to repeat that it will exert all of its goodwill and determination to find a final  realistic and worthy solution of this dispute which goes to the very roots of the development of Central American life."
"105",6356,"SOM",28,1973,"﻿354.	 Mr. President  on behalf of the Government of the Somali Democratic Republic  it is my privilege to join with my fellow representatives in congratulating you on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. We are confident that your wisdom and guidance will greatly contribute to the success of the session  and my delegation pledges to you  Sir  its full co-operation.355.	My delegation also wishes to express to your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  its appreciation of his efficient and skilful handling of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly.356.	I wish also to welcome the admission of the German Democratic Republic  the Federal Republic of Germany and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to the United Nations. The accession of these three States to ourOrganization is a clear indication that the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination and the principle of universality of membership in the United Nations are both acquiring an ever greater recognition.357.	Following the renewed acts of aggression launched by Israel last Saturday against Egypt and Syria  the situation in the Middle East has drastically deteriorated and fully justifies international concern  for such a situation could have tragic consequences for world peace and security  The Somali Democratic Republic unreservedly condemns Israel for its repeated aggression against the Arab States and for breaking once again the already fragile peace in the Middle East. The General Assembly must strongly condemn Israel for this latest provocative act of aggression; otherwise it would be failing in its primary duty. Furthermore  the Assembly must immediately take the initiative of asking Israel to withdraw its forces from all the occupied Arab territories which it seized in 1967 so that an end to the violence of war now in progress could be promptly brought about.358.	My Government shares the disappointment of the majority of Member States that progress towards a clarification of the issues  and therefore towards a solution of the Middle East problem on the basis of accepted principles of international law  was impeded last July. I refer to the United States veto in the Security Council of a draft resolution that had gained solid support from an overwhelming majority of the Council's membership. In this connexion  my delegation fully endorses the resolution by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of [OAU] at its tenth ordinary session and presented to the United Nations General Assembly by the current Chairman of that organization  General Yakubu Gowon  the President of Nigeria  a few days ago [2141st meeting]. We also applaud the forthright decision of the Republic of Zaire to break off diplomatic relations with Israel  as announced to the world by President Mobutu Sese Seko during his address to the General Assembly on 4 October 1973 [2140th meeting]. It is our strong hope that all those who have a sincere concern for the cause of peace and justice in the Middle East will follow suit.359.	The task before the United Nations with regard to the Middle East is not the devising of so-called balanced resolutions as though the problem was one of literary composition rather than of political realities. United Nations action must reflect the facts of the situation  which are that Egypt and Jordan have co-operated with United Nations peace initiatives and Israel has adamantly refused to do so.360.	The consensus of the United Nations membership is that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) is a just and practicable basis for peace. But Israel has refused to accept its main responsibilities under that resolution by stating that it will never withdraw to the pre-June 1967 de facto boundaries and by ignoring the question of the Palestine refugees. On the other hand  Egypt and Jordan have acceded to every requirement of resolution 242 (1967) that concerns them  in response to the United Nations peace initiative undertaken by Ambassador Jarring. They have stated clearly and unequivocally their willingness to terminate all states of belligerency and to acknowledge thesovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries  free from threats or acts of force.361.	Israel calls for negotiations without conditions  but its exceptions to this position are so notable as to make it inoperable. There is the exception of Arab Jerusalem  whose return has been declared non-negotiable and where a I frantic rush is being made to change the Arab composition and character of the Old City; where  too  the sacred trust of the spiritual and aesthetic integrity of three great religions is being betrayed by political expediency and crass materialism. There are the exceptions of Sharm el Sheikh and the paramilitary settlements in the Sinai desert. There are the exceptions on the west bank of the Jordan where more paramilitary settlements and a linking highway are being established as part of a plan for a ""security belt"" within occupied Arab territory. There is also the significant movement of the Arab population in Gaza and the assertion that the Golan Heights will not be returned to Syria.362.	If there were any doubts about the true nature of Israel's annexationist and expansionist policies  they should be dispelled by the fact that the dominant Labour Party has put forward as a major platform in its elections campaign the establishment of new Israeli settlements in the occupied territories and a plan for the public and private purchase of Arab land. All these positions and activities contravene the United Nations Charter  numerous United Nations resolutions  and the provisions of relevant international conventions.363.	In the light of these facts  it is difficult to see how any State can support Israel's position and claim with credibility to support resolution 242 (1967) as well. The efforts of all who seek peace with justice in the Middle East must be directed towards ending Israel's illegal occupation of Arab territory and towards restoring the inalienable rights of the Palestinian refugees. The plight of the Palestinians still remains at the heart of the Middle East problem.364.	No settlement would be complete or lasting unless this long-standing injustice is ended and the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians are satisfied. This fact is universally acknowledged in principle and almost universally ignored in practice.365.	On 24 September last  a new independent State was proclaimed by the Popular National Assembly of Guinea-Bissau. On behalf of the people and Government of my country  I wish to salute from this rostrum the birth of a new sister State in Guinea-Bissau to which my Government has already extended diplomatic recognition.366.	This jubilant event illustrates in a dramatic way the validity and the effectiveness of the African liberation movements. The success of the long and arduous struggle led by PAIGC provides a symbol of hope for those other peoples still under colonial domination. It is a warning to the colonialist and racist oppressors that they are not invincible and that the spirit of freedom can and will prevail.367.	The primary task of the new State of Guinea-Bissau is to complete the expulsion of Portuguese forces from the rest of its territory and from Cape Verde. In this task it will need as much diplomatic and material support so that the consolidation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity can be firmly established. All those States which give such support will show their concern for human rights and human dignity  and for the achievement of an important goal of the United Nations — that of self-determination and independence for all peoples. This goal is closely linked to the principle of universality in the United Nations  for only when all subjugated peoples are free to take their places in the family of nations  will true universality have been accomplished. We  therefore  look forward to an early admission of the new State of Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations.368.	In this connexion  I should like to pay tribute to the memory of all those Guinean patriots who have paid the price of this victory with their own lives and we pay special homage to the memory of the late leader of PAIGC  Amilcar Cabral  who died at the hands of the forces of oppression.369.	The recent tragic events in Chile  where the legitimate Government of the late President Salvador Allende was overthrown by the most reactionary elements within the armed forces  provide a vivid example of the menace to the developing world of the forces of imperialism represented by multinational corporations. All who believe in the. philosophy and goals of Salvador Allende will condemn the combination of foreign interests that effected his overthrow and will strongly condemn the brutal manner in which his work was interrupted.370.	At this point  I should like to pay homage to the memory of Salvador Allende Gossens  the late President of Chile  who paid with his life for his loyalty to his ideals and whose tragic and untimely death is a blow to the cause which he pursued with so much dedication  namely  the cause of social justice.371.	The tragedy in Chile  which fully justifies international concern  provides also another vivid example of how the combined forces of imperialism and reactionary foreign interests can replace those of peaceful revolution for social change.372.	This subject should be examined by the United Nations because it is becoming all too apparent that these elements can and do use the great political and economic influence they command to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign States.373.	The United Nations must also be concerned about these events because the reactionary military junta is not only hounding down and executing supporters of the legitimate socialist Government of the late President  but are subjecting foreign nationals and property to their harshly repressive measures. A Member State  Cuba  has already lodged a complaint to the Security Council in this regard. It is to be hoped that the pressure of international opinion will serve to end  for citizens and-non-citizens alike  the reign of terror and the suppression of fundamental human rights in that unfortunate country.374.	The twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly is taking place against a background of what is considered by many a detente in international relations. My Government cautiously welcomes the easing of tensions in some areas of the world. There is clear evidence that such areas have moved away from a cold-war atmosphere and that peaceful coexistence among the nations concerned is no longer an optimistic slogan. This development can be seen in the bilateral and multilateral agreements between European nations in the last three years and in the meetings which have resulted in the establishment of peaceful and better relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and between the United States Government and the People's Republic of China. There is further evidence of this spirit of detente in the Helsinki Conference  which initiated a period of East-West co-operation in economic  industrial  cultural  scientific and environmental affairs and which set in motion concrete efforts to reduce military tensions.375.	It is the conviction of my Government that the achievement of the easing of tensions in the parts of the world I have already referred to owes much to the fact that for nearly three decades now the statesmen of the world and representatives of Member States have been acquiring the habit of international co-operation at the United Nations and its agencies.376.	Everything that happens in world politics is reflected at the United Nations. However  the Organization is not merely a mirror of the world situation — it is a training ground for the acquisition of the habit of international cooperation in political as in other fields.377.	The achievement of the Organization in instilling the habit of international co-operation is indeed unspectacular but steady and it is of significant importance  for the habit must be learnt if the structure of peace is to be built.378.	The more obvious successes of the Organization in the economic  social  scientific and humanitarian fields underline the necessity of the existence of an established machinery for global action. Each year sees the expansion of United Nations activity into new and exciting areas of human experience and endeavour such as the protection of the environment and the use of the sea-bed  oceans and space.379.	It is in this context that my Government would like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General and to the various agencies of the United Nations for their efforts in organizing  over the past year  relief assistance to many countries which were hit by natural disasters.380.	Following the tragic results of the earthquake in Nicaragua  were the equally tragic famine conditions in parts of India  major floods in Pakistan and the overwhelming tragedy of the drought that has wreaked havoc on the people and economies of several countries in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of west and central Africa.381.	The Somali Democratic Republic has suffered from occasional droughts and so we can appreciate fully the way such disasters retard national development and shatterins which have been formulated on the basis of limited resources. In such circumstances  the developing countriessometimes require international assistance so that normal conditions can be restored.382.	My Government was glad to witness the excellent organization that has been established by the Secretary-General to deal with crisis situations in a co-ordinated manner. We will certainly give favourable consideration to the Secretary-General's plan  endorsed by the Economic and Social Council  to devise an over-all international strategy to provide the required co-ordination for medium-and long-term assistance to countries affected by large-scale natural disasters.383.	It is another positive contribution to the cause of peace that regional co-operation has become as much a part of the world scene as international co-operation. OAU  which celebrated its tenth anniversary this year  is in a very real sense a positive outgrowth of the United Nations  and its existence and effective functioning for the past decade have made it as significant to African peace and progress as the United Nations is to world peace and progress.384.	Like the United Nations  the OAU is more often criticized for its failures than praised for the steady progress it is making in every area of regional co-operation. My Government believes that the record of the OAU is an impressive one and that it will continue to improve as the benefits of regional co-operation become increasingly apparent.385.	Another aspect of the agreement of general policy reached by the African Heads of State and Government last May  and one which my Government considers of particular importance  is the unanimous support of African States for the principle of non-alignment. We regard this as a positive force and one that has contributed to the advent of the era of international detente.386.	The Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973  of 76 non-aligned States demonstrated the fact that the principle of non-alignment has now attracted a clear majority of the Member States of the United Nations  and that the third world is a highly significant factor in international affairs.387.	My Government supports the consensus of the Conference that it is time for the United Nations to recognize that the third world should be given a greater voice  and that such a change could best be made by abolishing or limiting the veto system of the major Powers.388.	We also support the insistence of the non-aligned States that principles of international law should be upheld  particularly in the context of the Middle East where Israel refuses to accept the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war. We of course identify ourselves strongly with the concern of the non-aligned States for human rights shown in their decision to give active support to the African liberation movements. We share  too  the aspirations of other peace-loving States in the call for disarmament in general  and nuclear disarmament in particular. One of the results of the non-aligned Conference we consider of immediate practical value is the agreement on presenting a solid third world front in negotiations for establishing33equitable arrangements and conditions for trade with the developed countries  and agreement on the principle that developing countries have the right fully to control their natural resources.389.	The de-escalation of the American military involvement in South-East Asia is  we hope  another step towards world peace. The end of the war in Viet-Nam can be described as the removal of a cancer from the international body politic. Small nations can now hope that ' a heightened sense of international morality will in future protect them against being used as pawns in the game of international power politics. My Government trusts that not only the people of Viet-Nam but also those of Laos and Cambodia  who have suffered illegal  wanton and highly destructive bombing attacks  will now be permanently free from the terrors of a particularly inhuman aggression.390.	The people of South-East Asia must  like any other people  be left alone to determine for themselves their political future  free from outside pressures and interferences. Their wish for  and indeed their right to  political self-determination must be scrupulously respected.391.	It is evident that the Cambodian people look to the return of Prince Norodom Sihanouk for the restoration of unity and stability to their country. My Government recognizes the Royal Government of National Union headed by Prince Sihanouk  whom we regard as the legitimate Cambodian Chief of State and who has the support of the majority of the people. We hope that it will soon be possible for him to be in a position to lead his country once again to unity  peace and progress.392.	A most welcome development is the creation of a coalition Government in Laos. For 20 years the internal divisions of that country were sharpened and unnecessarily prolonged by foreign interference and by the pressure of external events. The present coalition agreement is evidence of the ability and willingness of the Laotian people to work for national reconciliation. My Government hopes that foreign disengagement from Laos will be genuine and complete so that a lasting peace can be achieved in that country.393.	In the context of the welcome dissipation of cold war tensions  the Government of the Somali Democratic Republic hopes that Member States will agree  at this session of the General Assembly  to end another unfortunate legacy of the past — namely  the continued presence in Korea of what is known as the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea [UNCURK] and of American armed forces under the so-called ""United Nations Command"".394.	The internal dialogue which is continuing between the Governments of the North and South has given the Korean question a new climate  a climate in which it is possible for the General Assembly to hold a full and objective debate on this issue. The welcome presence of representatives of the Government of North Korea  who for the first time are attending the General Assembly as observers  will give balance and validity to such a debate.395.	The task before the General Assembly is clear: ii is to correct the mistakes of the past. It was a mistake  initially  for the world Organization to have given up its role as mediator and to have taken sides in a cold war issue. That mistake is compounded by the continued presence in South Korea of foreign armed forces under the United Nations flag. Their presence is a symbol of threat and hostility  and is one of the main stumbling blocks to the reconciliation and reunification of the Korean people.396.	As far as UNCURK is concerned  it is obvious that the time is long overdue for the dissolution of a body which has itself declared that it serves no useful purpose  and whose one-sided approach ill befits a United Nations peacekeeping operation.397.	The realities of today must now be reflected in the establishment of normal conditions in Korea. The question of reunification and other internal questions can be decided only by the Korean people themselves. Now that they have formulated and accepted the principles on the basis of which they intend to proceed towards reunification  it is clear that UNCURK and the so-called ""United Nations Command"" represent unwarranted interference in the internal affairs of that country. Their presence can only hamper the creation of conditions likely to bring about the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea. If they are allowed to remain  it will mean that the lessons of the tragic wars in South-East Asia have not been learned.398.	Progress in building the structure of peace has undoubtedly been made in some areas  but the structure remains glaringly incomplete while over 31 million people in southern Africa are still victims of apartheid and of cruel and oppressive colonialism. It would be a great setback to the cause of international security if  in the atmosphere of satisfaction over the allaying of tensions in Europe and South-East Asia  the crimes of apartheid and colonialism in southern Africa were to be overlooked or relegated to an unimportant position on the list of international priorities.399.	We do not look for new insights or for the making of new judgements about the southern African situation. The international community has long been aware that apartheid  with its elements of genocide  and representing as it does a national commitment to racism and all the injustices that spring from it  is one of the historic crimes against humanity. The international community has long accepted the fact that colonialism  by its very nature  is an exploitative system that easily lends itself to racism and to the withholding of the human rights of peoples under colonial domination.400.	But just as the character of apartheid and of colonialism remains unchanged so  unfortunately  do the attitudes of those States that are most' able to exercise leadership in the economic  political and social isolation of the minority regimes of southern Africa. They remain as unmoved by recent examples of the brutality of the racist regimes as they have been by the gross injustices of the past decade in South Africa  Namibia  Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and the Territories colonized by Portugal. They are apparently also able to rationalize their complacency and indifference with easy consciences.401.	One might ask why it is that American big business is prepared to demand the emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel as a quid pro quo for trade agreements with the Soviet Union  but finds it impracticable to attempt to put economic pressure on the South African Government with regard to the elimination of apartheid But this is only one example of the indifference of the highly industrialized States of the Western alliance towards the plight of the majority of the people of South Africa. An example of the rationalization of this indifference is given by those who assert that contributing to the expansion of the South African economy will erode apartheid by a natural process. This unrealistic but convenient approach ignores the more fundamental political  social and coercive arrangements which dehumanize non-white South Africans and make them powerless to control their destinies.402.	It is also asserted that financial assistance and the supply of arms to Portugal are not given for the purpose of supporting its colonial war  although it is obvious that without such support the Portuguese effort to suppress the African struggle for freedom and self-determination could not continue.403.	The minority regimes have also been making new attempts to cover up and justify the evils of their racist societies. New constitutional arrangements in the African territories still under Portuguese domination or small economic concessions to black workers in South Africa are cited as evidence of the benevolence of these racist regimes. But cover-ups and rationalizations have been completely discredited by recent events. The revelation  on the basis of evidence from unimpeachable sources  that terrible atrocities have been committed against hundreds of innocent villages in Mozambique has received world-wide publicity. In their colonial war against Africans fighting legitimately against colonial domination  the Portuguese have already used napalm  defoliants and herbicides to terrorize the African populations. Now they have resorted to ""the systematic genocidal massacre of villages"" — to quote a report from Spanish missionaries.404.	In numerous resolutions  the United Nations has called on Portugal's NATO partners to stop the supply of armaments that enables Portugal to carry on this unjust and cruel war. Will there be as little response to the latest evidence of Portuguese brutality as there has been in the past to the use of internationally proscribed forms of warfare? It seems very likely. There have been protests from people all over the world against the barbarities of the Portuguese army  but the Governments whose generous support makes the Portuguese war of oppression possible  have maintained a deafening silence.405.	The other event which should shatter any complacency that has developed about the southern African scene is the recent killing of 11 mine workers in the Western deep mine in Carletonville  South Africa. The killing dramatizes a basic fact about South African society which may have been forgotten. As Chief Butelezi expressed it  ""a black life is regarded as very cheap in South Africa"". That comment is relevant to the shooting of workers protesting against patent economic injustice; it covers the whole enormous economic gap between black and white in South Africa and the system which keeps thisgap a constant of South African society. It covers  most of all  the inhuman  slave-like conditions which are considered suitable for hundreds of thousands of African breadwinners who must live herded together like cattle in compounds and who are denied the rights of normal family life.406.	In spite of what is common knowledge of conditions in southern Africa  the minority regimes will no doubt continue to receive the arms they need for the suppression of the non-white peoples of southern Africa; the trade and investments they need to shore up their unjust systems; the moral support they need through social and diplomatic intercourse to prove to themselves and to the world that they are not complete outcasts and that their crimes are acceptable in the highest circles of the international community.407.	This session of the General Assembly will be presented with a draft Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid; and it is important that this convention be established as a norm of international law. But will the convention be observed and enforced by the allies of the minority regimes any more than the arms embargo against South Africa or the sanctions against the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia  or any of the numerous resolutions which reflect the consensus of international opinion about the southern African situation? The outlook is not hopeful.408.	One may well ask whether it is an exercise in futility for the African Members of the United Nations  for their non-aligned and third world friends and for the many other supporters of the cause of African liberation to come here  year after year  and ask for co-operation  from the Western Powers and Japan  in the international campaign against apartheid and colonialism. The time has come for a more widespread realization of the fact  emphasized in the Mogadishu Declaration of 1971 by the Seventh Summit Conference of East and Central African States and sanctioned by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of OAU in Rabat last year  that the road to freedom for African peoples living under apartheid and colonialism is through armed struggle waged by their own liberation movements and through the help that can be given to those movements by all who have an honest concern for human rights and human liberties. The victory of the heroic people of Guinea-Bissau is the most recent example of that fact.409.	A most welcome example of practical action in assisting the liberation movements has been given recently by the Scandinavian countries  in particular Norway  whose Government is in favour of giving increased humanitarian and other forms of financial assistance to the peoples of dependent areas who are fighting for their national liberation. Putting the question in its proper perspective  the Norwegian Government has rightly emphasized that such aid is based on the United Nations Charter and on General Assembly and Security Council decisions  and that it must be seen as a normal  internationally accepted duty. That is how aid to the liberation movements has long been viewed by OAU. It is the approach to the southern African problem that has been endorsed by 76 nations of the non-aligned group. It deserves the widest support and emulation.410.	My Government continues to be concerned about the elimination of the remaining vestiges of colonialism not only in large areas of southern Africa but also in smaller colonial territories such as Spanish Sahara  the Comoro Islands  the Seychelles Islands and French Somaliland. The legitimate aspirations of the people of these territories continue to be kept in restraint by the ruling colonial Powers because of their own military  strategic and economic interests — a state of affairs which is contrary to the Charter and to the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.411.	My Government has  of course  a very special interest in French Somaliland  a neighbouring territory. The question of French Somaliland has been before the decolonization Committee"" since 1965 and the status of the Territory remains clearly that of a colonial dependency. Decisions of the Territorial Assembly have to be communicated to the French High Commissioner before being published or implemented and can be annulled at will by the French Minister for Overseas Departments and Territories. In addition  important matters such as control of immigration  law and order  currency and foreign relations  come within the exclusive control of the French Government. Several referendums and elections have been held in French Somaliland within the past 15 years —  supposedly to determine the wishes of the people about their status. But it is notorious that these procedures have not been conducted in a climate free from political and other intimidation. My Government strongly hopes that the question of French Somaliland will continue to be viewed with concern by the United Nations in order to secure for the people of that Territory the free exercise of their right to self-determination  free from the intimidations to which I have just referred.412.	It is within the context of the frustrations and sufferings of peoples such as the Palestinian refugees and the oppressed peoples of southern Africa that my Government views the question of international terrorism. We are not indifferent to the tragedies which occur when innocent people become the victims of terrorists who use violent methods to dramatize their cause. But our greatest concern must be for violence which unjustly excludes over a million Palestinians from their native land; the violence of racism which brutalizes millions in southern Africa; or the violence that subjects small States to large-scale military aggression by a bigger Power.413.	Obviously  there is a strong desire on the part of those countries most affected by international terrorism to put into immediate effect measures to combat the problem. But it would be an even greater contribution to the cause of peace and security if the same urgency  which some nations feel about protecting the rights of the few  could be directed towards the removal of the chronic violence which is the condition of life for millions in the Middle East and southern Africa.414. There is no lack of effective measures or just solutions to the underlying causes of international terrorism and to the underlying causes of those legitimate wars of""Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.liberation to which the minority regimes of southern Africa would attach the label of terrorism. And so it is pertinent to ask why powerful States which have dragged their feet for the past 26 years on the question of the plight of a million Palestinians and that of 31 million victims of apartheid and colonialism are today anxious to take action which might give an air of legality to the suppression of the cause of freedom in Africa and which would certainly demonstrate to the Palestinian people that there is no equality in the justice that is meted out in the name of the United Nations.415.	What stand is the world community to take on terrorism when the Government of a Member State —  Israel — itself indulges openly in terrorism  formerly the preserve of the hopeless and the desperate? What credible action can the United Nations take now  when Israel resorts to terrorist raids  brutal murders and the hijacking and shooting down of civilian aircraft — acts which have violated the sovereignty of a peaceful neighbour State  violated the rule of law in international civil aviation and violated the most elementary codes of human and civilized behaviour?416.	If Governments in the national sphere were to use the methods of those who are driven by whatever ""causes to desperate and criminal acts rather than duly prescribed legal processes  there would be national chaos. Similarly  there will be international chaos if Israel's actions are allowed to set a precedent and to go unreprimanded and unpunished.417.	There must be general recognition of the fact that violence and terrorism engendered by a deep-seated sense of injustice cannot be combated with more terrorism. They can be dealt with only by the restoration of justice and human rights to those who have been deprived of them.418.	In conclusion  I should like to express a sense of optimism about the future of international co-operation as it applies to political as well as to economic and social goals. Obviously  it would be unrealistic not to recognize the fact that many States  particularly some of the major Powers  do not yet accept all the implications of the Charter and are not yet prepared to put international peace and security above national self-interest. Still  I believe that the time must come when the international ideal will be fully accepted and when the machinery of peace will be fully used. However unsatisfactory the short-term results of our present efforts for peace may seem  in the long run they cannot fail to contribute effectively to the goals we all seek."
"106",6520,"SWE",28,1973,"﻿9.	I am very pleased to be able to associate my delegation with the congratulations that have already been addressed to Ambassador Benites on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. The fact that an eminent son of Latin America is this year presiding over our deliberations is a fitting tribute to the ever more important role that the countries and peoples of that continent are playing in world affairs.10.	The prevention of war is the primary task of the United Nations. War means human suffering. The wars in our time not only affect the men at the battlefront; they are also a threat to the entire civilian population. The longer a war  the greater the risk of ever-escalating violence and of the use of more brutal methods of warfare. There is also an increased risk that the war may spread to other countries. The international community is shocked by what is now happening in the Middle East. The immediate reaction must be a passionate appeal for peace.11.	The fact that war is now raging in the Middle East represents a failure for the United Nations. The area concerned has for more than 25 years attracted the special attention of the world Organization. The competent United Nations organs have throughout this period sought roads to a durable peace in the Middle East. The point of departure was the creation of the State of Israel  which was based on a decision of the General Assembly [resolution 181 (II)]. The existence of Israel is a long-established fact.12.	Ever since the founding of Israel the future of the Palestinian Arabs has been uncertain. Israel and its neighbours have lived in a state of permanent tension with repeated outbreaks of violence. The aim must be a settlement which takes account of the legitimate interests of all the peoples concerned and which establishes security for all States in the region within recognized frontiers. No solution to this problem will be found by one party or another demonstrating its military superiority. Whatever the outcome of the present war  the risk of renewed military confrontations will remain as long as the parties are not able to agree on a common political solution.13.	The guiding principles for such a solution are expressed in Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  of November 1967. These principles retain their full validity. But time has been allowed to pass and the possibilities contained in that resolution have not been explored in earnest.14.	What is now happening in the Middle East was preceded by large-scale acts of warfare and by serious violations of State sovereignty. It was also preceded by a wave of terror and counter-terror  which left no part of the world ""untouched. The fact that the United Nations so far has proved unable to solve the serious problems of international terrorism is to a large extent due to the lack of a settlement of the conflict in the Middle East.15.	The situation in the Middle East places a heavy responsibility on the parties to the conflict. But an important part of the responsibility also falls on the great Powers which for a long time have been deeply involved in the area. Several of them have played important roles in the military build-up. Now that full-scale war has broken out  they must contribute effectively towards a political solution of the conflict. At the same time  it is in the interest of everyone that the involvement of the super-Powers should not lead to a confrontation between them. If one dares discern any encouraging clement in today's sombre picture  it is the attitude of relative restraint that has been shown by the super-Powers during the present conflict. Their wish to pursue the policy of detente might facilitate the efforts to find a solution.16. There is every reason to welcome the desire of the super-Powers to replace  in their mutual relations  confrontations with dialogue. Their effort towards detente has manifested itself in various parts of the world.17.	The war that has ravaged Indo-China for so long has deeply engaged world opinion. It must be a source of satisfaction to us all that last January in Paris the parties to the war reached an agreement  leading to the withdrawal of the American forces and creating hopes of peace in all the Indo-Chinese States. Subsequently  the American bombings in Cambodia have also ceased under pressure from strong public opinion within and outside the United States. It has been possible to start reconstruction work in North Viet-Nam after the devastation of the war  and the parties in Laos have agreed to a peaceful settlement; but fighting still goes on in South Viet-Nam and in Cambodia. It is necessary to find a solution to the political problems of South VietNam in accordance with the stipulations of the Paris agreement. In the first instance  the many political prisoners must be released and the hundreds of thousands of refugees must be given the right and the possibility of returning to their homes. The hard-hit people of Cambodia must have the right to shape their own future free from outside interference.18.	In Europe the most important result of detente is that it has made a settlement between the two German States possible. This settlement has in turn been an important contribution to the continued process of detente. The Swedish Government is happy to welcome the entry of the two German States as Members of the world Organization. This event does not affect the right of the German people to achieve reunification by negotiation.19.	The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is an essential element of the continued trend towards detente. The Conference must be seen as a complement to the efforts of the United Nations to safeguard international peace. It is important to stress that the task of the Conference is to solve problems in Europe  not to promote the interests of European States in other parts of the world.20.	The very fact that 35 States  at the initial stage of that Conference in Helsinki  were able to agree on a programme for the continued work of the Conference is an important step forward. However  patience and hard work will be needed if the Conference is to fulfil what international opinion expects from it.21.	I At the Conference Sweden has stressed that  in discussions on security in Europe  the question of disarmament cannot reasonably be ignored and that the policy of detente ought to be supported and confirmed by measures in the field of disarmament.22.	Although they are not directly connected with the Conference  preparations are now under way for negotiations on the reduction of armed forces in Central Europe. The Swedish Government hopes that in this field concrete results will be achieved that will be designed to increase security  not least for the small European States.23.	As regards the efforts within the framework of the United Nations to reach results in the field of disarmament  the situation is deeply discouraging. For the second consecutive year the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament comes empty-handed to the General Assembly. Ten years ago the partial test-ban Treaty1 was signed. In that Treaty the parties clearly committed themselves to trying  by continued negotiations  to achieve a complete ban on all nuclear tests. In spite of the unequivocal request made by the General Assembly last year  no progress has been made towards a comprehensive test-ban treaty.24.	The General Assembly should now carefully consider by what methods new impetus could be given to the disarmament work. This is a task in which all Member States must actively involve themselves. It appears more and more absurd that such a large part of the material and scientific resources that should be seen as common to all mankind are now allocated to the arms race.25.	So long as we are not successful in our endeavours to avoid armed conflicts  it is all the more urgent to use every opportunity of limiting brutality and of protecting non- combatants. The rules of international law have not been adjusted to new types of conflict and new weapons or to new methods of warfare created by an accelerating evolution of military technology. The world conference to be held in Geneva early next year to deal with these matters  is therefore of greatest importance.26.	The monstrous effects of air warfare on civilians must be limited by a ban on area bombing and on acts of destruction which threaten the survival of the civilian population.27.	The conference should not content itself with a mere confirmation of the present general ban on the use of conventional weapons which cause unnecessary suffering or of weapons which  by their construction or use  lead to indiscriminate destruction. To be truly effective  such general rules must be supplemented by special bans  for instance on napalm and other incendiary weapons  as well as on the equivalent in our time of the dumdum bullet  namely  high- velocity weapons.28.	In southern Africa the demands of the peoples for freedom and self-determination are countered by oppression and by an increasingly brutal use of force. There are ever more frequent reports about Portugal's inhuman warfare in Africa. Testimony concerning the massacres in Mozambique last summer caused the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples to demand an international investigation. Consultations are now under way among Member States to prepare for such an investigation to be decided upon by the General Assembly. The pressure of public opinion against the colonial policy of Portugal grows ever stronger. The increased humanitarian assistance to the liberation movements in Africa is an expression of international opposition to the remnants of colonialism.29.	The General Assembly has before it the report of the International Conference of Experts for the Support of Victims of Colonialism and Apartheid in Southern Africa  held at Oslo from 9 to 14 April 1973 [A/9061]  organized by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. We are confident that the Assembly will welcome this report as an important contribution to the discussion of how to solve the problem in southern Africa.30.	Portugal has ignored the request of the Security Council to start negotiations with all parties concerned for the purpose of enabling the African peoples to exercise their right to self-determination and independence. It is now up to the Security Council to decide what attitude to take in the face of this open defiance of its own earlier request.31.	The situation in southern Africa is particularly serious because of the co-operation between Portugal  Southern Rhodesia and South Africa. This co-operation grows more evident every day in the political  economic and military fields. The sanctions against Southern Rhodesia are being systematically violated by Portugal and South Africa. The people of Namibia is still being denied the right to self- determination  which has been explicitly recognized by the world Organization. In South Africa the policy of apartheid is being pursued and the growing opposition of the majority is met with new acts of violence.32. All States which are dedicated to human rights  democracy and national independence ought to find it natural to give moral and material support to the realization of these principles in southern Africa.33.	In recent years world opinion has become increasingly aware of the use of torture in connexion with armed conflicts and internal political conflicts in different countries. The efforts to ban torture must never stop. One of the achievements of the great French Revolution was an explicit ban on torture. Since then  nearly two centuries have passed  but the fact remains that these abominable methods are accepted by Governments in various parts of the world. In its Universal Declaration on Human Rights the United Nations has decreed an absolute ban on torture. This ban has been repeated in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [see resolution 2200 A (XXI)]. All Members of the United Nations voted in favour of this ban  which  consequently  is now part of common international law. If all States ratify this Covenant  protection against torture will be strengthened  especially if individuals are given the right to appeal to the international body to be established in accordance with the Covenant. And we should also consider whether  in order to make the ban effective  the question of torture should not be discussed also as a separate matter  not only as part of the said Covenant.34.	Not so many years ago Governments in the East and in the West proudly pointed to the fact that they had abolished capital punishment. Only two years ago the General Assembly adopted a resolution expressing the desirability of the abolition of capital punishment in all countries [resolution 2857 (XXVI)]. The renaissance of capital punishment  which appears to be under way  can only be described as a historic setback. It is important that the United Nationsbe instrumental in creating a strong public opinion against superstitious ideas as to the effectiveness of capital punishment and against the contempt for human life of which the application of capital punishment is an expression.35.	The defence of human rights is clearly linked to the defence of peace. It is therefore a concern of all States. For this Organization  the protection of human rights has been a central issue ever since it was founded. But we can make no progress in this field without the support of a vigilant public opinion which condemns all forms of violence. The strivings for detente must not lead us to refrain from creating such an opinion. When we succeed in crystallizing this opinion in international recommendations or conventions which gain adherence from a significant number of countries  we are then making an important contribution to the long-term stabilization of peace. Essential progress in this area has already been achieved through various United Nations conventions and through the growing number of adhering countries.36.	The use of force within States can manifest itself in many forms. Particularly serious are those cases in which brutal military intervention in favour of privileged groups is directed against Governments which strive to bring about a more equitable society. The latest example is Chile  where the fight against the popularly elected Government finally took the form of naked military violence. Economic interests outside the country also contributed to the evolution which led to the coup. Salvador Allende has given his life for the sake of the poor. Members of his government have been arrested  Parliament has been dissolved and political parties have been banned. Resistance-fighters are being persecuted and killed.37.	Events in Chile have aroused a wave of protest around the world. That this has happened is important. That the protest does not die down is important. This Organization and its Member States are faced with the immediate and pressing obligation to assist the victims of oppression. A large-scale humanitarian endeavour is needed to provide«. safe haven for refugees of various nationalities. The appeal of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to Member States to receive refugees from Chile should be met by their speedy and positive reaction.38.	The developing countries  which represent an overwhelming part of the world population  are today struggling with enormous political and economic problems. The readiness of the industrialized countries to support them in their efforts is clearly inadequate. In fact  the policies of the rich countries tend to counteract in important respects the goal of international equality. As long as the deep gulf between the industrialized and the developing countries remains  there will be unrest and tension  which can spark new conflicts. From this point of view too it is urgent that the development strategy of the United Nations be pursued forcefully.39.	The General Assembly meets at a time when the distribution and utilization of the world's resources confront us with ever more serious problems. Catastrophic famine occurs ever more frequently in certain parts of the world. Support for the World Food Programme must therefore be strengthened. Immediate action is required to create  reserves of foodstuffs. The proposals made by the Director- General of the Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO\ should be fully supported. It is the hope of the Swedish Government that these proposals will be made more concrete at the FAO conference later this autumn. The proposal of the United States Secretary of State for the convening of a global food conference in 1974 under the auspices of the United Nations [2124th meeting] is welcome as part of the efforts to attract world attention to the problem of hunger. The countries and regions hit by famine have in common  besides difficult climatic conditions  underdevelopment and generally low productivity. A long- term solution to the food problem of the developing countries can only be reached through increased production of foodstuffs within these countries. Such increased production is in turn dependent upon fundamental structural reforms combined with social and economic rural development.40.	There is strongly increasing awareness of the dangers which threaten the human environment. The immediate threats are greatest where industrial development has been most rapid. As environmental standards are raised  industrialization in the developing countries is burdened by a cost factor which today's rich nations did not have to cope with in the corresponding phase of their history. The rising cost of energy creates similar problems. The questions of environment and energy demonstrate the interdependence of nations  but views and interests must inevitably vary according to the particular conditions of each country. In the environmental field the United Nations has already made important contributions towards the formulation of an international policy. This work can now be pursued through the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme. Also in the case of the energy crisis there should be a role for the United Nations in searching for solutions which take account of the interests of the smaller and economically weaker States.41.	Many of the problems  which I have only been able to outline in my statement  are being studied and discussed very thoroughly within the United Nations family. This takes place against the background of the new possibilities and risks created by rapid technological development. When the world Organization»increasingly devotes itself to those questions  it is the expression of a realistic awareness of the interrelationship between economics and politics I between the distribution of wealth and peace  between freedom from hunger and freedom from fear. Perhaps many people regard it as over ambitious when our Organization strives to encompass this entire field. But an Organization whose task it is to represent all mankind cannot but involve itself in all the problems which concern the peoples in the various parts of the world. The solving of these problems is the prerequisite for the realization of the goals which are contained in the Charter of this Organization. The United Nations is to serve man's longing for peace both by efforts to prevent breaches of the peace and by promoting developments which lessen the risk of conflicts. In the settlement of problems which concern the basic living conditions of people everywhere  all States  large and small  have a right to participate. The task of the United Nations is therefore more important than ever."
"107",6632,"SYR",28,1973,"﻿28.	Mr. President  it gives me the greatest pleasure to offer you  on my behalf and in the name of the delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic  our warm congratulations on your election as President of the twenty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly. The fact that you were chosen for this high office is a genuine expression of the appreciation and esteem in which the international community holds your country and people.29.	I am happy to welcome the new Members  the Democratic Republic of Germany  the German Federal Republic and the Bahamas. With their entry into the United Nations the principle of universality essential to the world Organization  which since the inception of the United Nations we have actively supported and have constantly striven to achieve  has been greatly enhanced. In this connexion  we wish to formulate the hope that the affiliation of the German Federal Republic with the Organization will usher in a greater understanding on its part of the problems of the third world  and particularly those of the Middle East.30.	The convening of the twenty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly comes on the heels of an event which stirred world-wide interest: the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries held at Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973  the greatest summit meeting human society has witnessed in the last decade.31.	The declarations and resolutions of that Conference [see A/9330] incarnated the drive of the non-aligned nations towards self-fulfilment and the assertion of their identity  and to a reaffirmation of the principles of non-alignment  proven to be universal principles aiming at achieving justice  equality  coexistence and peace among nations.32.	The basic significance of that Conference lay in the fact that it embodied the determination of over half the inhabitants of the world to be freed from unequal relations  to establish instead among nations a democratic relationship both in politics and economics  to eradicate colonialism in all its forms and to eliminate hegemony  foreign occupation  backwardness and deprivation.33.	If the non-alignment movement has been described in the past as an expression of world conscience  the Fourth Conference revealed that that movement is proceeding with a firm pace towards achieving freedom in the world. That Conference  with the clarity of vision which characterized its work  was able to adjust to the international changes  affirming and developing their positive aspects without swerving from the principles on which the non-alignment movement rests.34.	The Algiers Conference was a gathering that took a global view  at which it was pledged anew to realize the basic aims of the non-alignment movement — those universal goals conceiving world peace as a unit indivisible  centred on eliminating tension everywhere  increasing international co-operation  developing the innate capacities ofdeveloping countries  ending privation  backwardness  and unequal relations between peoples.35.	We hope the General Assembly of the United Nations will support the principal demands made in the declarations and resolutions of the Algiers Conference  because they are all fully compatible with the United Nations Charter.36.	The relationship between the Conference of non- aligned countries and the United Nations arises not only from the fact that the non-aligned nations form half the membership of the international Organization  but also from the determination of the non-aligned countries to strengthen the role of the United Nations and within its framework to take upon themselves the work of realizing its goals and the objectives of the Charter in such way as to benefit all mankind.37.	In our review of the international situation  special emphasis should  of course  be given to the new developments that have had an important impact on international relations. Aiming at eliminating the dangers of confrontation between the two great Powers and abating the tension in Europe  those developments nevertheless will be of limited effect and uncertain results so long as their benefits do not extend to all parts of the world  eradicating the oppressive conditions still prevalent in the third world  such as colonialism  exploitation  racism  occupation and aggression at the hands of imperialism and foreign control.38.	International concord will remain an elaborate fiction if it means the monopoly of the big decisions ruling our destiny in the hands of a few and the consolidation of unjust conditions to which the peoples of the developing world are subjected  or if it is to be achieved at the expense of peoples and their rights to freedom  progress and self- determination. In those circumstances detente would be tantamount to extinguishing the focuses of dispute in a certain region of the world while feeding the elements of conflict in some other areas.39.	In this connexion it is disappointing to see the United States of America bent on exploiting the international climate of relaxation in order to consolidate its interests at the expense of the interests of other peoples and sustaining aggression in all areas of the third world  especially in the Middle East.40.	The state of international security today is far from permitting the majority of nations to achieve their aspirations for freedom  independence  peace  and progress. Imperialist aggression continues in important areas of Asia  Africa and Latin America.41.	Faithful in its support of the principles of the freedom of peoples and their right to self-determination without foreign interference  and their right to territorial integrity  regional unity and permanent sovereignty over natural resources: faithful in its struggle against colonialism  imperialist control and exploitation  against discrimination on the basis of colour  race or creed; faithful to the Charter of the United Nations  the Syrian Arab Republic demands a cessation of imperialist interference and aggression against the people of Cambodia and considers that the five points of the Government of National Union are a practical and just basis for the solution of the Cambodian problem.42.	We further demand the solution of the problem of Korea through the creation of appropriate conditions to hasten the union of Korea as an independent  peaceful nation. .We demand the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the southern Korean territories and the dissolution ofI the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. We believe that this session of the General Assembly of the United Nations should work towards uniting  not consecrating  the division of Korea.43.	We welcome the Agreement on the restoration of peace in Viet-Nam.' We believe that the safeguarding of peace in this area is absolutely necessary for the carrying out in good faith of all the clauses of this Agreement. We therefore deplore the repeated violations of the provisions of the Agreement on the part of the imperialists and their agents  and we hope that the heroic Viet-Namese will  achieve complete success in their struggle to restore the social and economic structure of their country.44.	We emphatically support the struggle of the national liberation movements in Africa  America and Asia. We strongly condemn the role of the racist minority in Rhodesia and in South Africa and the imperialist manoeuvres calculated to overthrow national governments in these countries.45.	We warmly welcome the struggle of movements for national liberation bearing arms in the four quarters of Africa against the forces of racial discrimination and colonialist exploitation  and we offer them our support andencouragement. We wish them the early attainment of their aims.46.	In this connexion let me welcome the rise of that valiant country Guinea-Bissau to the status of independence through the struggle of its sons assisted by the great African continent and justice-loving peoples. It is high time that the Portuguese regime reviewed its reactionary policy and conceded the right of Mozambique and Angola to self-determination and independence. The admission of Guinea-Bissau — soon  we hope — to the ranks of the Organization's membership will be a landmark in the universal struggle for freedom and justice.47.	World opinion endorses the fact that the Middle East problem now poses the greatest thereat to international peace and security. It is the one problem that bears within itself the seeds of a world war.48.	The origins of the question  its tragedies and dimensions are known to everyone. Its ugly traces leap to the eye in the Israeli occupation of the land of Palestine in 1948  which has uprooted its inhabitants and deprived them of all their national and human rights. These ugly traces were further manifested in the expanded Israeli occupation of June 1967  which was an extension of settler colonialism and an imperialist conspiracy against the Arab nation.49.	More than six years have passed since the Israeli occupation of territories of three Arab countries that are Members of the United Nations  and the imperialist forces are still striving hard to consolidate this occupation by the consecration of this aggressive fait accompli. The unlimited support offered by the United States of America to the Israeli aggressor has enabled Israel to defy the whole world and to deride the United Nations  its resolutions and its Charter.50.	But peace-loving nations have come to perceive the dangers inherent in the continuance of this menacing situation  with the result that American imperialism and its Zionist creature are now lined up on one side facing all other nations on the other.51.	The isolation of Israel and American imperialism in the United Nations and elsewhere in the international sphere has become one of the distinctive features of the present era in international relations. It reflects the attitude of rejection which the international community takes against aggression and the protectors of aggression.52.	We place again before this international Organization the case of Israeli aggression because we are convinced that the United Nations  despite its shortcomings  is capable of playing a useful role in opposing imperialism  and in eliminating the consequences of aggression and protecting world peace.53.	In a world of such intertwined interests  a world of common destiny  no responsible Government can be indifferent when its land and the peace of its people are threatened with destruction.54.	The Middle East crisis does not threaten international peace and security alone; it is a menace also to the economic security of nations. In addition to this area being the most important route of communications by land  sea and air between three continents  it has the greatest known reserves of petroleum in the world — oil constituting the main prop of life with respect to any advance in civilization during our era.55.	Signs and statistics indicate that the wheel of life in this world  and particularly in the advanced industrial nations  will for a long time and increasingly be dependent on. sources of energy in the Middle East. Accordingly  a view of the Middle East crisis from this perspective should prompt nations to intensify their efforts to eliminate the focuses of explosion in the region and to put an end to the reckless playing by Zion with the destinies of its peoples. Men everywhere have commenced to understand that their national wealth is one of the elements of their inherent strength and must play a role in protecting their independence and the integrity of their lands.56.	Consequently  the situation in the Middle East calls for prompt  effective treatment by the United Nations and its Members. It requires that every effort be put forth to keep the Israeli aggressor from reaping the fruits of aggression. Condoning aggression by allowing the fait accompli to prosper threatens a continual erosion of the prestige of the United Nations and encourages aggression and expansion in every place upon the earth.57.	It has been demonstrated in recent years that Israel  prospering through illegality  and adopting violence  terror  war and occupation to serve the objectives of its settler colonialism  has no regard whatsoever for the resolutions of the United Nations  no respect for any international or human or moral law. Israel's leaders have gone so far as to consider the resolutions taken by the United Nations as a sign of the bankruptcy of the Organization  morally  politically and legally.58.	This Israeli arrogance and contempt for international law and custom has led Israel to embark on hideous practices that arouse the aversion and condemnation of the entire world. On 8 January 1973 Israeli planes undertook a brutal assault upon civilian targets in the Syrian Arab Republic  resulting in the slaughter of hundreds of civilians  old people  women and children. On 21 February 1973 Israeli forces raided the refugee camps in A1 Baddawi and A1 Barid in north Lebanon  killing a great number of women  old men and children. On 22 February this year Israeli armoured planes shot down a Libyan civil aircraft that had lost its way over Sinai. This resulted in the death of 108 innocent passengers. During the night of 9-10 April 1973 Israeli commando forces raided the city of Beirut. They murdered three Palestinian leaders in their sleeping quarters and slew a number of Palestinian refugees and Lebanese civilians. It was a real Mafia operation  yet it was perpetrated not by outlaw gangs but by the authorities of a Member State of the United Nations.59.	Within this period Israel committed a series of deliberate murders of Arab individuals in Paris and Rome on the pretext that they supported the Palestinian cause or that they were suspected of supporting this cause. I think we all remember the murder of the Moroccan citizen Bouchiki in Oslo by Israeli intelligence staff and the ensuing expulsion of one of the members of the Israeli mission in Norway.60.	On 5 August 1973 Israeli armoured planes abducted an Iraqi civil aircraft flying in Beirut skies to Lydda airport  endangering the lives of 76 passengers and gravely violating Lebanese sovereignty and the safety of international civil aviation. In its resolution 337 (1973) the Security Council condemned this aggression  as did the International Civil Aviation Organization.c61.	On 13 September 1973 64 Israeli war planes of American manufacture undertook the most serious operation of violation of Syrian air space in a: attempt to strike at civilian targets. They were only prevented from achieving their objective by the opposition of our fighting planes. It is highly ironical that the leaders of Israel claim their planes were on routine patrol when our planes attacked them. Israeli arrogance goes as far as considering that Israeli fighter planes flying at a depth of a hundred kilometres within Syrian skies to be performing merely a routine flight.62.	Israeli authorities have elevated terror to the level of the State's official policy in pursuance of the principle that the end justifies the means  with no regard to international law and without respect for the sovereignty of other nations. It is odd that such conduct by Israel  whereby it arrogates to itself the right to infringe the sovereignty of nations  has not^aroused the foreign States that have suffered from it to take effectual counter-measures. Consequently  we find Golda Meir and Dayan announcing without trepidation that Israel will continue on its course  whatever the results.63.	We must ask what the United Nations should do in the face of this situation  which constitutes a grave challenge to the international Organization and to the international and human community as a whole.64.	The United States has impaired the competence of the Security Council by abusing the right of veto  which it has exercised to encourage Israeli aggression and the consolidation of the Israeli occupation of Arab lands  as reinforcement to American imperialist interests in the Middle East. It was natural that such conduct on the part of the United States should lead to the phenomenon of shifting the centre of gravity of United Nations activities and effectiveness from the Security Council to the General Assembly.65.	The General Assembly  therefore  must bear its responsibilities under the Charter  it must make specific practical recommendations in the face of a situation which threatens international peace and security. The situation in the Middle East  menacing the peace and security of every nation  requires from the General Assembly that it adopt such resolutions as will exert real restraining pressure on Israel  in conformity with the provisions of Chapter VII of the Organization's Charter.66.	The passage of six years since the Israeli aggression and occupation of the territories of three Arab nations is a clear indication that the leaders of Israel are not influenced a hair's breadth by the counsels and recommendations thus far embodied in the General Assembly resolutions  and that there is no alternative but to give such resolutions a new content.67.	The Organization of African Unity \OAU\ comprehended this fact thoroughly and acted accordingly when in May 1973 it adopted a resolution stating that the attitude of Israel might lead OAU member States to take  at the African level  individually or collectively  political and economic measures against it  in conformity with the principles contained in the OAU and United Nations Charters. Further  the Fourth Conference of non-aligned nations held in Algiers in September 1973 called upon member States to take steps to boycott Israel diplomatically  economically  militarily and culturally  as well as in the field of sea and air transport.68.	I wish in this connexion to hail the dynamic  progressive step proclaimed at the 2140th meeting by the President of the Republic of Zaire  General Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga  before the Assembly and the world. This is the most genuine expression of deep respect for the principles of the Charter of our Organization. It is an affirmation of the commitment of our peoples to support the struggle for freedom  justice and self-determination  and to act together in solidarity and determination against injustice.69.	We welcome the spirit of courage and justice shown by all the States which  perceiving the aggressive expansionist nature of Israel  have severed relations with it. We call upon the General Assembly to adopt a resolution with such restraining provisions as will induce Israel to end its aggression  in accord with the provisions of the Charter. We remind the General Assembly  in this context  that Israel is the unique Member which has been received conditionally into the .United Nations. The General Assembly's resolution 273 (III) of 11 May 1949 further recalls the two resolutions concerning Palestine and- repatriation of the Palestinian refugees [resolutions 181 (II) and 194 (III)]. Israel has continued to violate those resolutions from the day of its entry into the Organization up to this very day.70.	With this stand  Israel has put itself outside the pale of United Nations membership from a legal aspect  and there is no doubt that its repeated violations of the Organization's Charter have made it the more justifiable that Israel should have its membership stripped from it. We ask ourselves how the Organization can protect its existence from the fate encountered by the. League of Nations if it does not cast out from its ranks any Member that is insubordinate to its constitution; that tramples on its prestige  and announces  with the tongue of responsible authority  that morally  politically and legally it is a bankrupt Organization.71.	We call upon the General Assembly  in defence of the international Organization's prestige and its very existence and out of respect for the principles of right and justice  to approve a resolution divesting Israel of membership and boycotting it diplomatically  economically  militarily  culturally  and in sea  air and land communications; demanding the immediate  unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Arab territories occupied since June 1967  and that all measures taken by Israel in those territories to alter their demographic and geographic features be considered void  with non-recognition of the consequences of those measures; further  that it recognize the right of the Palestinian Arab people to the restoration of all its national rights in its homeland.72.	The authorities of Tel Aviv try to .ad world public opinion by promoting the idea of negotiations and secure boundaries. The world  however  saw the spuriousness of the Israeli position when Israel announced that it would not accept withdrawal from the Golan Heights or the Gaza Strip or Old Jerusalem or Sharm el Sheikh or the areas of Sinai  behind a line drawn from Sharm el Sheikh to Rafah; that the West Bank  though to be restored in a large part to the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Jordan according to the Israeli plan  should remain open to the citizens of Israel  who should enjoy the right to own land and work there  and that Israel would retain a number of army sites along the length of the Jordan river. Israel sees all these as sine qua non premises on the basis of which any negotiations must start  though it does not consider them prior conditions. The very fact of continuous Israeli occupation during a period of over six years  in itself  constitutes a condition which hangs heavily over us  and in the shade of which equal negotiations between  the occupier and the victim of occupation cannot take place. Any negotiations proceeding in such circumstances can lead only to submission and acceptance of the occupier's terms. This is what Israel and the forces behind her actually desire and are working toward.73.	As for the idea of ""secure boundaries""  as Israel calls them  this is a mere ruse. Israel is contemptuous of the intelligence of us all when it justifies its expansionist greed by terming it an effort to obtain secure boundaries. In our day is there in truth such a thing as secure geographic boundaries? Technological advance and the new developments in weapons — of which Israel possesses the most advanced types — have erased boundaries  and there remain no geographical barriers on land or water of any significant effect in the face of these weapons. There is not one nation in the world  therefore  that can claim for itself secure geographical boundaries.74.	True security is that which is built upon justice  on remedying any sense of injustice entertained by neighbouring countries  on respect for law and adherence to the principles of the Charter. This kind of security is naturally inconsistent with the expansionist goals of Israel. The ""secure boundaries"" which Israel is trying to promote for itself are expanded  movable boundaries which it carves out by altering the demographic  economic and geographic features of occupied territories and by bringing in millions of settlers from all quarters of the globe for conversion of the occupied territories into a Jewish land and preparatory to occupation of new territory at the expense of the Arabs.75.	Following a debate held in the Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency three days before the creation of Israel was announced  Ben-Gurion said:""Take  for instance  the American Declaration of Independence. They did not mention in it specific boundaries  and we are not obliged to mention boundaries for the area of Israel.""That shows the intentions of Israel; those are its aims.76.	The position of the Syrian Arab Republic with respect to the Palestine problem and the imperialist Zionist aggression against our territories is a firm stand upon principle  consistent with the Charter of this Organization and with all international law and the rules of justice and right. There are two basic conditions for the establishment of peace in the Middle East: firstly  recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people to their lands and homeland and their full right to self-determination; and  secondly  immediate  complete and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied Arab territories.77.	Our determination to struggle for the liberation of all occupied Arab territories and the restoration of all the national rights of the Arab Palestinian people has never been stronger than it is today. We are certain that liberation of Arab earth from the Zionist imperialist aggression is a part of the universal struggle to create a world built on equality  justice and freedom  and that the realization of our goal of liberation enhances the aims of the United Nations and its lofty objectives."
"108",6770,"THA",28,1973,"﻿79.	Mr. President  first of all  I should like on behalf of the delegation of Thailand  to offer you my sincere congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the twenty-eighth session of this Assembly. My delegation fully endorses the expressions of confidence  respect and admiration which have been conveyed to you by previous distinguished speakers. The keen knowledge of  and deep experience in  United Nations affairs which you have acquired during the years as the representative of your country  Ecuador  are the essential attributes of a successful President of the General Assembly. Your wisdom and compassion are the human qualities which add further to the high esteem that the peoples of Latin America  as well as other parts of the world  have for you as a person. My delegation pledges its whole-hearted support and co-operation in the tasks that lie ahead of all of us.80.	On this occasion my delegation would also like to pay a tribute and to express its deep appreciation to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski of Poland for the efficient and able manner in which he conducted the proceedings of last year's General Assembly as its President.81.	The delegation of Thailand wishes to convey to the Swedish delegation  Government and people its heartfelt condolences on the demise of His Late Majesty King Gustav VI Adolf of Sweden. My delegation is also saddened by the death of Mr. Salvador Allende  former President of Chile  who only last year addressed this Assembly on many important international issues [2096th meeting/. It was also with the deepest regret that my delegation noted the loss of Mr. Eduardo Zuleta Angel of Colombia  the President of the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations  whose contribution to the founding of our world Organization will always be appreciated by the ""peoples of the United Nations"".82.	The Thai delegation wishes to express its grateful appreciation to our Secretary-General for his report on the work of the Organization [A/9001/ and its thought- provoking introduction [A/9001/Add.l]  which should commend itself to the careful attention of all Member States. Last year the Thai Government and people were pleased and privileged to welcome the Secretary-General on his first official visit to Thailand and to the headquarters of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East in Bangkok. It is therefore a genuine pleasure and an honour for me once again to meet you  Mr. Secretary-General  at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.83.	The past year has witnessed  except in one instance  a continuing improvement in the relations among the major Powers. Despite evident difficulties generated by fears and suspicions in certain areas  the great Powers appear to be trying in earnest to promote mutual restraint in their conduct towards each other and the outside world. In so doing  they are entering a new era of peaceful accommodation and detente. Although it may take a while longer before these promising trends become an established fact of international life  they are welcomed by all peace-loving peoples of the world.84.	In this respect  Europe has made impressive gains. The successful conclusion in Helsinki of the first phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  the agreements on and between the two German States  together with a series of treaties between the Federal Republic of Germany and its neighbours to the East  seem to justify a mood of optimism in East-West relations  and enhance the prospect of a European settlement.85.	Since both the First and Second World Wars began in Europe  the outcome of the on-going negotiations is awaited with interest by people throughout the world. The admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic to the United Nations in furtherance of the concept of universality in the world Organization provides ample proof of the pragmatic wisdom of the States involved  perhaps setting a trend for an evolving accommodation of similar difficulties in other parts of the world.86.	My delegation  therefore  was privileged to be a sponsor of the resolution that admitted the two German States to the world Organization and wishes to extend  once again  its whole-hearted welcome to them  as well as to the other new Member of the United Nations  the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.87.	Big Power moderation nay also have a salutary effect on the Middle East  where the cease-fire has continued in its fourth year  although with worrying interruptions and little lessening of tensions. However  the Security Council has found itself powerless to enforce compliance with its resolutions. The continuing occupation of the territories occupied as a result of the 1967 conflict and the subsequent measures taken by Israel to consolidate its control run counter to the spirit and letter of existing United Nations resolutions. Security Council condemnation of the lawless violence perpetrated on government orders  as well as its repeated warnings  have also not been heeded. This is a deplorable state of affairs  and one fraught with grave risks.88.	The efforts of Ambassador Jarring have come to a standstill  with no beginning of a settlement in sight. Indeed  the only glimmer on the darkened horizon has been the first official visit of the Secretary-General himself to the countries in the area; for his presence in the area has emphasized the increasing concern felt by United Nations Members and may have served to underscore the urgent need to prevent further deterioration of the situation  as well as to renew our hope of finding a just and lasting settlement in conformity with the United Nations Charter and on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and other United Nations resolutions.89.	Regarding Asia  one of the significant events of the past year has been the establishment of regular diplomatic contact between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America. It is  however  still too early to ascertain whether that historic step will pave the way towards a possible settlement of the outstanding problems in Asia. Nevertheless  there have been some subsequent positive developments.90.	In South Asia  the emergence of the Agreement between India and Pakistan is a welcome development of great humanitarian significance which augurs well for the solution of the other problems pending among the nations on that subcontinent. It is hoped that  with the improved climate of understanding  the People's Republic of Bangladesh will be able in the near future to take its rightful place in the United Nations.91.	In East Asia  where United Nations attention this year will be focused on the Korean question  recent developments on the Korean peninsula have made it possible for the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea to recommend its own dissolution. It therefore remains for the world Organization to determine  in the appropriate organs  what new steps or further adjustments concerning the United Nations role can be undertaken to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities in Korea. It is the earnest hope of my delegation that United Nations Members  particularly the permanent members of the Security Council  will be able to reach an accommodation on the remaining issues which will be to the best interest of the Korean people itself.92.	In South-East Asia  where the legitimate aspirations of people to live their own lives have long been hampered  the situation remains a cause of deep concern and a grave threat to world peace. Subsequent violations of the Paris Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam have made it increasingly difficult to implement the already complex arrangement  and have further prolonged the bloodshed. However  the long-awaited Protocol to the Agreement on Restoring Peace and Achieving National Concord in Laos  has finally emerged. Thailand welcomes this important development which has brightened the prospects for peace and national reconciliation in the neighbouring Kingdom of Laos. It is  however  necessary that all the provisions of the Agreements be implemented in good faith by all parties concerned  and that the Geneva Agreements of 1962 and article 20 of the Paris Agreement  which was signed in the presence of the Secretary- General of the United Nations in January of this year  be fully and strictly adhered to by all the signatories.93.	With the new accords on Laos and the Paris Agreement on Viet-Nam  the absence of a similar consensus on the Khmer Republic represents a noticeable failure of international diplomacy and a remaining challenge to us all. While the Government side is prepared to negotiate  the other side  with active and substantial support from outside  is still intent on imposing a military solution to the conflict. Although it is generally accepted that the Khmer people itself should be allowed to solve its own problems free from foreign interference  it should be apparent to all that a just and lasting solution must be firmly predicated on the preservation of Khmer independence  neutrality and territorial integrity.94.	After the din of battle has ceased it is imperative that the vital security interests of all the neighbouring States should be assured and that they should have adequate protection to safeguard their independence as well as regional peace and stability. A basis for such a step has already been created-when the five members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] signed the Kuala Lumpur Declaration 27 November of 1971 stating their common aim that South-East Asia should become a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality free fr6m any form or manner of external interference. Moreover  the proposal before the United Nations to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace also has an important bearing on the security of littoral and hinterland States  some of which are situated in South-East Asia. A great deal of satisfaction and inspiration can be derived from the growing acceptance of similar endeavours by major Powers in other areas  such as the Treaty for the Prohibition of NuclearWeapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco)  which has already received the formal endorsement of four of the five nuclear Powers. The latter should be persuaded also to recognize that only a new structure based on the willing and mutual co-operation of the Asian States themselves and other interested parties can promote genuine peace in that important part of the world.95.	Thailand firmly believes that all countries in the region of South-East Asia must jointly assume primary responsibilities in establishing conditions for political stability  economic progress and social justice and genuine peace in the region. We of the region must be left free to work out our own destiny. It is essential that all countries in the region participate actively in the creation of a new order and contribute directly towards peace  freedom  stability and progress. Together they could make the South-East Asian region free from all forms of interference from outside and ensure freedom with peace  independence and territorial integrity for all States of the area regardless of differences in political systems.96.	In the area of disarmament  improved East-West relations in Europe have made possible the encouraging progress of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT). With SALT-II now in the negotiating phase  the anxious world has been promised a slowing down of only one aspect of the arms race. Progress in the field of general disarmament is disappointing  and national defence budgets do not reflect the atmosphere of detente. The proposed World Disarmament Conference has not benefited from early organizational difficulties  which can be resolved only through mutual goodwill and not by political pressure or manoeuvre. Since participation in the Conference by all the nuclear Powers and other militarily important States is indispensable to its success  we should explore every possibility of achieving a compromise and refrain from acting in undue haste.97.	The tenth anniversary of the signing of the partial test-ban treaty12 passed by without any further movement towards the final goal of a comprehensive test-ban agreement. It may be said that a nuclear-test race is going on at fever pitch  with the more advanced nuclear Powers resorting to underground nuclear testing to maintain their superiority and the newcomers to the nuclear club rushing to develop an independent capability for avowedly defensive purposes. As this situation is a serious danger to mankind  my delegation would urge immediate cessation of all testing as a first essential step in the direction of the elimination of all nuclear weapons.98.	We in Thailand firmly believe that all peoples are entitled to their inalienable rights of self-determination  independence and sovereignty  free from outside interference. We have therefore consistently supported the efforts of the world Organization in the area of decolonization which have resulted in the birth of many new nations and the increase in the membership of the United Nations. However  many problems are still unsolved  especially with regard to Angola  Guinea-Bissau  Mozambique and Cape Verde. Various resolutions of both the General Assemblyand the Security Council have been adopted  but certain Powers still place their economic  political and militaristic interests above their national conscience and human values and thus have neither strictly observed nor implemented those resolutions. Again this year  the time has now come for all of us to appeal to those countries to soften their known positions and to adopt a new policy which will help correct the long-standing injustice done to the peoples in colonial Territories and to hasten the process of self- determination and independence for the people of those Territories.99.	Thailand also supports the legitimate struggle of millions of indigenous Africans against apartheid and racial discrimination in southern Africa. Despite the fact that this year marks the observance of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  those peoples are still denied their fundamental freedoms and basic human rights. Thailand will therefore continue to work closely with other Member countries of the United Nations to bring about the speedy elimination and total eradication of racism and the shameful practice and policy of apartheid.100.	Eleven years ago the General Assembly proclaimed the first United Nations Development Decade [resolution 1710 (XVI)] with the expressed aim of reducing the gap between the rich and the poor nations. It is now three years since the Second United Nations Development Decade began; but the gap between the rich and the poor has widened even further. A major task lies ahead for all of us therefore in that the first biennial review and appraisal of the objectives and policies of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] are scheduled to take place during this session. The developing countries have a great stake in the outcome of the review  and my delegation stands ready to give its whole-hearted support to the Group of 77 in the task of breathing new life into the global development effort  the aim of which is to raise significantly the standard of living of the developing countries. This worthy goal must be vigorously pursued in the present decade  if there is to be any hope of lessening human misery and the despair affecting the majority of mankind  thus fulfilling the lofty aims of the Strategy.101.	Several events of major importance are taking place which could be of tremendous benefit to the developing countries. First  the multilateral trade negotiations dealing with world-wide trading arrangements under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] have begun in Tokyo. The Thai Government has shared the view that increased and expanded access of exports from developing countries to the large industrial market is one of the essential keys to the accelerated growth of developing countries. Furthermore  developed countries should lower  and eventually eliminate  trade barriers and other practices which have long curtailed the export trade of the developing countries. Such benefits can be attained only through concerted efforts by the developing countries during what will be long and arduous negotiations.102.	Whether the multilateral trade negotiations will have a chance of success  however  is intrinsically linked to the monetary negotiations which have just ended in Nairobi.Statements coming from the Committee on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related Issues of the International Monetary Fund indicate that a significant step forward has been made  to a point where the over-all shape of the reforms is perceptible enough to allow for greater concentration on the key issues. It is welcomed that the Committee has affirmed the desirability of effecting an equitable transfer of resources from developed to developing countries as a means of promoting the latter's economic' development. Here again it is essential that the developing countries should do all in their power to increase their individual and collective bargaining power and so improve their chances of obtaining beneficial results. In this connexion the members of ASEAN have had useful consultations concerning both the GATT negotiations and the Nairobi talks.103.	Of equal significance to developing countries is the United Nations World Population Conference to be held in August 1974 in Bucharest at the invitation of the Government of Romania. The problem of population is of fundamental importance to the future of humanity  and a coherent approach to this highly complex issue is needed to make the best use of our available knowledge and resources. The United Nations has already made impressive progress in this field through the United Nations Fund and Population Activities and it is hoped that the conference will further help us to see this problem in all its dimensions.104.	My delegation holds that economic relations among States should be governed by agreed principles and that a charter of economic rights and duties of States will be of benefit to all countries. One of these rights is the right of States to permanent sovereignty over all their natural resources.105.	We fully support the concerted efforts being made to expand the capability of developing countries to apply science and technology to development  and we consider that the serious maldistribution of the world's scientific and technological resources is a major obstacle to development.106.	Above all  we believe in  and will continue vigorously to pursue the idea of  economic self-reliance with the co-operation of neighbouring countries and within geographical subregions.107.	All of the foregoing come under the purview of the Economic and Social Council  whose task and responsibilities for the co-ordination of all United Nations activities in the economic and social fields have grown both in complexity and scope over the past 25 years. The imminent ratification of the amendment to Article 61 of the Charter should further enhance the Council's leadership role and ensure a broader basis for its activities. It is necessary therefore that this enlargement  coming at a time when the Council has shown a spirit of revitalization  should be used to provide opportunities for member nations that have expressed their willingness to serve but have never had an opportunity in the past to participate in its important work.108.	One of the most challenging questions facing the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly is the progressive development of the international law of the sea.During the year's session  the Thai delegation was privileged to play a role in achieving the widest possible consensus on various procedural steps that would lead to the substantive phase of the conference on the law of the sea 1974. The Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction  of which Thailand is a member  has met twice this year and has accomplished a certain amount of preparatory work. Further efforts should  however  be made to consider the legitimate and limited interests of others  particularly those arising from geographical factors  be they concerned with land-locked or shelf-locked countries  or semi-enclosed seas  in order to find compromise solutions before the conference takes place. My delegation looks forward to the organizational meeting towards the end of this year and also to the conference itself in the early part of next year as originally agreed.109.	With regard to the exploration and exploitation of resources in the sea-bed area  progressive development in the direction where the legitimate interests of coastal States  countries with special geographical problems and maritime Powers can be harmonized  is not only feasible but beneficial to all. Perhaps it is even conceivable that with the enormous wealth lying untapped beneath the deep ocean it should be possible to share the benefits on an equitable basis without falling short of the aspirations of any State or group of States. However  there can be no derogation from the fundamental principle that every nation  whether small or large  rich or poor  has sovereignty over its own natural resources. The question is  therefore  one of delimiting areas under national and international jurisdiction. My delegation recalls the difficulty encountered in 1958 and 1960 on the limit of the territorial sea  but is confident that this problem can soon be resolved. Thus  it also hopes that the questions concerning the sea-bed outside national jurisdiction and related issues  which have important economic ramifications  can eventually be settled for the benefit of mankind.110.	The rule of law must reign in all fields of human endeavour. The only alternative is anarchy. Nations should  therefore  accept the necessary adjustments to make the international community more responsive to basic human needs as well as more responsible to its final constituent  namely  man himself. The international community should endeavour to avoid catastrophic mistakes of the past and to ensure that man's noble instinct and ideals will not only endure but will ultimately triumph over his foibles and follies. States  therefore  have an obligation not to impede progress in this respect  but must act in concert to further it. In so doing  they have the United Nations to assist them. The Organization's inherent shortcomings are already well- known  and its many accomplishments and useful rule are widely appreciated  especially in the light of the Secretary- General's eloquent introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add.l]. But whatever the shortfalls are  the world Organization  now composed of 135 Member States  embodies the international community and represents its weaknesses and virtues. Moreover  the United Nations system constitutes the only  albeit imperfect  universal instrument of peaceful change in existence today. It is  therefore  imperative' that the international community should try to improve the Organization's efficiency and effectiveness partly by positive actions of its component States. It was in this spirit that the Thai delegation last year joined with others in sponsoring the draft resolution on the strengthening of the role of the United Nations.  In the present atmosphere of detente  no opportunity should be lost  and we should explore fresh avenues that will satisfy the demands of change and the requirements of contemporary international life. The amendment to Article 61 of the Charter is a welcome demonstration of realism on the part of all concerned. The world has grown  not only in terms of population  but also in political maturity. Although it is a slow and continuing process  the time has come for us to encourage it by every possible means. Indeed  the world Organization  together with the international community which it represents  should be made truly responsive to basic human needs and more responsible to mankind."
"109",6931,"TUN",28,1973,"﻿120.	 Mr. President  the Tunisian delegation would like to associate itself with the tribute which has been paid to you  to your career  which is well known in Tunisia  and also to your qualities of heart and of mind; all these are equally well known. That is why your well-deserved election appears to us to honour you at the same time as it honours your country and your part of the world. We are extremely gratified to be able to co-operate with you to ensure that our work proceeds smoothly at this General Assembly.121.	We have emerged from a state of false peace into a state of genuine war  without any major upheavals  and perhaps with less noise and fuss than would be engendered by a brief meeting between the two super-Powers in connexion with the vague and mysterious question of international detente.122.	This conclusion is born neither of moroseness nor of the acrimony of which we are generally and unfairly accused. It describes a fact. The historic day that marks the Middle East war has been a matter of daily occurrence. It is only now  here and elsewhere  particularly within the area of world public opinion — although certain newspapers continue to surround us by silence — it is only now that people are beginning to grasp the serious nature of the war and what is at stake. It is true that this time it is the war of the humble man who has had enough of being vilified; of the person who has suffered aggression and has had enough of occupation; of the simple refugee who has had enough of suffering despair and desolation.123.	Yes  it is the war of the Palestinians  that nameless people  the Syrians and the Egyptians  who have been suffering in the shadows of poverty and enslavement. Refusing injustice and dishonour  they have launched a struggle for deliverance. For most of them it appears in the form of death — a just death that will contribute to the brotherly and worthy life of their peoples.124.	In fact  these are stoic fighters who are waging war against war  against those responsible for aggression. They fight  showing to the entire world that man is  despite everything  better than this monstrous occupier —  all the more monstrous because Zionism has perverted it  and the power of money has spoiled it to such an extent that it believes it belongs to the race of lords and masters who are permitted everything  including the arrogance to thwart the United Nations  its Security Council and its permanent members  its General Assembly  its Secretary- General and all its resolutions.125.	The ideal of these stoic Egyptian and Syrian fighters is something that has not fallen into this morbid mould which motivates their Zionist enemies and which consists of considering war as a perfected razzia and of setting records of atrocity and humiliation  thanks to sophisticated weaponry.126.	Their ideal is beyond war; it is part and parcel of the concept of coexistence and fraternity — we repeat: coexistence and fraternity — between a Jewish community  de-Zionized and reconciled with itself  and that Christian-Arab community and Moslem community  rid of its complexes.127.	The ideal of these fighters is to make sure that justice triumphs  even above heroes!128.	Such an ideal means that one may be cast down but never overcome.129.	Whatever the incantations we hear in the Assembly about detente  whatever the calumnies  the slanders and the ridiculous things that are said to deafen us  we will not be prevented from crying out this simple truth  the truth of the Egyptian and Syrian fighters  which is becoming an ever more evident truth as the days go by: that people cannot be occupied for decades against their will  whatever the military supremacy that is available to their occupiers. Today  in the Golan Heights and in the holy places of Sinai  hope is still felt where freedom has once again been restored through these valiant Syrian and Egyptian fighters.130.	We in Tunisia are not fanatics or partisans of all-out war or peace at any cost. At the present stage of the struggle  no one can say whether this freedom which has gradually started to make its way in Sinai will accelerate progress towards justice and fraternity. No one can say whether this faint glimmer which we can see through the smoke of battle is the dawning of a new day on this earth where God once resided or a twilight that may bury new dead and our hopes once for all.131.	The outcome of the war is still uncertain. But what is certain is that the Arab peoples will remain in the battle  because they are convinced that truth is on their side. If today our brothers of Egypt and Syria  although less trained and less versed in the techniques of modern war and perhaps under-equipped  are waging war against the forces of war with so much faith and courage  it is precisely because they know they are sustained by this wave of support from international public opinion  the opinion of valiant and right-thinking men  and because they know that  as General de Gaulle said  at the individual and State levels and at the level of any human community  the end of hope is the beginning of death.132.	Everything  even decadence  ends. The Arab peoples of Palestine and elsewhere have passed beyond despair. It is by overcoming their despair that today they have encountered the highest possible form of hope: that which gives confidence to leaders  that which is synonymous with risk — because hope is also a question of risk.133. Sooner or later sympathy  goodwill — or simply will — will gradually become polarized around these three principles which President Bourguiba listed in Geneva before the International Labour Conference  namely: the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland and to a State  the right of the Arab countries not to be occupied and humiliated  and the right of the Israeli people not to be thrown into the sea.134.	Those three principles will  sooner or later  form the just and lasting foundation for settlement of the conflict that for more than a quarter of a century has been ravaging that area. On that basis and on the basis of the 1947 resolution [resolution 181(H)] — by which our Organization approved and legalized the birth of Israel — our President was even prepared to undertake  open-handedly and frankly  a dialogue with Israel. Israel thought that was a ruse and responded by polemics. Once again Israel missed availing itself of a reasonable initiative.135.	Neither the subtleties nor the verbal tics of Mr. Abba Eban  nor the thunderclaps and threats of Mr. Moshe Dayan  nor the cold and cynical calculations of Mrs. Golda Meir can deceive us. Because they are buried in the sarcophagus of their prejudices  because they do not want to change and even prevent themselves from changing  they are lost in a maze of procedure and formalism for fear of entering into the substance of the debate; they condemn themselves; and they discourage their warmest supporters. They have not yet understood that to maintain occupied territories as direct guarantees  to create faits accomplis in some places and to cause an exodus in other places  to organize repression against Palestinians is to take out for themselves and for the entire region an insurance that their future will be an unhappy one. It is to opt for a kind of man and a kind of society bathed in chauvinism; it is to proclaim intolerance and fanaticism and to practise violence and contempt.136.	Mr. Abba Eban  let me repeat what I have already said from this very platform. We believe that you are sincere in certain statements that you have made to the Assembly and it is this which gives us pause. Yes  we really begin to wonder whether it is in the nature of Israel  of its regime and of its leaders to be able to make peace. You have referred eloquently to certain international precedents and have concluded that only the Arabs and the Palestinians shirk dialogue for peace. But everybody is speaking. You know that under conditions of war there can only be people who talk further about war. The West and East Germans — whose admission to membership of our Organization we would like to welcome — managed to coexist in peace and fraternity only after they had clarified and spelled out the basic principles existing between them and between the great Powers. As far as North and South Korea are concerned  both of which we should be very pleased to see admitted to the United Nations too  if they have not yet arrived at that stage of unity and homogeneity which is so desired  it is solely because everything is not yet clear and agreed — at least as far as principles and objectives are concerned.137.	Leave all the occupied territories  therefore  including Jerusalem; put forward yourself valid conditions for peace; accept the pertinent resolutions of the United Nations  particularly that of 1947; and you will be surprised at the sense of responsibility and the constructive spirit which will be manifested by the most intransigent Arab leaders  including those among the Palestinians.138.	Meetings  direct negotiations  international precedents  logic  a scale of values  your logic  your scale of values — these are all nothing but words. It is not because you use these words that we should fear them. It is not because you have failed to bring about peace that we should fail to regenerate that peace. It is not because you' wish to exterminate the Palestinians that we have to exterminate you. Only a tolerant Palestine  where there would be coexistence between the Jews and the Palestinians in ways which remain to be determined  only an open society whose laws would be common to all and whose power would be assumed by its permanent members  Christian  Moslems and Jews — only this will make it possible for you no longer to be — in this tortured Middle East which has deserved better of mankind — the engenderer of hate  of fear and violence  a sort of pot which is ready to boil over. It is a question of time  perhaps  but it is also a question of the blood which is flowing in this tortured Middle East. Above all  it is a question of behaviour and commitment. Let the Israelis behave in a way which will bring about proper coexistence between Jews and Arabs  as has been the case and is the case in the Arab and Moslem countries; let the Zionists put an end to this dual and hateful tendency to suspect all other religions — even all other philosophies which do not believe in God — and to consider that the Jews  the citizens of other nations  are their own subjects  who can be mobilized whenever they see fit  in order to serve Israel hand and foot. Let them take care not to add to the bitterness of armed confrontation  the blindness of injured faith and religious passion.139.	Let us not commit the crime of transforming  in the name of the Jewish faith  Jews here and our brothers and those of our colleagues in the General Assembly into perjurers  into mercenaries or traitors to their own country. Israel is not  after all  the homeland of all Jews. Have not the leaders of Tel Aviv committed the arrogance of giving Israeli nationality collectively to an entire African tribe living in Ethiopia? And this must be an aberration from the point of view of international law. Henceforth  with the present Zionist practices and requirements  let us be on our guard; any Jewish community living in Africa  Europe or America might simply wake up one day relabelled as a Zionist homeland. Thus any country which practises tolerance and coexistence between races and religions runs the risk of becoming one day the Palestine of a new Israel.140.	When we realize that South Africa  Rhodesia and Portugal in particular are the unconditional allies of Israel  when we are aware that these countries help each other to practise scorn  arrogance and all the most abject forms of segregation  we can then understand the dangers which are lurking  particularly in Africa. In the structure of conquest and domination where the policy of Israel  as well as that of the racists of South Africa  Rhodesia and Portugal  is rooted  any defeat is considered as possibly being fatal. Thus  these protagonists of hate  scorn  colonialism and racism are quite naturally predisposed to violence by their very nature. Hence their desire to defy all reason and to thwart all peaceful efforts. They are predisposed to be more vain than heroic  more obstinate than prudent. They try to surround us in a dialectic of despair. As far as we Tunisians are concerned  the world is a witness of the fact that President Bourguiba  who has taught us the desire for fraternity  love  tolerance and co-operation  has never ceased tirelessly to seek practical ways to bring about peace and understanding. In 1946 — before the wars and before the atrocities — warned by the tragic experience of the German people with Hitler  he called upon the forces of good and progress  which were the Allies at the time  to help the Jews of Palestine to become de-Zionized  as the Germans of that time were being helped to become de-Nazified. We are happy to welcome here the great German nation which has been cured of its destructive demons. It now occupies the place which is due to it in the international community. Even if it takes the form of two Germanys  the joint effort of its worthy representatives is remarkable in all respects. Chancellor Brandt  while speaking fervently for peace  as he did here [2128th meeting]  also deserved peace  as the prestigious Nobel Prize awarded him has emphasized. There is more than one precedent to be thought about by the Israelis if they are really looking for peace  and also by the friends of Israel. Perhaps there we can find some precious indication of the way which will lead to salvation. The Israelis might aspire to coexist with us  as the Germans are doing in Europe and throughout the world  if they were to take the step of de-Zionizing themselves. But to de- Zionize in Israel is something quite different.141.	In the Middle East  where the sky touches the earth and has made it fertile with tremendous grace  one day all this hate will be succeeded by love; so much war must be succeeded by peace; so many tears must be followed by smiles; so many crises and sacrifices by a little joy and happiness. How can we help? The Egyptian fighters are dying even now to recover their territories  but also to revive the Suez Canal for international trade and peaceful commerce. It is important that all those in Europe and elsewhere who have suffered from the closure of the Canal because of Israeli aggression should assure Egypt of their sympathy and their support. For security throughout the world  for the development of trade and for the strengthening of the currents of fluidity to which man aspires  we demand that all countries  both great and small  should finally take action to ensure that the Suez Canal is reopened and that no longer will this path of peace be closed. A time will come when the instigators of war  the Israelis and the Zionists in particular  who have caused so much damage not only to the Arab nations but also to humanity  will have to answer for their crimes before men and before . God.142.	Unfortunately  Israel continues to commit these crimes. It is attacking civilians  children  women and diplomats  particularly in Syria. While the Egyptians and the Syrians are sacrificing themselves and are dying  and are confining their combat to the occupied territories; while they regard themselves as occupied people  the Israelis not only do not regard themselves as occupiers but are making civilians targets in the battle.143.	May I convey our condolences to all civilian victims of these indescribable acts  primarily to the Secretary- General for the United Nations victims and also to the Soviet Union  to its people  to its Government and to its delegation.144.	We denounce this tendency to practise war along pure Hitlerite lines. We denounce this with particular force because Jews were among the first victims of the Nazi follies.145.	Have the Arabs these days become a sort of Jew themselves? Have the Zionists themselves today become neo-Nazis? It is with horror that I ask that question.146.	Has unreason taken hold of the Israelis to such an extent that they are no longer content with the honour they had of having been victims of the Nazis but are now so ignominious as to justify these Nazi practices by themselves attacking civilians?147.	Today  the non-aligned countries  through their representatives  have been moved by the trials inflicted upon the civilian population and foreigners in Damascus. They held a meeting; they adopted a resolution and they have asked me to read it out  and with your permission  Mr. President  I should like to read it out:""The heads of delegations of non-aligned countries  who met at the United Nations on Wednesday  10 October 1973  considered the recent developments of the situation in the Middle East.""They condemn the aggression of Israel against Egypt and Syria and express to both those countries their total support in their just struggle and in their heroic efforts to liberate their occupied territories.""Recalling the resolution on the Middle East adopted by the Algiers Summit Conference   they demand that Israel withdraw from all occupied Arab territories as the prior condition for any solution being found to the crisis in the Middle East.""The heads of delegations of the non-aligned countries condemn the blind bombing of the civilian population of Syria by Israel  bombings which have caused the death of hundreds of innocent civilians  men  women and children  including foreign diplomats  United Nations officials and members of their families.""They particularly denounce the fact that Israel has carried the war to the civilian population and it condemns these acts of barbarism which gives an already painful conflict an inhumanity which cannot be tolerated by the international community.""The heads of the delegations of the non-aligned . countries have decided to remain in close contact with each other and with the representatives of Egypt and Syria in order to define what they may subsequently have to do  in accordance with the policies established by their Heads of States at the Algiers Conference.""148.	In this Organization we feel ourselves at a crossroads of anguish and anxiety. Every year  as new Members are admitted  our Organization gains in universality what it loses in effectiveness. Israel  Portugal and South Africa are simply burying  as they say themselves  the resolutions of the United Nations in what Israel has called ""the cemetery of aborted decisions"". Thus  they contribute to gravely harming public opinion regarding the United Nations.149.	What can we do about that? That was something which was referred to by the previous speaker and it is a question I ask myself. It is one of the most serious problems which is being faced by our Organization. What can we do with those who refuse  and persistent in their refusal  to abide by United Nations resolutions?150.	In the midst of these storms which are reverberating throughout the third world  facing these difficulties which are becoming increasingly many and complex as days pass  and despite the super-Powers who do not always give us encouragement and despite the ""small"" Powers which often harass and defy us  without forgetting the budgetary concerns and difficulties which are endless  we are very grateful to our Secretary-General for the way he is coping and is continuing imperturbably to proceed along the lines of innovation and research. A great deal has been said about our Organization  but it is a miracle that it has not yet stumbled and continues to spread its effect throughout the world by bringing about detente and peace.151.	The contract which we have with the United Nations and by which we shall always be bound is possibly the sort of tacit contract which children  because of some mysterious far-sightedness  give to something which seems to incarnate their careless seriousness  their calm innocence  their intelligence and the tremendous promise of their future. That is the great favour which the United Nations gives to those people who have ""just emerged from childhood"" — as is often said with a certain amount of scorn.152.	The real greatness of the United Nations is not to give wealth to the world but to maintain hope in the world. The surest star in the firmament of the United Nations in these stormy times is its faithfulness to its vocation.153.	In Addis Ababa on the tenth anniversary of OAU  at Algiers at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  we have applied ourselves to basing our action on studying a rigorous analysis of the situation in order better to understand men and situations. In doing so it seems to us that we have acted for the best in order to ensure that the cause which we serve  peace  the ideal of the United Nations  will have light  warmth and strength brought to it  which is the only way to bring about events and which alone can modify events sooner or later.154.	The African voice has been heard here through two prestigious heads of State: President Gowon of Nigeria and President Mobutu of Zaire [2140th meeting]. That of the non-aligned countries  which are the majority of this Assembly  will shortly make itself heard through the voice of President Houari Boumediene whose name alone evokes seriousness  lucidity  refusal to be cast down and commitment to genuine peace  peace for all.155.	To succeed in making the United Nations equal to the requirements of our times  to ensure that there is this contribution of light  strength and warmth  undoubtedly we need this sense of restraint  this sense of reality  this penchant for the concrete which is so typical of those peoples who have only just left childhood behind: in other words  these virtues which illuminate audacity  which ensure that things are thought out and which make action fruitful.156.	President Mobutu expressed here what we Tunisians believe  both authentically and eloquently — virtues which he proved that he possessed when he showed us what his plans were. He also showed us  in a masterly way  that he was operating as a builder and that he was not one of those who built merely by abstraction. In his frank words there was a great freshness  a spontaneity which is. so characteristic of young peoples and which tomorrow could become the new sap which will rise and which will help us to rid ourselves of outworn slogans and all these complications produced by the interests of the great Powers and calculated strategies of detente.157.	We represent in the United Nations peoples who in Africa  Asia and in America seem to be overshadowed by suffering and death but who continue to multiply their yearning for hope.158.	We are very concerned about detente. We are particularly sensitive to the spirit underlying it  the tendencies rather than those old well-used incantations which often sound false. We would have deserved detente if only we could have injected some concern into this indifference towards us which is sometimes characteristic of the superpowers. We would be mad if we were not in favour of detente. But we know what detente means and should mean. We are in favour of genuine detente which would be effective everywhere and for all.159.	Detente would be genuine if the arms race were brought to a halt  if total nuclear and conventional disarmament were brought about  if we no longer had to fulminate against those who test weapons  and if the force of law were restored and when we have the necessary remedies in order to reinforce the United Nations and bring about a more harmonious and balanced economic and financial order.160.	It is true that detente would be everywhere and for all if it were to benefit  first  the countries of the third world  and if it made it possible for the Arabs to recover their territories  if it made it possible for the Palestinians to recover their homeland  for the peoples of Angola  Mozambique  Namibia  Guinea-Bissau and Cambodia and others finally to know what peace is  by recovering their full rights to live as they want.161.	Detente would be universal and for all if useful and necessary steps were taken in order to banish famine and its scourges  which only ravage the soil of the third world. Human life  man  in our country  seems to have two extra risks — the risk of death by enslavement and death by famine. It will be understood that our needs pertain to life and death and we are aware that they are both easy and difficult to satisfy. We do not want to offend anybody. We do not want to ask the impossible of anyone  and that is why we welcome any sign of detente  even if it is limited to the great Powers. However  it does have to be real  not something which disguises dark designs.162.	A genuine detente between the USSR and the United States would contribute to liberating for those of us in the poor countries some of the resources which are now completely taken up in the arms competition  and a little tranquillity for mankind as well.163.	My delegation welcomes the initiative of the Soviet Union in revising the proposal which it had the merit of making as early as the General Assembly session of 1958 and which consists of taking 10 per cent from the military budgets of the five great Powers  permanent members of the Security Council [A/9191].164.	The representative of the great Soviet Union will. I hope  allow us to say that since 1958 currency has depreciated considerably and that the Soviet offer would be better if it kept pace with present-day prices  and particularly if it had broad support  if only to prevent it from becoming a sort of common coin. May I add that we have not really understood why the Soviet delegation placed a great deal of emphasis on the fact that all five permanent members of the Security Council should agree  without a single exception. Does this mean that  if one of them did not agree  the offer would be completely void? We know that there is at least one who does not agree. However  we continue to believe that this is a genuine offer on the part of the Soviet Union  and not just an empty promise.165.	We are aware that we  the small Powers  the unsatisfied and troubled countries of the third world  are often outside the decisions taken in the major capitals of the world and are often the object of these agreements  the thing at stake. We know the specific weight of each country and the attendant authority and responsibilities  and there is some justice that the super-Powers should feel more responsible and more involved in managing the affairs of the world. In fact  however  the behaviour of various countries does not always obey these laws of good conduct. Excessive use of the right of veto in some circumstances really gives us pause. Can we not say that the contemporary spirit is somewhat disturbed by the survival of the right of veto? It is true that  as Andre Malraux said  for the mind there is no minor nation; the mind recognizes only brother nations.166.	We should have liked to have had the same sort of active affection embracing America  whose help we shall not forget in difficult moments in our existence; the Soviet Union  whose great contribution we appreciate; the countries of Europe  our allies  our natural partners. And in this regard I will begin by mentioning that country with which we have particularly privileged relations: France  the value of its teachings  its humanism and its desire for independence; the United Kingdom  with its ability to stand up to adversity; Germany  with its impressive degree of development; Italy  with its history; the Scandinavian countries with their devotion to peace; Japan  with its spectacular recovery; Canada which  with its contributions  helped to allay suffering; Australia  with its desire to heed the voice of the small and the weak; and not forgetting the tremendous country of China which is so fascinating  so rich in its wealth of teaching and which has such remarkable intelligence and aptitude  gauging as it can the precise feelings of the third world. We should like to have had equal and active affection for all those nations which  in their own way  have to a certain extent helped the countries of the third world. But is it not really time for these nations to revise the criteria for assistance  co-operation and active solidarity with the poor countries?167.	We are full of admiration for so much moral and material strength in our Organization. We are full of admiration for all the reserves  the imagination  the talent and the creative power. At the same time  how can I disguise the fact that we are sorry to see so many seeds of division? And what a waste of energy is taking place among these nations.168.	Sometimes we feel obliged to make a choice between the notion of exigency and interest represented by these nations  and alignment with one of the concepts of life they represent. The fourth Algerian summit conference said firmly and clearly that we refuse to choose in order not to accentuate these antagonisms  and we modestly  but tirelessly  seek to promote pluralism in our countries — each in his own way according to our national temperament  originality and national genius — and we do this to affirm our desire to practise in our way the principles of peaceful coexistence.169.	I should like to conclude by asking a question which is particularly important to the hearts not only of Tunisians  but of others as well. Never has it been so obvious that the history of Jerusalem is linked with the history of our times. There can be no genuine peaceful coexistence in the world  no valid detente in the world  if fraternity and concord do not become necessities in this city of light  the only city where God chose to reside on earth  the only city which was chosen by providence so that three times in the history of mankind messages should resound in the ears of men through Jews  Christians and Moslems.170.	There are places where  more than anywhere else  the Divine spirit can help to bring about tolerance and understanding among peoples. There are cities which teach faith and help to lift spirits which are tired and devoid of hope. They are predestined for dialogue between man and God  between man and man. Jerusalem is such a place; it is one of those cities and  in the present situation  when Israel obstinately blasphemes Jerusalem  the past and the future of Jerusalem turn their eyes towards us. We say: save Jerusalem!171.	You  the representatives of the great nations with whom we wish to work together to try to overcome suffering  to restore dignity  to spread hope  if you often dislike getting involved in our small conflicts  and if you sometimes give us strength to settle our quarrels  if sometimes you quarrel to defend your own interests  if your words of detente and peace are not always in accordance with your actions  at least let Jerusalem give you an opportunity to co-ordinate your actions with us so that we can join our efforts to defend Jerusalem  to save the spirit of Jerusalem  to preserve what is dearest to us  what is most sacred to us  to help God and men  and to warn off those who disfigure Jerusalem and who commit a crime against man and God.172.	Let us try together to produce a motion before this General Assembly concerning Jerusalem; let us all meet together to serve Jerusalem; perhaps only in this way can we save ourselves  can we save our countries  can we save the ideals of the United Nations  peaceful coexistence and the spirit of civilization of which we are all such staunch protagonists."
"110",6978,"TUR",28,1973,"﻿37.	I should like first to express our warmest congratulations to Ambassador Leopoldo Benites on the occasion of his election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. I am certain that the outstanding personal qualities of Ambassador Benites as scholar  journalist and diplomat  which we have known and appreciated very closely  his long experience in the service of our Organization and his dedication to the ideals of the United Nations will ensure the success of our deliberations and decisions. This is the seventh time that this high office has been assumed by the Latin American countries  with which Turkey has excellent and most cordial relations.38.	I wish also to express my appreciation to our outgoing President  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Polish People's Republic  for the excellent work he did throughout his tenure of office.39.	Equally  it is with distinct pleasure that I wish to pay here a warm tribute to my good friend Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim for his unceasing efforts for the promotion of peace  concord  co-operation and security in these challenging and fast-changing times.40.	Another source of satisfaction for us is to see the growing membership of our Organization. Therefore  I join my colleagues who preceded me at this rostrum in welcoming the representatives of the three new Member States-the Federal Republic of Germany  the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas — with all our good wishes. There is no doubt that with each addition to its membership our world Organization approaches a step further towards its goal of universality. We hope that this process will continue in the future.41.	In my rather long years of association with the United Nations I have had the privilege a great number of times of taking this rostrum to expound our views on the state of affairs prevailing in our ever-shrinking planet  and I expressed our fervent hope that forthcoming developments would fall in line with the aspirations and expectations of mankind as a whole. In my addresses I have always tried to be as objective as ii was possible for a responsible representative of a country  both in the choice of subjects I touched upon and in my evaluations and analyses in so doing. Among the problems which I took up there were a few of such long duration that I have had to come back to them time and again  year after year; there were also those which were serious enough to warrant urgent and close examination  but which proved to be more manageable with the passage of time; and lastly  and most happily  events about which elation had to be voiced were not non-existent.42.	In so far as the present situation in the world as a whole is concerned  it would be over-optimistic  if not too naive  to say that the over-all pattern has undergone a very fundamental change compared to previous years. We still have a checkered one  complete with problems of all kinds43.	I arrive at this conclusion proceeding from the logical rule which demands that a bottle be called half-empty or half-full according to the gradual decrease or increase of its contents. In other words  nothing being static  everything being subject to constant change in one direction or another  the main yardstick with which to appreciate a given situation ought to be the development which has led to it and the trend which it represents.44.	Looking at our world of today from that angle  I would submit that we can detect  through conflicting elements  an unmistakable and continuous trend of progress for the better. It is this indeed too slow and too erratic but nevertheless new trend that makes me feel rather optimistic despite all the caution which the vicissitudes in international relations of the post-war decades teach us.45.	In point of fact  let us cast a cursory look at the developments that have taken place since the last session of our Assembly. Since their history is too recent for a clear judgement of their respective importance  let us consider these developments on a geographical basis  heading from the East towards the West.46.	In the Far East  the happiest event is no doubt the agreement reached in the Viet-Nam conflict. That long- drawn-out armed confrontation harmed all the participants and caused great human suffering. Now that it is over  we hope that the atmosphere of reconciliation which has been created by the Viet-Namese cease-fire will spread to the other neighbouring countries and that the whole region will soon have peace  calm and stability.47.	Some more good news has come to us from the Asian subcontinent: the repatriation of thousands of prisoners of war held in captivity since 1971 is at last on the way to realization. The subcontinent is one of the birthplaces of civilization. With its population reaching the hundreds of millions  with its great natural resources and with its time-tested wisdom  the nations of the subcontinent are destined to have a promising future. Our wish is that this event may mark the beginning of a new era in which all remaining points of dissension can be eliminated and the foundations of a lasting co-operation with full respect for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and equality of all can be laid down.48.	Agreements in Viet-Nam and in the subcontinent show  us that  given goodwill and perseverance  no conflict is too hard  or too complicated to defy peaceful and honourable solution.49.	Coming to Europe  we again have cause for hope. As might be guessed  I am alluding mainly to the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. This Conference  which was held with the' participation of 32 European countries plus the United States and Canada  has already completed its first stage successfully  and its second one is on the way. Moreover  preparatory work for the conference on mutual force reductions in Central Europe is now completed  and the conference itself is expected to start at its appointed time and place. Although it is too soon to express a firm opinion  we can already say that it will constitute a landmark in the examination of security problems.50.	In this context  I wish to underline the fact that security in the world in general  and in Europe in particular  is based on a very delicate balance. Therefore  in this process all our efforts should converge towards strengthening and stabilizing security  and not diminishing it for one or another country or group of countries.51.	Of all the remnants of the Second World War  the German question proved to be perhaps the hardest one to solve. We are happy that a formula has been reached and that we can greet in our midst both the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. In the attainment of this result  the efforts deployed by all parties are of course worthy of praise; but we can  in all equity  single out the courageous and realistic policies pursued by the present distinguished leadership of the Federal Republic of Germany.52.	I shall repeat what I said a few minutes ago  namely  that even the most arduous difficulties can be overcome when goodwill and mutual understanding prevail. It is precisely because we have this observation in mind that we do not fall into undue pessimism as regards the Cyprus question-a question which is of paramount importance for both the Turkish nation as a whole and the Turkish community on the island. Although we view with deep concern some developments that are taking place on the Greek Cypriot side  we still hope that the enlarged intercommunal talks which are being held between the representatives of the two communities with the participation of experts on constitutional law from Greece and Turkey and the Special Representative of the Secretary- General will yield results acceptable to all interested parties and defuse once and for all a potentially explosive situation.53.	We have always favoured a peaceful and lasting solution for the Cyprus question-one which would safeguard the partnership status of the two communities in the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and security of that bicommunal State and which would be based on local autonomy  in accordance with the justified aspiration of the Turkish population of the island. Here I would like again to express our appreciation to all those Governments which are contributing to the peace-keeping activities in Cyprus  the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the members of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus.54.	The Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Algiers  which more than 70 countries attended  has once more demonstrated the importance of the role the third world can play in international relations. We believe that the conclusions of that Conference will give impetus and add a new dimension to the prospects for peace and development.55.	So much for the relatively bright side of the present- day world scene. As for the darker sides  they are numerous.56.	First of all  the phenomenon which has come to be known as the arms race and which is not only the reflection of the uneasiness and insecurity felt by all nations but also  in its turn  one of the reasons for that same uneasiness and insecurity  goes on unchecked and unabated. In spite of the favourable atmosphere created by the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks for new endeavours in the field of disarmament  no relaxation is observed in the upward swing of arms production. It is really sad that on this tenth anniversary of the partial test-ban Treaty2 both the quality and the quantity of nuclear as well as conventional weapons should be constantly progressing  swallowing up huge amounts of riches and energy most needed for the betterment of- the human condition  and forcing mankind to live under the threat of unprecedented disaster.57.	If this most serious problem is not tackled courageously and realistically  and if  as a beginning at least  a partial solution cannot be arrived at  arrangements to be achieved in the political field alone are bound to be rootless  and the climate of detente to be created will accordingly be fragile.58.	A no less dark image seen in the international kaleidoscope is indeed the survival of that most heinous practice called colonialism. Colonialism  as implemented nowadays  is rooted in slavery and bases itself on man's exploitation by man. Therefore  it cannot be justified by any measure of historical distortion. In this year of 1973  when we celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and when the United Nations counts among its Members scores of former colonial countries  ' the most lenient judgement to be passed on the fact that some 28 million people continue to live under the colonial yoke and still others suffer from racial discrimination is that this clearly denotes a mentality cruelly behind the times. The Republic of Turkey  which emerged from a struggle for liberation  will always be on the side of those who fight for their independence and freedom.59.	It is a good omen for the future that efforts in the international field against colonialism never cease to be deployed  as witness the International Conference of Experts for the Support of Victims of Colonialism and Apartheid in southern Africa  held at Oslo in April 1973  sponsored jointly by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.60.	However  another source of deep anxiety in the present world panorama is the continuation of the Middle East question  with no solution in sight as yet. This unhappy and stagnant situation of ""no war  no peace"" should not be viewed only in the light of its negative effects on the search for a solution  but should also be considered carefully  as it carries in itself the seeds of violence and thus maintains its highly explosive character. It must be recalled that peace means a lot more than a negative definition  such as the lack of war suggests.61.	It must equally be recalled that no amount of rhetoric should be able to supply with a cloak of legitimacy any attempt at gaining territory or political prestige by the use of force or by means of forcible faits accomplis  on the one hand  and the delaying of the evacuation of territories thus gained  on the other. We believe that the world community is in duty bound to do whatever it can in order to break this deadlock.62.	Turkey  being in the region involved and having traditionally close and friendly ties with the Arab countries  wishes to see this problem solved as soon as possible in conformity with the principles of justice and equity. We continue to believe that Security Council resolution 242(1967) contains the necessary elements for the attainment of a lasting and honourable settlement. The establishment of a just peace should safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of all concerned  including  naturally  those of the Palestinians. We hold the view that the status of Jerusalem  a Holy City for three major religions of mankind  should not be changed by unilateral actions.63.	I now wish to dwell briefly on a different subject which should retain the attention of our Assembly. I refer to acts of violence and terrorism. It must be more than a truism to underline the fact that recourse to violence with its underhanded methods such as terrorism  sabotage  the hijack. of aircraft and so on  far from solving problems complicates them still more and engenders new ones.64.	Here I want to make one point absolutely clear. Terrorism can in no way be condoned. I should even add that of all acts of violence terroristic acts must be condemned with particular emphasis because of the cowardliness inherent in them. The justness of the cause they are supposed to serve must never be considered an excuse. But we should never lose sight of the very important fact that the reverse is valid too. That is  we should never be unduly influenced in our judgement on a given cause by our abhorrence of the means used for its furtherance.65.	We must earnestly hope that the present Assembly will through its concurrent efforts be able to prepare a draft convention for the prevention and suppression of international terrorism. We think that it falls equally to us to consider seriously and adopt at this session the draft convention on the prevention and punishment of crimes against diplomatic agents and other internationally protected persons [item 90]. It is also important that a large number of countries should be parties to the Tokyo  The Hague and the Montreal Conventions.66.	Here I note with regret that the extraordinary session of the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization  and the International Conference on Air Law closed recently without any positive results.67.	We are looking forward to the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea with great expectations. The outcome of the Conference is of extreme importance for the international community. We shall either open a new era of international co-operation or move towards possible chaos in that field. The main question in our efforts in the preparation of new international norms for the law of the sea is the determination of the limits of national jurisdiction of sovereign States. In our opinion  a solution of this problem does not infringe the sovereign rights of States or relate to the division of those rights. The creation of a new order must be based on justice and equity and must take into account the peculiarities and realities of different regions of the world which have particular problems that can be solved only through mutual agreement.68.	If I have so far dwelt mostly on political questions and prospects for the future  it should not be construed that we attribute less importance to economic problems. On the contrary  we believe that the roots of many of the political problems encountered are of an economic nature. International co-operation is an absolute must when we look forward to the improvement of the well-being of the masses.69.	A preliminary assessment of the progress achieved so far during the Second United Nations Development Decade does not give rise to much optimism  especially for countries in the process of development. Yet the forthcoming multilateral trade negotiations lead us away from falling into complete pessimism. The prolongation of the uncertainties in the world monetary system seriously endanger world trade as a whole and particularly the trade of the developing countries. Therefore we urge the completion of the work being carried out for the improvement of the international monetary system without delay. International economic relations need to be salvaged from their present insecure atmosphere. Much remains to be done in the sharing of the benefits accrued through technological progress.70.	Recent drought and natural disasters in many parts of the world have led us to think more seriously about the alarming situation of the world food problem. In this age of Igreat technological advancement  it is paradoxical still to witness men dying of hunger and men being overwhelmed by the forces of nature. The need for assistance from the international community is urgent  especially for the Central African Republic  Chad  Mali  Mauritania  Niger and Upper Volta in the Sudano-Sahelian region. Furthermore  the heavy floods which devastated life and property in Pakistan  with which we have fraternal ties of friendship  have left that great country in need of immediate assistance.71.	While we are sure that all possible aid will continue to flow expeditiously to those fellow member countries  timely realization of that vital assistance should not relieve our minds of the long-term problems of poor agricultural production. We therefore find the convening of a world food conference  as proposed by the Secretary of State of the United States [2124th meeting]  timely and appropriate.72.	Moreover  serious consideration should be given to the problems of the environment and to the immediate and long-term problems of energy  which are inseparable from the future of mankind.73.	A month from now  almost to the day  on 29 October  Turkey will be celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the proclamation of the Republic. That means  above all  the beginning of a new era for our nation.74.	The political philosophy of this era has been characterized more than anything by the justly renowned principle of the founder of the new Turkey  the great Kemal Ataturk  which demands  ""Peace at home  peace in the world"". The latter part of this principle which Ataturk bequeathed to his nation is clear enough to need no comment. Throughout history  many great thinkers have perceived and expressed the necessity of peace for human happiness. Whereas the first part  which takes up peace as an element of progress in the internal life of a nation'  contains truly original and far-sighted thought  when Ataturk insisted that peace at home should flourish together with peace in the world Turkey was emerging from a long series of wars. On the other hand  it was preparing itself for the complete eradication of the remnants of exploitation in economic and other fields which had for such a long time distorted both its relations with the outside world and its day-to-day life.75.	Ataturk  who was the first to take up the sword when the nation had to fight a life-and-death struggle  taught his people that  although any undue foreign influence was not to be tolerated  the orderly social and economic development of the national life depended nevertheless on the achievement of a climate of peace in both internal and external relations. Foreign interference should be supplanted by co-operation  hostility should give way to friendship  and peace should prevail both at home and in the world. Those principles are enshrined in the Charter of our Organization.76.	Those same principles led Turkey to establish and maintain throughout this half-century a policy of good- neighbourliness and friendship with all the countries of the region and the world. That policy is also the basis of the fraternal ties existing between Turkey  Iran and Pakistan.77.	Having espoused as sincerely as we have the principle of our great leader  it should be no accident that Turkey has during the course of the five last decades  which were full of turbulent events in international life  withstood the vicissitudes of the era and remained a loyal member of the world community in the promotion of peace  security and co-operation in its region as well as in the world at large. My country is determined to remain faithful to its traditional policy of peace and co-operation.78.	Inspired by this experience of ours. I shall now try to think aloud on what can be done about the positive and negative elements which combine to form the present international political fabric  with a view to fostering the former and weeding out the latter. What do we have at our disposal for our guidance?79.	First of all  we have the fundamental purposes and principles of our Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  as well as the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)].80.	Then there are international agreements which are valid under the generally recognized principles and rules of international law  and which stipulate obligations to be fulfilled in good faith by every nation.81.	All those documents are inspired by the fact that peace and security represent the fundamental aspirations of mankind  and for that reason their maintenance and strengthening acquire paramount importance.82.	We can be guided also by the solemn declarations of intent made during the July 1973 Helsinki session of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to strive for the establishment of conditions of detente and co-operation in that region of the world. We can bear in mind that genuine detente can be achieved only by eliminating the causes of international conflicts  armed confrontations and open hostility.83.	Again  we can bear in mind mankind's impressive achievements in science and technology  on the one hand  and the consequent problems of a political  economic  environmental and social nature  on the other. And  last but not least  we can bear in mind the laudable efforts made by the United Nations in dedicating decades to particular causes in the fields of disarmament and development  as well as prospectively in the field of action to combat racism and racial discrimination.84.	With all that in mind I ventured to suggest last year the possibility of declaring a ""decade of political conciliation"". The basis this year for such a declaration  which I still regard as useful  could be a text in which the relevant principles of the Charter should be emphasized  giving due consideration to the inalienable rights of colonial peoples to self-determination and independence and strongly condemning colonialism  apartheid and racial discrimination. In this text  after having unequivocally underlined the inadmissibility of acquisition of territorial or political advantages through the use or threat of force in international relations  we might  for the promotion of the purposes of this ""decade of political conciliation""  ask the Secretary- General to co-operate with interested specialized agencies  intergovernmental organizations and institutions renowned for their impartial expertise on the subject  and to take into consideration the valuable work already accomplished in this field in order to prepare a study on the implications of such a decade and to propose appropriate machinery within the United Nations system for the implementation of its exigencies.85.	I think that  if these ideas meet the support of my colleagues  our Secretary-General and his able staff may be trusted to produce a document on the subject and present it for the consideration of the next session of the General Assembly."
"111",7040,"TZA",28,1973,"﻿20.	 Mr. President  allow me first of all to take this opportunity to join my colleagues who have preceded me in expressing the deep gratification we all share in seeing you assume this highly respected and immensely responsible office of the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly. Your unanimous election to this office bespeaks the confidence you personally enjoy in this august assembly. Above all  it is an expression of the great respect and admiration we have towards your great country and your great people.21.	For my country and Africa  you represent not only your country  Ecuador  with which we enjoy warm relations  but also the sister continent of Latin America  with which Africa is linked in solidarity by common social  political and economic backgrounds and the growing co-operation in our common struggle to free our peoples from the vestiges of political and economic imperialism. There is  therefore  no need for me to state that you represent that solidarity and common cause. We remain convinced that under your able and enlightened guidance this session will be crowned with unqualified success.22.	May I also pay tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Trepczynski  the Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland  who during the last session of the General Assembly conducted his office with the highest degree of responsibility  dedication and wisdom.23.	Before continuing with my statement  allow me to address myself to a very important and perhaps one of the most historic events of our time in the continent of Africa. I refer to the declaration of independence by the gallant people of the State of Guinea-Bissau.24.	The State of Guinea-Bissau  after holding a democratic election last year  has now completed the process of exercising its right to self-determination and independence by declaring its State to be an independent State. This has been achieved after many years of hard struggle and much bloodshed by the people of that country under the correct and the dynamic leadership of the PAIGC. 25.	I am pleased to inform this Assembly that the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania yesterday accorded full recognition  diplomatic and otherwise to the new State of Guinea-Bissau.26.	On behalf of the Government and people of Tanzania I wish to congratulate the new State and the people of Guinea-Bissau on the bold step they have taken. Tanzania is fully aware-I repeat  Tanzania is fully aware-of the consequences of such a step.27.	As the proclamation rightly pointed out  the struggle of the people of the new State will continue to be waged with greater vigour and determination  until those small parts of Guinea and Cape Verde which remain under the occupation of the Portuguese aggressors have been completely liberated. In that struggle for the consolidation of national independence and eradication of foreign occupation  Tanzania will provide its maximum support. It will also be our duty to do all we can to help this new State join the family of nations in this our United Nations  should they so desire. This is going to be one of the historic test cases to indicate whether the United Nations can stand firm on the side of self-determination  independence and freedom.28.	We strongly appeal to the whole membership of the group of non-aligned nations and to all States to extend recognition to this new State.29.	It also gives me special pleasure  on behalf of the Government and the people of Tanzania  to welcome the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. The Commonwealth of the Bahamas is a country with which we share a common background and aspirations. Its attainment of independence and subsequent admission to membership in the Organization is yet another victory of the ideals for which the United Nations stands  namely  the right of all peoples to self-determination and independence. We look forward to close collaboration and co-operation with its delegation.30.	The admission of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to membership in this Organization is an important and historic event. The presence here of those two States is a manifestation of that spirit of detente which we welcome. It brings nearer the realization of the lofty goals of universality which is so fundamental for the effectiveness of our Organization.31.	In welcoming the German Democratic Republic we take cognisance of the significant role which the Government and the people of that country play in the liberation struggle of the colonial peoples and their support for justice and freedom in all its forms and manifestations.32.	In equally welcoming the Federal Republic of Germany  we would wish to express our earnest hope that that Government will assume its obligations and responsibilities in a concrete manner with regard to the problem of southern Africa. We have noted with interest the vigorous efforts which that Government  under the leadership of Chancellor Brandt  has deployed on the question of detente in Europe  and we sincerely hope that equal concern will be manifested in the problems which are so vital to the African people. After all  it is only through understanding clearly the problems of southern Africa that the Federal Republic of Germany can hope to have meaningful friendly relations with Africa.33.	Our warm welcome also goes to the Office of the Permanent Observer of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  which has just opened its offices at the United Nations. While this is a modest step towards the final goal  our primary hope remains that the Korean people will be allowed to reunite peacefully and without external interference so that that great country may one day also join our Organization as one country.34.	The Government and people of the United Republic of Tanzania learned with great shock and profound sorrow of the tragic and untimely death of President Salvador Allende of Chile. As we know  the constitutionally and democratically elected President Allende fell in the violent military take-over which recently befell the Chilean people. He died in combat  fighting to defend the ideals he had pursued throughout his life  the ideals of freedom  justice and human dignity.35.	President Allende was a staunch patriot  one who pursued the economic liberation to which the people of Chile look for the fulfilment of their aspirations. He devoted his entire efforts to the liberation of the Chilean people from the evils of ignorance  poverty and disease. He sought hard to transform Chilean society into a socialist society where prosperity would go hand in hand with equality and justice. Under his leadership the Chilean people had made great strides towards the fulfilment of those goals  but the forces of imperialism  reaction and injustice have relentlessly accelerated their pressures to undermine the efforts of the Chilean people. The tragic events in Chile are the culmination of the long and well-known machinations of reactionary forces. They demonstrate the ruthlessness of neo-colonialism and economic imperialism.36.	The death of President Allende is a great loss to all those who strive to build a prosperous world where justice and human dignity will prevail. It is  indeed  a singular blow to the third world. President Allende has died a martyr to those ideals  not only for his own people but for the entire masses of the world. His life has been terminated  but we in Tanzania believe that his spirit will continue to spur us on  in pursuit of the lofty ideals for which he sacrificed his life. The Government and people of the United Republic of Tanzania extend their profound and heartfelt condolences to the family of President Allende and to the people of Chile.37.	The developing world must learn from the events in Chile that international monopolies will go to any lengths  including murder  to ensure their continued exploitation of our countries. We raise our hats to all those victims of the murders which are now going on in Chile in an attempt to silence those who stand for the complete liberation of their country.38.	As we gather here it is pertinent to note that the trend of events in the world has been towards the reduction of tension. The adoption of the policy of negotiation instead of confrontation among the major Powers of the world  as exemplified by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and other contacts elsewhere  have all been moves designed to increase the possibility of peace. Tanzania welcomes that trend. However  while we welcome such trends  notice must be taken of the fact that these improved chances of peace have not necessarily brought justice. There are still very many places in the world where justice is flagrantly flouted and injustice venerated. In Indo-China  despite recent developments towards peace there  the aggressors still support the puppet regimes in Cambodia and Viet-Nam against the forces of liberation. In the Middle East  forces of occupation continue to consolidate and enjoy the fruits of conquest  contrary to the principles of our Charter. State terrorism is being adopted as an instrument of policy and the rights of Palestinians are being flouted. And in southern Africa  despite all manifestations of the people's will against oppression  relentless efforts are being made  sometimes with the connivance of some of those Members of our Organization primarily responsible for peace-keeping  to continue that oppression.39.	These situations  which are fraught with injustice  could still reverse the very significant steps which have been made towards peace. Peace can only last if it is based on a firm foundation of justice  for without justice the world can have only the facade of peace. In this context  note must be taken of the fact that so long as there still remains one spot in the world where injustice exists  that spot could jeopardize all efforts which are being made for the attainment of world peace. Lack of security in one continent affects the security of the other continents. That is why peace must be based on justice everywhere. It is an illusion  for example  to build the foundations of peace in Europe and neglect the explosive situation in southern Africa. Inevitably  the events in that region will affect the security of the European continent. Let me repeat — justice must be universal and indivisible or peace will not last.40.	The Middle East remains an area of high tension. Injustice and aggression continue to be perpetrated and consolidated. Israel not only has continued to cling to the territories that it illegally occupies but has also adopted measures geared towards the permanent occupation of some of those lands. That has remained so despite all the efforts which have been exerted in search of a solution. The Government of Israel has become so arrogant  so contemptuous  that it not only has refused to respond favourably to numerous warnings and calls by this Organization but has also embarked on deliberate and calculated acts of aggression. It has adopted terrorism as State policy. It was in pursuance of that policy that that Government  in contempt of all norms of international practice and in breach of international law  violated the air space of ILebanon to intercept a civilian aircraft on a scheduled flight and thereby endangered civilian life. That Government has sent its troops into Lebanon  sometimes even in the presence of television cameras  to commit murder. And how can we forget the despicable and senseless act of shooting down a civilian Libyan aircraft  with the tragic loss of so many lives?41.	By any standards  this is an incredible record of violation of the principles of the United Nations. There"" is no doubt that these acts have made the situation more explosive and peace all the more elusive.42.	In the face of this serious threat to international peace and security  the United Nations must fully assume its responsibility if we are to avert another military confrontation in that area. The United Nations must act  and act decisively  to eliminate the consequences of aggression and in favour of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. Considering the obduracy and intransigence of Israel in this connexion  the United Nations can no longer be content with the passage of mere moralistic resolutions. Enforcement of the decisions of the Organization is indeed long overdue.43.	Let me now turn to the question of the Palestinian people. It is absurd for our Organization and indeed cruel  to say the least  that thousands of Palestinians should be made to live in tents for ever. Yet every time this Assembly meets we seem to sweep under the carpet the Palestinian problem which actually is the root-cause of the Middle East question.44.	It would be illusory to imagine that the Middle East question could be solved without finding a solution to the Palestinian people's plight. To ignore this is  to say the least  to postpone the inevitable. It is  therefore  the hope of my delegation that this Assembly will sincerely look into this matter and start to find a just solution which the Palestinians have for so long awaited from this Organization.45.	At the beginning of this year an agreement was signed in Paris with a view to bringing peace to Viet-Nam.  It was an agreement that sent a welcome wave of deep relief throughout the world. For the immediate effect of that agreement was to bring an end to the traumatic savagery that had so vividly characterized United States imperialism in that unhappy land for more than a decade. The world could not but feel relieved at that important development  which signified a great victory for the Viet-Namese people and the forces of peace throughout the world. Like the rest of mankind  therefore  the Government and people of Tanzania welcomed the Paris Agreement.46.	The Paris Agreement testified to the resilience of the Viet-Namese people and demonstrated the invincibility of a people struggling for its rights against formidable odds. It was clearly shown that brutality and the might of even the most powerful of nations could not and cannot subdue the will of a people determined to be free. That is the lesson of Viet-Nam and that is the inspiration which all those who are struggling for freedom and justice draw from the indomitable spirit and heroic struggle of the Viet-Namese people.47.	It is regrettable that the lessons of Viet-Nam have not been fully comprehended in relation to Cambodia. There the United States continues to interfere in the domestic affairs of the Cambodian people by propping up the puppet regime of Lon Nol. While bowing to the legitimate demands of the American people and the international community to put an end to the barbarous bombing  the United States. continues to bolster the economic and military capacity of that besieged regime  desperately trying to give reality to its pretences. It is our hope that  instead of proceeding on this misguided course  the objective realities of Cambodia will be realized and the international community as a whole will accord recognition to the only legitimate and rightful Government of Cambodia  under the leadership of the Head of State  Prince Norodom Sihanouk.48.	The people of Indo-China have known war and suffering for too long. They are as much entitled to enjoy peace as those who are responsible for their misery. But the only way to achieve this noble objective is to leave the people of that region to determine their own destiny.49.	The people of Korea have for many years been divided  largely because of foreign interference — again by the United States. The situation in Korea is both ironical and anachronistic. Ironical  because the name of the United Nations and its flag continue to be used as a cover for foreign troops which serve the interests of imperialism through war-mongering and other forms of instigation and promotion of conflict. Anachronistic  because we are made to understand that the era of the cold war is ended. Yet the victims of the cold war continue to be divided from kith and kin. The longer we allow this situation to continue the more cynicism we invite from those who look to the United Nations for salvation.50.	The Korean people have rejected foreign interference in Korea's internal affairs and pledged to unite through peaceful means. Failure by the United Nations to respond to these favourable indications of the possibility of a peaceful reunification of Korea cannot but display hypocrisy on our part  and heavy would be our responsibility for any worsening of the Korean situation. I find it very strange that  while we all talk about the role of the United Nations as being primarily to promote peace in the world  the flag of this Organization is being used by one — I repeat  one — super-Power for aggressive purposes in Korea. Yet when the matter is raised we all seem either not to care or to imagine that to say no to such a super-Power would break up our Organization. We ought to tell this superpower that we can no longer tolerate the use of the United Nations flag to further the international aggrandizement of a super-Power.51.	It is therefore  the hope of my delegation that  in connexion with the new item on the creation of favourable conditions for an independent  peaceful reunification of Korea [item 41 (b)]  the draft resolution sponsored by more than 20 Powers and calling for the withdrawal of all foreign troops  the dissolution of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea and the termination of the so-called United Nations Command in Korea   will this year be adopted and implemented immediately.52.	In Africa  the injustice of colonialism and racism sustained by the continued intransigence of the colonial  racist minority regimes remains.53.	In the Portuguese colonies  the situation has taken an even more sad turn. As the tide for liberation grows  and as the people  led by their national liberation movements  gain more victories  the Portuguese authorities become more desperate. They have resorted to barbarous acts of violence and genocide. The callous murder of the gallant fighter and leader of the people of Guinea-Bissau  Amilcar Cabral  is an eloquent testimony of this desperation and their bankruptcy in policy. In Mozambique  Angola and Guinea- Bissau that regime has committed atrocities and mass murders of extraordinary proportion. The recent murders at Wiriyamu in Mozambique is only one of the many similar massacres — I repeat  it is one of the similar massacres — that that regime has been committing in Africa. Mass murder is being used as an instrument of policy to perpetuate a colonial situation. It was indeed naive and ridiculous for the Portuguese to attempt to vindicate their innocence by sending a hastily hand-picked group of journalists to investigate murders  when all we know is that they went on a guided tour arranged by the very Portuguese who selected them. If the Portuguese were really interested injustice  in finding out whether the murders in Wiriyamu took place or not  then they would institute an impartial inquiry.54.	The rejection by the Portuguese authorities of a call by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for an- impartial investigation of those who were involved in the massacre clearly confirms the perpetration of these brutalities. The international community must remain convinced of the authenticity of these murders. After all  the disclosure was made by honest. God-fearing Catholic priests who in our view had nothing to gain from fabricating such cold-blooded murders of defenceless women and children.55.	These massacres are sufficient reason for taking all the measures against Portugal which were taken against the Nazis  who continue to be hunted for their crimes up to the present day. In this context  therefore  those who collaborate with Portugal in trade  in the supplying of arms and a training programme for soldiers  or in giving any form of support and assistance must reflect on the result of their actions. Any form of collaboration with Portugal not only gives it the desperately needed political support and a sense of respectability  but indeed enables it to perpetuate the colonial situation  and to commit more mass murders for which those who provide such support cannot remain blameless.56.	The illegal minority regime of Rhodesia not only has increased oppression in that country  but has shown the boldness of desperation by sending troops to fight in Mozambique  and threatening neighbouring Zambia. Internally  it has adopted measures of repression to suppress the people of Zimbabwe. It has recently committed several cold-blooded murders of freedom fighters. Collective punishment has been introduced and carried out. The leaders of the nationalist and liberation movements have either been detained or restricted in their activities. Measures to introduce apartheid have been accelerated. Yet  the people have consistently and with determination continued to reject domination. They have conclusively rejected the sell-out proposals as reflected in the Pearce report. The forces for freedom in Zimbabwe continue to agitate for meaningful change  and the liberation movements have consolidated their activities in Zimbabwe. The requirements of the situation dictate that this Organization and its Members give support to these efforts and intensify our action against that regime.57.	Sanctions not only should be comprehensive and total  but must  in particular  be extended to all mail and air transport. They should also be extended to the Portuguese colonies in southern Africa as well as to South Africa  which have been the greatest ""sanction-busters"". It is pertinent  in this connexion  to emphasize the importance of implementing the United Nations resolutions and the denial of all co-operation with the illegal regime in Rhodesia. It was in recognition of this cardinal principle that my Government was dismayed by the violation of sanctions by the United States in its importation of chrome 6from Rhodesia. We hope  therefore  that the United States Government will now take the necessary measures to ensure the scrupulous observance of the Security Council decisions on sanctions  especially when the United States is one of the permanent members of the Security Council. In this connexion my Government expresses its appreciation to all those well-meaning American legislators who are exerting their efforts to secure the repeal of the Byrd amendment to the Military Procurement Act of 1972  which would lead to the reinforcement of the Security Council sanctions. We call equally upon all those States which  in one form or another  violate these mandatory sanctions to take appropriate measures to put an end to such violations.58.	The problem of Namibia remains unresolved. When the idea of initiating contacts between the South African racists and the Secretary-General was first put up  my Government viewed it with scepticism. We very much hoped that our scepticism would have been proved wrong. However  the results of these talks have confirmed our original fears. Not only have the South African racist authorities refused to answer positively the questions put to them  but they have also shown a great lack of good faith by going ahead with the implementation of apartheid measures in Namibia.59.	This bad faith has been demonstrated through the creation of the so-called homelands in Kavangoland and elsewhere  and the establishment of the so-called advisory council against the expressed wishes of the people of Namibia. They have  further  arrested people who have been opposed to the continued illegal presence of that regime in Namibia. The racists have used these talks to entrench themselves in Namibia  while attempting to confuse the international community and world opinion as to their true intentions. Yet  the people of Namibia have continued to express their opposition to such entrenchment with firmness and determination.60.	The failure of the recent so-called elections for the establishment of homelands in Namibia is eloquent evidence of this. We find no encouragement  therefore  in the continuation of the contacts which were initiated in 1972 between the Secretary-General and the South African racist authorities pursuant to Security Council resolution 309 (1972) and the other subsequent resolutions.61.	We would all the same wish to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his untiring effort in this regard  which is a reflection of his genuine concern over the problem of Namibia. What is now urgently needed is the intensification of support and the provision of material assistance to the people of Namibia  through their liberation movement  in their just struggle. Of no less importance is the need for all States to abide by all the appropriate measures of the United Nations and all its organs geared towards the liquidation of the illegal occupation of Namibia by the South African racist regime.62.	We meet in the wake of another Sharpeville-like massacre of innocent people by the South African racist authorities at Carletonville  South Africa. Those callous murders not only illustrate the decay of the South African system; they also portray the utter disregard for human life by the South African apartheid regime. The rationalization of these murders and the commendation of the conduct of the murderers by the South African authorities is further evidence of their degeneration. South Africa's consistent role as a bastion of colonialism and racism in southern Africa and its willingness to accept the role of bolstering the already outlawed illegal regime in Rhodesia serve further to expose the brutal and lawless nature of the Pretoria regime. Yet to many of us in this Assembly South Africa's unrepentant and persistent aggression against our very humanity is a matter of common knowledge  its recalcitrancy is already legendary. But the question that arises is how long we of this Organization can remain impotent in the face of this inhumanity. How much longer can we tolerate the myth that the regime of the racists in Pretoria can speak on behalf of the people of South Africa? I submit that each day that apartheid is allowed to reign supreme in South Africa constitutes 24 hours of scandal and disgrace for civilized humanity and our Organization.63.	We must all resolve to take definite and effective measures to end this anachronistic system before its effects engulf us all in a racial holocaust. In this connexion  I should like to inform this Assembly that Tanzania  in its fight against racism in southern Africa  devotes a lot of time on the radio to combating racism. I should like to take this opportunity to invite the Office of Public Information of the United Nations to take advantage of and to utilize our facilities. This will indeed be our humble contribution to the fight against racism. My Government would be prepared to take up this matter with the people concerned in the Secretariat.64.	This year the United Nations is to convene the preliminary session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which this Assembly decided should take place next year [resolution 3029 A (XXVII)/. At its last session in Geneva this summer the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction was to finalize its work to enable the Conference to proceed as scheduled. Although the Committee has failed to produce the agreed draft articles on some of the subjects and issues  it is worth while noting that  in trying to formulate the draft articles  a thorough  substantive and political debate was conducted. We believe that the Committee has done what was possible under the. circumstances prevailing. No prolongation of the mandate of that Committee is likely to produce any better results. It is therefore the view of my delegation that the Conference can and should proceed as scheduled. I should like to state from this rostrum that if the Conference is held in Chile now  under the present junta  my Government will not attend.65.	Events in the arena of the oceans point to the urgent need for the international community to take appropriate action if a scramble  with all its consequential evils  is to be avoided in that area of the globe which not only constitutes the greater portion of our environment but also bears immense living and non-living resources. To allow such a scramble to happen will spell not only the revival of aggravation of political tensions and further deterioration of the ocean environment but also the passing into the hands of a few technologically advanced States of the inestimable wealth which lies in the ocean space.66.	The situation facing us indicates the urgency of holding the Conference on the Law of the Sea without any further delay. Let us not allow this opportunity to slip from us  lest it be too late and the impending situation  as it threatens to occur  becomes impossible to reverse. Let me repeat that we hope the organizers of the Conference will find it possible to select a venue other than Chile  the venue that has been envisaged.67.	We see today in the world economic situation much that could be improved. When the Second United Nations Development Decade was launched  we placed much hope in its success.' Yet the results have been disappointing  judging by the performance of the year 1972. Only one third of the developing countries exceeded the over-all target of a 6 per cent annual growth rate. Half of these territories failed to achieve even a 5 per cent annual growth rate and in one fifth of these countries there was an actual decline in the per capita income. The low-growth group accounted for about 40 per cent of the population of the developing countries.68.	This situation has arisen largely because of the mood of uncertainty in trade patterns and monetary systems. The failure of the developed countries to meet their commitment to transfer resources to developing countries has not helped matters. While the price of manufactured goods has gone up  that of primary agricultural products has gone down. The measures taken by the developing countries  therefore  have been subjected to conditions beyond their control and hence they have not been able to reap the benefits of their increased efforts. Debt servicing by the poorer nations is becoming increasingly unbearable  if not intolerable. Thus  this unwelcome economic situation has resulted in several adverse effects on the economies of developing countries. Should things be left to follow this present trend  it will not be just a matter of the gap between the haves and have-nots widening  but  more importantly  we shall be doing further violence to the principles of this Organization to improve the economic and the social situation of the peoples of our world.69.	We in Tanzania have learned one hard fact  that there is no substitute for the theory of self-reliance; that in spite of the many conferences we may go to on the question of economic development  we must nevertheless understand that it is only through self-reliance that we can find meaningful progress for our country.70.	In my address I have attempted to discuss some of the burning problems of our era. Throughout  I have emphasized the need to extend the spirit of rapprochement and to gear the purposes of just solutions to the outstanding problems which continue to bedevil us. Throughout  I have emphasized that the prerequisite of durable peace is the eradication of all injustice. For  as the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned States  held in Algiers  pointed out:""As long as colonial wars  apartheid  imperialist aggression  alien domination  foreign occupation and power politics  economic exploitation and plunder prevail  peace will prove limited in principle and scope. In a world where  besides a minority of rich countries there exists a majority of poor countries  it would be dangerous to increase such division by restricting peace to the prosperous areas of the world while the rest of mankind remained condemned to insecurity and domination by the most powerful. Peace is indivisible: it could not be reduced to a mere shifting of confrontation from one area to another  nor should it condone the continued existence of tension in some areas while endeavouring to eliminate it elsewhere. Detente would remain precarious if it did not take into consideration the interests of the other countries."" 71.	The millions of Africans who still live under the humiliation and the degradation of slavery under colonialism in their own countries are waiting to hear from this Organization whether they  too  can one day expect freedom and justice from us.72.	Thousands of children who have been made orphans by the bombs and massacres of the enemy whose conduct debases our very humanity are asking us  asking the United Nations  whether they too will one day raise their children in conditions of peace which we in the United Nations have so much talked about.73.	Millions of women and children in Indo-China .who have never known — I repeat  have never known — a home are looking to us to create a world where they  too  can one day sleep under a roof without the fear of war.74.	In the Middle East I can hear the voices of a million Palestinians asking the United Nations how long they can continue to live a life that has neither hope nor expectation.75.	In Africa  in Asia  in Latin America  even in some poorer areas of Europe  in the slums of the big cities of the world where millions have never known the luxury of two meals or the pleasure of bread and butter  I hear the same question  How long until our Organization and the multitude of our economic conferences will be meaningful to them to ensure their ability to have two meals a day?76.	How long? How long shall this Organization continue to feed such hopes with slogans and unimplemented resolutions. This Organization has a herculean task towards the fulfilment of these hopes.77.	Let us therefore rededicate ourselves to the cause of building peace on the firm foundation of justice. It is only by doing so  that we shall be able to achieve the objectives of the Charter — peace for everyone  everywhere  based on justice and respect for human dignity."
"112",7130,"UKR",28,1973,"﻿152.	 The overwhelming majority of speakers at this session of the General Assembly has noted with a feeling of definite relief and optimism the positive changes taking place in the world.153.	We are in fact witnessing a fundamental change in the entire post-war history of the world — a shift from the lengthy period of tension and ""cold war"" towards detente and confirmation of peaceful coexistence as an immutable principle in relations between States.154.	In analysing the course of events  it is impossible not to conclude that the trend towards detente did not come about of its own accord but that it has broken through and is gaining momentum as part of the arduous struggle of progressive contemporary forces against the forces of reaction and the advocates of the policy of negotiating from a position of strength. As we all know  the world system of socialism came into being after the Second World War and consolidated itself into a powerful stronghold in the struggle for peace and international security. The anti-imperialist  anti-militarist front of the peoples of the world has gained immeasurably in extent and strength with the emergence  as a result of the collapse of the colonial system  of new independent States which need peaceful conditions for their political and economic transformation and development. Thus  a huge number of countries and peoples has become involved in the building of peace. The effect of all this was to doom to failure the policy of negotiating from a position of strength and at last bring about changes in the direction of realism even in the foreign policies of a number of capitalist Powers.155.	The consistent and constructive peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community  supported by many other peace-loving States  and the bold and persistent implementation of the programme of peace proclaimed by the Soviet Union  slightly more than two years ago at the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party have been of decisivesignificance in accelerating this crucial change in international life.156.	The political talks which Comrade Brezhnev  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  had recently with the leaders of the Federal Republic of Germany  the United States of America and France  the conclusion of treaties and agreements with these and other Western countries  the development of co-operation and friendship with India  Egypt  Iraq and many other independent States of Africa  Asia and Latin America  the constructive proposals submitted in conjunction with the Socialist countries concerning the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe — all these developments are graphic evidence of the efforts of the Soviet Union to carry out the Programme of Peace and to give new impetus to a further easing of tension on earth.157.	The war in Viet-Nam has now ended  and a whole system of treaties and agreements has been concluded in Europe thus easing the way for the strengthening of security and the development of co-operation. Although in the remote past the history of Europe was measured in periods of lengthy military conflict — the Seven Years' War  the Thirty Years' War  the Hundred Years' War  and so on — and although twice in the lifetime of one generation Europe has been the source of devastating world conflagrations costing tens of millions of human lives  today we have for the first time the possibility of measuring European history in decades of peace. To strengthen peace and genuine co-operation in Europe and to transform those ideas into a permanent factor in international life — that is the noble task of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  the work of which  we hope  will reach a successful conclusion this year. The talks on the limitation of arms and armed forces in Central Europe are also of great significance.158.	In speaking of achieving detente  due credit should also be paid to the United Nations  which has done much to help establish an atmosphere of peaceful coexistence and co-operation among peoples and States. We note with satisfaction that in the new conditions of friendlier international climate the Security Council and the General Assembly have been able to decide the question of the admission to the United Nations of the two German States — the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Our delegation has already had an opportunity to congratulate the representatives of those countries as also the delegation of a young independent State — the Commonwealth of the Bahamas — on the occasion of their admission to the United Nations. In welcoming with a special feeling of friendship and solidarity the admission to the United Nations of the German Democratic Republic  the Ukrainian people wish the fraternal people of the German socialist State further great successes in the struggle for the triumph of socialism and of peace and security.159.	At the same time  however  we cannot ignore the fact that  against the background of the tangible successes achieved by peace-loving forces  peoples and States in the easing of tension  important contemporaryproblems remain unsolved: the dangerous arms race continues  hotbeds of armed conflict persist  and millions of people suffer in the chains of colonial slavery. Certain forces are still active which view with disfavour positive changes in international relations and the movement of peoples towards peace  independence and progress.160.	Detente and the strengthening of peaceful coexistence are being opposed by the imperialist circles  the elements of the extreme right  the military-industrial complexes which are profiting from the arms race  the counter-revolutionary leaders of the emigre group which have been expelled from their own countries  the Zionist extremists and  in short  by all those who have prospered from lies and the propaganda of hatred and enmity among peoples. Those who seek to turn backward the wheel of history to undermine the foundations of the detente which has been achieved and to denigrate socialist reality can be aptly described by the Ukrainian proverb which says that those who lurk in the dark shy away from the light.161.	The peoples of the world are aware of the need for ceaseless efforts in the struggle to strengthen peace  as can be. seen from the wide support given by the popular masses and public organizations to the World Congress of Peace Forces  which is to take place shortly in Moscow. That is why  as V. V. Shcherbitsky  First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine  rightly pointed out in a recent speech made by him at Kiev:""In the present international situation  when a constructive basis has been established and a considerable investment made for the further improvement of the political climate  the advocates of the 'cold war' find it increasingly difficult to breathe.""162.	All peace-loving forces must  however  maintain a high level of vigilance. The facts show that  wherever they have the chance  the enemies of progress use their vast propaganda machine to try to mislead people  kindle acute conflicts and foster conspiracies; in so doing  they have no compunction in resorting to armed force. That is what happened in Chile  where Fascist thugs overthrew the lawful Government  assassinated the President elected by the people and unleashed acts of terrorism against the people  brutally suppressing their desire for freedom  independence and a better life.163.	Our people angrily protest against the arbitrary action and atrocities of the military-Fascist junta and express their fraternal solidarity with the people of Chile; they are confident that the just cause of the Chilean people  for which the unforgettable patriot Salvador Allende and thousands of other Chilean patriots gave their lives  will triumph and that the butchers will receive the punishment they deserve and be damned by the people and by history.164.	Nor can we overlook the fact that the reactionaries  in their efforts to justify a policy of brinkmanshipand the maintenance of a state of tension which is so dangerous for the cause of peace  assert that although the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community affirm in their foreign policy the principles of the peaceful coexistence of States  yet they remain true to the ideas of communism and are determined to vindicate their ideology.165.	But surely even the troubadours of the ""cold war"" must be aware that the value of peaceful coexistence lies in the very fact that it enables States with opposing social systems and opposing ideologies to live in peace. In conditions of peaceful coexistence the opposition between two systems and the related conflict of ideas must not develop into interference in internal affairs or  a fortiori  into military confrontation  but must entail the peaceful settlement of disputes and mutually advantageous co-operation.166.	Given this understanding of peaceful coexistence  a solution can be found to many contemporary problems of vital importance for the further consolidation of peace and international security.167.	One of the vitally urgent problems which must be solved without delay is the situation in the Middle East. Here  as we all know  Israel  for more than six years  has been occupying Arab territories several times greater in area than the territory of Israel itself. During this time the Arab States  seeking to ensure a political settlement of the conflict on a just basis  have shown great restraint. However  the Israeli usurpers are flagrantly undermining the cause of peace and international security and defying Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and other decisions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. Relying on the support of international zionism and the most reactionary imperialist circles  they are pursuing an adventurist policy of annexation and expansion.168.	A few days ago guns began to fire again in the Middle East  and now military action is spreading havoc over an ever widening area. The peoples of the world are again faced with a dangerous turn of events. Now even those who earlier had some doubts have come to see clearly that the continued presence of the hotbed of Israeli aggression in the Middle East is the cause of the renewal of military operations.169.	The frequent discussion of the Middle East crisis in the Security Council has shown that only Israel and its protectors are opposed to a peaceful political settlement in that area. Israel persists in a policy of annexation  terrorism and oppression of the Arab peoples  seeking with the support of its imperialist protectors to undermine the progressive regimes in Arab countries and to maintain and strengthen at any price the positions of international monopolies  and the oil monopolies in particular.170.	But surely even rabid aggressors have realized that they cannot pursue with impunity a policy of usurpation and annexation  for such a policy generates irresistible opposition in the peoples concerned and rouses them tofight for their liberation against the aggressors. This is true of any region on our planet  and it is true of the Middle East as well. That is why the smouldering hotbed of Israeli aggression has again kindled the flame of armed conflict in the Middle East and why the responsibility rests with the Israeli forces of occupation.171.	A just and lasting peace can be re-established in the Middle East only through the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which constitutes a realistic basis for a peaceful settlement in that explosive area. The withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the occupied territories and respect for the legitimate rights of the States and peoples of the area  including the Arab people of Palestine  are indispensable conditions for such a settlement.172.	We share the opinion of those delegations which have stressed that the termination of the lengthy and bloody war in Viet-Nam is of the greatest significance for peace and security in Asia. We are confident that the talented and industrious Viet-Namese people  with the brotherly assistance and support of the countries of the socialist community  will succeed very quickly in healing the deep wounds of the war and rebuilding their destroyed towns and villages.173.	We must not  however  forget that the peace in South-East Asia is still very precarious: the Saigon regime continues flagrantly to violate the Paris agreement  military operations are still being carried out in Cambodia  and the peaceful situation in Laos has not yet been properly consolidated. In addition  great efforts still need to be made to ensure genuine peace and security on the Indian subcontinent.174.	Complete normalization of the situation in Southeast Asia  and indeed on the continent of Asia as a whole  would give new impetus to the efforts to establish peaceful co-operation among all Asian States on a basis of equality with no exceptions whatsoever — a development which would serve to strengthen international security.175.	The idea of strengthening collective security in Asia was greeted with interest in that vast area. The United Nations  too  could encourage a dialogue on this subject among the countries of the area  an action which would  incidentally  be in conformity with the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)].176.	We expect that even at this session the General Assembly will take decisions which will help to improve the situation in that important part of our planet. We refer primarily to the termination of the United Nations Commission for Korea  the disbanding of the so-called United Nations Command  which is a cover for foreign interference in Korean affairs  and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from South Korea. Such action will remove one more obstacle from the road to a peaceful political settlement of the Korean question without any outside interference.177.	A vital factor in the strengthening of international security — and one which is embodied in the United Nations Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security — is the strict observance by all States of the principle of the non-use of force in international relations. On the initiative of the Soviet Union  the General Assembly adopted at its twenty-seventh session resolution 2936 (XXVII) concerning the non-use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons  having rightly noted that in the present situation a ban on nuclear weapons can be achieved only if  at one and the same time  States renounce the use of force in international relations.178.	Indeed  the most noteworthy stages of progress in the improvement of the international situation in recent years have been linked with an unequivocal affirmation of the obligations of States to refrain in their relations from the use or the threat of force. It is sufficient to refer in this connexion to the treaty of 12 August 1970 between the USSR and the Federal Republic of Germany or to the Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War  concluded between the USSR and the United States for an unlimited period on 22 June 1973.179.	The USSR and the United States undertook to take the necessary action to remove the danger of nuclear war and not to permit its emergence or the use of nuclear weapons by specifically agreeing that both sides will refrain from using force or the threat of force either against each other or against other countries. The salutary effect of this agreement on the international situation is obvious. And if other States  especially the nuclear States  were to adhere to the principle of renouncing the use of force and adopting decisive measures to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war — a principle jointly established by the Soviet Union and the United States — they would provide an even firmer guarantee of the strengthening of universal and lasting peace.x 180. If someone ""frightens the weak-willed""  as they say  with the non-existent threat of collusion between the ""two super-Powers"" but at the same time refuses to take part in the joint action to strengthen international peace  he thereby reveals his own demagogic and negative approach to practical international action to eliminate the threat of nuclear war.181.	We consider that all the conditions exist for the Security Council and all its permanent members to adopt specific practical measures concerning the non-use of force and  at the same time  the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2936 (XXVII).182.	No one who soberly assesses international events can fail to see that never before in the whole post-war period has the general climate changed so rapidly. An energetic search is under way to find solutions to the most important and the most weighty problems facing the world.183.	Among those problems is  of course  the problem of disarmament  which affects the interests of all Stateswithout exception. It has many aspects  both general and particular. The practical experience gained over many years shows that it is useful to approach them in different ways: either on a bilateral basis or with the participation  for example  of a specially delegated group of States meeting in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  as is the case at Geneva  or in a forum in which all States can take part — the World Disarmament Conference. The need for such a variety of approaches to the solution of this complicated problem is dictated by life itself.184.	Consequently  some well-known treaties and agreements have been concluded in recent years which have played and continue to play an important part in the search for a consistent  concrete and effective solution of the problem of disarmament.185.	Because of the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water 2 which has already been signed by more than 100 States  the atmosphere has become significantly freer of the products of nuclear fission  and a start has been made in preventing irreversible changes in the human environment. This year is the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex]  which has been an important milestone along the road to removing the threat of nuclear war. In our view  it is fully appropriate for new efforts to be made to increase the number of States which are parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to ensure its ratification by all the countries which have signed it.186.	The Ukrainian SSR advocates greater progress in the activities of the Geneva Committee on Disarmament. The talks taking place under the auspices of the United Nations at Geneva deal with the broad spectrum of disarmament problems. We all know that the general efforts made both within the framework of the United Nations and elsewhere led to the preparation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI)  annex]. The agenda of the Geneva Committee now includes the drafting of a convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons. The socialist  countries  including the Ukrainian SSR  submitted a draft convention on the prohibition of such weapons3 for consideration by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. In our view  the situation is now favourable for the immediate adoption of this important convention.187.	The General Assembly has every reason to express its satisfaction with the position taken by the two strongest military Powers — the United States of America and the Soviet Union  —  on the limitation of strategic defensive and offensive weapons.188.	However  no matter how gratifying the conclusion of the existing agreements may be  it does not of itself remove the burden of the arms race from the peoples of the world. Thus  as A. A. Gromyko  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR  pointed out in his well reasoned statement: ""... only in recent years has it become possible to take the first... steps towards limiting the arms race"" [2126th meeting  para. 115]. But military expenditures continue to grow on a world scale at an increasing rate that is approximately twice as high as the rate of growth of world industrial production. This has a negative effect on the level of capital investment for non-military purposes and on the amount of funds made available for improving the living conditions of mankind.189.	Accordingly  the Soviet proposal concerning the reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries is of enormous importance for the cause of disarmament  for reducing the burden of military expenditure being borne by the workers  and for the provision of substantial additional assistance to developing countries [A/L.701].190.	It would  of course  be desirable that not only all the permanent members of the Security Council but also other States which have large economic potential and considerable military expenditures should join in the implementation of this proposal.191.	Our delegation fully supports and welcomes this timely and important proposal and hopes that this latest noble initiative of the Soviet Union will be supported by the overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations and by all progressive forces and peoples.192.	Many of the heads of delegations who have spoken from this rostrum  and above all the heads of delegations of developing countries  have already reacted favourably to the Soviet proposal. True  there were also delegations which did not find the proposal to their liking. Fortunately  they have thus far been few in number —  only two or three.193.	Among the few sceptics and opponents of disarmament  as you have heard  was the delegation of a country which is a permanent member of the Security Council  that is  a country entrusted with special responsibility under the United Nations Charter for the maintenance of peace and international security and for disarmament. That  however  did not prevent the representative of that country  with his characteristic penchant for demagogy and anti-sovietism  from opposing the Soviet proposal  which is aimed at solving the most important international problem of our times  namely  disarmament  and is dictated by a sincere desire to help satisfy the needs and requirements of developing countries.194.	So it has come about that a State which puts itself forward as a defender of small and medium-sized countries is in fact again taking up a position  as it has done at previous sessions of the General Assembly  which is opposed to the interests of those countries and isopposing detente  the strengthening of international security  and disarmament. It has again been demonstrated that the representatives of this Power  in their judgements and actions  close ranks with the reactionaries and the opponents of detente; they make no constructive contribution to the United Nations and maliciously reject everything that is conducive to the safeguarding of peace and security of peoples and to disarmament. They try to cover up their bankrupt position with rabid anti-sovietism. Truly  as the popular saying has it  their bones are filled with spite.195.	At the last two sessions of the General Assembly  as we know  approval was expressed for the convening of a World Disarmament Conference to examine the problem of disarmament in all its aspects with the participation of all States and with due regard to the positions of all parties concerned. Unfortunately  the stand taken by two of the permanent members of the Security Council is actually bringing to nought the work of the Special Committee established by the General Assembly to make the preparations for the World Disarmament Conference.196.	In the opinion of the Government of the Ukrainian SSR  the sooner that this World Conference takes place  the sooner will further talks on disarmament  including those held under the auspices of the United Nations  be given a powerful boost and the sooner will speedy and concrete results be achieved in the matter of halting the arms race.197.	Our delegation therefore believes that the Committee established to convene the Conference4 could begin the preparatory work without delay. If any country  nuclear or non-nuclear  is not ready to take part in the work of the preparatory committee at this time  it can join it at a later stage.198.	The struggle for disarmament has now entered a very specific phase; the time has come for action. To assume the obligations of preventing nuclear war  renouncing the use of force and nuclear weapons  and reducing military budgets  to take an active part in the preparation and conduct of the World Disarmament Conference and to work for the early prohibition of chemical weapons and the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe — these are specific steps in the implementation of which all States  large  medium-sized and small  undoubtedly have an interest. Along this road are to be found limitless opportunities for peaceful initiatives by all Governments.199.	Disarmament is capable of consolidating and strengthening the process of mankind's turning away from the ""cold war"" period to an era of peaceful cooperation. Political  economic and other measures  supplemented by an easing of military tension  will undoubtedly bring stability and permanence to the processes of detente and improvement of the international climate.4 Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference.200.	Our delegation considers that speedier progress towards the complete elimination of colonialism would be a very important contribution to the further relaxation of international tension and to the consolidation of the peace and security of all peoples. The existing colonial enclaves are permanent hotbeds of tension in international relations not only in Africa  but also in Oceania and Latin America — in all parts of the world where the desire exists to maintain the conditions of the last century and breathe new life into colonial regimes.201.	Profound indignation was aroused throughout the world by the bloody massacres carried out by Portuguese punitive squads against Africans in Mozambique and other territories. The fact that Portugal receives armaments from its NATO allies and enjoys their protection and support is not the least of the reasons for these colonialist outrages.202.	Peoples are aroused to just indignation by the inhuman apartheid regime in South Africa. The racist regime in Pretoria not only deprives the African population of South Africa of its elementary human rights but also constitutes  in fact  the foundation  of the tripartite alliance of the colonialist racist regimes of Portugal  South Africa and Southern Rhodesia or  as it is justly termed in Africa  the ""unholy alliance"" in southern Africa. Repression continues in Southern Rhodesia as well. Our delegation believes that there is and can be no justification for the sale of arms to racist regimes. The embargo on the supply of arms to South Africa and Southern Rhodesia must be strictly observed by all States. Diplomatic  economic and military relations with the racist regimes of Pretoria and Salisbury must be broken off by all States which have not yet done so. Every day that the colonial and racist regimes continue to exist through the aid and support of Western monopolistic and military circles is an insult to the honour and dignity of Africans  an insult to the dignity of all honourable people and a threat to peace and international security.- 203. In this connexion we again draw the attention of the General Assembly to the need for persistent efforts to achieve the earliest possible implementation of a programme of action for the full implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514(XV)]. In accordance with the traditional policy of the socialist countries  our nation will continue to render every kind of support and assistance to oppressed peoples in their legitimate struggle for the elimination of colonialism in all its forms and manifestations. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR warmly welcomes the proclamation of the independence of Guinea-Bissau by the people of that country  welcomes the participation of representatives of the national liberation movements in the work of United Nations organs  and expresses its firm conviction that the day is not far off when new independent States created by the liberated peoples of the remaining colonial territories will be numbered among the Members of the United Nations.204. The nature of the auspicious changes taking place in today's world confirms yet again the vision of the founder of the Soviet State  V. I. Lenin. As early as 1920he stressed that the policy of socialism created ""completely different international relations which enable all oppressed nationalities to rid themselves of the imperialist yoke"".5 The present restructuring of international relations on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence enables States which recently attained independence to fight more effectively against exploitation by monopolist capital.205.	We are aware that the peoples of the developing countries are facing great difficulties. We know that international monopolies  because of their greedy nature  will not voluntarily renounce the pursuit of profits  the merciless capitalist exploitation of economically weak countries. We consider that  with the help of the United Nations  it is both possible and essential to establish a political and an international legal framework to regulate the activities of monopolies and make possible the introduction of profound social and economic transformations  thereby helping to protect the interests of the developing countries and countering the attempts of the monopolies to impede the social and economic progress of the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America.206.	In this regard  particular importance attaches to: a further strengthening of the principles of the sovereign equality of States; non-interference in internal affairs; respect for the basic political  economic and cultural character of all States; equality of rights; and the right of peoples to control their own destinies and their own natural resources. These  indeed  are the principles which form the basis for the ever stronger relations between the socialist States and the developing countries.207.	Success in the development of international economic co-operation can in turn do much to strengthen the auspicious progress now being made in the political relations among States and can also make those relations long-lasting and irreversible and can confirm the triumph of stable and universal peace on our planet.208.	In the case of our country  which has suffered the horrors of devastating wars throughout its history  the direct interrelationship between the strengthening of peace and economic development is not just a theoretical issue. We built power stations and planted trees  we transformed the appearance of our towns and villages  and then  with heartfelt pain  we saw the fruits of peaceful labour perish in the flames of a war unleashed by fascism. The ""cold war"" and its legacy  the arms race  have diverted considerable energy and resources from peaceful development. But it is our wish that the installations built by the hands of our people should stand for centuries  that our orchards and fields should yield generous harvests and that future generations should continue our work on a peaceful earth.209.	That is why we support the joint efforts of all States in the establishment of the kind of international relations which will ensure that the ""cold war"" — together with its dangerous atmosphere of suspicion  the arms race and the clatter of lethal weapons — will recede into the irrevocable past and will yield  for all time  to lastingpeace and mutually advantageous international cooperation.210.	The peoples of the world judge the political maturity of the United Nations as it approaches its thirtieth anniversary  not by its age  but by its actions  by its contribution to the strengthening of international security and the development of international cooperation on a basis of equality. May the bold and positive action of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly on the important problems which reality itself has caused to be placed on the agenda demonstrate the readiness of the United Nations to justify the great hopes placed in it by people of goodwill throughout the world."
"113",7177,"URY",28,1973,"﻿ Mr. President  may the first words spoken by the delegation of the Republic of Uruguay be words of congratulations and greetings to Mr. Leopoldo Benites  a distinguished Ecuadorian and  as such  a member of our Latin American family.2.	I am happy to emphasize Mr. Benites' outstanding personal and intellectual qualities  a certain guarantee that he will conduct our deliberations with wisdom. May I also be permitted  as a Uruguayan  to recall with sincere friendship for him and for his country  our sister nation  the valuable mission he discharged in my country as Ambassador of Ecuador  and also to recall the permanent ties that link him to Uruguay  which is a symbol of the relations between our two countries.3.	May I also extend a greeting to the representative of Poland  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  who guided the work of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly with dignity and great skill.4.	My country warmly welcomes the entry into the United Nations of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. This event constitutes a historic step along the road to peace and understanding. The Commonwealth of the Bahamas has now joined our Organization. We extend to it a cordial welcome to this forum and to the work of our Latin American regional group. Thus does the process towards full universality in the United Nations continue.5.	Each session of the General Assembly is an inevitable confrontation between the magnitude of our ideals and reality  which at times is difficult to mould to our hopes. This repeated and dramatic experience  however  is not interpreted by Uruguay as a sign of ultimate failure but rather as proof of the very nature of this complex task to which the answer is clear: we must multiply our efforts  confirm our commitment to the purposes of the Charter and work untiringly to achieve them.6.	Consistent with this view I wish  on behalf of my Government  to express our faith in the principles that gave life to our Organization and our permanent devotion to their promotion.7.	My country  to the extent of its possibilities  has contributed with perseverance and good faith to the building of a world governed by law. The observations we all make about the flaws and shortcomings of the system do not discourage us. Rather  such failings show  by their imperfections and through their consequences  the need for a legal order in force for all  a legal order that will link the community of nations  that will offer the climate of security necessary for effective political independence and economic and social development  that will offer essential guarantees to small nations and will remove the shadows of arbitrariness.8.	Very often the flaws in the law have been covered by the makeshift device of an ad hoc political arrangement applied to specific situations: barely to close the deepest gap and to staunch the most serious wounds resulting from that disruption. Although that is valuable  we must study the matter further and not only cure the disease but try to prevent it  not only treat those who are ill but try to improve their health and make them well. That is why I venture to suggest that this sporadic political arrangement be applied now in a permanent manner and on a priority basis to arrive at the true enforcement of international law. The more Utopian it appears  the more necessary it is to achieve it in order to discipline the chaotic reality  which is sometimes unjust and violent  and bring it into line with the law.9.	This effort  so vital for our Organization and  even  I would say  the very raison d'etre of our Organization  must be included in the contemporary context which over the past 28 years has displayed certain definite characteristics. The birth of a number of new independent States throughout the world  the complex structure of relations between the great Powers  the multiplication of plans for political  economic and social organization in the different countries  the opening of prospects for a single mankind  however diverse it may be in its manifestations. At the same time  research and scientific reflection  the requirements of the economy  and the progress of technology lead irrevocably to an interdependent world and  whether we like it or not  to a united world through an indestructible network of links and relations. It is in this perspective that our action takes place.10.	Many steps have been taken in our search for roads towards an integrating synthesis of this diversity without harming it. That must continue on the strength of the principle that we shall not dissolve what is different  but shall rather seek out the common points. In a word  this is the need to develop solidarity among peoples and to organize it  identifying and recognizing common interests in relation to universal questions.11.	Efforts along these lines are to be found in fields such as peace and security  natural resources  the human environment  health  communications  trade  finance  the strategy for development  and so many others. Here  despite natural discrepancies  little by little we see a progressive acceptance of principles and behaviour reflecting the consensus of the international community and representing  as it were  the common denominator of common interests. To apply development along these lines is to work for peace and solidarity.12.	The existence of this process of convergence  impelled by both ethical and philosophical needs  as also by material demands derived from the nature of things  does not  however  preclude the survival of anachronistic trends inserted in the process itself  which sometimes make use of it but which  more often  seek to impose some form of political domination or covert machinations designed to impose an ideology. In these trends and forms of conduct  the violence of the struggle for power suffered so long by mankind persists and overwhelms the small nations  through insidious infiltration of their institutions or the outbreak of terrorist cruelty or open aggression.13.	In the face of this  Uruguay reaffirms once again its respect for the various paths chosen by each of the-members of this community to organize its political  economic and social life and structures. We recognize the important contribution made by different cultures to the common patrimony  enriching it through new perspectives in what has been called the ""dialogue of civilizations"".14.	For our part we are faithful to the pattern we have chosen and will continue to be so. Within the simplicity and . modesty of our own customs  we proclaim with pride our fidelity to our own way of being  our national traditions  and the political  economic and social forms that we have freely established for ourselves. That is why  while we confirm our absolute respect for the choice of other nations  we demand equal respect for ourselves  not only in the shape of outer forms  but also in the very  substance of international conduct.15.	Resolution 2625 (XXV) takes up these principles. I believe that its permanent and scrupulous observance is indispensable if we are to make possible international co-operation and even coexistence itself under international law. Only thus can the plurality of patterns that are merged in the different political societies cease to be a factor of divergence and tensions and become an enriching element for constructive world co-operation.16.	My country will give of its best in this undertaking to build up co-operation among nations  but at the same time will be watchful of its national individuality in the face of any possible intention  whether overt or covert  to subvert its character.17.	At the same time  together with observing these political rules  we must go deeply into world processes in many areas to prevent the very dynamics of such processes extended throughout the world from changing the characteristics of the small nations.18.	We maintain as a principle that the construction of world co-operation and technology shall not be based even involuntarily on the elimination of national idiosyncrasies. The challenge we confront  therefore  is twofold: to organize constructive co-operation in a multiple world  and to eliminate from that process any aspect of a policy of power  of influences  interventions  and diktats  in order that each country may be authentically free in an interdependent and united world.19.	In the light of these perspectives  Uruguay will advocate and live a united nationalism in keeping with its history and integrated with the present reality of the world  while being ready to participate in the building up of an international community marked by peace  justice and co-operation. When I say ""united nationalism"" I want strongly to affirm the values of the nationalism of my country  of its own peculiar forms and characteristics and to make a strong affirmation of the values that are our own  of our sovereign right to govern ourselves freely and to choose our own patterns of development and national solutions.20.	But  at the same time  when I speak of ""united nationalism"" I wish to express our indeclinable universal vocation and the feeling that we belong to a single mankind  to which we are integrated in spirit  within which we enjoy the same rights and obligations and to which we are united by our natural patterns  and associated by the interdependence of economies and technology.21.	Thus we wish to participate in the universal task and contribute to the effective establishment of solidarity. That is why we share and shall continue to share in a brotherly manner the common endeavours of the human species and will participate in the task of building a united and more co-operative world. We shall do so  however  with our own and unchangeable national personality.22.	I have drawn on these reflections concerning the philosophy behind the participation of Uruguay in the Organization in order to explain from this high rostrum the spirit that guides us in this solemn moment in history in which we open a new era of authentic national and popular development. These principles which we have chosen freely to guide our destiny are combined with those of the Charter; they are the manifestation of the creative will of our people; they represent the practical expression of a multiple world  and guarantee from the point of view of the international community our constructive desire to participate in the task of co-operation.23.	That is why  in renewing our expressions of adherence to the universal objectives of the Charter  we do so today with the new vitality derived from a process of profound national affirmation and with an international vocation which is in keeping with our history.24.	We trust that militancy in solidarity represents the path to a better international community. But there is no doubt that this positive road cannot be followed to the end if when we begin it we do not simultaneously open up actions designed to face the main negative questions affecting world peace and security.25.	It will be difficult to build a renewed world in solidarity unless we are able to apply a similar spirit to our daily and immediate endeavours-if we cannot duly harmonize our short-term interests with the demands of those same interests considered from the long-term view.26.	With this criterion we shall approach consideration of the main items on the agenda.27.	One of the main questions before us is that of disarmament. In our condition as a peaceful country we have worked towards that goal  advocating that the conference on disarmament be open to all States. We regret the meagre results achieved. It is necessary for States to strengthen their will to make progress in this area. Undoubtedly  the permanent members of the Security Council have in their hands the possibility of creating appropriate conditions so that the international community may benefit in a climate of security from a policy of disarmament.28.	We also wish  with pleasure  to point to the opening in Helsinki of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe as a valuable effort at relaxing tension. Similarly  we are happy to point to the progress towards peace made by the United States and the Soviet Union in their talks on the limitation of strategic armaments. Although we recognize the practical difficulties of the process  we insist on the need for it. The construction of new plans for co-operation throughout the world and prospects of a more just organization of the economy are delayed by the pressure of existing armaments.29.	Uruguay have mentioned its permanent desire for nuclear energy to become an instrument for a task of civilization. Hence  we have subscribed to the Treaty on the N™-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons /see resolution 2373 (XXII)j  and in this spirit we have given life to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco)  which  for the first time in history  establishes a denuclearized zone covering a surface of 8 million square kilometres with a population of about 200 million inhabitants. With this contribution by Latin America  one of its greatest contributions to peace  we claim today the support of all States which may become parties to that Treaty  and specially to its two additional protocols.30.	Moreover  I feel it opportune to recall her? General Assembly resolution 2934 (XXVII)  proposed last year by 14 Latin American countries and approved by a large majority  in which we reiterated  once again  the condemnation of all nuclear weapons tests. We believe that there is already a universal awareness of the need for absolute prohibition  and we deplore the fact that the appeals made so far have not yet been heeded.31.	With regard to the painful question of the Middle East  Uruguay  which has no material or political interest except that of co-operating with the nations involved  hopes that steps will be taken soon and in an effective manner to alleviate tension first  and later to arrive at permanent formulas ensuring peace on the basis of law.32.	With a conciliatory outlook towards opposing views and a realistic view of just and balanced solutions  we come again this year to the General Assembly.33.	It is our desire-and we shall fight for this constantly-to support formulas that may bring us close to the objective. We hope that a more understanding climate will prevail. We hope that the effort of the international community will concentrate on the basic purpose of applying international law and that other aspects not directly connected with the question will be left out of the discussion.34.	Uruguay is happy to see the efforts made by the United Nations  as well as bilateral efforts  in the hope that both may lead to a final settlement and complement each other. Our delegation is prepared to co-operate  within the context of the Charter  towards a negotiated solution allowing for the establishment of peace in the area  fully in keeping with international law and with all other aspects of the problem.35.	As regards human rights our position is that we must accentuate the effective protection of these rights  whose recognition has been made general but whose application is still imperfect. For this reason we insist again on the creation of a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  and we believe that this kind of mechanism can be instituted with the agreement of all our States  become a true promoter of peace and prepare the advent of a system based not only on a declaration of rights but on a legal statute governing  through the sentences of tribunals  the international protection organized by law.36.	There is no doubt that  together with the instruments we have mentioned we must create an international climate that is in keeping with the peaceful coexistence of all States. In fact  it is well known that external factors which sometimes unlawfully affect internal affairs in many countries are hotbeds of imbalance and tension  change the structure of the coexistence within communities and thus create negative conditions for the preservation of human rights.37.	We have arrived at similar conclusions as to the need to strengthen international security. Since the creation of the Permanent Court of International Justice over 50 years ago  Uruguay agreed unreservedly to take its problems to that high jurisdiction  and still maintains those principles today in the firm conviction that at this stage of the development of the international community perhaps the greatest shortcoming lies in our disregarding the essential past of any system of law  which is the judiciary.38.	Our submission to such a norm is the best way of living up to the principle of the legal equality of States  and the day we see that jurisdiction consolidated and become an unconditional and automatic power we shall have finally created an authentic international order.39.	Faithful to these convictions  my Government hopes to solve international disputes with a clear bent towards peaceful solutions and reaffirms its allegiance to the tribunals of international justice.40.	My Government wishes to express  with regard to international terrorism  its decision to support  as it did in the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism which finished its work a few weeks ago  the adoption of specific measure allowing for the prevention and condemnation of this growing mode of violence whose inhuman methods create a climate of insecurity and danger and provoke the loss of innocent lives.41.	We believe that no pretext can be invoked to delay this absolute obligation  and although the study of the ultimate causes of terrorism deserves analysis and reflection  we must avoid a situation in which any delay in energetically condemning and repressing these acts would be interpreted as a demonstration of weakness or of dangerous tolerance. This would encourage the perpetrators of such acts to continue them.42.	Ever since its inception  the United Nations has followed a clear policy designed to lead to decolonization and to combat the manifestations of racial segregation. Uruguay has lent  and will continue to lend  its militant support to this trend  which is why we must today deplore the persistence of such practices. We cannot say we have exhausted all peaceful means of solving these problems  and therefore we must multiply efforts to achieve constructive dialogue within the framework of the United Nations in order to speed up the process and avoid painful confrontations.%43.	The economic and social growth of nations has frequently been conceived and practised as competition  as a pitiless struggle for better possibilities  which has led to a lack of morality in certain economic and trade practices  at the expense of the weaker developing nations. This has taken place due to the lack of balanced rules of conduct that would temper the rigours of confrontations that only impair justice. This situation has encouraged the concept of class struggle on the international level  among categories of countries.44.	My Government cannot go along with such a concept  nor can we accept the dialectics of hatred and opposition. We affirm  instead  the responsibility of all nations in the struggle for development and the establishment of more just-trade relations. It is a common  responsibility that flows from international solidarity and from the indivisible unity in present-day world economy. This is a responsibility that does not involve identical duties for each nation; rather  each must assume the contribution that each must give in order to ensure the public wealth. As Pope Paul VI declared in paragraph 86 (b) of Gaudium et Spes  ""As for the advanced nations  they have a very heavy obligation to help the developing peoples. . ."".45.	The developing countries themselves  however  must take a hand in their own evolution  for nothing can be effective unless it is the product of one's own efforts. Thus my Government attaches special importance to the establishment of international machinery and norms which will allow the efforts of the developing nations to burgeon freely. Each one must determine its own course and its own procedures and machinery. The international community will merely have to make sure that the common undertaking is based on justice. Hence Uruguay supported  during the meetings of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]  the Mexican initiative for a charter of economic rights and duties of States.46.	Today the atmosphere is conducive to an undertaking of the required profound changes in the international economy along those lines. But the monetary system has reached a critical moment where a revision is called for  and the needs and requirements of the developing nations must be heeded. In this respect  it is indispensable that the means of international payment should be such that development can be financed adequately  and that there be a monetary reordering that will take into account the interests of all nations  and not only one group of them. At the same time  in the financial field  the international community must recognize the very serious situation created by foreign debt on the less developed nations.47.	International finance cannot be used as a means to strangle the progress of the more backward nations  nor can it give exaggerated remuneration to the advanced nations. A policy of balance must be created that will ensure economic dynamism all over the world  in keeping with the diversity of situations and the degree of progress of each nation. Only thus will the requirements of solidarity be met.48.	The work of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has formally begun in Tokyo  and the figures are extremely enlightening that have emerged: they show a loss being suffered by the developing countries  despite the fact that world trade as a whole has grown. This indicates that the greatest benefits flowing from that increase are concentrated in the most highly developed nations.. We must therefore deduce that general non-discriminatory preferences have not produced the hoped for effect  both because of the limitations those preferences imply as far as products  stability and quotas are concerned  and because of the failure on the part of some nations to put those policies into practice. By the same token  we must also point out the protectionist policies of certain developed countries towards their own agricultural production in sectors that arc usually the main source of income for many of the more backward nations.49.	We would hope that this new series of GATT negotiations will produce operative results leading to a true opening up to our nations of a substantially increased participation in world trade. This requires a new ordering of trade patterns to include increased participation by the developing nations. We believe that GATT and UNCTAD must work together so that all nations may join in more dynamic international trade relations.50.	As Uruguay has reiterated elsewhere:""The defence of permanent sovereignty over the natural resources of each nation meets one of the most obvious requirements of international justice and- is in keeping with the efforts of the developing countries to shake off economic dependency and to raise the standards of living of their peoples.""51.	But together with trade and financial resources  fully exploited natural resources are just so many other fields where development can take place. The effective utilization of all these economic factors is the condition for progress. Therefore  the international community is in duty bound to regulate those processes with justice  and  considering the inequalities that exist among nations  to mobilize every possible effort to ensure that development is a true common undertaking.52.	That is why my Government attaches enormous importance to the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. I appreciate the value of all the efforts that have been made  but I must stress the need for obtaining more immediate practical results and a more prompt implementation of the principles that we recognize as underlying our own system. The peoples of the world are looking to our deliberations with the expectation of greater executive ability. Everywhere  we are confronted by a public opinion that is increasingly well-informed and  therefore  more critical  specific and demanding in its expectations. The challenge lies in activating the achieving capacity of our community and in thus turning into deeds our good intentions.53.	We admire with amazement the prodigies of science and technology; we recognize in their accomplishments positive conquests for our peoples. But at the same time  we must warn against the risk that surrounds this progress  which  at its furious pace  threatens to reduce the individual to a mere component part in a process that 'is measured only by its efficiency and economic benefit. This does not mean  of course  that we think that we must abjure the marvels of applied science; but it does bespeak the international community's need to recognize fully the existence of this question and to live up to its responsibilities in order to create a civilization that will be in keeping with the material needs of human welfare.54.	We are approaching the point  I believe  where we will have more firmly to direct our development strategy towards what must be the true destination of progress. This is the moment of truth  when we must inscribe in the very heart of the computer a single  supreme human objective and multiply it thus as the only purpose and target of our efforts.55.	With that prospect in mind  mere economic indicators can de deceptive as far as the facts of development are concerned  to the extent that they set aside the higher values of the spirit and the very quality of life  the type or condition of existence  and welfare in its widest sense. We aspire to an international community that will re-embrace these concepts and  even at the risk of shattering the clear-cut starkness of statistical tables  introduce the notion of the quality of life  replacing growth and economic development with growth and human development - replacing it with net national welfare  as it has been called.56.	The subject of the environment is a true challenge to all countries  requiring a new effort on their part to co-ordinate their energies; and therefore we must all take an attitude consistent with protection of the atmosphere. My country has made specific efforts in this respect  but it. is the industrial countries that have the greatest responsibility in this united effort. We can hardly consider that preservation of the environment can be at the expense of the development of the least developed countries  which are only now beginning  timidly  to take their first tottering steps on the industrial and technological scene.57.	The institutions and machinery of the law of the sea must be restructured in order to ensure a dynamic and effective harmonization of the interests involved. We must appropriately order their legal protection and achieve a correlative distribution of responsibilities flowing therefrom  and do so on the basis of international justice  peace and security.58.	The General Assembly responded to this need by creating the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction  entrusting it with the task of preparing for a conference on the law of the sea.59.	But Uruguay is concerned over the fact that this work has not progressed as we had hoped or foreseen. Consequently  we deem it necessary that this General Assembly adopt the necessary decisions that will allow for a further preparatory stage to be undertaken so that we can be reasonably assured of positive results without necessarily postponing its convening unduly. Such a preparatory stage must  we believe  involve the widest participation of the States that will be attending the conference later.60.	Once again  before this Assembly  Uruguay wishes to reaffirm its decision to preserve its sovereignty over the 200 miles of its territorial sea. This is based on elementary reasons of justice and is in accord with the geographical  geological and ecological characteristics of our adjacent sea  and with our inalienable rights to promote the development of our economy and to safeguard the health and well-being of our population  without prejudice to the guarantees provided by the exercise of the rights of international communication. Up to the present we have co-operated with the greatest willingness in the search for an international consensus to safeguard all those rights  and we shall continue to do so.61.	In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General raises the question of the very fate of the Organization and gives us observations and comments as a basis for a very constructive discussion on the matter.62.	My Government wishes now only to refer to some aspects of that and to refer to the beginning of this statement  when I defined the nature of Uruguay's participation in the Organization.63.	We are convinced that both political and philosophical beliefs with regard to the requirements of modern life strengthen the ties between nations. Those increased relations must obviously be administered in accordance with law. Certain basic principles must be safeguarded: independence  justice  solidarity and equality among States.64.	At the same time  modern law must give up those rigid criteria of a formal nature and must enter more deeply into this reality of relations among countries and consider the specific idiosyncrasies of each. Thus the normative order will ensure the substantive validity of the principles as such and not merely their appearance. The organized international community will have to strengthen its capacity to achieve in order to transform declarations into deeds. But in the meantime we must link and tie our immediate and circumstantial interests to objective targets based on a true understanding of the community of interests.65.	At the same time  we must be ready to correct any possible mistake that power politics and ideological penetration may introduce in the development of international solidarity. If I may  I shall put it another way: we must create and maintain an atmosphere of political security that will guarantee the free development of the community.66.	These and other more concrete tasks  all equally urgent  are tasks that can be discussed in the United Nations as the most appropriate body. We believe that at the same time it may lead to the creation of the atmosphere we require for these transformations. They are linked in an extremely complex and complicated play of fields and planes  that calls for spiritual and material changes in order to create a new prospect for mankind: international solidarity without destroying national characteristics.67.	That is why we agree with the Secretary-General that we should create for our Organization the target of making it ""a more reliable instrument of world order and cooperation  accepted and respected by all Governments and capable of safeguarding the common interests of mankind in a crowded world of increasingly interdependent but sovereign States"". Only thus will we be consistent with the responsibilities we have assumed."
"114",7224,"USA",28,1973,"﻿35.	I should like to add my congratulations to those so well expressed by the Minister for External Relations of Brazil to our new President  Ambassador Benites of Ecuador  whose long experience at the United Nations and his many contributions to international law and to the inter-American system all ensure that this twenty-eighth session of the Assembly will have outstanding leadership.36.	I come before you today  —  confirmed in office but two days ago  —  as probably the world's most junior Foreign Minister. That President Nixon should ask me as my first official act to speak here for the United States reaffirms the importance that my country attaches to the values and the ideals of the United Nations.37.	It would be idle to deny that the American people  like many others  have sometimes been disappointed because this Organization has not been more successful in translating its architects' hopes for universal peace into concrete accomplishments.38.	But  despite our disappointments  my country remains committed to the goal of a world community. We will continue to work in this Parliament of Man to make it a reality.39.	Two centuries ago  the philosopher Kant predicted that perpetual peace would come eventually — either as the creation of man's moral aspirations or as the consequence of physical necessity. What seemed Utopian then looms as tomorrow's reality; soon there will be no alternative. Our only choice is whether the world envisaged in the Charter will come about as the result of our vision or of a catastrophe invited by our short-sightedness.40.	The United States has made its choice. My country seeks true peace  not simply an armistice. We strive for a world in which the rule of law governs and fundamental human rights are the birthright of all. Beyond the bilateral diplomacy  the pragmatic agreements and dramatic steps of recent years  we envisage a comprehensive  institutionalized peace encompassing all nations  large and small  a peace which this Organization is uniquely situated to foster and to anchor in the hearts of men. This will be the spirit of American foreign policy. This attitude will guide our work in this Organization.41.	We start from a bedrock of solid progress. Many of the crises that haunted past sessions of the General Assembly have been put behind us. Agreement has been reached on Berlin; there is a cease-fire in the Middle East; the VietNam war has been ended. The rigid confrontation that has dominated international life and weakened this Organization for a quarter of a century has been softened.42.	The United States and the Soviet Union have perceived a commonality of interests in avoiding nuclear holocaust and in establishing a broad web of constructive relationships. Talks on stretegic arms limitation have already produced historic accords aimed at slowing the arms race and ensuring strategic stability; we have today resumed negotiations on this subject. The positive results we hope for will enhance the security of all mankind.43.	Two decades of estrangement between the United States and the People's Republic of China have given way to constructive dialogue and productive exchanges. President Nixon has met with the leaders of that great nation; we have agreed to a historic communique  that honestly sets forth both our differences and our common principles; and we have each opened a liaison office in the capital of the other.44.	Many other countries have seized the initiative and contributed  in substance and spirit  to the relaxation of tensions. The nations of Europe and North America are engaged in a conference to further security and cooperation. The two German States have taken their place in this Assembly. India  Pakistan and Bangladesh have begun to move towards a welcome reconciliation. North and South Korea are at last engaged in a dialogue which  we hope  will lead to a new era of peace and security between them.45.	Yet these achievements  solid as they are  have only made less precarious the dangers and divisions inherited from the post-war era. We have ended many of the confrontations of the cold war; yet  even in this room  the vocabulary of suspicion persists. Relaxation of tensions is justified by some as merely a practical interlude before renewed struggle. Others suspect the emergence of a two- Power condominium. And as tension between the two original blocs has eased  a third grouping increasingly assumes the characteristics of a bloc of its own — the alignment of the non-aligned.46.	So the world is uneasily suspended between old slogans and new realities  between a view of peace as but a pause in an unending struggle and a vision of peace as a promise of global co-operation.47.	In 1946 James Byrnes  the first Secretary of State to address this Assembly  spoke of how the United Nations could ""help to break down habits of thinking in national isolation and go far to bring about understanding and tolerance."" 48.	The United States will never be satisfied with a world of uneasy truces  of offsetting blocs  of accommodations of convenience. We know that power can enforce a resigned passivity  but only a sense of justice can enlist consensus. We strive for a peace whose stability rests not merely on a balance of forces  but on shared aspirations. We are convinced that a structure which ignores humane values will prove cold and empty and unfulfilling to most of mankind.49.	The United States deeply believes that justice cannot be confined by national frontiers; that truth is universal  and not the peculiar possession of a single people or group or ideology; that compassion and humanity must ennoble all our endeavours.50.	In this spirit we ask this Assembly to move with us from detente among the big Powers to co-operation among all nations  from coexistence to community.51.	Our journey must begin with the world as it is and with the issues now before us. The United States will spare no effort to ease tensions further and to move towards greater stability. We shall continue  in the spirit of the Shanghai communique  our search for a new relationship with the People's Republic of China. We shall work to promote positive trends elsewhere in Asia. The uncertain peace in Indo-China must be strenghened; the world community cannot afford  or permit  a relapse into war in that region. We shall continue to pursue vigorously the building of constructive relationships with the Soviet Union. We shall strive to promote conciliation in Europe. In the negotiations beginning next month we shall seek a reduction of the military forces that have faced each other for so long across that divided continent. We shall give new vigour to our policy of partnership in the Western hemisphere. We shall honour our pledge to promote self- determination  economic development and human dignity across the continent of Africa. We shall press on with strategic arms limitations talks. We consider them crucial for security and stability in this period. We shall search for solutions to the world-wide problem of conventional weapons  which drain our resources and fuel the fires of local conflict.52.	In all these efforts the United States will be guided by certain fundamental principles.53.	We have no desire for domination. We will oppose — as we have consistently opposed throughout this century — any nation that chooses this path. We have not been asked to participate in a condominium; we would reject such an appeal if it were made.54.	We will never abandon our allies or our friends. The strengthening of our traditional ties is the essential foundation for the development of new relationships with old adversaries.55.	We will work for peace through the United Nations as well as through bilateral relationships.56.	We recognize our special obligation  as a permanent member of the Security Council  to assist in the search for just solutions in those parts of the world now torn by strife  such as the Middle East. While we cannot substitute for the efforts of those most directly involved  we are prepared to use our influence to generate a spirit of accommodation and to urge the parties towards practical progress.57.	But progress on the traditional agenda is not enough. The more we succeed in solving political problems  the more other and perhaps deeper challenges emerge. As the world grows more stable we must confront the question of the ends of detente. As the threat of war recedes  the problem of the quality of life takes on more urgent significance.58.	We are  in fact  members of a community drawn by modern science  technology and new forms of communication into a proximity for which we are still politically unprepared. Technology daily outstrips the ability of our institutions to cope with its fruits. Our political imagination must catch up with our scientific vision. This is at the same time the greatest challenge and the greatest opportunity of this Organization.59.	The pollution of the skies  the seas and the land is a global problem.60.	The increased consumption of cereals has reduced world food reserves to dangerously low levels.61.	The demand for energy is outrunning supply  and the need for technological innovation is urgent.62.	The growth of the world's economy is inhibited by restrictive trading blocs and an insufficiently flexible international monetary system.63.	The exploitation of the resources of the ocean beds  which is essential for the needs of burgeoning populations  requires global co-operation lest it degenerate into global contention.64.	Challenges of this magnitude cannot be solved by a world fragmented into self-contained nation States or rigid blocs.65.	I do not intend  today  to cover the whole agenda of international co-operation. Rather  I shall speak briefly of some illustrative areas for common action. I pledge the readiness of the United States to solve these problems co-operatively and to submit proposals Jmed at their resolution.66.	First  a world community requires the curbing of conflicts. The United Nations  in its 28-year history  has not always been idle in this sphere. In Indonesia  the Indian subcontinent  the Middle East  the Congo  and Cyprus  it has shown its ability for effective fact-finding  mediation and peace-keeping missions. This central aspect of the United Nations work must be strengthened. On a small planet  so bound together by technology and so interdependent economically  we can no longer afford the constant eruption of conflict and the danger of its spread.67.	Yet  in recent years  we have found ourselves locked in fruitless debates about the inauguration of peace-keeping operations and over the degree of control the Security Council would exercise over peace-keeping machinery — an impasse which has ensured that permanent peace-keeping machinery would not come into being. Each peace-keeping unit we have formed has been an improvisation growing out of argument and controversy.68.	We should delay no longer. The time has come to agree on peace-keeping guidelines so that this Organization can act swiftly  confidently and effectively in future crises. To break the deadlock  the United States is prepared to consider how the Security Council can play a more central role in the conduct of peace-keeping operations. If- all countries concerned approach this problem with a desire to achieve a co-operative solution  the United Nations can achieve a major step forward during this session.69.	Secondly  a world community must have the widest possible membership. The exclusion of any qualified State denies representation not only to Governments  but to peoples. Membership in this body should be a step towards reconciliation  not a source of conflict. The time has come for North and South Korea to be offered their rightful place here without prejudice to a future evolution towards unification. In this spirit also  we support the permanent membership of Japan in the Security Council.70.	Thirdly  a world community must assure that all its people are fed. The growing threat to the world's food supply deserves the urgent attention of this Assembly. Since 1969  global consumption of cereals has risen more rapidly than production; stocks are at the lowest levels in years. We now face the prospect that  even with bumper crops  the world may not rebuild its seriously depleted reserves in this decade.71.	No one country can cope with this problem. The United States therefore proposes that a world food conference should be organized under United Nations auspices in 1974 to discuss ways to maintain adequate food supplies and to harness the efforts of all nations to meet the hunger and malnutrition resulting from natural disasters and that nations in a position to do so offer technical assistance in the conservation of food. The United States is ready to join with others in providing such assistance.72.	Fourthly  a world community cannot remain divided between the permanently rich and the permanently poor. Let us therefore resolve that this Assembly  this year  initiate a search  drawing on the world's best minds  for new and imaginative solutions to the problems of development. Our search must be candid and realistic  but it must also be free of peremptory demands  antagonistic propositions  ideological confrontation  or propagandistic rhetoric  or we will surely fail.73.	The United States is prepared to join this new search  providing freely of the experience gained over two decades. We have learned not to exaggerate our capacity to transform nations  but we have also learned much about what progress is possible. We will participate without pre-conditions  with a conciliatory attitude and a co-operative commitment. We ask only that others adopt the same approach.74.	In this spirit  the United States is willing to examine seriously the proposal by the distinguished President of Mexico for a charter of the economic rights and duties of States."" Such a document will make a significant and historic contribution if it reflects the true aspirations of all nations; it will accomplish nothing if it is turned into an indictment of one group of countries by another. To command general support  and to be implemented  the proposed rights and duties must be defined equitably and take into account the concerns of industrialized as well as of developing countries. The United States stands ready to define its responsibilities in a humane and co-operative spirit.75.	Fifthly  a world community must harness science and technology for the benefit of all. We must begin to match our remarkable technological skills with our equally remarkable technological needs. We must find the means for the co-operative and judicious development of energy resources. We must responsibly confront the problems of population growth  which are fast pushing humanity towards the limits of what our earth can sustain. We must embark on a new scientific revolution to increase agricultural productivity in all lands. No field of human endeavour is so dependent upon an open world for its advancement  no field is so in need of international co-operation to cope with its potential dangers.76.	Are we prepared to accept the imperatives of a global society and infuse our labours with new vision? Or shall we content ourselves with a temporary pause in the turmoil that has racked our century? Shall we proceed with one-sided demands and sterile confrontation? Or shall we proceed in a spirit of compromise produced by a sense of common destiny? We are convinced that we must move from hesitant co-operation born of necessity to genuine collective effort based on common purpose.77.	It is a choice no country can make alone. We can repeat old slogans or strive for new hope. We can fill the record of our proceedings with acrimony  or we can dedicate ourselves to dealing with man's deepest needs. The ideal of a world community may be decried as unrealistic  but great constructions have always been ideals before they can become realities. Let us therefore dedicate ourselves to this noblest of all possible goals and achieve at last what has so long eluded us: true understanding and tolerance among mankind."
"115",7341,"VEN",28,1973,"﻿78.	Mr. President  the distinguished speakers who have addressed this Assembly before me from this rostrum have offered their sincere congratulations to you on the great honour which the Assembly has conferred on you by electing you to preside over this session. On behalf of my Government and on my own behalf  may I tell you how pleased we are to endorse those significant tributes. Your election is a well-deserved tribute that we pay your country  which is so closely linked to ours by so many different ties  especially by the imperishable figure of our common Liberator  Sim6n Bolivar  and which is a land admirable for its natural beauty and the noble quality of its men. It is also a just recognition of your many and varied personal merits and virtues  of your long career as a public figure  and of your unflagging devotion to the cause of peace.79.	On this occasion it is likewise fitting to express our special appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  whose equanimity has garnered the sympathy and affection of us all.80.	It is particularly gratifying to us to take this opportunity to extend a cordial welcome to the new States Members of the Organization: the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic.81.	This twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly is of special significance to me personally. It is  in fact  the fifth and last year of the constitutional term of office of thePresident of Venezuela  Mr. Rafael Caldera. It is also the fifth time that I am addressing this august Assembly.82.	For that reason  in the present general debate I shall refrain from giving in detail our position on the specific items on the agenda. My delegation will express the views of my Government in the relevant debates. In this unique United Nations forum I shall  on the other hand  refer to the fundamental principles that have guided the course of the international policy of my Government during these last five years in its endeavours to contribute to the coming into being of a new  just and humane international order.83.	Profound economic  social  political and cultural differences separate the peoples of the world. It is true that there are varying degrees of wealth and power  of poverty and weakness. Nevertheless  we can affirm that the world is divided into two major sectors  namely  a minority of countries which have everything and a majority of countries which have little or nothing.84.	The imbalance between the developed and the developing countries grows day by day. Wealth and progress are still in the hands of the same States. Whichever way one looks at it  there is a lack of three indissolubly linked fundamental elements of development — capital  educational level and technology — that engender a vicious circle of poverty.85.	These serious inequalities  added to the desire for domination and the ambition for power over human communities  have given rise to and maintain actual patterns of subjection exercised by the developed countries over the under-developed ones.86.	Four main instruments help to shape these patterns of subjection: so-called international aid  the deterioration of the terms of international trade  foreign investments and the power which weapons and money give.87.	Although any generalization invariably conceals a simplification  we might perhaps describe the patterns of subjection at present prevailing in the world as falling into two categories: a system of subjection based on economics and another based on ideology.88.	Under the economic system of subjection the underdeveloped countries  being a prey to the developed countries' desire for gain  suffer economic domination  which in turn leads to the loss of their political and cultural independence. Under the ideological system of subjection  the developing countries are prey to the developed countries' desire for ideological penetration and we see their structures infiltrated  falling under the control of the developed countries and  ultimately  losing their economic freedom and their political independence.89.	On the other hand  we are well aware that the international order engendered by the policy of blocs and the balance of power has not achieved peace. It has only succeeded in preventing a global conflagration  but armed conflicts have not ceased since the very moment when the Second World War ended. The very precariousness of peace teaches us that the system of international relations under which we live cannot lead us to the objective so earnestly desired by all  namely  peaceful coexistence and the harmonious development of peoples. It is essential that we build a new international order  inspired by lofty and enduring principles and not by considerations of practical expediency.90.	We consider that the fundamental goal of the present- day world is development. Pope Paul VI  in his now familiar phrase  stated that the new name for peace was development. Indeed  as long as there are inequalities existing between men and an unjust distribution of the benefits of progress  in both the domestic and the international field  there can be no peace. Inequalities are a sign of injustice  and injustice in the end engenders violence.91.	Development  however  cannot be of any kind. It must be a development that is harmonious  fair and balanced  both within each country and among all nations. Therefore we must not confuse development with economic growth  or material well-being with progress. Man does not live by bread alone. Development must encompass the total man  and all men  the whole nation  and all nations.92.	On the other hand  the harmonious and human development of civilization transcends all divisions within States or among States. Art  science  philosophy  literature  are in our times more than ever before the fruits of collective endeavour.93.	The scientific and technological revolution has brought men and peoples closer than at any other time in the history of mankind. Thus the outbreak of a contagious disease in one part of the world endangers the whole world. As we stated in 1971 before the General Assembly:""Thus there emerges a new concept: that of mankind. We think of mankind as all the peoples of the world and  thus conceived  mankind appears to us as a world-wide society which encompasses us all and which is in opposition to individual societies or States  having their own lives  it is true  but dependent on the development of that greater society.""Thus  then  as it does internally where each State seeks the realization of the common good of all its citizens  in the universal society of nations there is also need for a Universal Common Good which is the objective and raison d'etre of international authority and of the action of each of the States making up mankind."" 94.	How can we fight pollution and. the destruction of nature unless we take a loftier view that compels us to be ever mindful of the supreme interests of humanity?95.	How can we radically change the existing unjust structure in the international division of labour  where some countries export their manufactures at increasingly higher prices and others export their raw materials at increasingly lower prices  other than by the conception of an economy on a world scale?96.	The universal common good presupposes a system for the international distribution of production; or  in other words  all countries being members of the community of nations must be able to be a part of a real and effective system of universal economy that provides for all stages of the economic process. This necessarily implies the formulation of a global and comprehensive world economic policy aimed at the development of humanity; the universal common good — and not merely the development of a group of privileged countries. In the name of that universal common good we must question the development patterns followed by the modern industrialized countries  both in the East and in the West.97.	Every action has to be inspired and guided by an underlying principle. Hence at the international level we must have a set of values  that is to say  a principle towards which our action is directed and which guides our action. That principle is the principle of international social justice  which has been proclaimed with ardent conviction by the President of our Republic in many international forums.98.	The industrial revolution brought in its wake profound poverty among the workers  who were subjected to the law of supply and demand. Wages declined steadily  while their needs grew. In this situation  the workers became aware of their poverty and sought a principle that would raise their spirits and lend weight to their claims. That principle was the principle of social justice. They combined their efforts and turned their common weaknesses into strength. The first trade unions came into being  and with them the development of the labour movement.99.	Social justice became the dynamic moving force behind a multitude of economic  social  political and cultural changes. Justice was the regulating principle  seeking to restore the balance between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots""  between the strong and the weak  the rich and the poor  the employers and the workers  the socially strong and the socially weak.100.	In the name of social justice  fiscal legislation was changed and it seemed perfectly logical that those who had the most should shoulder the heaviest burdens. In the name of social justice  labour protection laws were passed to restore the balance between employers and workers. In the name of social justice  an entirely new perspective of struggle and global transformation emerged and a new concept of economic and social relations was defined.101.	Why should we not bring that social justice into the international order? Why should we not use the set of values that enabled men to change substantially the internal situation of many countries? Why should we not use that set of values as a principle to transform the international order and thus rid it of the injustices on which it is based? At this point I should like to yield to President Caldera and quote from his address to the United States Congress:""Just as 'society'  in the national ambit  has the right to impose different relations among its members  so the 'international community' demands that the peoples of the world participate according to their capacity  that 'all' may live a human existence. The rights and duties of the different peoples must therefore be measured in terms of the capacities and needs of each  in order tomake peace  harmony and progress possible and so that we may all develop in a spirit of genuine friendship.""If we believe that an international community exists  if we honestly maintain that all men constitute a great society and that that great society has the right to exist and prosper  then it is essential that the burdens and responsibilities taken on for its sake be in keeping with the relative opportunities  the strength  and the degree of development and wealth of some people.""102.	Furthermore  this principle applies to developing countries such as ours. Among us  too  those who have the most must accept greater obligations. We could hardly cry out against the injustices of the great Powers if we were to practise among ourselves the very acts of injustice which we reproach them for.103.	In the light of the principle of international social justice  the whole range and outlook of the unsuitably termed ""international aid"" takes on a completely different complexion and perspective. It is not a question of a favour  but of a duty. The greater the possibilities  the greater the obligations. On the other hand  it is inadmissible that a ""developed"" country should demand of a ""developing"" country a counterpart equal to  or even greater than  the ""value"" of the ""assistance"" rendered. And it is even more inconceivable that the ""assistance"" should be used to pressure or to coerce the ""assisted"" country. How can underdevelopment be overcome in such conditions? We were right when we stated  on several occasions  that the wealth of the developed countries has its roots in the poverty of the developing countries.104.	Let us also consider the over-all aspects of foreign investments from the point of view of international social justice. True  the developing countries need foreign capital to attain their own development. However  those investments should not be prompted either by a profit motive or by a desire for ideological invasion  because  in either case  such investments lead to the subjugation of the country in which they are made.105.	International social justice  on the contrary  demands that foreign capital investments be directed towards the development of the individual and of all the men in the country where such investments are made. It also requires that States respect each other  and hence exclude any abuse of power by the stronger against the weaker.106.	The realities of the present-day world prompt us to speak on the subject of ideological pluralism. May I be permitted to make a few remarks in this connexion to dispel any possible misunderstanding.107.	Man is a rational and free being. As a human being he is responsible for his destiny. Hence  he has the right to act out his role in life. That is why we speak of self- determination and the fulfilment of the human being.108.	Similarly  in a national community  the various human groups  legitimately constituted  have the right to pursue and give expression to the various conceivable ways in which their purpose may be realized. This  logically  implies the right to dissent and to express dissent.109.	For analogous reasons also  every national community in turn has the legitimate right to fulfil its own destiny and  consequently  to carry out in full freedom its historic mission within the international community. The existing system has enshrined that right in a number of principles  namely: legal equality and mutual respect among States; the self-determination of peoples and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.110.	The diversity of economic and social regimes and systems which exist in the various States on the one hand  and  on the other  the need to establish conditions of legal security for the benefit of peace  have ushered in a new phase in the relations between peoples that we call ""ideological pluralism"". It follows as a corollary from the aforementioned principles  and it is in this context that it can be correctly interpreted.111.	Ideological pluralism implies the coexistence  at one and the same time  of different ways of establishing the scale of values according to which a society is structured and organized.112.	Because of its origin and source  if we wish to be consistent  ideological pluralism at the international level presupposes — or at least should presuppose — the application of the same principle that is applied at the national level  with the consequent right to dissent.113.	To invoke ideological pluralism at the international level while denying it at the national level reveals a serious inconsistency. In point of fact  it is tantamount to invoking in the international order the self-same right that 'is denied in the domestic order.114.	I should like now to refer to Latin America. In the international concert of nations there are countries that are bound by very special ties. This is particularly outstanding in the case of the Latin American countries.115.	For us  Latin American unity is a historical necessity . if the countries of Latin America are to play their part in thedevelopment of mankind.116.	My Government is convinced of this historic reality. The President of the Republic  on a recent tour of a number of countries in South America  proclaimed the urgent need for that unity within what he termed ""the pluralist solidarity"".117.	It goes one step beyond ideological pluralism  because this can be viewed as a part of a system of ""coexistence""  namely  a system whereby one country accepts thatanother should have a different conception of its own economic  political and social order. However  such a system does not preclude there being a latent state of war  since one of the parties regards the internal order of the other as unjust  feels that it should cease to exist and is waiting for it to disintegrate  or even goes as far as to try to bring about deliberately its downfall  in a struggle for world hegemony.118.	For its part  pluralist solidarity presupposes a system of coexistence where it is not enough to ""tolerate"" those who are different  but where it is actually necessary to ""want"" to be different  in order to achieve the commonhistoric goals which we place over and above our contingent momentary differences. In other words  we sacrifice our present differences — which are merely contingent — for a future which is permanent and for the sake of which we must all unite.119.	It would be a serious mistake to begin to build the world of tomorrow on existing models. The results are before us.120.	History bears witness to one certain fact: underdevelopment will not be surmounted by the use of familiar  known methods. We are aware of no under-developed country that has overcome its under-development. Other ways must be found. . . . The Club of the developed countries  Eastern and Western  is still exclusive and excluding.121.	We believe that it is possible for each country to find its own course. It is based on the methodology of the trade union struggle  an historic experiment that has proved to be effective'. What were the trade unions? They were associations of workers who by combining their weaknesses turned them into strength.122.	The trade unions  however  soon realized that in order to be truly powerful they had to unite. And so the trade union federations came into being. These  in turn  realized that they  too  had to unite to acquire even greater authority. In fact  just as not all trade unions had the same strength  so too not all federations had the same power. Thus did the trade union confederations emerge. They moved from the national to the international level.123.	Let us transpose that experience to our own struggle against under-development on the international level. The primary-commodity producing countries would form organizations at the international level  enabling them to achieve their just aspirations on the world market. That is what we affirmed at the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]  held at Santiago in 1972  in Santiago.124.	It has sometimes been said  ""more trade  less assistance"". And that would be so if trade were fair. But how can the terms of trade become more just unless the developing countries unite? We cannot sit at the negotiating table if v/e have no power to negotiate  and that power can be acquired only by having representative organizations backed by numerical strength. *125.	It will therefore be of paramount importance to organize the primary-commodity producing countries on a sectorial basis.126.	This would be a unique way for the developing countries  for the producers of primary commodities  to organize  and a way that requires no promises of the kind that are made to be broken  a way that would change the structure of power between developed and developing countries.127.	It is a methodology that is taking its first steps in the field of petroleum  and it will not prove fully effective until we are able to extend it to other significant primary commodities — namely  those without which there can be no development process.128.	That methodology can and should be improved on  and even supplemented. Just as the trade union movement of the developed countries created its own security  economic  social and financial structures  so too there would be no obstacle to the primary-commodity producing developing countries initiating experiments towards the same goal.129.	There are difficulties involved in putting into practice the idea we propose. Stultifying national egotisms will have to be surmounted. But did not the trade unions encounter many and even greater obstacles in their struggle to improve the lot of the workers? This is the great challenge for the under-developed countries: to find their own way.130.	In conclusion  allow me to make a comparison. According to legend  St. Christopher used to help travellers across the river by carrying them on his shoulders.131.	The river is under-development; St. Christopher the developed countries; the travellers  the developing countries. Up until now the developed countries have carried us on their shoulders.132.	If violence is not to take over the world  and if peace is to reign on earth  changes will have to be made.133.	It will be necessary for St. Christopher to give travellers a helping hand  and no longer to carry them on his shoulders. Thus  and only thus will the travellers one day be' able to cross the river by themselves.134.	The way lies before us. It is called ""international social justice."""
"116",7489,"YEM",28,1973,"﻿Mr. President  please permit me to express  on behalf of the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic and on my own behalf  my great pleasure at seeing you elected President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I assure you  Mr. President  that my delegation will spare no effort to co-operate with you during the term of your presidency.102.	It is also with pleasure and satisfaction that I welcome  on behalf of the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic  the admission of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  as well as the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic  to membership in the United Nations. The admission of the two German States signifies the ending of the painful sufferings to which mankind as a whole  as well as the German people themselves  were subjected when nazism appeared in the arena of world history.103.	We are convinced that the contribution of these two States to our Organization will be effective and open up new perspectives for international co-operation in building a better future for mankind  characterized by peace and progress. On this occasion I am happy to convey to the General Assembly that my Government has recognized the Government of Guinea-Bissau  which we hope will soon take its place in our Organization.104.	The explosive situation in the Middle East has imposed upon me the necessity of shortening my statement now before you  which I request be reflected in the General Assembly records. It is my conviction that our responsibilities in preserving international peace require the concentration of our attention on the developments in the Middle East  where a dangerous situation  with all its repercussions on international relations  has been created.105.	The Israeli persistence in disregard for international will to establish peace and justice in the Middle East  and the Israeli refusal to respect and to abide by General Assembly and Security Council resolutions  is to be blamed for the eruption of hostilities in the Middle East. Israel  by virtue of its technical superiority  and of the material and moral support extended to it by a super-Power represented in the flow of arms and money  is to be held responsible for the premeditated and continued aggression on Arab lands.106.	Our role should not be confined merely to delivering speeches and statements or adopting resolutions full of compassion for humanity  peace and justice. If we really want to acquire for ourselves the quality of a civilized international community and make sure that we have abandoned the law of the jungle and are willing to live as human beings in this universe  then we are bound to give thisOrganization an effective role in stopping aggression and putting an end to injustices inflicted on small nations byinternational pirates  by virtue of their might and technological superiority.107.	Our responsibilities call for a scrupulous implementation of the United Nations resolutions. In this connexion  I refer to those resolutions which condemn the acquisition of territories by force.108.	If we do not abide by the international norms which we have accepted as embodied in the Charter  if we do not respect the decisions we have adopted  if we resort  as some do  to the murder of international will by a single vote  then we will  certainly  find ourselves in the future confronted with a devastating situation  not only in the Middle East alone but in other parts of the world.109.	Justice is indivisible  legitimacy is indivisible  and if aggression is given the chance to reap its fruits and achieve victory while we watch as spectators and are satisfied with condemnation  without putting an end to it  then we are allowing the epidemic to spread indefinitely. In order to maintain a genuine and lasting peace in the area  and before trying to suppress the smoke  we should honestly seek to extinguish the source of the fire.110.	Since its inception the conflict in the Middle East has revolved around one issue: that is  the legitimate right of the people of Palestine to live as a nation in their homeland and not as refugees victims of the aggression by a Member State of the United Nations.111.	The tragedy of the people of Palestine is the main source of tension and hostility in the Middle East. TheUnited Nations  which played the role of the midwife in the creation of Israel  is called upon today  more than at any time before  to impose on Israel compliance with United Nations resolutions regarding the right of the Palestinians to self-determination.112.	The United Nations is in duty bound to see to it that Israel fully respects the territorial integrity of the Arab States and abandons its illegal claims of sovereignty acquired by the force of arms.113.	The great sacrifices endured by the peoples of Egypt and Syria  who had been denied justice and were forced into this battle to regain their territories  awaken every human conscience which believes in the right of every human being to live in a free and independent society. My delegation takes this opportunity to salute the heroic sacrifices and the determination of the people of Egypt and Syria. It is my duty to declare from this rostrum  on behalf of Yemen  our total support for and solidarity with the people of Egypt and Syria  who are now engaged in a legitimate struggle to liberate their territories occupied by force for so long by Israel. It is my conviction that the freedom-loving and peace-loving nations Will lend their support to the legitimate rights of both Egypt and Syria  in the pursuit of peace based on justice which would put an end to Israeli aggression."
"117",7536,"YUG",28,1973,"﻿I wish to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the current session of the General Assembly. I am confident that your acknowledged experience and dedication to the purposes and principles of the United Nations will be fully reflected in the successful discharge of your responsible duty. In your election we see an additional recognition of the important role which Latin America is playing in the work of the United Nations. The peoples of the Latin American continent are today making an evermore substantive contribution to the general struggle for progress. They see the road leading to the fulfilment of their aspirations in an increasingly closer co-operation and common activity with all those countries sharing the same ideals of freedom and independence. This was especially reflected at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries. 2.	I should also like to pay a tribute to Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  the President of the twenty-seventh session of the Assembly  for having effectively and competently guided the deliberations of that session.3.	This year's session of the General Assembly of the United Nations is actually being held after one of the largest international gatherings ever held-the Fourth Conference of the"" Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries. That Conference  which was attended by the highest-ranking representatives of about 100 countries and peoples  with a population of almost 2 000 million  expressed the determination by even greater reliance upon their own forces and strength  by further strengthening their mutual co-operation and by joint action to change the prevailing inequitable political and economic relations in the world and to seek  together with other countries  solutions to the pressing international issues.4.	Contrary to attempts at peremptory interpretations of their orientation  the resolve of the non-aligned countries to implement the decisions adopted at the Fourth Conference by intensifying their concerted activities constitutes  in fact  an integral part of their permanent determination to co-operate with all the international elements on an equal footing. The view that the non-aligned countries are aligning themselves into a bloc cannot but cause perplexity. The non-aligned countries remain consistent in their fundamental position of opposing the division of the world into blocs  into closed privileged political  military and economic groups. Rather than shunning the concerted action of the non-aligned countries  the true approach to the solution of world problems lies only in common efforts and the equal co-operation of all the international factors.5.	As a follow-up to their previous gatherings at Belgrade  Cairo  Lusaka and Georgetown  the non-aligned countries assembled at Algiers decided that world developments have confirmed the value and the vitality of the principles  purposes and practice of the policy of non-alignment. They examined in depth the present highly significant moment in international relations  made decisions and took stands of their own regarding the most important issues and preoccupations facing the peoples and countries in the world and the United Nations.6.	The non-aligned countries-whose number has increased almost fourfold since their first summit conference 12 years ago-constitute a real force  without whose participation it is not possible to settle major problems affecting mankind. Any attempts to bypass the non-aligned countries when dealing with international problems of vital interest to all inevitably tend to aggravate existing conflicts and to sow the seeds of new ones.7.	I should like at this point to quote the following words from the statement President Tito made at the Algiers Conference:""The non-aligned countries are not asking anyone to grant them the right to participate on an equal footing in the solution of world problems. They have won this right and are firmly resolved to exercise it through unity and co-ordinated action. This means that they are assuming their share of responsibility and obligations.""8.	In the course of the last few years events have taken place marking the transition from the cold war to the relaxation of tensions  to negotiation and agreements. This process is marked by the summit talks between the United States and the Soviet Union and between  the United States and the People's Republic of China  by the Paris agreements on Viet-Nam  the treaties recognizing the consequences of the Second World War  and other events. These developments have reduced the immediate danger of a general nuclear war and of a direct confrontation of blocs and they affirm the validity of the principles of active peaceful coexistence.9.	This was also evident in the preparations for and the first phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Conditions have been created which will make it possible  in the second and third phases of that Conference through persistent and cautious efforts  to achieve further progress in the direction of removing bloc divisions and evolving a security system based upon equal co-operation among the sovereign and independent States of Europe and North America. We believe that the improvement of relations must not be limited to the participants in the Conference  which  with few exceptions  in fact represent the entire developed world. The desired stability and durability of relations will depend upon the extent to which they evolve as an integral part of general security and co-operation in the world  and in close connexion with the situation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East in particular. This emphasizes even further the need for a genuine contribution on the part of the participants in the Conference to the solution of key world issues and especially to the completion of the process of decolonization and the development of the less developed countries. Peace and security are indivisible — either they will be universal or else they will be enjoyed by no one.10.	More than 10 years ago  at a most critical stage  the non-aligned countries-among them my own-urged upon the great Powers the need to start negotiating with a view to removing the dangers of a general conflict. Through their stands and actions they have  together with other progressive and peace-loving forces  contributed to checking bloc policies and to the initiation of the positive processes of relaxation of tensions and negotiation.11.	It is with profound concern  however  that we note that the practice of interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States  of political and economic pressures and of blockades is continuing. Moreover  there is no hesitation even in resorting to open armed intervention for the purpose of obstructing the liberation of peoples from imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism and all other forms of domination and exploitation. The relaxation of tensions has not favourably affected the international economic position of the developing countries: their position is deteriorating further. The changing of the prevailing system of the inequitable economic relations in the world represents one of the central political issues of peace and security upon which many fundamental antagonisms of the contemporary world are increasingly centering.12.	The peoples of the Middle East  Indo-China  Africa  and Latin America are forced to continue to fight for their freedom  independence  and political and economic emancipation.13.	The events in Chile strikingly demonstrate that the forces of international imperialism and reaction even in the present conditions do not hesitate to resort to any methods or means in order to obstruct the struggle of peoples for freedom from foreign domination and exploitation. Those events serve as yet another warning to the independent countries  and especially to the non-aligned countries  which have sufficient cause to be disturbed and to worry and to ask themselves; ""Who is next? Where will the next blow fall? ""14.	What is happening in Chile also demonstrates the danger that even in conditions of detente new hotbeds of tension may break out. In Chile a confrontation is taking place between an anti-neo-colonialist revolutionary  —  which is with increased vigour spreading over the entire region -and the imperialist forces and interests. This conflict is fraught with many dangers for other countries and for international relations in general. Consequently  the negative effects of this crisis extend far beyond the boundaries of Chile.15.	My country deeply grieves at the tragic death of President Salvador Allende  who fell in the struggle for the social progress of Chile in independence and democracy and to whom all those who fight for the emancipation of nations and man are indebted. Brutal mass persecutions and terror against the democratic forces of Chile are arousing the greatest indignation among the peoples and the Government of Yugoslavia.16.	The military junta did not stop at violence against the legitimate representatives and the democratic forces of their own country. The military junta has created through terror a situation which renders impossible the normal functioning of many foreign diplomatic missions  including the embassy of my own country.17.	In view of all of the foregoing  my Government has today decided that diplomatic relations between the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Government of the military junta in Chile shall be broken off. In making this decision the Government and peoples of Yugoslavia remain faithful to their traditional friendship with the freedom-loving people in Chile and deeply believe in the ultimate victory of the people of Chile over the forces which have trampled on their liberty and legitimate rights to independence  to sovereignty over their natural resources and to an independent road to social  economic and political development.18.	We are firmly convinced that the democratic and peace-loving forces in the world will not reconcile themselves to the attempts at collusion between international  imperialism and domestic reactionary forces in order to arrest the irreversible processes leading to the full political and economic independence of peoples and countries and their progress.19.	The crisis in the Middle East continues to grow and is .ominously extending to the entire area of the Near East. Israel continues its aggressive and expansionist policy  uses force daily  resorts to State terrorism  changes the situation in the territories occupied by force and prepares new measures of annexation. All this drives Israel's policy into ever deeper isolation. A grave responsibility falls upon the shoulders of those forces which identify themselves with the aggressive goals of Israel. The aggravation of the crisis in the Middle East not only complicates the situation in the Mediterranean  but also limits the scope of otherwise positive developments in Europe. Any expectations that external factors could control this crisis for a longer period of time are both illusory and in essence dangerous.20.	A just and durable settlement is possible only through the total withdrawal of Israel  without pre-conditions  from all the occupied territories  and through ensuring the legitimate national rights of the Arab peoples in Palestine. It is through their own struggle that the Palestinian people have made the attainment of their own rights a focal point of the solution of the Middle East crisis. The United Nations  with its decisions  has established the platform and determined the venues; no doubt it constitutes the most suitable instrument for securing a just solution. Efforts should be exerted by all Member States to find a final settlement in the Middle East on this basis. Should Israel persist in its aggression  it will be necessary to apply sanctions against it in conformity with the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter  which was the position taken by the non-aligned countries at the Algiers Conference.21.	The forces of colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism and apartheid continue to suppress African peoples in southern Africa  Namibia  Zimbabwe  Angola  Mozambique  Guinea (Bissau) and the Cape Verde Islands  and elsewhere  enjoying the political  economic and military support of some Western countries and international capital. Moreover  we are faced with increasingly frequent aggressive attacks by colonialists and racists on the independent countries of Africa-Zambia  the United Republic of Tanzania  Zaire  the People's Republic of the Congo  Senegal and Guinea. Tomorrow this could befall other countries as well. The United Nations must resolutely resist this. In the opinion of the Yugoslav delegation  the essence of United Nations action aimed at the eradication of colonialism in the world lies primarily in extending effective all-round political and material assistance to the liberation movements as the only authentic representatives of their own peoples. My country will continue to extend full support to those movements. It is high time that those movements should no longer be treated  as petitioners or observers. The United Nations action should go beyond this in recognizing the liberation movements as the legitimate representatives of the sovereignty of their respective countries in their struggle for the fulfilment of the purposes and principles of the Charter.22.	The Paris agreements are the result of the invincible struggle of the people of Viet-Nam  which is its historic contribution to the realization of the goals of freedom and independence in the world. The only road leading to the consolidation of peace in this area lies in strict implementation of the agreements concluded and in the total cessation of any external intervention in all countries of Indo-China. It is necessary to prevent the violation and flouting of the Paris agreements by the Saigon regime  with support from outside. The provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam  which is consistently implementing the policy of non-alignment  has pledged itself to the full implementation of these agreements and to the right of the people of Viet-Nam to freedom  independence and self- determination  and my country will continue in the future to extend its full support to the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam.23.	It is likewise necessary to put an end to the continued external intervention in Cambodia. The successful struggle waged by the people of Cambodia enjoys ever-broader support and confirms the fact that Prince Sihanouk and the Government of National Union are the sole legitimate representatives of the people of Cambodia. It is both absurd and unacceptable to have Lon Nol's regime  which came into power through foreign intervention  representing Cambodia in the United Nations. The time has indeed come for Cambodia to be represented in the United Nations by its true representatives  and the Yugoslav delegation will work for that at the present session of the General Assembly.24.	The demands of the Korean people for unification without foreign interference merit our full support as a contribution to the improvement of the situation in that area and in the world in general. Supporting the efforts of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  my delegation will strive for the adoption at the current session of a decision likely to expedite the realization of the aspirations of the Korean people — a vital pre-condition for which is the withdrawal of foreign troops.25.	Initial results have been achieved in the area of disarmament  although they do not as yet represent real steps in the direction of general and complete disarmament. The limitation of the scope of the detente among the great Powers is seen in the fact that the arms race continues and that it is spreading to new areas. Although we also welcome the bilateral measures aimed at disarmament that have been taken  we are convinced that substantive results cannot be achieved without the participation of all countries. I should like on this occasion also to reiterate the position of my country  which has been stated many times in the past and is shared by the non-aligned countries in general  namely  that the largest possible share of the resources released through disarmament should be utilized for a more rapid solution of problems of development.26.	The convening of the World Disarmament Conference is  in our opinion  the best way to initiate the process of general disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament. At this session maximum efforts should be exerted to overcome the existing difficulties and to initiate preparations for convening the Conference. The continuation of negotiations for the undelayed conclusion of a convention on the prohibition of all chemical weapons and on the destruction of the existing stocks constitutes an urgent task of the United Nations. It would be of special importance to have the nuclear Powers at long last respond to world-wide demands for total prohibition of the use and production of nuclear weapons and for the destruction of the existing stockpiles and the prohibition of all nuclear-weapon tests in all environments. An inseparable part of such measures should be the elimination of foreign military bases and the withdrawal of all troops from foreign territories  as consistently advocated by the non-aligned countries.27.	We  like many others  have never deemed the relaxation of tension and recourse to negotiations as constituting an isolated process. Even less do we see them as a vehicle for preserving conditions in which it is possible to perpetuate foreign domination over the peoples and countries that seek to strengthen their political independence by strengthening their economic independence while at the same time enriching their independent internal development through new forms and paths of accelerated and comprehensive social and economic progress.28.	We fully appreciate the fact that it is not possible to liquidate overnight the existing crises and conflicts  or to resolve all pressing issues. However  the determination to seek out effectively  and to find  just solutions to these problems and to extinguish existing hotbeds will in the future be the basic criterion of the merit of further detente. Moreover  unless we resolutely embark upon this course even the results achieved thus far will be jeopardized.  29.	The Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries called upon the international community to ensure a proper place for development objectives in the United Nations and to evolve a new system of international economic relations based upon equality and the common interests of all countries. The non-aligned countries are demanding that a general and comprehensive concept of the resolution of long-term and pressing economic problems should be founded upon a new world system of economic relations  especially a new world system of international trade  monetary and financial relations. They desire to build this concept in co-operation with the developed countries  and to participate most actively  and on an equal footing  in the practical implementation of the solutions to be adopted. This is the essence of their positions as contained in the Economic Declaration and the programme of action for economic co-operation  adopted at Algiers [see A/9330 and Corr.]  as well as in the decisions adopted by the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries that was held at Georgetown in August 1972.30.	The non-aligned countries decided to establish a solidarity fund for financing projects related to their economic and social development. The international community as a whole  and in particular the Governments of certain developed countries  have to demonstrate greater political readiness to support the outstanding efforts being exerted by the developing countries. This also entails a curbing of the harmful activities of transnational companies as instruments for the preservation of old-type relations  and an end to the denial of the right to the exercise of full sovereignty over natural resources  and it also requires non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States.31.	An expression of the determination to assign to problems of development the place they serve in our general efforts aimed at securing peace and security in the world would undoubtedly be the broadest possible support for the initiative of the Fourth Conference of the non- aligned countries to convene  in the near future  a special session of the General Assembly devoted to economic issues. Of great importance too is the proposal advanced by that Conference concerning the holding of a joint conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  at the ministerial level  with a view to formulating a programme of international co-operation for overcoming the increasingly dangerous food situation and for solving certain other acute problems.32.	The International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)J is not being implemented  while the objectives set are not being realized. At the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly we should establish the causes andeffects of the unsatisfactory implementation of the Strategy and formulate requisite measures for its realization.33.	The General Assembly should also demand that the interests of the developing countries should be respected and reflected in the monetary and trade negotiations for the establishment of new relations in these most vital areas of international economic co-operation  and it should also demand the adoption of the principles of preferential treatment  non-reciprocity and non-discrimination upon which those relations should rest.34.	I should also like to point out the urgency and importance of the formulation of a concept on the achieving of collective economic security in which every member of the international community would have its unobstructed  independent economic and social development guaranteed. The foresight and validity of the initiative of the President of Mexico  Mr. Luis Echeverna Alvarez concerning the adoption of a charter on economic rights and duties of States  has been confirmed. In saying this I wish to voice our interest in having this charter drafted and adopted as early as possible.35.	The question of the role and effectiveness of the United Nations has never before been of such great importance as today. In reflecting the changed relation of forces in the world  the United Nations has in many ways had its own physiognomy changed. Conditions are being created for this Organization to serve as the main instrument for the solving of major issues of the contemporary world.36.	The United Nations is more and more approaching full universality. In this connexion we welcome the admission to our Organization of the new Members-the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany  with which my country has been developing friendly relations and all round co-operation. In the admission of the two German States we also see an important manifestation of the positive changes that have taken place in Europe  based upon the recognition of realities.37.	In the admission of the Bahamas we once again welcome the success achieved in the realization of the right. of peoples to self-determination and the elimination of vestiges of colonialism.38.	I am certain that in the near future we shall also welcome the admission of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. We are of the opinion that there need no longer be any obstacle to having an independent and non-aligned People's Republic of Bangladesh become a Member of the United Nations  which  there is no doubt  would also constitute a significant contribution by our Organization to the further improvement of relations in the subcontinent  towards which the agreement of 28 August 1973 between India and Pakistan at New Delhi has Contributed in large measure.39.	We find ourselves  however  in a very contradictory situation. The United Nations is drawing closer to full universality and reflects the turbulent processes of national emancipation and the democratization of international relations  but at the same time its effectiveness is not enhanced. The efforts of a limited number of countries to have the most important problems of common interest taken more and more but of the framework of the United Nations are increasing. Many decisions and resolutions are not being implemented or else are openly violated. The cause of such a state of affairs does not lie in the shortcomings of the Charter  but in the behaviour of a limited number of Member States which do not refrain from flagrantly violating its principles and objectives. Such a situation is rendering the work of our Organization more difficult.40.	While being aware of the responsibilities of the permanent members of the Security Council  we feel that the resort to the use of the veto for the purpose of blocking decisions on which there otherwise exists a very broad consensus can only harm the realization of the role and aims of the United Nations Charter. We firmly believe that our decisions should and can in a greater measure be the outcome of agreed positions and mutual understanding on the broadest possible basis.41.	The existing weaknesses and hardships facing the United Nations can be overcome only through concerted efforts and joint operation. We hold the view that the United Nations should serve as the central place for the consideration and settlement of the most important international issues affecting the interests of all States. The world Organization should be informed and appraised of the negotiations and agreements reached outside the United Nations which have a bearing on the interests of the other countries  or when  by their substance they fall within the domain of the responsibility of the United Nations.42.	The non-aligned countries are aware of the fact that their goals can best be achieved through the United Nations and  therefore  they are vitally interested in  and persistently work for  the strengthening of the role and effectiveness of this Organization.43.	Never before has the demand for equal participation in the solving of common issues been so resolute  nor has the number of countries and peoples determined to decide their own destinies in a sovereign manner been larger. In the conditions of the cold war  the dangerous confrontation between the military-political blocs and the great Powers  the general tension and great danger of a general nuclear war  the United Nations was thwarted in discharging its duty in conformity with the letter and spirit of the Charter. We believe that now there exist better chances for the United Nations successfully to discharge its duty in the new conditions. Let us  —  individually and collectively through our attitudes and our contributions-make this a reality."
"118",7574,"ZAF",28,1973,"﻿56.	 This year the General Assembly once again looks to Latin America to provide a distinguished figure to preside over its proceedings. The honour  Sir  has fallen to you  and to your country. May I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your assumption of this high and responsible office  and also to express my confidence that our deliberations will be guided into constructive and productive channels with your experienced hand at the helm?57.	The membership of the United Nations at this moment stands at 135. This is a large membership when compared with the 51 States which signed the Charter as founder Members In 1945  of which my country was one. One of the objectives then  and in the intervening years  was to strive for universality in the Organization so that ""We  the peoples "" of the Organization could justifiably speak as ""We  the peoples"" of the world. That desirable objective has been brought a step nearer realization by the admission during the current Assembly session of three new Members — the Bahamas  the Federal Republic of Germany  and the German Democratic Republic — representing between them a considerable population and a diversity of cultural  social  historical and political backgrounds and philosophies.58.	The admission of the two Germanys is the fruit of a policy of detente actively pursued in Europe  and is a striking example of the fact that accommodation can be reached between parties with widely differing political persuasions and conflicting interests  provided that the will is there and the effort is conscientiously and patiently made. It is a lesson from which we can all profit for the lessening of hostility is conducive to the buttressing of peace  which is the raison d'etre of this Organization.59.	The spirit of detente abroad was one of the main themes of the statements made in the general debate at last year's session of the General Assembly. The passage of time enables us to consider its consequences in better perspective and to take stock. Those countries which have adopted the course of detente appear to be consolidating their contacts and relationships to their mutual benefit and  in many ways  to the benefit of others. At the same time  some other Governments with seemingly irreconcilable differences have begun to follow their lead and to open up a cautious dialogue with one another. This attitude is highly commendable and ought to be endorsed and conscientiously emulated by all of us  for the single  overriding imperative of international relations is international peace. This is a fact which should be borne in mind  particularly by smaller countries  for they  too  have a duty to work towards a relaxation of tension after the example set by the major Powers. It would be a tragedy if the world should move out from under the shadow of major-Power confrontation only to be faced with the threat of increasing conflicts of smaller scale. Such a tragedy must be averted by responsible leadership in this Organization  as well as by the individual efforts of each one of us.60.	In its external relations  South Africa  for its part  remains willing to pursue all avenues of contact and communication  with the object of relaxing tensions and creating conditions favourable for the solution of problems of concern to us. Where our efforts in this direction have been reciprocated the results have been encouraging. South Africa remains ready to enter into discussions with any country  on the African continent or elsewhere  which shares our approach  an approach rooted firmly in the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes. South Africa harbours no aggressive intentions against any country; hence our willingness to conclude non-aggression pacts with other States in Africa. Accusations that we have committed acts of aggression are totally unfounded. We are irrevocably opposed to the use of force and violence in international relations.61.	It is deplorable that force and violence in the form of indiscriminate attacks against innocent  uninvolved and unsuspecting individuals and groups should have become a characteristic of our times. Terrorism takes many forms  but a common component is the utter disregard by the perpetrators for established authority and their determination to subvert  and if possible destroy  constitutionally established law and order  both national and international. It is doubtful that the international law of sovereign States can survive in a meaningful way if the international community should fail to discharge its responsibilities to curb this evil. It is a source of concern to my Government that so little progress has been made on this urgent world problem in the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism  which held its first session in July and August this year. My Government considers that the Assembly should urgently commence drafting a general convention on terrorism. We cannot afford to evade or to confuse the issue while terrorism is rampant.62.	If we  the international community  resolve that we shall settle our political differences without having recourse to force  if we renounce irresponsible methods of terror and violence  and if we continue to make progress in disarming a world bristling with lethal weapons  we can direct our energies and our resources to the solution of the world's other pressing problems  which are many. A number of these are problems of a non-political nature  and confront mankind as a whole. I suggest that the most basic problem of all  and one which encompasses a host of supplementary problems  is how in the future we shall balance the world's rapidly increasing population against our planet's dwindling resources  taking into account the rising economic and social expectations of the very same people whose numbers are increasing at a phenomenal and unprecedented rate. We have  for example  already been given a disturbing reminder this year of the difficulties of providing everywhere the most elementary of man's needs: food. The spectre of famine was raised by the devastating drought in West Africa  end drought conditions  floods and other natural disasters elsewhere. Let me at once express South Africa's sympathy to those who have suffered as a result. These disasters and the consequential threat of famine should not be seen as isolated occurrences. They are a foretaste and a warning of the problems that will have to be dealt with in the future.63.	Another serious problem with which mankind will have to deal is the potential energy crisis. It is necessary that there be the closest co-operation between the developed and the developing nations in the consideration of this matter  for  after making due allowance for the need to protect the quality of our environment  energy is the key to the material improvement of man's estate. We are faced with the possible gross depletion of the total known reserves of all sources of energy if energy is in future consumed at the rate forecast today. It is  therefore  essential for all of us that the different energy-producing resources of the earth be rationally exploited in the interest of mankind as a whole.64.	Nuclear energy undoubtedly occupies a key position in supplying mankind's energy needs of the future. Nuclear power reactors which will supply only about 51 000 megawatts of electricity in 1976  are expected to contribute as much as 564 000 megawatts in 1985 and then to double their supply in the space of the next five years. In terms of total world requirements of electricity  nuclear energy is expected to supply 23 per cent by the year 2000 as compared with half of 1 per cent in 1970.65.	South Africa is one of the world's major producers of uranium. We possess large exploitable deposits of low- grade uranium and we provide a stable supply of a portion of the world's uranium on a competitive basis. At the present moment we are engaged in assessing our capability of supplying this nuclear fuel in an enriched form since enriched uranium is the fuel for most nuclear powered reactors.66.	Having said this  let me add that South Africa's atomic energy programme is devoted to peaceful purposes exclusively. It has always been our policy  and it remains our policy  to sell uranium only on condition that the uranium be made subject to International Atomic Energy Agency or equivalent safeguards to ensure that it is not diverted to military purposes. In the same spirit  the uranium enrichment project to which I have just referred will also be applied for peaceful purposes only. To that end  the South African Government proposes to negotiate  at the appropriate time  an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency for the application of safeguards to the enriched uranium produced by the project  so as to ensure that the product is used solely for peaceful purposes.67.	We believe that this development will not only herald a new era of industrial and economic growth in South Africa but will also enable us to make a contribution to the efforts of the international community to solve the potential world energy problem.68.	May I at this point digress to refer in a few words to the unfortunate events at Carletonville of which mention has been made in the course of the general debate. The tragic loss of life is deeply regretted. Sympathy with the next of kin was expressed by my Prime Minister and others immediately after the incident. A memorandum compiled by my Mission  in the course of reproduction as an official document   will place the matter in perspective. Meanwhile I would simply ask that judgement on the incident not be formed purely on the basis of emotion. What transpired at Carletonville will be determined by the judicial inquiry which has been instituted.69.	Turning now to the question of South West Africa  may I say at the outset that my Government has noted with regret the repeated calls of the Security Council to terminate the contacts between South Africa and the Secretary- General. Those contacts represent a voluntary attempt to use the facilities of the United Nations for the pursuit of a peaceful settlement of the problem. That is one of the primary purposes of this Organization. Yet the call is now apparently to bypass and to set aside the machinery which the United Nations offers for the peaceful settlement of problems. This must inevitably serve as an encouragement to those who advocate confrontation  force and violence as a means to an end in South West Africa. And that course is being advocated despite the fact that in the 14 months between March 1972 and April 1973 during which contacts were made  more real progress was achieved in the search for a solution to the problem in the United Nations context than in all the preceding years.70.	For the first time in the history of the Territory  directly as a result of the contacts  representatives of black  white and other groups from throughout the territory have been brought together around the table under the chairmanship of a Prime Minister of South Africa for the purpose of discussing and trying to resolve issues with Territory- wide implications. We consider that this is a significant and important development for  as my Prime Minister has declared  it is the inhabitants of South West Africa themselves who must decide their own future and not South Africa or the United Nations.71.	We for our part do not consider that we have the right to impose a settlement on the Territory and we do not believe that the United Nations has the right or indeed wishes to impose a settlement on its inhabitants. We shall respect their wishes.72.	We have indicated that any exercise to ascertain the wishes of the population will not be compromised by any existing political and administrative arrangements. And we have stated  with regard to the question whether individual population groups may suddenly become independent as separate entities  that we do not envisage such an eventuality. We expressed the latter position in dealing with a point raised by the Secretary-General whether the possibility could arise  in the light of South African legislation  that one or other of the population groups might acquire separate independence before the South West African people as a whole had exercised their right to self-determination.73.	We believe that all this  taken together with the other points set out in the South African statements reproduced in the Secretary-General's reports  constitutes progress in the real sense of the word. South Africa  for its part  is ready to engage in further contacts  for we believe that we ourselves as well as the United Nations should persevere in searching for a solution.74.	We realize that there are those who believe that progress has been too slow. On the other hand  they too should realize that this is a most complicated and intractable problem and that it cannot therefore be solved overnight. This is fully recognized by the Secretary-General  who stated in his report of 30 April of this year that:""Should the Security Council decide to continue these efforts""  — that is  the contacts — ""it should bear in mind my earlier statement to the effect that time and protracted discussion will be required if any progress is to be achieved."" 75.	South Africa's presence in the Territory is accounted for by the undertaking we have given to ensure that its inhabitants are able and ready to exercise their right to self-determination and independence. We have no designs whatsoever with respect to any part of South West Africa's territory. In the meanwhile  we believe we have a duty to continue to assist in the development of South West Africa in all spheres: economic  social and political. We derive no financial or economic advantage whatsoever from our presence in the Territory. Every cent which accrues from taxation levied on income derived within the Territory  including profits on foreign investments and operations in the Territory  is reinvested in South West Africa for the benefit of all its inhabitants. In addition  South African taxpayers contribute to the Territory's advancement on current account alone — that is  excluding payments to finance capital projects — funds which in the last few years have varied between $60 million and $80 million per annum. It will be appreciated that our resources are not unlimited. Moreover  we have responsibilities also to our own peoples in South Africa  where there is an increasing need for funds for development purposes. Nevertheless  we make this Contribution to South West Africa in the genuine belief that it is our duty to do so.76.	One cannot of course forecast the outcome of the Security Council's consideration of the Secretary-General's latest report. We recognize that the gap separating us  although narrower than it has ever been as a result of our contacts with the Secretary-General  still exists. But we would hope that the Council and this Organization as a whole will be guided by the imperative need for peaceful evolution by consent of those directly concerned  namely  the inhabitants of South West Africa  both black and white. We believe it is crucial that all the segments of the population of South West Africa should be enabled to get together to sort out their problems and to resolve them to their own satisfaction  in a manner consistent with the peaceful objectives of the Charter77.	As I have indicated  a start has already been made in this direction. We have also been encouraged in this regard  by a series of discussions which have recently taken place and which are continuing between representatives of the white group in South West Africa and representatives of such groups as the Hereros  the Namas and the Damaras as well as of the organization known as the Voice of the People. The latter representatives are among those who are known to be opposed to the South African Government. Nevertheless  they have all in the course of these discussions expressed themselves as favouring dialogue in South West Africa and as being opposed to violence as a means to an end. As an example of these discussions  I may mention that Mr. Clemens Kapuuo of the Hereros and Mr. D. F. Mudge  a member of the Executive Council for South West Africa  met in Windhoek on 24 September. In a joint statement issued shortly thereafter  they declared that they were both in favour of contact and dialogue as a method of solving the problems of South West Africa and that they rejected violence. In the course of their discussions  according to the statement  they exchanged views on matters relating to South West Africa in general. It was clear  the statement added  that both of them wished to promote the interests of their respective peoples and of the peoples of South West Africa as a whole. Further meetings of this nature are envisaged.78.	These meetings of individuals of differing views and attitudes are an indication of the desire of the inhabitants of the Territory to involve themselves jointly and directly in the future evolution of South West Africa  and we hope that they will receive encouragement to seek progress in this way. We for our part will afford them every encouragement.79.	In this world of continual change  we recognize and accept the need for change also in areas of our own responsibility. Our policies are anything but rigid or static. My Prime Minister has stated in Parliament that the South African Government is a Government of change  and that it will continue to bring about change in a systematic and orderly way as warranted by changing circumstances and changing requirements. But we believe in change by evolution  not by violence. This is why we attach special importance to the consultations which are continually in progress between the Government and the leaders of the black and other peoples in South Africa.80.	We have stated on many occasions that our policies provide-for the different black nations in South Africa to achieve self-government in the geographic areas of their jurisdiction and to advance to complete sovereignty and independence in the sense in which this concept is generally understood. In other words  each of them would qualify for membership in this Organization. They are aware that they can negotiate their independence  in the full sense of the word  with the South African Government at any moment of their choice  as the South African Prime Minister has repeatedly stated.81.	Eight black nations  totalling more than 14 million people  have already achieved self-government in varying degrees. Six of them have their own Parliament  their own Cabinet and Prime Minister  the latter answerable to their Parliament. The two other black nations  including the 4 million Zulus  have Legislative Assemblies  with executive power vested in an Executive Council. During the course of the last two years  five elections have been successfully held to elect members of these Parliaments. A sixth election is still to be held.82.	Arising from this political progress  the South African Government and the Prime Ministers and other leaders of all the various nations are continually in dialogue with each other. Frequent contacts take place at all levels from the Prime Minister downwards and in the private as well as the public sector. In fact  my Prime Minister has  during the seven years of his premiership  held more official discussions with the leaders of these nations than have all his predecessors together. Many of these leaders  moreover  travel abroad and state their positions publicly. Their opinions on matters of detail falling within the over-all objectives of South African policy do not always coincide with the opinions of the South African Government — but it is their prerogative and duty to put the position of their peoples as they see it. The South African Government regards these contacts and discussions as essential for the promotion of peaceful evolution.83.	One of our concerns  in this evolutionary process  is the question of human dignity. The South African Government is fully conscious of the importance of recognition and acceptance of the human dignity of the individual  and my Prime Minister has publicly stressed the central position it must take in future political developments in South Africa. Earlier this year in Parliament he said he was at all times prepared to do away with unnecessary measures if these measures stood in the way of healthy relations in South Africa.84.	There is nothing which exercises the minds of South Africans more than the solution of our own special political problems. It is after all our future we are building and it is our security that is at stake.85.	We ask the international community to respect our desire to resolve our problems without interference. Let me repeat  however  that we are at all times ready to enter into discussions concerning our internal policies with anyone who is genuinely interested therein. But in the final analysis  it is we ourselves who must solve our problems and solve them we must and shall  whatever the sacrifice  if we are to continue to live in peace and prosperity in South Africa.86.	This brings me to the end of my prepared statement. Before resuming my seat  may I refer briefly to the efforts made to prevent me from addressing the Assembly. I do not intend to deal with the accusations levelled against my Government in the course of these efforts  for they are irrelevant to the issues before the Assembly. I must  however  totally reject them.87.	We have witnessed here an attempt to violate the principle of freedom of speech and expression in this august Assembly. It was an attempt to deprive the representative of a Member State of his inherent right to participate in the proceedings of the General Assembly and to state the case of his country. If it had succeeded it would have put the clock back 2 000 years. For it was the Romans who introduced the concept audi alteram partem: listen to the other party  a principle which has survived for over 20 centuries and is still observed and cherished in all civilized societies. The actions of some representatives were unworthy of the dignity and the status of this Assembly.88.	Moreover  far from humiliating me and my country  they have succeeded only in furnishing proof of the length to which they will go to undermine a principle which forms one of the main corner-stones of the United Nations and without which it cannot survive.89.	Finally  in view of what has happened here I must place on record my strongest possible objection to the unprecedented  illegal and unconstitutional action by the General Assembly concerning South Africa's credentials. My Government views it in the most serious light indeed."
"119",7602,"ZMB",28,1973,"﻿86.	Mr. President  my delegation joins others in expressing our sincere congratulations to you on your election to the high office of President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. The election of a man of your experience and skill befits the onerous demands of your new office and is a source of confidence and inspiration to my delegation. I hope that through your guidance this session will further the cause of freedom  justice  peace and progress. I therefore pledge my delegation's unqualified support in the successful executionof your noble task. I87.	I would also pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski  who steered the proceedings of the twenty-seventh session of this Assembly with admirable competence and impartiality.88.	I wish to reiterate my Government's sorrow at the recent death of His Majesty King Gustaf VI Adolph of Sweden  whose contribution to the well-being of his own people and to the promotion of the ideals of the United Nations is a living testimony to his achievements.89.	Permit me also to express the shock felt by the party  Government and people of Zambia at the loss sustained by progressive humanity as a result of the tragic death of President Salvador Allende  whose name will go down in history as that of a man who strove to rid his country of the shackles of imperialism and neo-colonialism and to promote the economic independence of the developing countries.90.	My delegation wishes to extend a warm welcome to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany  which have joined the United Nations. The admission of these States is a manifestation of the significant trend towards the realization of the principle of universality in the United Nations. My delegation hopes that these new Members will add a new and a positive dimension to the proceedings of this session and future sessions of the General Assembly. -91.	The search for a world order based on freedom  justice  peace and the security of all peoples and countries remains a major preoccupation of Zambia together with other non-aligned and peace-loving countries. This session is taking place hardly a month after that historic Fourth Conference of Heads of State and Government of Non- Aligned Countries  held in Algiers in September. I wish  from this rostrum  to pay a tribute to the Government and people of Algeria not only for the warm hospitality they extended to the participants but also for all their untiring efforts  which contributed so much to the success of the Conference. The Algiers Conference was yet another milestone in the determined collective effort of the non-aligned countries to eradicate the many evils that still afflict this world. It is the hope of my delegation that  as in the past  the important .decisions of that recent non-aligned Conference will greatly facilitate the work of this session.91. We in Zambia have been consistently opposed to activities and situations which are contrary to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. We have always objected strongly to foreign interference 'in the internal affairs of countries in Indo-China. We believe this to be the major reason for the senseless loss of many lives and destruction of property. We have welcomed with relief the Paris peace agreements on Viet-Nam. We are nevertheless distressed at the persistent violations of these agreements. We have repeatedly condemned the brutal bombings to which the people of Cambodia have been subjected. We have always urged  and urge now  that all forms of foreign interference in Indo-China-and in this particular case in Cambodia and Laos-should cease forthwith so that the people of that region  who have suffered far too long  may be left alone freely to determine their own destiny. This is their right. Indeed  I wish to register our deep admiration for the courage the people of Indo-China have shown in their just struggle to rid themselves of foreign aggression.93.	We continue to be encouraged by the bilateral negotiations which are aimed as creating favourable conditions for the reunification of Korea without interference from outside. We remain convinced that the immediate withdrawal of United States troops stationed in South Korea under the United Nations flag and the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Reunification and Rehabilitation of Korea would be conducive to the early conclusion of the bilateral negotiations and to the goal of reunification. In view of the desire of the people of Korea to reunite  we are opposed to any manoeuvre to have North and South Korea admitted into the United Nations as separate entities.94.	The situation in the Middle East continues to be a serious threat to international peace and security. In complete defiance and contempt of the decisions of the United Nations  Israel  a State Member of our Organization  continues its illegal occupation of Arab territories. Displaced Palestinians continue to be denied their fundamental rights. In the meantime  they languish in misery  many of them without shelter. The recent report of the Secretary- General  and the subsequent Security Council debate on the situation in the Middle East make it clear that Israel and its supporters are obstructing a peaceful settlement of this crisis. The readiness of the Arab side to make peace has been demonstrated beyond any doubt.95.	In my address last year   I referred to the initiative by the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and paid a tribute to the 10 members of the Committee of African Heads of State  who  in the OAU efforts to supplement those of the United Nations  visited both Cairo and Tel Aviv. They made every effort to help find a just and durable solution to the problem. The lack of positive response from Israel has caused considerable disappointment to us. As I said earlier  Israel has not complied with numerous United Nations resolutions. It is the duty of the United Nations to ensure that Israel honours its obligation as a Member. We appeal to all States to make earnest efforts towards finding a peaceful and just settlement of the crisis in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967). We sincerely hope that the current initiative of the Secretary-General will bear fruit.96.	Zambia has already welcomed detente in Europe and the process of negotiations that now characterize relations among the major Powers. The relaxation of tension among the super-Powers and their growing willingness to negotiate for the improvement of their mutual relations have reduced the immediate danger of a major world conflict.97.	While detente and the process of negotiations among the major Powers and in Europe are gaining momentum  aggression  pressures and interference in the internal affairs of many small and medium-sized countries and the threat of force against them are on the increase. We disapprove of this trend. It is our firm conviction that genuine peace and security  particularly that of developing countries  can come about only if efforts are similarly directed  with the participation of all States on an equal basis  to the solution of the many problems that bedevil the vast majority of the countries of the world. In other words  our goal must be to strengthen international peace and security as a whole. In this connexion I cannot over-emphasize the importance Zambia attaches to the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)J adopted by this august body.98.	Zambia is opposed to all forms of nuclear testing. This stand is consistent with our commitment to general and complete disarmament under effective international control. We believe that there is an urgent need for the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. The partial test-ban Treaty is a half-hearted measure. For that reason  its effectiveness becomes questionable. Quite understandably  there are some among us who consider it both unfair and discriminatory to prohibit others from acquiring nuclear weapons after certain States have accumulated theirs by the same means and continue to improve upon them both qualitatively and quantitatively. It seems to us that only a comprehensive test-ban treaty which will apply to all has greater chances of effectiveness.99.	We in Zambia deeply regret the unhappy events which made it impossible for a Special Committee on the World Disarmament Conference to be formed as envisaged under General Assembly resolution 2930 (XXVII). It is indeed a pity that such developments should have occurred to prevent the implementation of that resolution  which was adopted after protracted and painstaking negotiations. We remain strongly convinced that a world disarmament conference would be a most significant endeavour and perhaps a real beginning in the search for genuine disarmament.100.	We regret the ineffectiveness of the Conference of -the Committee on Disarmament. We remain convinced that all nations must participate fully as equals  in all discussions that touch on their peace and security. Any bilateral decisions among big Powers which affect other nations  big or small  without full consideration for their legitimate interests  are unacceptable to us. Furthermore  we consider world peace and security based on balance of power  which seems to be the framework of accords bilaterally negotiated between the super-Powers  as nothing but an illusion.101.	Since the last session  Africa has witnessed two sad events. Mr. Amilcar Cabral  President of the Partido Africano de Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde  was brutally assassinated on 20 January 1973 by the agents ofPortuguese colonialism. The world cannot but deeply mourn the tragic death of that great son of Africa.102.	In Mozambique  where Portugal still maintains its colonialist policies  the Portuguese Fascist forces brutally murdered 400 innocent men  women and children late last year at the village of Wiriyamu. The Wiriyamu massacre will indeed go down in history with Sharpeville and My Lai as epitomizing the bestiality and savagery of fascism  colonialism and imperialism. These barbarities are in the vile tradition of generations of colonialists who have terrorized and subjugated the people of Africa. It would be outrageous for this Assembly to let those heinous acts by Portugal pass uncondemned.103.	I am glad to say that neither Cabral's tragic death nor the Wiriyamu massacre has deterred the determination of the people of Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique from their resolve to free their countries from Portuguese colonialism. Similarly  the struggle in Angola continues.104.	It is common knowledge that Portugal is a small and poor country. On its own it cannot withstand the onslaught of the freedom fighters in its colonies. Portuguese colonialism in Africa is sustained principally by some of its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]. The concern of OAU about any form of assistance given to Portugal which enables it to carry out its atrocious policies in Africa was demonstrated by the appointment of a Special Mission to NATO countries led originally by my own President and concluded last year by Moktar Ould Daddah  President of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. We appreciate the positive response of certain NATO countries to appeals to them to terminate all such assistance to Portugal. We call upon those NATO countries still rendering this assistance to Portugal to take example from the others. We would like to state further that the countries which supply arms to Portugal  either bilaterally or within any other framework  bear a special responsibility for the atrocities committed by Portugal against the people of Angola  Mozambique  Guinea-Bissau and the rest of Africa.105.	Portugal will not win its colonial wars in Africa. The continuation of colonial wars by Portugal will only cause untold loss of life in Angola  Mozambique  Guinea-Bissau  including loss of life by Portuguese nationals in those areas. The Portuguese regime should now start negotiations with the leaders of liberation movements to bring about independence to these countries. We know the leaders of liberation movements in Angola  Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau.. They are fine men and women. They are not racists. We are convinced that when they take over the management of the affairs in their respective countries  people of all races and all religious beliefs will live together in peace and in harmony.106.	In Southern Rhodesia  the rebel regime has intensified its oppressive and segregationist policies against the 5 million indigenous Africans. During the year  the regime introduced a system of mass arrests and collective  punishments against innocent villagers in the north-eastern area on the mere suspicion that they offered cover to freedom fighters. I must state that in spite of these desperate acts by a clique of frightened men  the freedom fighters will not be discouraged from intensifying the struggle for the liberation of their country.107.	I should like to reiterate what my Government has continued to uphold regarding the obligation  f the British Government as the administering Power in Southern Rhodesia. The British Government must ensure that there should be  no independence in Southern Rhodesia except on the basis of majority rule. In this regard it is incumbent upon the British Government immediately to convene a constitutional conference  representative of all sections of the people of Southern Rhodesia. In order for this objective to be realized  it is imperative for Britain to ensure the release of all political prisoners and detainees so that they can participate in determining the destiny of their country. In this connexion  we condemn the continued detention of African leaders by the illegal regime of Ian Smith.108.	The problem of Southern Rhodesia has been compounded by external factors. We all know that the illegal regime is very weak internally. However  the breaking of United Nations sanctions continues to be one of the major factors that have sustained the illegal and racist regimes. We regret that certain countries which are in a better position to implement sanctions against the Smith regime are in fact the main culprits. However  we note with appreciation the positive trend in the foreign policies of the new Governments of Australia and New Zealand vis-à-vis southern Africa.109.	Since the unilateral declaration of independence by the settler minority in Southern Rhodesia  we in Zambia have made sacrifices in our efforts to abide by the decisions of the United Nations which are aimed at bringing about justice to the oppressed people of that country. In pursuance of this policy we have decided to cut off completely dealings with the rebel regime. As a result and at a very high cost to Zambia  we are engaged in rerouting our trade to the north instead of to the south  a route to which we had been tied by the colonial pattern of trade in southern Africa.110.	Permit me to express the sincere thanks of the party  the Government and people of Zambia to all those countries which have responded positively to the appeal by the Security Council in its resolution 329(1973). My delegation would equally like to thank the Secretary- General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his initiatives designed to ensure the implementation of the Security Council resolution.111.	In examining the problem of southern Africa it is imperative to pay particular attention to South Africa's political  economic and military role in Southern Rhodesia  Angola  Mozambique and Namibia. Apart from intensifying within South Africa its evil policies of apartheid  the effects of which we recently witnessed in the Carletonville massacre  the Pretoria regime's basic foreign policy objective is to sustain the minority regimes of southern Africa. In this regard it should not surprise the international community that South African military forces have joined ranks with those of the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia and with the Portuguese colonial forces in Mozambique and Angola.In recent months we have witnessed the savage killing of innocent men  women and children by the racist minority regimes  particularly in Mozambique  Southern Rhodesia and Namibia  in a desperate attempt to stifle the efforts of the gallant freedom fighters.112.	South African aggression is not confined to the people of countries still under the yoke of minority rule in southern Africa. Together with the Portuguese Fascists and the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia  it has intensified its acts of aggression against neighbouring independent African States. My own country  for instance  has at the hands of the Pretoria-Salisbury-Lisbon axis lost many innocent lives.113.	In the international Territory of Namibia the racist regime of South Africa is rigorously implementing its apartheid policy through the creation of the so-called ""homelands""  in complete disregard of the opposition of the Namibian people to any Balkanization of their country. This opposition was unequivocally demonstrated in their boycott of the recent bogus elections organized by the South African occupation forces.114.	We in Zambia had serious misgivings about the usefulness of the contacts which the Secretary-General of the United Nations has been conducting with the racist regime of South Africa over the question of Namibia  in accordance with the mandate given him by the Security Council in its resolution 302 (1972). His reports have confirmed our anxieties that these contacts are detrimental to the interests of the Namibian people and should therefore be discontinued forthwith. Given the refusal of the South African regime peacefully to terminate its occupation of Namibia  it has become imperative for the Namibian people to intensify their armed struggle.115.	In the light of these developments in southern Africa  Zambia will continue to render all possible assistance to liberation movements. We - are happy to note that the liberation movements are receiving increased assistance from many parts of the world. They deserve this assistance. They are putting it to good use  for the frontiers of oppression are receding; but their needs are still very considerable. To this end  we wish to appeal to all progressive forces in the world to offer substantial material assistance to the liberation movements.116.	In my address to this Assembly last year I stated my belief and conviction in the capacity of the United Nations — particularly of its specialized agencies — to provide health  transportation  educational and other facilities in the liberated areas of Angola  Mozambique and Guinea- Bissau. The subsequent adoption by the General Assembly of resolutions calling on the specialized agencies of the United Nations to render the assistance indicated in the resolutions on the Territories concerned was a clear endorsement by the international community of the necessity and urgency of such assistance.117.	We are aware of and appreciate the fact that the limited resources at the disposal of the United Nations haveto be disbursed world-wide. However  we believe most sincerely that the provision of such multilateral assistance would be consistent with the genuine priorities and long-term objectives of the United Nations. Apart from achieving maximum economic effect in the field of development  a token contribution would reflect concrete solidarity between the liberation movements and the United Nations.118.	As we await the full and effective implementation of the relevant resolutions in this regard  I wish to reiterate another related appeal concerning the full participation of the representatives  of the liberated areas in dependent countries and of Namibia in the activities of the specialized agencies  on the basis of established criteria applicable to non-Members of the United Nations.119.	It cannot be overemphasized that the direction and scope of the activities of specialized agencies should  perhaps more than ever before  reflect the priorities of the United Nations. Such priorities are cleat. Given the relaxation of tension between East and West  the potentially explosive problems facing the international community continue to be imperialism  colonialism  apartheid-.and the slow rate of economic and social development of developing countries. In other words  the basic task confronting the world is the attainment of those living standards which are consistent with human dignity — a task which inevitably demands maximum co-operation and commitment by all parties concerned.120.	My delegation commends the speedy action of the United Nations in coping with natural disasters and providing and co-ordinating the necessary relief and rehabilitation  as recently demonstrated in Bangladesh  Pakistan and the Sudano-Sahelian zone of Africa. In these situations the specialized agencies have been admirably responsive.121.	The gap between promise and performance in international economic co-operation continues to widen at a dangerous pace. Problems have been highlighted and- diagnosed. Various prescriptions have been advanced  but the will to translate them into practical action consistently continues to be inadequate. We are all aware of these failures. We know that the share of developing countries in international trade has diminished over the past year  despite the spectacular rise in global trade. We equally know of the general unsatisfactory trends in the important economic sectors of these countries. In the absence of political will  particularly on the part of the developed countries  to dispose of their resources in favour of their poor counterparts  the logical result is that outstanding problems become more complex  new ones emerge  and the gap between the poor and the rich continues to widen.122.	Golden opportunities for solving some of the latent and actual problems have been lost out of callous indifference on the part of developed countries  and failures to fulfil their various obligations have been rationalized away. This situation is clearly a despicable disregard of the purposes and the spirit of international economic co-operation.123.	Developing countries have experienced  and continue to suffer  disproportionately  the ominous influences ofinflation and international monetary instability originating from the leading participants in the development process. Such trends and developments have adversely affected the ability of developing countries to contribute meaningfully to the effective implementation of global and other strategies.124.	On present indications the prospects for forestalling a repetition of the failure of the First United Nations Development Decade will largely depend on the unlikely achievement of total commitment to the set goals by all parties concerned  and particularly the need for developed countries to pay more heed to their responsibilities under the Charter and as prescribed by other relevant international instruments.125.	Members of this Organization should do their utmost to forestall the erosion of all hopes that the international community has placed in the Second United Nations Development Decade  the failure of whose International Development Strategy would entrench the disappointments which climaxed the end of the first Decade.126.	Our attitudes and commitment as partners in the process of development should consistently reflect the increasingly recognized principle of mutual interdependence in international relations. This demands the adherence to those principles and objectives which recognize the fact that all national  bilateral or regional policies and practices which influence international relations should be regarded as matters of mutual concern. For example  the achievement of detente between the East and West should not be permitted to affect adversely the genuine economic interests of developing countries. Additionally  the forging of closer links by way of preferential trading arrangements among the developed countries should not equally j permitted to erode the benefits of other international arrangements in favour of developing countries. The participation of developing countries in such arrangements whose consequences affect them should be on the basis of equality and mutual advantage.127.	My delegation recognizes that the significance of the proposal for the drafting of a charter of economic rights and duties of States in terms of the urgent need to safeguard the national sovereignty and independence of all States is that this would improve international economic relations.128.	While reaffirming each country's inalienable right to the full exercise of sovereignty over its natural resources  my delegation would at the same time urge greater awareness of the limited character of natural resources and Itherefore the institution of effective measures to ensure their efficient exploitation and utilization. Furthermore  we would hope that current deliberations on various commodity shortage problems will usher in a new era of realism  rationale and economy in the management and exploitation of the world environmental resources for the betterment of mankind.129.	The important issue pertaining to the role of multinational corporations and the influence of developing countries as well as on international relations in general  has now seriously engaged the attention of the international community.130.	Two important initiatives in this regard have been undertaken by the United Nations Secretariat under the guidance of 20 eminent persons appointed by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 1721 (LIII) of 28 July 1972 and by the group of non-aligned countries as part of their continuing efforts aimed at achieving peace and progress.131.	The United Nations study on the subject   the meeting of the economic experts of the group of non- aligned countries recently held in Santiago  Chile  and the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Algiers in September  have on this important subject recognized the urgent need for countervailing action against the negative activities of multinational corporations or the adoption of appropriate measures to place private foreign investment at the service of national development objectives.132.	In order to give concrete effect to the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly  as well as to realize vital national goals  my delegation reaffirms the cardinal right of every nation to undertake all appropriate measures designed to recover its natural resources and aimed at facilitating the full exercise of its control over the exploitation of such resources particularly by private foreign investment.133.	My delegation equally supports the immediate cessation of any form of interference by countries in which multinational corporations originate in disputes between the latter and their host countries  particularly developing countries.134.	I should now like to turn to another important area in which the United Nations is making efforts. This important area in which the United Nations is making efforts is regarding the progressive development of the international law of the sea.135.	It will be recalled that during the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly [resolution 2750(XXV)J  the United Nations reaffirmed that the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction was the common heritage of mankind. Subsequently  it was decided [resolution 3029 (XXVII)] to convene the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which would deal  inter alia  with the establishment of an equitable international regime — including an international machinery for the international area and its resources and a broad range of related issues.136.	My delegation is pleased to learn that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction  whose task it has been to prepare for the Conference has made significant progress in the discharge of its responsibility. For instance  the Committee has succeeded in identifying the issues necessitating the holding of the Conference. In some cases  single texts have been agreed upon  and in others alternative texts have been presented. It is our view that adequate preparations have been made on the basis of which we can look forward to the convening of the Conference as originally scheduled.137.	While recognizing that the stage has been reached for convening the Conference  we note that previous Conferences on the Law of the Sea gave inadequate attention to the problems of land-locked States.138.	Particular attention needs to be given by the Conference to the following three vital issues. The first relates to the right of land-locked States to free access to the sea. We note that attempts to solve the problem began quite early in the present century. Yet it is recognized that insufficient safeguards have been provided for land-locked countries. Previous conferences have largely left the question for settlement through bilateral or regional negotiations. Past and contemporary experience has vividly shown that this is highly unsatisfactory  especially in southern Africa. To avoid this continuation of such ill effects on international relations it has become necessary that such a right and other related issues should be provided for by the forthcoming Conference.139.	Another important issue to be decided. by the Conference appears to be whether or not the international area already declared to be the common heritage of mankind  will be the subject of exploration and exploitation by an enterprise or by individual States on licences to be issued by an international authority. We believe that  in order to safeguard the interests of developing countries  some of which rely for their economic survival on land resources which are also to be found in the international area  it would be vital to assign the functions of exploration and exploitation of the area to an enterprise subject to the control of a truly representative international authority. In that way  we would be assured of a strong regime which would safeguard the interests of all States  especially the developing countries.140.	Thirdly  concerning the limits of national jurisdiction  we are gratified to note that the Secretary-General  in response to the decisions of this Assembly during its twenty-seventh session  has prepared a study on the economic significance  in terms of sea-bed mineral resources  of the various limits proposed for national jurisdiction.  In establishing uniform limits of the territorial sea  the Conference will need to give due attention to such data.141.	Needless to say  we have addressed ourselves to only a few of the issues before the forthcoming Conference  which  when assuming its momentous task  should no doubt also have regard to its contribution to international peace and security.142.	Zambia attaches great importance to the United Nations. We have consistently held the view that the United Nations is vital to human development. Its importance in the maintenance of peace and security in the world is invaluable  for through it all States are able to give expression to their equality among the rest of the members of the human family. The United Nations  in our view  is one of the greatest expressions of interdependence in an ever-growing and ever-more-complex international community. Consequently  one of the cardinal principles of Zambia's foreign policy is to support the United Nations.143.	This is not to say that all is well with our Organization. As I stated earlier  in my address to this august body at its twenty-seventh session  there is a growing crisis of confidence in the ability and authority of the United Nations to deal effectively with pressing international problems such as the achievement of human freedom and independence.144.	We must act now to restore confidence in this vital instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security. As we move closer to a fuller realization of the principle of universality of membership in the United Nations  an essential and important element for its effectiveness  we must at the same time weed out all impediments in order to ensure that the Organization assumes its proper role for the benefit of mankind. The growing tendency  particularly among the super-Powers  to bypass the United Nations in dealing with problems of vital importance and interest to the whole of the international community should be discouraged  as it has  inter alia  the effect of eroding the prestige and authority of this Organization. The principle of equitable and more-broadly- based geographical representation in all major organs of the United Nations and its specialized agencies must be fully realized. The Security Council  the organ charged with the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security  must cease to be a preserve of the big Powers  where they can use their power to veto at will in order to protect their interests and those of their allies. We wish to reiterate our belief that the time has come for a review of the whole question of permanent membership in the Security Council. We strongly believe that a new criterion for eligibility should be devised. In our view  this should be based not on military or economic power  but rather on the principle of equitable geographical representation. Mere military or economic strength should not be the criterion for permanent membership in the Security Council. Certain countries falling within this category are guilty of protecting and sustaining the racist minority regimes of southern Africa. Such behaviour does not befit the responsibilities that they have assumed  as it is in itself a contravention of the Charter  let alone the numerous resolutions of the General Assembly.145.	We would also urge the elimination of the privilege of veto enjoyed by the permanent members of the Security Council  or at least the institution of measures that will guarantee against its abuse. It is intolerable that the wishes of the vast majority of countries should be frustrated by one permanent member.146.	Although much remains to be done  the international community has taken significant steps towards realizing the objectives of the United Nations. The areas of crisis are being reduced  if somewhat slowly; some of the goals are in sight. The phenomenal growth of the non-aligned movement is gradually transforming a divided international community into one. I wish to reaffirm Zambia's commitment to the objectives of the United Nations. Zambia  along with other peace-loving nations  will continue to work tirelessly for the attainment of these objectives."
