"1",44,"AFG",69,2014,"It gives me great pleasure to express my sincere congratulations to the President on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We are confident that his wisdom and experience will ensure constructive and fruitful deliberations on the very important and vital issues before the Assembly. I should like to assure him of the full cooperation of my delegation to that end. I also express my deep appreciation to his predecessor and my gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his competent and excellent leadership of the Organization.I am delighted to report to the Assembly that Afghanistan has achieved a significant milestone with the successful conclusion of its presidential elections  including the important task of recounting the votes. The new President  Mr. Mohammad Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai  will be sworn in on 29 September. Afghanistan is witnessing the transfer of power from one elected administration to the next. While Afghanistan faces marked challenges  we are confident that the new Government  which enjoys the full backing of the vast majority of Afghans  will strive to bring about political security and socioeconomic prosperity to Afghanistan and  by extension  to the region and beyond.It was more than a decade ago that many countries of the world joined the Afghan people in their struggle for peace and fought against the forces of extremism and terrorism. In that regard  we have collectively achieved tangible results. Unfortunately  however  the menace of terrorism and extremism continues to threaten security  socioeconomic development and peace  not only in Afghanistan but also in the region. There is an urgent need for a comprehensive response to the threats from terrorism  drugs and extremism at the regional and international levels.Today  Afghanistan has credible political institutions  an elected Parliament  a Constitution and elected provincial councils supported by the brave Afghan National Security Forces. The people of Afghanistan have witnessed many positive achievements in the past decade  including in the fields of socioeconomic development  education — especially education for our girls — health  communications and information technology  and the promotion and protection of human rights  including particularly the rights of women. Afghanistan has one of the most dynamic media scenes in the region  propelled by the freedom of expression that the Afghan people have enjoyed for more than a decade. We should also underscore the pioneering spirit of our youth  who are behind much of the innovativeness and diversity of thought in academia and in the private sector.The Afghan people appreciate and thank the international community for the vital support that it has given the country to build security  peace and prosperity in Afghanistan. We look forward to continued mutual cooperation with the international community to protect our achievements and ensure the sustainability of a strong partnership.The transfer of security responsibilities from the international forces to the Afghan National Security Forces for the whole of Afghanistan  launched in the summer of 2011  will be achieved by the end of 2014. As we speak  Afghan forces are providing security independently across the country  despite increasing acts of terrorism inside Afghanistan  which are being committed with support from terrorists from beyond our borders. The growing levels of violent extremism and the alarming developments in the Middle East and other parts of the world make international support for the NATO mission in Afghanistan even more imperative.Parallel to our ongoing efforts to enhance the capacity and capabilities of our National Security Forces  the Afghan Government is also pursuing a dialogue to achieve peace through political means and reconciliation. We have put in place clear conditions in order for that process to be accepted by the Afghan people. For instance  we demand the renunciation of violence and respect for Afghanistan’s Constitution  as it guarantees full and equal rights to Afghan men and women and is the only tool for the preservation of our collective achievements of the past decade.Afghanistan strongly believes in comprehensive  long-term  friendly and good-neighbourly relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan in the fight against terrorism and the strengthening of peace and stability between the two nations in the region. At the same time  we would like to express our serious concern over the rocket attacks by Pakistani forces onto Afghanistan’s soil. The continuation of such attacks is unacceptable to Afghanistan. We hope that the Government of Pakistan  considering our common interests in ensuring peace and stability  will put an end to any kind of acts that could endanger the prospects for good-neighbourly relations and will act to protect cooperation and trust between our two nations.The Afghan Government is keen to reduce the negative economic impact of the security transition and to move towards sustainable economic development in at least three ways.First  we will focus on the development of agriculture and the agribusiness sector  where more than 70 per cent of our population is directly or indirectly engaged  with enormous potential for growth and employment generation.Secondly  Afghanistan is estimated to hold trillions of dollars worth of natural resources  including minerals and hydrocarbons  representing a guaranteed source of wealth and income for generations to come. We already have several State-owned and private companies from China  India  the United Kingdom  Canada  Turkey  the United Arab Emirates  Azerbaijan and other countries  in addition to Afghan companies  expressing a keen interest in investing billions of dollars.Thirdly  Afghanistan is now on the eve of a transformative decade  from 2015-2024  which will be a multidimensional process that will have security  political and economic ramifications. Therefore  the pledges made at the 2012 Tokyo and Chicago Conferences will maintain the Afghan Government’s overall socioeconomic efforts. Afghanistan critically needs the continuation of that support from its international partners over the next few years.Afghanistan’s report on its progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  published in late 2013  shows that the progress with regard to most of the MDG targets  in particular those related to health and universal primary education  is commendable. Despite only starting in 2005  Afghanistan is committed to achieving most of the MDGs by 2020. Meanwhile  national consultations are under way to synchronize efforts towards achieving the off-track MDG targets  bearing in mind the outcome of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals.As we embark on the important task of crafting the new post-2015 development agenda at this session  I am happy to inform members that that process also coincides with Afghanistan’s transformation decade. Both are top priorities for Afghanistan’s national development agenda. We appreciate the work of the United Nations in recognizing the need to reduce the number of sustainable development goals to an affordable  achievable and realistic number in the post-2015 development agenda. We are of the view that that agenda should leave no one behind  it should be adaptable to both global and local settings  and it should have sustainable development and poverty eradication at its centre.Our region is blessed with vast resources and opportunities for economic cooperation. An expanded level of regional cooperation can serve both economic and security purposes. The Afghan Government’s regional strategic goal for economic cooperation is to establish regional economic growth and resource corridors that connect the Silk Road through Afghanistan  the people of South and Central Asia and the Middle East and their key economic activities  including agriculture  light manufacturing and mineral extraction  with essential trade  transit and energy enablers.Regional cooperation is one of our priorities. The Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process represents a significant step towards enhancing stability and regional cooperation between Afghanistan and the 12 participating countries  with the support of 12 other country partners and nine international organizations.This year’s General Assembly session takes place at a time when the United Nations has seen a number of conflicts continue and new ones have taken shape. My Government fully supports the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital. We strongly condemn illegal actions and violations by the occupying Power against the Palestinians as a whole  especially the ongoing disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks on innocent Palestinian civilians.We express our grief at the killing of innocent civilians in Syria and support a political resolution  reached through a broad-based national dialogue that meets the aspirations of all Syrians. With the worsening security situation in Iraq and Libya  we strongly condemn the actions of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Sham and its brutality  and we call for joint efforts to defeat that evil. In that context  I call upon the United Nations to take appropriate action within its mandate to uphold international peace and security.My delegation believes that there is an urgent need for the international community to pay attention to the resolution of the crisis in Ukraine  while taking into account the situation of civilians.In conclusion  let me assure members that Afghanistan remains committed to its national and international responsibilities and obligations. We reaffirm our strong will for a further strengthening of democracy and good governance  including a further strengthening of the rule of law; accountability and transparency; the promotion and protection of human rights  particularly the rights of women; justice reforms; the fight against terrorism  narcotic drugs  corruption; and the eradication of poverty. The support of the international community is essential for all of that."
"2",83,"AGO",69,2014,"On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Angola  allow me to congratulate you  Mr. Sam Kutesa  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session  and to assure you of my country’s support as you fulfil your mission. I would also like to congratulate Ambassador John William Ashe for the competent manner in which he led the work of the previous session. We extend our greetings to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and commend him for his commitment to finding solutions to the issues facing the international community.This session of the General Assembly is taking place in an environment that gives rise to concern due to the aggravation of international tensions  the intensification of conflicts and the deepening of global crises that require effective and sustainable solutions. It is a matter of consensus that the solutions to common challenges are to be found in multilateral negotiations and should take into account the specificities of each country and each people. The United Nations has always been and will continue to be the mainstay of Member States’ participation in decision-making on issues of concern to the international community and in upholding the global values of tolerance and peaceful and harmonious coexistence of countries and peoples  in accordance with the principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and international law.Angola would once again like to reiterate the importance of all Member States joining in efforts to make the United Nations a strong and effective organization  and one that serves as the basis for a more balanced  fair and inclusive international legal order and global security system  while promoting confidence among States and strengthening relations of friendship and international cooperation. Our Organization should pay special attention to the resurgence of armed conflicts and their negative effects on populations  as well as to arms flows  trafficking in drugs and human beings  transnational organized crime  international terrorism and piracy — all phenomena that have an adverse impact on economic development and consequently impede the improvement of living conditions.Religious fundamentalism in some African countries is taking on such violent proportions that it poses a threat to regional security  with serious consequences for peace  stability and development. Angola strongly condemns the acts committed by terrorist groups and expresses its support for efforts to ensure the full neutralization of those groups. Angola supports efforts to strengthen the crisis-management capacity of the United Nations and considers dialogue and negotiation to be the best means of resolving conflicts.We will continue to meet our international obligations  with special emphasis on the African continent and the regional groupings in which we operate  including the Southern African Development Community  the Economic Community of Central African States  the African countries that use Portuguese as an official language  the Gulf of Guinea Commission and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region  with a view to defining mechanisms and forms of cooperation with the United Nations  the African Union  the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries and other international partners.Angola assumed the rotating presidency of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region in January  and in that forum continues to promote the resolution of conflicts on the African continent with a view to attaining stability  political and institutional development  internal and border security  good governance and human rights. It is in that context that Angola is engaged in the peace processes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  the Central African Republic and the Great Lakes region.The Ebola epidemic is an issue of great concern. The position of the Security Council  which declared the epidemic to be a threat to international peace and security  fully reflects the seriousness of the situation. A decisive commitment on the part of the international community is required if the scourge is to be combated and eradicated.We reiterate the need to reform and revitalize the United Nations system  in particular the need to reform the Security Council  which should be brought into line with the current international context and whose membership should reflect an equitable geographical representation through an increase in the number of permanent members. Angola reiterates the right of the African continent to sit among the permanent members of the Council.The Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the lack of progress in finding a lasting solution are a major cause of widespread instability in the Middle East  and also the root cause of the resurgence of terrorism in the region. That situation worries the Government of Angola. We call for political will and flexibility from both parties  and we encourage the Secretary-General and the United States Secretary of State to continue their mediation efforts with a view to establishing a sovereign and independent Palestinian State  as well as a modus vivendi to ensure that the two States coexist in peace and security within internationally recognized borders.The impasse in resolving the question of Western Sahara continues to delay the exercise of the right to self-determination of the people of that territory. Angola calls on the parties to continue negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations and the African Union in order to find a solution in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and resolution 1514 (XV) of December 1960.With regard to the situation in the Ukraine  Angola deplores the loss of human lives caused by instability in the region and calls for dialogue between the parties involved to find a political solution to the conflict.The situations in Somalia and South Sudan remain cause for concern. However  there has been some encouraging progress  which is why we urge the authorities in those countries and the international community to continue their efforts for stabilization. Angola welcomes the constitutional normalization in some African countries. We welcome the holding of democratic elections in Guinea-Bissau  Madagascar and Egypt  and we express our solidarity with the national reconciliation and reconstruction processes and the economic and social development in those countries.The Government of Angola expresses its appreciation for the choice of the central theme of this session  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”. It is greatly relevance  especially for the least developed countries. The progress made in some of those countries is far behind the targets of the Millennium Development Goals  due to structural issues  and is insufficient to mitigate the persistent effects of the economic problems.With one year remaining until the final assessment of the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  our economies continue to suffer the effects of the international economic and financial crisis  which create barriers to economic growth and hinder the implementation of programmes to combat poverty and improve the living conditions of our peoples. However  we note with satisfaction that the African continent has ceased to present the image of desolation it did at the beginning of the millennium. A new reality has emerged in which African countries boast an average growth of 5 per cent per year and improvements in several human development indicators. We believe that the trend of progress will prevail in the near future  and we will do everything to make it so by investing in future generations on the basis of the objectives of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development  the post-2015 road map and the African Agenda 2063.Angola is implementing its National Development Plan 2013-2017  which aims to increase the supply of social services to the population  diversify the economy and consolidate macroeconomic stability  thus laying the foundation for the process of graduation to a middle-income country.Angola reiterates the need to end the economic and financial embargo imposed on Cuba  which limits the right of the Cuban people to development and is a clear violation of the principles and rules of international law.Finally  we appreciate and have been touched by the support that Angola has received from numerous countries for its candidature to be a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the 2015-2016 biennium  elections for which will place during the Assembly’s present session. Once elected to that important organ  we will work with partners in the Council to seek solutions to the serious problems facing the international community and to make a real contribution to peace and security in the world."
"3",130,"ALB",69,2014,"It is a great pleasure for me to address the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. First  allow me to congratulate the President of the Assembly on his election to that post and to assure him of the full support of my country during this session. I believe that  under his leadership and given his prior experience  he will further advance the achievements of his predecessor  who worked with dedication to achieve concrete results.In addition  I would like to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to the Secretary-General for his vision and leadership at the helm of the United Nations and his continuing efforts to revitalize and reform the Organization.Albania is committed to an efficient and coherent United Nations  fit for its purpose as a multidimensional system. We support its strengthened role and contribution to efforts to preserve peace and security  eradicate poverty  inequality and disparity  achieve sustainable human and economic development  and promote respect for and protect human rights as a universal value of humankind. A more fitting United Nations  with the ability to swiftly respond to man-made or natural crises and effectively use available human and financial resources  is key to achieving those objectives in view of an increasingly chaotic and hungry world.Maintaining  restoring and strengthening peace and security constitute one of the three pillars of the work of the United Nations. With so many resources and so much knowledge and manpower invested in dealing with the various and complex crises around the globe  it is simply impossible to ignore the contribution the Organization has made to the world  year upon year  decade upon decade. Yet in 2014 the challenges to peace  security and human values have continued  necessitating more responsive  coordinated and swift reactions on the part of the United Nations.We deplore the events in South Sudan  where tragedies have been played out and continue to shake human consciences. Fighting along ethnic lines has brought far too much suffering to the innocent population. Only a negotiated political solution that considers  protects and respects the rights of all the communities concerned can help rebuild trust and understanding  turning the page on a better future for the youngest country in the world.It is hard to find the words to describe the situation in Syria. After more than three years of deadly fighting  the country is barely liveable. Every kind of horrible act has happened there. More than 170 000 people have died  millions are refugees  and large parts of the country are in ruins. With fighting and mass atrocities being committed every day  any hope of ending the war is a remote dream for those still trapped there. Albania joined the initiative taken by some 60 States Members of the United Nations to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. Unfortunately  like many other initiatives on Syria  the effort was vetoed in the Security Council. We reiterate and reaffirm that the perpetrators of atrocities in Syria must be held accountable and that the people of Syria deserve relief and justice.The events this year in Ukraine have been deeply worrying. What we thought was behind us once and for all  what we believed belonged to the history books and would serve as a lesson for today’s generation and those of the future — acts violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of another country  blatantly infringing and undermining the Charter of the United Nations — was unfortunately exhumed by a Member of the United Nations  a permanent member of the Security Council  the Russian Federation.Despite all the propaganda that Russia spewed forth  the Ukrainian crisis had nothing to do with protecting the rights of ethnic Russians. It was much simpler — from the first  it was about the ambition of a more powerful country to redraw another’s borders in order to satisfy its appetite for its neighbour’s territory. Although the Security Council has been unable to act on this issue  the General Assembly voted overwhelmingly not to accept Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea. The States Members of the United Nations  including Albania  made clear their support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and their full respect for the norms and principles of international law  and we reiterate that international relations must be governed by full respect for the principles and norms of international law and the Charter. The case of Ukraine is no exception.With these crises and disasters erupting in a frightening pattern and the world spiraling into insecurity  development has also been under stress. The United Nations has contributed to raising global awareness of the challenges facing development and the sustainable solutions that can bring economic growth  social inclusion and environmental protection and put our planet on a sustainable path.The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) created one of the most successful global anti-poverty drives in history. Covering poverty  hunger  maternal and child health  gender equality  education and the environment  the MDGs have seen important progress at the national  regional and global levels and have improved the lives of millions. The number of people living in extreme poverty has been halved since 2005  but with the deadline just months away  a lot remains to be done.But another ambitious long-term sustainability agenda  designed to succeed the MDGs  is in the making. Albania has been an active participant in the global consultations focused on making the people’s voices part of the formulation of the post-2015 development agenda. Albania has agreed to test a proposed development goal on governance and the rule of law designed to help countries achieve sustainable development. We hope our experience in monitoring governance  the rule of law and effective  capable institutions will help to inform the upcoming post-2015 agenda of the United Nations.Terrorism remains a major threat to international peace and security  and the fight against terrorism is a priority that requires a greater commitment. We are aware that this global threat can be countered only with collective action and a powerful response. Albania condemns in the strongest terms all terrorist attacks by terrorist groups and organizations in Iraq and Syria  including and especially by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Conscious that terrorism is a threat without borders  a threat to human values and principles as well as to individual countries and regions  Albania has joined the recently created international coalition aimed at deterring and eventually defeating ISIL.European integration and cooperation in our region  and the geopolitical and security situation in Europe  have changed significantly in recent months. The Western Balkans  of which my country is part  is an important geo-strategic European region and one that recently committed fully to a path of increased political stability  economic progress and sustainable development  with strengthened cooperation  security characterized by good relations with its neighbours  and peace consolidation. The European route is the best guarantee for achieving these objectives in our region.We are committed to resolving various bilateral issues as soon as possible  in the interests of our people and our neighbourly relations. We are fully aware that we must enact a number of measures to eradicate corruption and organized crime. Like every country in the region  we have expressed our willingness to conduct joint reforms that will bring increased economic stability and prosperity for our citizens and that will open markets and attract foreign investment.The Republic of Kosovo is one of the members of our Western Balkan community  the youngest State in the region. In less than six years as an independent State  Kosovo has managed  through a transformative development agenda  to enjoy wide  uninterrupted international recognition and to successfully integrate into international  regional and global organizations  such as the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund  the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  the European Bank for Development  the Venice Commission  the South-East European Cooperation Process and others. Kosovo has become an important factor for peace and stability in the region  and Albania fully supports its overall development  as well as its stability and territorial integrity within its current borders.Kosovo’s progress  the new atmosphere in the region  and the need for the region as a whole to move towards more cooperation and prosperity have led down the path to successful European Union-sponsored talks between Kosovo and Serbia as two equal partners in seeking concrete solutions to technical issues of importance to their citizens. Time has shown that engaging in dialogue was a wise decision. Dialogue has produced concrete results  brought the two countries closer to each other  and facilitated and sped up the European Union integration path for both States. Albania fully supports the process of dialogue and calls for the full implementation of the agreements reached.To date  Kosovo has been recognized by 108 States Members of the United Nations  representing more than half of the United Nations membership. Recognition has without doubt been an important factor in Kosovo’s progress. That is why  as before  we call on the countries that have not yet recognized Kosovo to do so  since in so doing they would not only help the people of Kosovo advance towards their future but also contribute to peace and stability in the region.We remain convinced that the quick and full implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement represents a condition indispensable to the sustainable stability of Macedonia  to the consolidation of democracy and the rule of law  and to fulfilling and realizing the rights of Albanians. Albania encourages the continuation of dialogue between the Belgrade authorities and the Albanians of the Presheva valley to promote their rights in accordance with international standards  focusing especially on solving economic  social  educational and cultural problems.During the past two decades  Albania has been transformed from a totalitarian State into a functioning democracy. Progress is evident  above all  in the field of human rights. The protection and promotion of human rights are one of the national priorities and part of Albania’s foreign policy. Albania offers a valuable model of respect for diversity  tolerance and coexistence for the Balkan region and beyond. For the Albanian people  tolerance and hospitality are inherent values derived from our national tradition.The presentation of Albania’s candidacy for membership on the Human Rights Council for the 2015-2017 term is only a logical consequence of our road towards building a society based on human rights. We are confident that Albania has accumulated valuable experience in democracy over the years that it can share with other member countries of the United Nations. Moreover  by reaffirming the universality  indivisibility and interdependence of human rights  Albania is committed to bringing a national and regional perspective into the Council’s deliberations and advocacy of human rights worldwide.We are aware that our membership in the Council for the 2015-2017 term is a challenge bearing great responsibility to justify the confidence of Member States. On the other hand  Human Rights Council membership would serve as an impetus for my country to further democratization and to raise human rights standards. Therefore  Albania  after obtaining the endorsement of the group of Eastern European States  would welcome and appreciate the support of all other Member States for its candidacy to the Council.In conclusion  I wish to reiterate Albania’s determination to continue its support of the United Nations agenda and strengthening the role of the United Nations globally."
"4",153,"AND",69,2014,"It is an honour for me to represent my country  the Principality of Andorra  in the Assembly  which for almost seven decades has been meeting annually to speak of peace  development and justice  and particularly this year  in which we are marking two historic events that are closely linked to the birth of the United Nations.The year 2014 will mark 100 years since the beginning of the First World War and 70 years since the landing of the Allies in Normandy  which was the beginning of the end of the Second World War. Those two armed conflicts caused humanity to open its eyes to a new reality: the old balances among European Powers no longer served to maintain peace in the world. The policy of blocs was ineffectual in preventing conflicts with enormous destructive capacity. Further  the foreign activities of countries  focusing solely and exclusively on their national interests  proved in some cases to be the cause of the conflicts.The two World Wars raised humankind’s awareness in that the world needed a global order that would ensure peace and security and promote development and justice. Those functions could no longer be provided by a single country  however powerful and large  or even by a bloc of countries; rather  there had to be multilateral action. That was the raison d’être of the United Nations  of which the highest expression is this General Assembly.I wanted to begin with a brief historical reference  because I believe that the challenges of peace and security in the world of today are not very different from the challenges of peace and security of the world of yesterday  of 1914 or 1944. Certainly there is a variety of challenges  but they have a very significant common denominator: they can be resolved only with a vision that is global  multilateral  effective and  above all  respectful of the principles that inspire this General Assembly.The conflicts in Syria  Palestine or Ukraine  which threaten peace and security and stability  will not be resolved optimally or effectively with a partial or short-term vision. Any solution that veers away from the founding principles of the United Nations is condemned to be unstable  not lasting and  unfortunately  quite often a solution that leads to new conflicts.Therefore Andorra has always championed and will continue to champion the discussion of and solutions to those conflicts under United Nations auspices. We did so when we co-sponsored the draft resolution in the Security Council that would have requested that the case of Syria be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC)  because without justice there can be no lasting peace — neither in Syria nor anywhere else.Also  in the same spirit we have been unflagging in our defence of a solution to the Palestinian conflict that obtains peaceful coexistence for two States  in compliance with United Nations resolutions. A solution must be based on mutual recognition and mutual respect  because the aspirations of the Palestinian people to have their own State are noble and respectable  but also noble and respectable are the aspirations of the Government of Israel to ensure life and security for its citizens. Along the same lines  we do not believe that any solution to the Ukrainian conflict can be stable unless it respects the principles of international law and unless it comes as the fruit of a sincere dialogue — neither in Ukraine nor anywhere else.The risk and threat to international peace and security arising from the emergence of the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq require a clear response from the international community vis-à-vis the extremists. There can be no excuse or mitigating factor for the criminal acts of barbarism  sectarianism and — let us be clear — terrorism to which the Islamic State resorts as a strategy for its action and communication. There can be no double-standard discourse. The Islamic State murders innocent people in cold blood. We all feel as if we are British  American or French citizens when watching the recent savage executions. We must also all feel as if we were Syrian or Iraqi citizens — true victims of those extremists  though not always so visible in the media. There can be no room for inaction or for impunity.New threats  also global in nature  have appeared  such as the phenomenon of foreign combatants. In that connection  Andorra co-sponsored the recent Security Council resolution 2178 (2014). We must have a response to rechannel efforts to tackle the challenges and immediate threats. In the long run we must be able to persevere in the fight against sectarian discourse  extremist discourse  and discourses of hate. On that point  education must play an essential role  together with the other values of the United Nations  now and in the future.The actions taken by my country in the United Nations over the past year have focused primarily on education. That matter requires  perhaps more than any other  a vision that integrates long-term thinking. Promoting access to quality education for all the citizens of our planet has always been a priority of the United Nations  because when we speak of education we are speaking also of fundamental rights and of development. But I would go further. Education is also an instrument for creating awareness of a global citizenry. If there is not a broad majority of citizens of the world who believe in the principles and values of the United Nations  our actions will always be in vain.I am convinced that the only way to create global awareness is through education. Education is the best weapon in the fight against hatred and violence of all kinds. Andorra therefore welcomes and has participated from the beginning in the Global Education First Initiative promoted by the Secretary-General  because it brings a universal vision together with local action. It also shows that diversity is strengthened in a global focus  and with diversity we can strengthen democracy.Andorrans  because of our historical and geographical circumstances  have understood for some time that education must have a twofold focus  local and global. We have also long understood that cooperation among the different States strengthens the quality of our educational systems and opens new opportunities for our citizens. I say “educational systems” because the citizens of Andorra can have access on an equal footing  and without cost  to French  Spanish and Andorran education. Those three public education systems are complemented by the offer in Andorra of a Catholic religious education  accessible also to a great part of our population.Perhaps without being fully aware of it  or perhaps because fortune has placed us between two great European nations  it is true that for decades now we Andorrans have educated ourselves in diversity and in being multicultural. That has not caused us to lose our identity; on the contrary  our identity has been reinforced. Sometimes we are not even aware ourselves of the educational richness of our country and of the great asset that that is. For that reason the Government of Andorra has focused a great deal of its policy and action abroad on education. In 2012 and 2013  during the Andorran presidency of the Council of Europe  that is how we acted. It is also what we have shown through participating in the Global Education First Initiative  together with 15 other countries from all continents. That was an honour for Andorra.That activity abroad is also reflected coherently in internal policies in Andorra. We have suffered the effects of the international economic crisis for years. We have had austerity in our public spending  but that has not undermined our educational system. It will never affect our educational system  or undermine it  because education is the best passport to the opportunity for a future that is better for all.The need for multilateral action is clear not only in the matter of education but also  and perhaps even more intensely  in the fight against global warming. What we each can do unilaterally will not accomplish much if there is no global commitment. It is in the fight against climate change that we can see most clearly that unilateral actions have a limited reach. Andorrans are very aware of that  given that our primary economic sector is winter and mountain tourism — a tourism threatened by global warming. The Pyrenees are heating up at 0.2°C each decade  and precipitation has dropped by 2 litres per square metre each year.It is clear that a programme of local action is required. We are working  together with the population through education and awareness  on policies to reduce our impact on the environment. We are preparing studies to seek ways to mitigate the effects of climate change and also to seek alternative and complementary systems. Over the years ahead  we will deploy great efforts to bring about alternative energy sources.But all that is not enough  nor are the many actions being implemented by Governments in countries represented enough. National domestic environmental policies are important  but if we are to limit carbon dioxide emissions we must have a global commitment. Without effective implementation of such a commitment  the fight against climate change will not bear the hoped-for fruits. We have a year to prepare for the Paris Conference  a year to mobilize our efforts.It is also time for the international community to mobilize to fight the Ebola virus that so seriously affects Sierra Leone  Liberia and Guinea. It also affects us; let us not deceive ourselves. It is the time to show solidarity  to help. Now is the time  in the weeks and months ahead  when we must tackle that disease  which  unfortunately  does not recognize — nor will it recognize — borders. It is urgent. Beyond that it is  in my opinion  a global emergency.Three years ago  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Principality of Andorra came to this Assembly and spoke  among other things  of an ambitious reform programme for restructuring our economic model (see A/66/PV.27). The programme hinged on transparency  economic openness and a homogenization that would respect certain Andorran specifics. Today  three years down the road  we can make a very satisfactory assessment of the implementation of that policy. Our country has implemented a fiscal model that works with our European neighbours  a moderate system that taxes all income and promotes economic productivity.We have also opened 100 per cent of the Andorran economy to foreign investment  as we believe that a more open world is a more transparent world  one with more opportunities for all  and in particular for those who deserve it the most. A country such as ours  which for many years has been open to immigration  cannot continue to allow our citizens to have different levels of rights economically. They must all have the same economic rights. In that process we have broadened all economic rights to all foreign residents  who represent more than half of our population  because a more open economy is also a fairer and more democratic society.At the same time  along with its domestic reforms  Andorra has negotiated double-taxation agreements with France and Luxembourg and is negotiating one with Spain that I am convinced will be concluded soon. We think we can have a similar agreement with other European and other countries. Those agreements show that there is a commitment in Andorra to a more open and transparent global economy. That is a firm commitment on the part of our Government with regard to generating more opportunities for our business sector. We are also firmly determined to move towards greater integration of our economy in the single European market. For us  going global begins in Europe.I wanted to sum up some of our principal domestic reforms because I understand that a spirit of multilateralism and a global spirit must prevail. The efforts of a country working for transparency and economic cooperation make sense and will be effective only if they are accompanied by equal efforts by all countries — again  by all countries. Andorrans are committed to moving in that direction  and to do so together with the international community  because we know that it is only thus  only by working globally  that progress will be effective  equitable and stable.The statement of the Head of Government of a country of 468 square kilometres and 70 000 inhabitants will never make the headlines or be discussed in prime time on the world’s big international television channels. But representing a small country gives us some advantages  including one that I believe we should underscore today. No one is as aware as we are of the importance of multilateral forums when it comes to resolving conflicts  strengthening international law and finding global solutions. No one is as aware as we are that to preserve individual identities and diversities we must have a collective resolve and joint action.History has accustomed Andorrans to being affected by the geostrategic decisions of bigger countries and to suffering indirectly the effects of instability occurring beyond our borders. We know that in the great causes of humanity such as the fight against climate change  our individual actions will not have much influence if not accompanied by collective action. I could say the same of building a global economy that is more equitable and more transparent. I have always said that the reality for Andorra is also the reality for all  that for the great questions we address  the solutions all hinge on consensus — otherwise they are not solutions. We must have broad consensus based on individual convictions.The convictions of Andorra are clear: they are the principles and values that almost 70 years ago inspired the birth of the United Nations. Let us never forget the reason for this great Organization. If we forget  we are not worthy of being here."
"5",198,"ARE",69,2014,"At the outset  let me say that it is my pleasure to join previous speakers in congratulating you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I am confident that your experience in international affairs will contribute to the success of the current session. We stand ready to offer our full support during your presidency. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend your predecessor  Mr. John Ashe  for his wise leadership of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I also would like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and United Nations staff around the world for their continued efforts to promote global peace and security and to achieve development and well-being for all people.We meet today  as we do each year  to renew our commitment to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  the basis on which the Organization was founded  and to reiterate our firm belief in its objectives  including creating a peaceful and secure world and achieving prosperity and development for all peoples. We believe that those noble objectives can be achieved by doing two things. The first is playing an effective and responsible role in regional and international issues through constructive dialogue  positive engagement and the peaceful resolution of disputes. The second is by creating a suitable environment for international relations  based on the principles of good-neighbourliness  moderation  tolerance and non-violence.The United Arab Emirates is gravely concerned about current forms of extremism  terrorism and sectarian divisions in our region  which have become a grave threat to international peace and security. In addition to being a violation of human rights  terrorism threatens the integrity and values of States  undermines their social fabric  disrupts their security and development  and erodes their cultural and human heritage. The acts of terrorist organizations — indiscriminate killings  mass executions  kidnappings and intimidation of innocent women and children — are heinous criminal acts and are strongly condemned by the United Arab Emirates. The United Arab Emirates also denounces the brutal methods used by such groups in the name of Islam  as Islam rejects such crimes  which are inconsistent with Islam’s moderate approach and principles of peaceful coexistence among all peoples.As the international community must be aware  besides the increased incidence of terrorist and extremist acts in our region  most notably those perpetrated by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS)  the threats posed by those terrorist and extremist groups are expanding beyond our region to threaten the rest of the civilized world. Various countries in the region  including Afghanistan  Somalia  Yemen  Iraq  Syria  Libya and the States of the African Sahel  are suffering at the hands of terrorist takfiri groups  which have exploited unstable conditions in those countries to create an environment that they believe will guarantee them steady funding  logistical support  training and recruitment. Those extremist and terrorist organizations promote obscurantism  exclusivity and an illicit ideology  and they perpetrate brutal acts to impose their control and increase their influence in order to achieve their goals. The current collective action against the threat of ISIS and other terrorist groups reflects the international community’s shared conviction of the need to confront the imminent danger. Civilized communities have no other option than to stamp out that threat. It is a test in which we must succeed.With regard to Libya  the United Arab Emirates is concerned about the deteriorating security conditions and their repercussions on the stability of neighbouring countries. We strongly oppose the terrorist acts that have undermined the work of legitimately elected institutions in Libya. The United Arab Emirates’s policy towards Libya is to provide full and unconditional support for the legitimate decisions taken by the Libyan people through their nationally elected House of Representatives.The latest developments in our brother country  Iraq  are increasingly alarming. ISIS has exploited the sectarian practices of the former Government in Iraq to garner the support of affected communities in expanding their influence over large parts of the country with extreme brutality. While the terrorist groups are threatening the sovereignty of Iraq and its social  cultural and religious fabric  they continue to exploit the chaos in Syria to achieve their purposes without any regard for sovereignty or national borders.In that context  the United Arab Emirates believes that the current collective action will address the growing threat of extremist fighters in Syria as well as in Iraq. In that regard  I welcome the recent decision of the Security Council to confront and block the extremist groups. The threat posed by extremist fighters has increased in the midst of the violence inflicted by the Syrian regime on the Syrian people. At this critical juncture  we must support the moderate Syrian opposition as part of an effective strategy to counter extremism and terrorism.From this platform  we express our deep concern at the grave developments taking place in Yemen. The Houthis  who are using violence to try to undermine the political process and the constitutional legitimacy of the Yemeni State  compel us to take a firm and immediate stand against attempts to change the reality through violence and force. We have to realize that an exclusively sectarian and individualistic approach is not an acceptable option to the Yemeni people  who aspire to build an inclusive civil State that is capable of committing to a national dialogue and continuing the implementation of the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative and its mechanisms. The United Arab Emirates will continue to support the political transition process in Yemen and will assist the efforts of the Yemeni State to achieve stability and development.In the light of the recent developments in the region  it is incumbent on us  as nations that have pledged to abide by the principles enshrined in the Charter  to focus our efforts on combating that dangerous scourge. The United Arab Emirates therefore calls on the international community and Member States to cooperate in combating terrorist groups and to take comprehensive measures to fight them through a clear  unified strategy. Those efforts should not be limited to Iraq and Syria alone  but must also be directed against the locations of those groups wherever they exist. We wish also to stress the futility of taking gradual measures to address those challenges. We must intensify our efforts in order to combat the terrorist groups promptly and effectively.While our attention should be fully focused on countering terrorism  the United Arab Emirates believes that providing support to Governments facing serious security challenges is of critical importance. Active participation is also required to provide the necessary assistance to restore peace and security in those countries by helping them to strengthen their legitimate institutions. In that context  we continue to highlight the importance of respecting the sovereignty and independence of States and supporting all political efforts aimed at achieving peaceful settlements of ongoing conflicts and disputes. Without those efforts  violence will continue. The United Arab Emirates hopes to see security and stability prevail in and throughout all countries.I once again reiterate the firm position of the United Arab Emirates in rejection of terrorism and extremism in all their forms. My country is fulfilling its responsibilities and is committed to participating constructively at the national  regional and international levels to combat violent extremism and affiliated beliefs and terrorist acts. The United Arab Emirates  through its membership in the Global Counterterrorism Forum  cooperates with international organizations and with concerned countries to ensure that the territories of the latter are not exploited by those who facilitate or execute terrorist acts  as well as other related crimes  such as the financing of terrorism  human trafficking and the recruitment of people to commit those egregious crimes. By hosting the Hedayah Centre for training  dialogue and research to combat violent extremism  the United Arab Emirates continues to support the international community in building capacities and exchanging best practices on that issue.My country also continues to develop its national policies and its legislative and executive systems in order to deter and confront all terrorist acts  eradicate the roots of terrorism and protect our youth from being lured into a cycle of extremism and violence. To that end  the United Arab Emirates recently adopted a federal law on combating terrorist crimes. The law provides strict penalties for those found guilty of inciting terrorism or committing terrorist acts. The United Arab Emirates is also strengthening preventive policies by establishing centres for the rehabilitation of people influenced by extremist and terrorist ideologies.The United Arab Emirates hopes for the recovery and restoration of security and stability in the region so that Governments can carry out their duties and obligations and their peoples can resume their normal lives in a constructive way. That hope is driven by the remarkable progress achieved by the new Government in Egypt and its good governance in implementing its political road map. Despite the challenges facing Egypt  the signs of normalcy in public life and the revived economy and culture are promising. Therefore  the United Arab Emirates regrets the statements of some representatives and their unacceptable questioning of the legitimacy of the Egyptian Government.The present Egyptian Government was freely elected by the Egyptian people  who believe in its ability to fulfil their aspirations. Questioning the Egyptian people’s will and right to choose their representatives is an interference in the internal affairs of Egypt and undermines its stability. Accordingly  I emphasize that the stability of our region depends on the stability of Egypt.The United Arab Emirates therefore calls on the international community to provide the necessary support to the Egyptian Government and its economy in order to boost Egypt’s efforts to achieve progress and prosperity. I would also like to commend the generous initiative of the King of Saudi Arabia  Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques  in convening the economic summit to support the Egyptian economy. His is a visionary approach to promoting Egypt’s future and maintaining moderation in the region.The United Arab Emirates expresses its disappointment over the failure of the peace negotiations between Palestine and Israel. We strongly condemn Israel’s aggression against Gaza  especially the destruction directed against the civilian population and infrastructure  including some United Nations facilities. We demand a thorough  transparent and independent investigation to determine legal responsibility for the damage. We hope that the continued failure of the peace negotiations will not lead to a resurgence of violence and the return to the region of a new and more brutal form of terrorism.The establishment of peace and security in the region is a key element in achieving global stability and a priority of our foreign policy  which derives its principles from the Charter of the United Nations and the provisions of international law. On the basis of those principles  my Government again rejects the continuing Iranian occupation of three islands that belong to the United Arab Emirates — Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa. We demand restoration of the full sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates over the islands and emphasize that all actions and measures taken by the Iranian authorities are contrary to international law and custom and to all our common human values. In that respect  we note that the Islamic Republic of Iran has recently hoisted the Iranian flag on the part of Abu Musa island allocated to the United Arab Emirates under the 1971 memorandum of understanding  in violation of the memorandum. My country strongly condemns that action as a flagrant violation of the memorandum of understanding and regards it as devoid of any legal effect.We therefore renew our call to the international community to prevail on Iran to respond to the repeated peaceful  sincere calls of the United Arab Emirates for a just settlement of the issue  either through direct  formal negotiations between the two countries  or by referral to the International Court of Justice to finally settle the dispute in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the provisions of international law.The United Arab Emirates welcomes the ongoing negotiations between the five permanent members of the Security Council and the Islamic Republic of Iran aimed at reaching a comprehensive settlement concerning the Iranian nuclear programme. We affirm that  in order to avert an arms race in the region  a final and strict agreement must be achieved; the region cannot afford further tension and instability. Nevertheless  the United Arab Emirates believes that the peaceful use of nuclear energy is a necessity in meeting the world’s growing energy demands. My country is proud to be a pioneer in this field and to successfully harness the peaceful use of nuclear technology in compliance with the highest standards of transparency  safety and security.Despite the challenges facing the region  my country has always sought to remain a model of moderation  tolerance and peaceful coexistence in the region  consistent with current international efforts. We strongly believe that investment in human development is important in the long term  and we therefore attach great importance to the negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda and the sustainable development goals. We welcome the results of those consultations  which have placed the eradication of poverty at the heart of the development agenda.My country also supports the inclusion of goals that would provide sustainable energy for all  develop green economies  promote food security  supply safe drinking water and ensure gender equality and women’s empowerment. The United Arab Emirates is committed to pursuing economic and social policies aimed primarily at achieving the development of the individual  providing all means necessary for a person to lead a decent and productive life  and promoting prosperity. In that context  I note that Dubai has been chosen as the venue of the 2020 World Expo. It is a great honour for us to act as host to this event  and we thank all the countries that supported our candidacy. We look forward to working with Member States to organize an exhibition that meets the aspirations of all.Comprehensive and sustainable development cannot be achieved unless all segments of society participate in the national development process. Accordingly  the United Arab Emirates pays special attention to women’s empowerment. My country now occupies a prominent place among the countries of the world in terms of women’s achievements and success in all areas of life. Our efforts are not limited solely to empowering women in the United Arab Emirates  but also include supporting women throughout the region and around the world.Abu Dhabi will host a UN-Women Liaison Office with the support and leadership of Her Highness Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak. We are also assisting UN-Women in the preparations for the high-level review on women  peace  and security. Those efforts reflect the interest and participation of the United Arab Emirates in international efforts to empower women as effective partners and agents in preventing war and resolving conflict  keeping in mind that women play a key role in countering violence and promoting peace and security throughout the world.We must continue to devote special attention to the issue of climate change. Recent international reports indicate that the effects of climate change have become a major challenge to development. But there is still some time left to mitigate the impact through international cooperation. In that context  we welcome the outcome of the recent Climate Summit held a few days ago at the United Nations. We are grateful to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts to advance that important issue prior to the start of the general debate of the General Assembly  and we thank all the participating parties. We also urge all parties to abide by the agreements reached and stress that the developed countries must take the lead in that respect.The efforts of the United Arab Emirates in the field of renewable energy are seen in various parts of the world. We host the International Renewable Energy Agency in Abu Dhabi and make available more than $500 million in the form of grants and low-interest loans for renewable energy projects in developing countries. We also have extensive and varied international commercial investments totalling billions of dollars in the renewable-energy sector. Such initiatives  investments and grants all contribute to addressing climate change and its impact throughout the world.In conclusion  I would like to underscore that the United Arab Emirates will continue to make every effort to achieve our aspiration to contribute to a secure and stable world  in which people can live in dignity  peace and happiness."
"6",245,"ARG",69,2014,"I address the General Assembly at a very special moment  not only for the world but also for my country. I would like to begin by reflecting on the words with which Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon opened this sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly. He went over many of the problems  tragedies and calamities that are unsettling the world today  and I think  if I remember correctly  that he literally confirmed that the turmoil  as he defined it  that is upsetting the world today is endangering multilateralism.I sincerely believe that most of the problems that the planet has today economically and financially  with respect to terrorism and security  in terms of force and territorial integrity  of war and peace  are the result of the exact opposite: the absence of an effective  practical and democratic multilateralism. That is why  I would like to begin today in particular by thanking and congratulating the General Assembly for adopting resolution 68/304  on 9 September  by which it finally decided by a wide majority of 124 votes to dedicate itself to drafting a multilateral convention which will be a regulatory legal framework for restructuring the sovereign debts of all countries  a task that we needed to take on.I have been coming to the General Assembly since 2003  first as a Senator  and then  starting in 2007  as President. We always came calling for reform of the Security Council and of the International Monetary Fund. Our point of departure was the experience we had in my country  the Argentine Republic. Today  I would go so far as to say in this international context that my country  the Argentine Republic  is a triple leading case in terms of economics and finance  terrorism and security  and force and territorial integrity.The first area is the economic and financial crisis that spread throughout the world starting in 2008  which persists to this day and which is beginning to threaten emerging economies whose greater economic growth we have supported over the past decade. The 2008 crisis was experienced by my country in 2001  when the largest default on sovereign debt in living memory occurred. At the time  the Argentine Republic had accrued debt representing 160 per cent of the gross domestic product  with the consent of multilateral organizations  because when one is speaking about that level of debt  the problem is not just that of the debtor  but also of the creditors.Starting with the dictatorship on 24 March 1976  and through the neoliberal period  Argentina was a favourite of the International Monetary Fund. In the end  Argentina accumulated an unprecedented debt that caused the country to implode  not just in economic terms but also in political terms. We had five presidents in a single week. At that point  nobody claimed responsibility for what had taken place in Argentina. Argentina had to resolve its problems as best it could  and in 2003  a few months after taking office  a President who had come to head the Government with only 22 per cent of the vote came to speak at the General Assembly (see A/58/PV.11) and maintained that it was necessary to generate a model of development and growth for the country so that the country could shoulder its debt. He maintained  in a rather interesting metaphor  that dead people do not pay their debts and that countries have to live  develop and grow in order to meet their obligations.But he also said that the level of debt — 160 per cent of the gross domestic product — was not our country’s responsibility alone; that we as a country were accepting responsibility for having adopted policies that had been forced upon us; that while we were shouldering our responsibility  we were also requesting and calling for the multilateral organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the creditors themselves  which had lent money at usurious rates — at that time as high as 14 per cent in United States dollars — which were receiving payments in the Argentine Republic  to also assume part of the responsibility for that indebtedness.And with that man — who took over with 22 per cent of the vote  with 25 per cent unemployment  a 54 per cent poverty rate and 27 per cent of extreme poverty  without education  without health  without social security  over time  with a model of development and growth — we were able not only to create millions of jobs  millions of people becoming integrated in the social security system  including retirees and pensioners  but also to invest 6 per cent of the gross domestic product in education  and set aside enormous amounts of money for the country’s infrastructure  building roads  schools  nuclear plants  hydroelectric plants  water  gas and electricity plants that now cover the entire country  in an unprecedented programme of social inclusion that has allowed to reduce poverty and extreme poverty to single digits.Today  the International Monetary Fund itself recognizes that Argentina’s economic growth between 2004 and 2011 is the third-largest globally in terms of quality of growth. Only Bulgaria and China are ahead of us. In Latin America  we have the greatest quality of growth and the best purchasing power for our workers and salaried employees and the highest social security deposits.We have been able to achieve all of that while also dealing with debt that others had generated. It is worth repeating that our Governments were not the ones that declared a default  nor were they the ones that had assumed the debt; we were simply the ones who shouldered the debt  as appropriate  and paid  from 2003 to today  more than $190 billion — I repeat  more than $190 billion — by restructuring the defaulted debt with 92.4 per cent of creditors through two debt swaps  one carried out by President Kirchner in 2005 and the other carried out by me in 2010.What is certain is that we were successful. We succeeded because 92.4 per cent of Argentina’s creditors regularized their situation. We began to make regular payments  and not only to them. We also fully paid our debt to the International Monetary Fund through so-called stand-by arrangements. We were able to completely cancel our debt with the International Monetary Fund. A few months ago  we also concluded negotiations with the Paris Club on a debt dating back to 1956. It was so long ago that I was three years old when that debt was created and the Minister of the Economy of my country  who discussed the restructuring and renegotiation of the debt with the Paris Club  was not even born. Yet we reached an agreement with 19 European Union finance ministers to finally restructure the debt. We are now paying the first phase of $642 million.This does not end there. We also regularized the situation with the rulings of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes at the World Bank  which has begun hearings not for acts or actions committed by our Government  but for the actions of previous Governments that ended up in the World Bank tribunal. We have also resolved that issue  just as we arrived at an arrangement with Repsol when we decided to regain control of our energy resources and expropriated 51 per cent of the oil company’s shares. We also restructured that debt and reached an agreement.We have done all this with our own resources  without access to capital markets because Argentina  due to the default of 2001  was denied access to capital markets. This represents a process of unprecedented social inclusion. Why do I say “unprecedented”? During the 1950s there were similar inclusion processes in my country  but the difference is that we initiated this process of inclusion after complete and utter bankruptcy. At the peak of default  we were able to overcome default  to include the people of Argentina and to enjoy social growth with inclusion. And today Argentina is extricating itself  and in addition we have one of the lowest debt ratios in the world.The other leading case to which I referred and now wish to discuss is the emergence of the so-called vulture funds. That is not a term used by any popular South American leader or by any African ruler  although African countries have also been major victims of these vulture funds. One of the first global leaders to mention them was the former English Prime Minister Gordon Brown at the General Assembly in 2002. This expression became the copyrighted shorthand for something unworthy and immoral that kept countries from addressing the genuine problems of education  health and poverty. Today  with the support of the judicial system of this country  Argentina is now being assaulted by these vulture funds.What are these vulture funds? They represent the 1 per cent of debt-holders that did not take part in the 2005 restructuring. They could not participate because they had purchased bonds in 2008. As everyone knows  these are specialized funds  as indicated by their names  that purchased funds or shares of countries that had defaulted on their debt or were about to do so. Subsequently  they did not revert to the country in question for the payment of that debt  but brought suits in various jurisdictions in order to make exorbitant profits. “Profits” is hardly the right word  because what has been recognized in a judgment passed down here in the jurisdiction of New York is that this 1 per cent grew at a rate of 1 608 per cent in a five-year period. Is there any business  undertaking or investor earning 1 600 per cent in just five years? That is why they are called vulture funds. Today  they are obstructing the recovery of that 92.4 per cent who trusted in Argentina.I am therefore pleased that the Assembly has taken the bull by the horns  and I hope that between this year and next — before the General Assembly holds its new session in 2015 — we will have arrived at a regulatory framework to restructure sovereign debts. The point is to engage in an exercise in active and constructive multilateralism so that no other country will have to experience what Argentina — a country that has the ability and willingness to pay its debts despite the harassment of these vulture funds — has been through.These vulture funds also threaten and hold the economy of our country hostage by provoking rumours  slander and libel from the personal to the economic and financial  so that they sometimes act as a destabilizing factor in the economy. Those who set bombs are not the only terrorists; those who destabilize the economy of a country and create poverty  misery and hunger through the sin of speculation are economic terrorists. That is what we want to spell out. That is why we strongly advocate the establishment of a multilateral convention soon and expeditiously  not just for Argentina  but for the rest of the world. We believe that a financial and economic balance that addresses the social and economic disparities among countries and within societies will also be a great antidote to those who recruit young people who have no hope in the future and enrol them in crazy crusades. We must all lament that. We can see only the surface of the phenomenon; we also have to delve deeply into the causes that mobilize people.We also talked about my country as a triple leading case on terrorism and security. My country is the only country of the Americas other than the United States of America that was the target of terrorist attacks: one in 1992 when the embassy of Israel was blown up  and the second in 1994 when the headquarters of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA) was bombed. This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the bombing of AMIA. I dare say before this Assembly — in the presence of some of the family members of the victims who have always been with us — that the Government headed by President Kirchner did the utmost and went the greatest lengths to uncover the real culprits  not only because it opened all my country’s intelligence files and created a special prosecutor investigation unit  but also because  when in 2006 the justice system of my country accused Iranian citizens of involvement in the bombing of AMIA  I myself was the only President who dared to propose asking the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate with and assist in the investigation.That request was made intermittently from 2007 to 2011  until the Islamic Republic of Iran finally agreed to a bilateral meeting  allowing it to be included in the agenda. That meeting led to the signing by both countries of a memorandum of understanding on legal cooperation that allowed for the Iranian citizens who had been accused  and who live in Tehran  to be deposed before the judge.But what happened when we signed that memorandum? It seemed as if all hell had broken out  both nationally and internationally. The Jewish associations that had sought our support for so many years and that had come here with us to ask for help turned against us  and when an agreement was finally reached on legal cooperation they accused us of complicity with the State of Iran.The same thing happened here in the United States. When the vulture funds lobbied before the United States Congress  they accused us of collaborating with the Islamic Republic of Iran  which at the time was known as the Terrorist State of Iran. They even lobbied on their websites  posting pictures of me on the Internet with former President Ahmadinejad as if we were business partners. Just this week  we learned that the iconic Waldorf Astoria hotel  in this city  was the setting for a meeting between the Secretary of State of this country and his Iranian counterpart.We are not criticizing them. Quite the contrary  anything that represents dialogue and understanding seems very good to us. But we wish to ask those who have been accusing Iran of being a terrorist State — and I am not speaking here of the last century  but of last year — what they would say today about the members of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS)  many of whom not so long ago were called freedom fighters when they were fighting in Syria against the Government of Bashar Al-Assad. And this is where I believe we have another problem with respect to security and terrorism. The major Powers too often and too easily seesaw from the concept of friend to enemy  and terrorist to non-terrorist. We need to agree once and for all not to use international politics or geopolitical positions to determine positions of power. I say that as a militant opponent of international terrorism.By the way  just to add a touch of color  ISIS has apparently issued a threat against me that is under legal investigation in my country. The threat apparently has two justifications: first  because of my close relationship with His Holiness Pope Francis  and secondly  because I recognize the need for two States  Israel and Palestine. While I am at it  let me reiterate my call on the Assembly to recognize Palestine once and for all as a State with full membership in this body. We have to begin to undo some of the Gordian knots — because there is not just one Gordian knot but several — regarding the situation in the Middle East  which involves recognizing the State of Palestine  Israel’s right to live securely within its borders  and Palestine’s right not to be subjected to the kind of disproportionate use of force that led to the deaths of hundreds of women and children  which we condemn just as we also condemn those who attack Israel with missiles.In a time of economic vultures and hawks of war  we need more doves of peace to build a safer world. We need more respect for international law and more equal treatment of those seated in this Hall. Just this morning  I overheard one leader refer to the use of force to attack the territorial integrity of a country.Here too  the Republic of Argentina is a leading case. For more than 100 years  we have had a claim against the United Kingdom on a matter of sovereignty. We once again ask the Assembly to call on the United Kingdom to sit down with Argentina to discuss the matter of the sovereignty of the Malvinas. No one cares and there is not a single veto from the Security Council  because Argentina is not a member of the Security Council and is not even among the countries that decide what happens in the world. So long as that continues  and so long as the votes of the five permanent members of the Security Council are worth more than the votes of Côte d’Ivoire  Ghana  Kenya  Egypt  Uganda  Argentina  Bahrain or the United Arab Emirates  nothing will be resolved. We will just have the same speeches we hear every year without arriving at a resolution.The Assembly must fight to take back the powers it delegated to the Council  since —almost paradoxically — the Assembly has to ask the Council for permission on its decisions or on whether to admit a member. We need to reassert that the Assembly is a sovereign body of the United Nations  and that each of us is worth one vote in a true global democracy. Not everything will be resolved when that global democracy is respected to the letter  but I do believe it will mark the beginning of a solution. I am neither a pessimist nor an optimist; I consider myself to be a realist. In any event  the child of pessimism and optimism is always optimism  but with realism. Optimism without realism is either ingenuity or cynicism. I do not wish to appear ingenuous or cynical before this audience.I want to convey what we really think in my country. We have long demanded reform of the Security Council and of the International Monetary Fund. In 2003  reform the International Monetary Fund seemed almost inevitable; today  hardly anyone remembers the idea of reforming the International Monetary Fund  because it no longer plays a central role in decisions. Even the International Monetary Fund itself and both its current head and former leaders  including Anne Krueger  are also calling for reforms with respect to the restructuring of sovereign debts. So long as there is no international treaty approved by this Assembly  no matter how many clauses are imposed by the restructuring  there will always be a Judge Griesa somewhere in the world who says that they are meaningless  and who will end up applying usurious taxes to bleed some poor country to death. That is what is happening  because it seems to me that they are trying to overturn the restructuring of sovereign debt for which the Argentine people worked so hard.Before coming here I was in Rome  meeting with a fellow countryman who today occupies a strong  exemplary religious and moral leadership. I would like to offer a message of peace and of peacebuilding. If we truly wish to fight terrorism  then let us work for peace. We cannot fight the terrorists by beating the drums of war. Quite the contrary  that is exactly what they want — a symmetrical reaction so that the wheel again begins to turn and a price is paid in blood.That is why I think it is important for us to think deeply about those issues. Above all  I want to bring to the table the certainty that if the United Nations recovers its leadership  if the Assembly resumes its mandate  when too many countries fail to comply with international law  even though they require others to do so  then I am certain that we will have made a major contribution to peacebuilding and the fight against terrorism from which no one would have been left out. But we have to leave to our children a much better world than the one we have today.Finally  I wish to recall that a year ago the problems were different. A year ago  we were discussing other problems  other threats to security. Times have changed. The wrongdoers of yesterday do not seem so bad today. Those who should have been invaded and crushed a year ago  today seem to be cooperating to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS). First  it was Al-Qaida  and  I wonder  where did Al-Qaida and the Taliban spring from? Where do they get their weapons and resources? My country does not produce weapons. Who sells arms to those groups? Then there was the Arab Spring  which ended up by being not so much a spring as a fall and even a winter. Those involved went from being freedom-fighters to being persecuted or imprisoned. Now there is ISIS  a new terrorist organization that carries out beheadings on television on a carefully set stage. What is causing all this  I wonder? Where is this coming from? I have become really distrustful of everything after seeing what is happening in the world today — real-life scenes that make fictional series look trivial.It is therefore worth asking ourselves why it is that we are facing ever-greater problems — problems that caused the Pope to comment that there is practically a third world war. That is true. It is a world war but not along the lines of the more conventional wars of the twentieth century. There are hotspots where the only victims are civilian populations. That is why  a few minutes from now in the Security Council  of which Argentina is a non-permanent member  we wish to raise some of those issues. We have no certainties  no absolute truths  but we have many questions. We want to put them to those who possess a lot more information than we do  far more data and far more extensive networks of information than my country has. Heaven forbid that  with all those data  they have a wealth of information but can understand little of what is happening. For they have to be able to comprehend what is happening if they are to come up with a definitive solution.I deeply appreciate once again the political will of the 124 countries that supported resolution 68/304. As everyone knows  there was pressure to keep us from getting that number of supporters or having a vote  but I think that the exercise of practical  effective and democratic multilateralism that the adoption of the resolution represents demonstrates that all is not lost. On the contrary  it is in the hands of each and every one of us  each of our countries  to find real and effective solutions to the problems the world has today."
"7",270,"ARM",69,2014," We are meeting at a symbolically significant time  between the 100th anniversary of the First World War and the seventieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Seven decades ago  at the end of the Second World War  the United Nations was established. Its mission was to form a new environment for civilization and culture in order to prevent the repetition of the previous tragic events of history.The year 2015 is of particular significance for all Armenians around the world. On 24 April  Armenians around the globe will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the most tragic page in the nation’s history: the Armenian genocide. It was an unprecedented crime  the objective of which was to eliminate the nation and deprive it of its homeland  and it remains an unhealed wound for every Armenian. The 1915 genocide was a crime against civilization and humanity  and its inadequate condemnation paved the way for similar crimes of mass murder in the future.Addressing the Assembly ahead of that 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide from this rostrum  which I would call the podium of honour and responsibility  I declare our profound thanks to Uruguay  France  Russia  Italy  Belgium  the Netherlands  Switzerland  Sweden  Germany  Poland  Lithuania  Greece  Slovakia  Cyprus  Lebanon  Argentina  Venezuela  Chile  Canada and the Holy See. We thank them for their recognition and condemnation of the Armenian genocide  regardless of the form it took or the language used to express it. I thank the United States of America  the European Union and all those personalities  State bodies  territorial units and organizations in many countries that publicly called things by their proper name. That is indeed extremely important  since denial is an integral part of the crime of genocide.For an entire century now  Armenians around the globe and the entire progressive international community have been waiting for Turkey to show courage and face its own history by recognizing the Armenian genocide  thus relieving future generations of the heavy burden of the past. Alas  instead  we continue to hear ambiguous and messages with ulterior motives  in which the victim and the slaughterer are set on equal footing and history is falsified.Armenia has never made recognition of the Armenian genocide a condition for the normalization of bilateral relations with Turkey. In fact  Armenia was the party that initiated that process of normalization  which in 2009 culminated in the signing of the Zurich protocols. However  those protocols have been shelved for years now  awaiting ratification in the Turkish Parliament. Ankara has declared publicly that it will ratify the protocols only if Armenians cede Nagorny Karabakh and Artsakh to Azerbaijan. In Armenia and Artsakh  ordinary people often simply retort: “To hell with your ratification.” This vernacular phrase summarizes the age-old struggle of the entire nation and unequivocally explains to those who attempt to bargain with others’ homeland that the motherland is sacrosanct and they had better stay away from us with their bargain. It is in these circumstances that  currently  Yerevan is seriously considering the issue of recalling the Armenian-Turkish protocols from Parliament.The tragic events in Syria and Iraq that we are currently witnessing demonstrate how groups whose creed is hatred are targeting religious and national minorities. Two days ago  on Armenia’s independence day  the Saint Martyrs Armenian Church in Dayr Al-Zour  Syria  dedicated to the memory of the victims of the Armenian genocide  was mined and blown up by the terrorists. Such barbarity is a criminal demonstration of godlessness  which is in no way or shape related to any faith. The catastrophic situation in Syria and northern Iraq continues to deteriorate  and today hundreds of thousands of people are directly in peril. Among them are tens of thousands of Armenians in Aleppo  Syria. It is one instance to consider in the context of our joint commitment to preventing crimes against humanity. Armenia has voiced on numerous occasions the need to defend the Armenian population of Syria and the Yazidi population of north-western Iraq  and we are encouraged by the unified stance of the international community in that regard.The maintenance of international peace and security is the essence of our Organization. In recent years  Armenia has consistently consolidated its peacekeeping capabilities thereby preparing ourselves for more proactive engagement in that field. Armenian peacekeepers will very soon be dispatched to the south of Lebanon in the context of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. The close collaboration we enjoy with our Italian colleagues enabled our participation in that endeavour. I strongly believe that our servicemen will fulfil their mission with dignity and a high level of professionalism and will use the extensive experience they have garnered in the last decade in Kosovo  Iraq and Afghanistan.It has been more than 20 years that our neighbouring State  through its unconstructive and maximalist stance  has thwarted the international community’s efforts aimed at the just and peaceful settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. The bellicose declarations and various threats made at the highest level in Azerbaijan have been completely tolerated on account of the international community’s failure to correctly assess them. The President of Azerbaijan has designated the entire Armenian nation as enemy number one  and what is considered in the rest of the world to be a crime  in Azerbaijan is considered to be a heroic act.Despite the fact that each conflict is unique  fundamental human rights and freedoms  including peoples’ right to freely express their will and self-determination  continue to evolve as a determinant in their resolution. The vote held a few days ago in Scotland once again proved that nowadays referendums are more and more widely perceived as a legal model for the peaceful settlement of ethnic conflicts. It was no coincidence that the right to decide one’s own fate through a referendum is at the core of the proposal put forward by the co-Chairs of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for the settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict.While discussing the Nagorno Karabakh conflict settlement  I must address the four Security Council resolutions — resolutions 822 (1993)  853 (1993)  874 (1993) and 884 (1993) — adopted during the war  which every so often are exploited by the Azerbaijani authorities in order to justify their obstructionist policy. Those four resolutions demand  as a matter of priority  the unconditional cessation of all military hostilities. Azerbaijan has failed to comply. Azerbaijan’s own non-compliance with the fundamental demands of the resolutions make their full implementation impossible. The resolutions call on the parties to cease their bombardments and air strikes targeting the peaceful civilian population and to refrain from violating the principles of international humanitarian law. However  Azerbaijan has continued its indiscriminate bombardments of the civilian population. Azerbaijan has not spared children  women or the elderly  thereby gravely violating all legal and moral norms of international humanitarian law. Now Azerbaijan cynically refers to those resolutions selectively — citing them out of context as a prerequisite for the settlement of the conflict. An adequate interpretation of the Security Council resolutions is not possible without a correct understanding of the hierarchy of the demands set therein.The resolutions  inter alia  request the restoration of economic  transport and energy links in the region and the removal of all obstacles to communications and transportation. It is no secret that Azerbaijan and Turkey imposed a blockade on Nagorno Karabakh and the Republic of Armenia at the outset of the conflict. In his statements  the Azerbaijani President even takes pride in that fact  promising his public that such action would remain the priority of Azerbaijan’s foreign policy.The aforementioned Security Council resolutions call on Azerbaijan to establish direct contacts with Nagorno Karabakh. Azerbaijan has refused to establish any direct contacts with Nagorno Karabakh  which was a legally equal party to the ceasefire agreement concluded in 1994  as well as a number of other international agreements. Moreover  Azerbaijan preaches hatred towards the people it claims it wants to see as a part of its State.None of the Security Council resolutions identifies Armenia as a conflicting party. Our country is called upon only to continue to exert its influence over the Nagorno Karabakh Armenians in order to put an end to the conflict. Armenia has fully complied  and due to its efforts a ceasefire agreement was concluded in 1994. All Security Council resolutions refer to Nagorno Karabakh as a party to the conflict.The Azerbaijani authorities have failed to implement the fundamental demands of the Security Council resolutions  including abiding by and adhering to the humanitarian norms. Incidentally  Azerbaijan has occasionally gravely violated that demand. Azerbaijan’s cruel and inhumane treatment of Armenian civilian prisoners of war regularly results in their deaths  although I imagine that no one would be surprised about that  since Azerbaijan is the very State that suppresses and exercises the most inhumane treatment of its own people. A clear proof of that was the decision of the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture to suspend its visit to Azerbaijan due to the obstructions it encountered in the conduct of the official Baku.The OSCE Minsk Group is the only specialized structure that has been dealing with the Nagorno Karabakh issue according to the mandate granted by the international community. While Azerbaijan knows that it could not possibly deceive or misinform the Minsk Group  which is well aware of the essence of the problem  it attempts to transpose the conflict settlement to other platforms by trying to depict it as a territorial dispute or exploiting the factor of religious solidarity. That is ironic  since Armenia traditionally enjoys very warm relations with the Islamic nations  both in the Arabic-speaking world or  for instance  with our immediate neighbour Iran.We highly value the indispensable role of the United Nations in the adjustment and implementation of the development goals. I strongly believe that  through the new post-2015 development agenda  we will continue our efforts to seek solutions and respond to global challenges  in accordance with the Millennium Development Goals.In conclusion  I would like to underline that we have covered a substantial part of the path towards the shaping of the post-2015 development agenda and we will continue our endeavours in that regard  displaying the flexibility necessary to bring the process to its logical conclusion."
"8",303,"ATG",69,2014,"At the outset  I wish to extend heartiest congratulations to the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. Antigua and Barbuda looks forward to his leadership and guidance throughout this session. I also offer congratulations to his predecessor  His Excellency Ambassador John Ashe  on a job well done and on his unrelenting service to the United Nations community  particularly small island developing States.I stand before the Assembly as  perhaps  the newest Head of Government at this sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly. The political party that I have the honour to lead was democratically and overwhelmingly elected as the Government of Antigua and Barbuda a little more than three months ago. I am probably also among the youngest of the Heads of Government at this gathering. However  although I may be relatively young and my Government new  I have been a steadfast believer in the value of the United Nations from the first moment of my adult consciousness. The idea that there could be a world without a machinery for leaders to gather in one place  with the single purpose of improving the lives of all humankind  conjures up images of chaos  carnage and catastrophe too frightening to contemplate. While some may argue that the United Nations has not always lived up to its noble purposes and that chaos  carnage and catastrophe have scarred our planet  I am profoundly aware that  without the United Nations  the viciousness and the wounds would have been significantly worse.However  even as I rejoice in the existence of the United Nations  I also lament that its largest and most powerful nations have too often used their privileged positions to weaken the authority of the Organization in advancement of their own narrow interests. It has also been a grave sadness that in the past powerful States have circumvented this body in pursuit of their national goals  even in defiance of the solidarity of the larger family of nations.For those reasons  my Government and the people of Antigua and Barbuda strongly support the reform of the Organization. We would like to see reform that democratizes the United Nations so as to give a greater voice to those countries  such as mine  that are marginalized in decision-making because we are considered too small to make a difference. We would also welcome a comprehensive reform of the Security Council that ends the anachronism of the veto power of the five permanent members — a system that has no legitimacy in fairness and in the global balance and that has often prevented the Security Council from acting in a manner that would command worldwide support and acclamation.It is paradoxical that such nations  particularly those that most fiercely advocate respect for democracy and the rule of law  implement those principles at home but decline to implement them abroad. Respect for the rule of law and for the democratic principle that gives nations rights that are as inalienable as those of the individual in powerful States must become integral to the process and systems of governance by which the world’s affairs are managed. Indeed  small States  such as mine  rely on the strength of the United Nations and on international respect for democracy and the rule of law to protect us from incursions on our sovereignty and disregard for our rights. Centuries ago  the philosopher Aristotle spoke a compelling truth when he said of the State:“A State is not a mere society  having a common place  established for the prevention of mutual crime and for the sake of exchange ... Political society exists for the sake of noble actions  and not of mere companionship.”Aristotle’s observation concerning the State remains valid and legitimate in today’s international system of States  which the United Nations represents. Every State within the international system must recognize that noble action is one of the purposes of a political community.In this regard  I draw the Assembly’s attention to the fact that 10 long years have passed since my small country  with a population of under 100 000 and an economy of $1.1 billion  received a favourable decision by the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in a complaint against the United States  a nation of several hundred million inhabitants whose economy is valued in the trillions. Despite the favourable judgment  against which the losing party has appealed without success  the United States Government has not seen fit to perform the “noble action” of settling with my small State in a manner consistent with the harm done to our economy. My country has been denied income that  had we continued to earn it  would have contributed significantly to the welfare of my people  and to the capacity of our economy to cope with the grave effects of climate change and the financial crisis to which we became a casualty. I stress that when my country took the United States before the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body  we did not do so as an act of hostility to a neighbour with whom we have enjoyed a long and friendly relationship; we did so because we had a duty to care for our people.My small State was the victim of a trade violation. In good faith  we sought relief within the international system and the democratic principles and rule of law that it is meant to uphold. To be fair  the system delivered justice. But in so doing  its weakness was exposed when justice could not be enforced because the powerful party that was found against would not settle with the small country that was injured. However  if democracy and the rule of law are to prevail in our international system  they have to be upheld and respected by the powerful and cannot simply be imposed upon the weak. Otherwise  there will be resentment  discontent and possibly conflict.Yesterday  speaking in this very forum  the President of the United States  Barack Obama  said that “right makes might... bigger nations should not be able to bully smaller ones” (A/69/PV.6  p. 11). If this universal truth is a guiding principle of his Government  then the United States cannot continue to approbate and reprobate on this principle. The noble thing is for the United States to settle this long-outstanding judgement fairly and expeditiously. In another context  but voicing a similar principle  President Obama said the following a year ago: “[T]he principle of sovereignty is at the centre of our international order. But sovereignty cannot be ... an excuse for the international community to turn a blind eye” (A/68/PV.5  p. 16). President Obama was perfectly right. That is why I believe he will agree that sovereignty and power should not be a shield against the fulfilment of obligations independently assessed  or an excuse for not settling this very vexing issue.I am sure that President Obama would also agree that the international community cannot turn a blind eye to the blockade imposed on Cuba. Antigua and Barbuda supports the preservation of the sovereignty of every nation. We are very proud of our long-standing relationship with the Republic of Cuba. We therefore join with the international community and condemn any discriminatory and retaliatory policies and practices that serve to prevent Cuba from exercising its right to freely participate in the affairs of the hemisphere. My Government firmly believes that any application of unilateral and extraterritorial coercive laws and measures that conflict with international law and the principles of free navigation and international trade is wrong. We therefore urge our long-standing friend  the United States  to respect and take note of the numerous calls by the United Nations to immediately bring an end to the unjust economic  commercial and financial blockade imposed on our neighbour Cuba.My small country has no military might  no economic clout. All that we have is membership of the international system as our shield and our voice in this body as our sword. That is why we will continue to uphold the value of the United Nations vigorously  and why we will join the effort for its reform to make it the guardian of all nations and all peoples.I want to express my Government’s full agreement with the President’s decision to make the theme of this General Assembly debate  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda.” It is well known now that the Millennium Development Goals Gap Task Force has reported mixed progress in the achievement of key targets. Among the targets on which there has been insufficient acceleration has been official development assistance. I congratulate those countries that have reached the pledged target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income. However  the developed world is still not meeting the target of $315 billion. Indeed  it is not even reaching half that amount.My own country and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) region as a whole have witnessed a decline in bilateral assistance from larger and richer nations within our own hemisphere  and we have relied on non-traditional sources  such as the People’s Republic of China and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. In regard to energy  the high cost of which cripples our country  the Venezuelan Petrocaribe arrangement has been a lifebelt in a sea of turbulence. We are also grateful for the contributions of our other international partners  including the European Union. However  as we go forward  there is clearly a need for increased global engagement with respect to development assistance  including the presence at the table of recipients as well as donors.In addition — and as a most urgent matter — the international financial institutions must be urged to stop penalizing small Caribbean States on the basis of their flawed per capita income criterion. Our countries are denied access to concessional financing because we are classified as middle-income countries. This obdurate attitude of the international financial institutions in not devising better criteria for assessing the eligibility of our small economies for concessionary financing  forces us into the commercial lending market. The consequence of this is that our debt is rising and many of us are among the most highly indebted countries in the world on a per capita basis.But I ask  “What is the alternative?” Rhetorically  I ask again  “What is the alternative?” It is said that six years after the global economy collapsed  jobs are being created  global financial systems have stabilized and people are once again being lifted out of poverty. But I say here this afternoon that this is not a universal truth. In the case of small States in the Caribbean  the global economic crisis in 2008 in whose creation we played no part  sent our economies into a tailspin. We have yet to recover fully from its impact  and we will probably never recover the development ground that we lost. Incredibly  a significant number of our educated young people are unemployed. If we fail to satisfy their aspirations  we condemn them to a life on the margins of society at best  or a life of crime and violence at worst. No nation can opt for so devastating an alternative.There is now an urgent need for this United Nations body  through one of its appropriate organs  to address the large debt that CARICOM countries have accumulated owing to declining aid  poor terms of trade  the high cost of regulating financial services  and expenditure on curbing drug trafficking and stopping refugees.Those countries in the Caribbean  including my own  that are now increasing their debt are not doing so because of poor policies or because we are not focused on increased productivity and growth  nor are we doing so because of high expenditures on vanity projects or unsustainable ventures. We are doing so to build the socioeconomic infrastructure to facilitate revenue generation.The fact of the matter is that the global crisis that began in 2008 has set our economies back to pre-1974 levels. While we are tightening our belts  forging relations with the private sector and energetically seeking foreign direct investment in productive enterprises  we are scraping our way uphill  having been pushed downwards by a deluge of external factors.The United Nations cannot step back from those realities  and it would be wrong  as it has been wrong for some time  for this Organization to abdicate its responsibility for action to multilateral organizations whose membership is made up only of a few  however powerful they may be. Indeed  it is precisely because the members of those groups are powerful and because they reach into a network of economic and political decision-making bodies that can easily impose their will on the weak and vulnerable that the United Nations should not abandon its responsibilities to the weak  who depend on this Organization.I cannot leave this rostrum without addressing the war on terror and the issue of the dreaded Ebola disease. The threat of Ebola requires a global response  and we urge the international community to act collectively and swiftly in combatting what could become a global pandemic with grave socio-economic consequences for small States  especially our fragile  tourism-dependent countries in the Caribbean. Antigua and Barbuda commends the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for its pledge of $5 million towards Ebola eradication and the Republic of Cuba for sending 165 doctors. We call on the members of the international community to continue to contribute towards that effort.Antigua and Barbuda condemns the savage and cruel acts of the jihadists of the Islamic State  who have beheaded three civilians. On behalf of the Government and people of Antigua and Barbuda  I express our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims and to the people of the United States  France and the United Kingdom for those atrocities. There can be no justification for such barbaric behaviour. We cannot afford a world that slips back into the dark ages when violence  wars and barbarism were the stock-and-trade of religious intolerance and ethnic divisions.Yet  as we survey the global scene  there are deeply troubling instances of such behaviour in Europe  Africa and the Middle East. In all this  the role of the United Nations becomes critically important. What is required is not unilateral acts that will embroil specific nations in cycles of violent retaliation. What is required is a United Nations whose Member States  particularly those on the Security Council  act together to defend peace and security.After only 100 days in office  my Government has demonstrated its commitment to building an all-inclusive  all-empowering and egalitarian society by promoting the protection of women’s rights  gender equality and the rights of the disabled. We see those issues not only as human rights issues  but as essential components of sustainable development  peace  social justice and security. At our first session of Parliament  my Government ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. We have gone further and have appointed a distinguished son of the soil  who is visually challenged  to serve as our representative to the United Nations. We have also appointed a plethora of women to serve in the Upper House of Parliament as ambassadors and in other key positions within the public sector. It is my Government’s pledge to continue to work towards full gender equality and the advancement and empowerment of women.When the President of the General Assembly opened the Assembly’s sixty-ninth session  he remarked that “to say that we are living in tumultuous times would seem an understatement” (A/69/PV.1  p. 3). He noted that the entire world is facing challenges such as poverty  hunger  climate change and rising sea levels  persistent unemployment  armed conflicts and the Ebola virus epidemic. He called on this global body to tackle those challenges “with dedication  single-mindedness of purpose and compromise” and “a sense of resolve and resilience” (ibid.) He was right to do so.Crises are staring human civilization in the face  including climate change  the Ebola virus and the threat posed by the Islamic State. As a result  we all face a future where those challenges can only be dealt with through joint international action. The United Nations  the parliament of parliaments  is the place where such joint action is to be decided and implemented. We need to strengthen the United Nations capacity for such action  whether military or humanitarian. There is no substitute for the United Nations. Antigua and Barbuda pledges its continued support of and participation in the work of the United Nations."
"9",350,"AUS",69,2014,"In what can seem to be darkening times  I want to begin with a message of hope. Amid all our problems  the murderous rage of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in Syria and Iraq  Russian aggression in Ukraine  the spread of Ebola in West Africa and the stubborn sluggishness of many economies  let me start with a small but telling illustration of nations working together to serve our common humanity. Last March  at the height of the search for the missing Flight MH-70  I went to the Pearce airbase in Western Australia to thank all the aviators involved. There were personnel from Australia  New Zealand  Malaysia and the United States — countries that are accustomed to working together. There were also personnel from China  Japan and Korea — countries whose relations sometimes labour under the weight of historical grievances.On that occasion  however  the tragedy and a daunting challenge drew out the best in everyone. The Organization was founded on the principle that we should work together for the common good and that  over time  talking together and working together will improve our capacity for living together. Like any institution  the United Nations is an imperfect instrument. Still  it is better than “might is right”  and it gives good arguments the best chance to prevail.Despite faults and failures  the United Nations has worked for peace and progress for nearly 70 years. Australia has been proud to play its part  starting in 1946  when we held the first presidency of the Security Council and helped to draft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. At the heart of the Organization is the principle that we should act towards others as we would have them act towards us. For almost seven decades  Australia has believed in the potential of the United Nations and supported its work. Keeping commitments  valuing human life  protecting property and extending freedom are universal aspirations  not only Australian ones.Since 1947  we have provided more than 65 000 personnel to more than 50 multilateral peace and security operations. We are not a country accustomed to turning back  once we have put our hand to the plough. We have had Blue Beret personnel in the Middle East since 1956 and in Cyprus since 1964. When leadership is needed  we step up  as we did in Bougainville  in Timor-Leste and in Solomon Islands. In Korea  Cambodia  Kuwait and Afghanistan and in Somalia  Sierra Leone and other troubled places  Australians have lent a hand under the United Nations banner. We have only 21 personnel in South Sudan now but have conducted an airlift of equipment that has supported a much larger force.With just 24 million people  Australia is a relatively small country  but we have the world’s twelfth- largest economy  with global interests and with some global reach. We are strong enough to be useful but pragmatic enough to know our limits. Under successive Governments  for more than 100 years  Australia’s determination has been to advance our interests  to protect our citizens and to uphold our values. We have never believed that we can save the world single-handedly  nor have we shrunk from shouldering our responsibilities. After the 2004 East Asian tsunami  we committed $1 billion to Indonesia. We were one of the first countries to arrive with help in Japan after the 2011 earthquake and in the Philippines after the 2013 typhoon.To date  we have pledged $8 million towards combating the Ebola outbreak  and dozens of Australian health professionals are working with international agencies in the region. To us  this is all part of being a good global citizen. Last July  we were pleased to sponsor Security Council resolution 2166 (2014) and to work with the Dutch and the Malaysians to investigate the crash site and recover our dead  after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 was shot down by Russian-backed rebels over eastern Ukraine. We are grateful for the help that Ukraine gave us  and are naturally sympathetic to a country struggling to preserve its independence and territorial integrity against a bully. With the Dutch and the Malaysians  we will do everything we can to ensure that the investigation is not undermined  and that the crime is not covered up  because that is our duty to the 38 Australians murdered in this atrocity.Right now  an Australian force has been deployed to the Middle East  so that we can join a coalition seeking to disrupt and degrade the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant terrorist movement at the request of the Iraqi Government. One of our prime ministers once talked about our country’s great objective  “our light on the hill ” as he put it  namely  to work for the betterment of mankind  not just at home  but wherever we can lend a helping hand. To build a better world  we need to respond sensibly to the problems before us  whether through bodies such as the United Nations  or in coalitions with like-minded countries. We also need to work purposefully to create stronger and more resilient people and communities. A stronger economy will not solve every problem  but it will make almost every problem easier to tackle. Richer people are not necessarily better people  but the problems of plenty are invariably easier to deal with than those of want.As this year’s Chair of the Group of Twenty (G-20)  Australia is determined to promote private-sector-led growth: growth  because that is the best way to generate jobs and improve everyone’s quality of life; private-sector-led  because profitable  private businesses are the best source of real  sustainable wealth. Freer trade  more investment in infrastructure  a modern and fair international tax system  stronger global economic institutions and a more resilient financial sector are all parts of our G-20 agenda to strengthen the world economy.Rather than preaching  we are trying to lead by example. Australia has abolished the carbon tax and the mining tax  and we have provided environmental approvals for $800 billion worth of new projects. We have also begun the task of eliminating our budget deficit within four years. We have finalized a series of trade deals  because every time a country trades with another  wealth increases  and when wealth increases  countries grow stronger. Our G-20 goal is to boost output by an extra 2 per cent over the next five years to create millions of jobs and to generate trillions in wealth right around the world.Likewise  the post-2015 development agenda should also focus on economic growth  because growth makes every other social goal  even tackling climate change  easier to accomplish. To people who do not know where their next meal is coming from  talk of economic growth can seem ignorant or indulgent. But “economic growth” is really just economists’ shorthand for more jobs  higher pay  new industries and the better life that only greater wealth can provide. Economic growth might seem a mundane vision  but it allows millions more people to create their own vision of how their lives can be better.To anyone who doubts that stronger economic growth can be achieved  I say  “Look at the countries of East Asia”. In scarcely two generations  the rise of Asia has driven the greatest social and economic transformation in history. People live longer  they are better educated  wealthier and  yes  they enjoy a level of freedom and stability that their parents could only dream of. In Japan  Korea and now China  in India and increasingly in Indonesia  many hundreds of millions of people have been lifted from poverty to the middle class. Almost certainly  that is the greatest and fastest advance in human welfare of all time.While all Governments  Australia’s included  could always be better  smarter and more compassionate  no one should be blind to the great progress that has occurred. We live in the most remarkable age in human history. For all the work that remains to be done  we have seen more change for the better than at any other time.As the General Assembly session meets with such pressing issues before it  our challenge — as always — is to realize our best hopes and to be our best selves. Australians have two defining characteristics: we believe in a “fair go”  because innate decency demands that every person have a chance to contribute. We also believe in “having a go”  because rolling up your sleeves will always produce a better result than standing on the sidelines complaining. That readiness to make an effort for a good cause is why Australia feels so comfortable in this body and is so ready to contribute to its work. We should put no limits on what we can achieve  especially when we work together  trust people and are faithful to our deepest values.Every country counts. Every argument must be weighed. Every person has equal rights and dignity. Every person deserves respect. All people are entitled to make their own choices — provided they do not infringe on the rights of others. Those are the principles that this Organization embodies and on which the future of humanity rests."
"10",397,"AUT",69,2014,"It is with great respect that I stand at this rostrum for the first time as Austrian Foreign Minister. Many eminent world leaders have stood here before me and laid out their visions on international challenges and crises. As many may be able to tell  probably even from the last row  I look a bit younger than most of the speakers before me. Indeed  I believe I am the only person under the age of 30 who has the privilege of speaking here this week. So while I cannot speak from many years of experience  what I can offer is the perspective of a young generation.My generation is the post-Cold War generation. The Iron Curtain collapsed 25 years ago  when I was 3 years old. For us in Europe  the years after the collapse of the Iron Curtain were years filled with hope and new opportunities. We could travel freely  study in foreign countries and meet people from all over the world. We grew up in a society where human rights were respected  where the rule of law was a given  and where religious freedom was practised. We communicate without borders on Facebook and Twitter  we have our entire lives stored on our smartphone  and we consume the news online.While the world after the Cold War offered fascinating new opportunities  it also proved to be not orderly at all  but quite messy and more uncertain than many had predicted. Just two years after the Berlin Wall came down  war returned to Europe in the Western Balkan countries. Thankfully  the horrors came to an end  and these countries now have a clear European perspective. After the fall of the Iron Curtain  we believed that the world would move forward and that more and more people would benefit from the same opportunities that my generation in Western Europe enjoyed. But the world today seems to be shifting into reverse. We are facing situations and horrors we thought we had overcome many years ago. For young people like myself  who learned about the Cold War only through history books  it seems unbelievable that the thinking in terms of confrontational blocs could return to Europe.The crisis in Ukraine is probably the most serious challenge to peace and security Europe has had to face in decades. In retrospect  it is easy to claim that this development should have been predictable  and that we should have foreseen it. But let us be honest. Who would have predicted that  after three years of negotiations  President Yanukovych would refuse to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union? Who would have predicted that the Maidan movement would be strong enough to force him to leave the country? And who would have predicted that Russia would react by annexing Crimea and would even actively support separatist movements?We cannot accept that international law should be violated and that recognized borders challenged in Europe once again. At the same time  we need to find a political solution that goes beyond a mere ceasefire. We need a solution that offers the prospect of a free  stable and united Ukraine  a Ukraine which enjoys strong economic ties with both the European Union and the Russian Federation. Let us not return to Cold War thinking  where two blocs face each other. Our political guideline must be to move from a policy of “either Europe or Russia” to a logic of “both Europe and Russia”.Some people have claimed that Ukraine would not be in this situation had it not given up its nuclear weapons. This kind of thinking is dangerous. And we have to ask ourselves  where would this lead us? As long as nuclear weapons exist  the risk of their use  on purpose or by accident  remains real. Let us be clear: the use of nuclear weapons  more than any other human action  has the potential to end life on this planet. And  69 years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki  let us not forget that the humanitarian consequences of a single nuclear explosion are terrifying and long-lasting. The desire to prevent the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons should unite us all. We therefore hope that the Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons in Vienna in December will mark a real change of direction in international discussions on nuclear weapons.Looking beyond our region  we are currently witnessing a further rise of extremism in the name of religion  and a new development — foreign terrorist fighters who come from Western countries and travel to the Middle East in order to join the fight. There is no time to lose; we must actively address what is happening in northern Iraq  where the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is attempting to wipe out entire religious communities  where children are being beheaded  mothers raped and fathers hanged because of their beliefs.In Europe  we estimate that there are thousands of foreign fighters with European passports. In our case  there are more than 140 people from Austria fighting in the name of a so-called holy war. We all know that the terrorist organizations operate worldwide. They get their terrorist fighters by recruiting globally. They finance themselves through global networks. They buy arms and other resources on a global scale. And they use  or rather abuse  the global communication networks to their benefit.How is it possible that terrorist organizations have access to financial and economic resources that allow them to operate so effectively? How is it possible that we allow terrorist organizations to abuse the right to freedom of expression by showing their barbaric acts on social media? And how is it possible that they are able to recruit new fighters within our societies?We all  Governments and the private sector as well  have a duty to develop preventive measures within our societies to stop the flow of foreign terrorist fighters  to cut off financial support to their organizations and to put an end to the abuse of social media networks by developing forms of voluntary self-restriction for those networks. The adoption of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) this week was an important first step  but now we must implement it. And we should always remind ourselves that the battle lines in this confrontation are not limited to Iraq or Syria. They run through our own Western societies.My generation in Austria was privileged to grow up in freedom from fear and from want. There are  of course  other stories to be told of young people growing up in Afghanistan or the Central African Republic  for example. Today half of the world’s population is under 25 years of age  and many of them lack adequate nutrition  health care  education and jobs. All in all  those are not great prospects for life. The work of the United Nations on development is therefore crucial to lifting millions of people out of poverty  helping the hungry and the sick and educating new generations around the world. The United Nations needs and deserves our support  and I can assure the Assembly that Austria fully stands behind the post-2015 development agenda.But we must also ensure that respect for human rights and the rule of law receive proper attention. Only a society that respects the rights of its citizens can enable each individual to develop his or her potential. We are therefore very pleased to be organizing the Second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries  to be held in Vienna in November. And we are honoured that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has agreed to attend the Conference.I am aware that the list of challenges that the international community and the United Nations are facing is long: the situations in Iraq  Ukraine  Syria  Gaza  the Central African Republic and Mali and the outbreak of the Ebola disease  to name just a few. In view of those challenges  the United Nations needs and deserves our full support. I want to especially thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts at the helm of the United Nations. I can assure him that Austria remains committed to working actively within the United Nations and its bodies to support his work and to address our global challenges  whether as peacekeepers  through our presidency of the Economic and Social Council or as a member of the Human Rights Council. We are particularly proud to host the United Nations Office at Vienna  which has become an Austrian landmark. Austria has a long tradition of building bridges and serving as a place for international dialogue. We will continue to do so in the future and to offer our contribution to making the world a little bit safer and better for the generations to come."
"11",422,"AZE",69,2014,"At the outset  I would like to congratulate my good friend Mr. Sam Kutesa on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I wish him every success in fulfilling that highly responsible duty. We are also grateful to Mr. John Ashe for all his hard work in presiding over the sixty-eighth session.Azerbaijan reaffirms its commitment to the implementation of the global sustainable development agenda and to reaching an agreement on the post-2015 development agenda. My country’s record in attaining the Millennium Development Goals is truly unique. Over the past 10 years  the gross domestic product of Azerbaijan has increased by 3.4 times. Now the economy of Azerbaijan accounts for more than 80 per cent of that of the South Caucasus.The unrivalled high rate of economic growth has been achieved thanks to the prudent use of available resources and the rapid transition to a socially oriented market economy. The poverty rate was reduced from 49 per cent in 2004 to 5.3 per cent in 2014. Over the same period  the unemployment rate has decreased from 10.6 per cent to 5 per cent. The Government has been implementing large-scale programmes on improving good governance  strengthening the rule of law  ensuring respect for human rights and providing facilitated access to public services. Such programmes also cover inclusive and equitable education  gender equality  the empowerment of women  better access to affordable energy and the protection of the environment.The rapid development at the national level has enabled Azerbaijan to embark on a new road of official development assistance as an emerging donor. Over the past years  Azerbaijan has continued to respond to the humanitarian and socioeconomic challenges faced by developing countries through the Azerbaijan International Development Agency and other channels. The commitment to contributing to international development is widely shared with our people. The leading non-governmental organization in Azerbaijan  the Heydar Aliyev Foundation  has implemented numerous social  humanitarian and development projects in a number of countries.Azerbaijan has established itself as a reliable supplier of energy in the global market. Just recently  a groundbreaking ceremony to launch the southern gas corridor was held in Azerbaijan. That $50 billion project  which envisages the construction of pipeline systems such as the trans-Anatolian and the trans-Adriatic pipelines  will enable Europe to obtain gas supplies from a completely new resource base in Azerbaijan. The Trans-Eurasian Information Superhighway project  which was initiated by Azerbaijan  will provide the countries of the region with information technology services  thereby facilitating access to the Internet  telecommunications systems and electronic information resources for 20 countries throughout the region. Acknowledging the value of transport as an important mechanism for sustainable development  Azerbaijan has successfully launched several regional infrastructure projects. The Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway is an important link that connects Europe and Asia.Against the background of the various threats and challenges facing the world nowadays  it is critical to persistently stress the importance of promoting key values of different cultures  enhancing better understanding among diverse communities and encouraging mutual respect. Located between the two great continents of Asia and Europe  Azerbaijan is a unique place  where the East and the West meet  where the world’s main religions peacefully coexist and where the values and traditions of different cultures harmoniously complement each other. It is not a coincidence that in recent years  Azerbaijan has hosted numerous international events aimed at promoting the dialogue among civilizations and enhancing understanding among different religions  faiths and cultures.Violence and fragility remain the greatest obstacles to development. The world community still faces serious breaches of the fundamental norms and principles of international law. Peoples throughout the world continue to suffer from devastating wars  aggression  military occupation and ethnic cleansing. For more than 20 years  Armenia has used force against the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Azerbaijan. It has occupied approximately 20 per cent of the territories of Azerbaijan and conducted ethnic cleansing against almost 1 million Azerbaijanis  as a result of which no single Azerbaijani is left in Armenia or in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. No single Azerbaijani historical or cultural monument has escaped destruction in the occupied territories or in Armenia.In 1993  the Security Council adopted four resolutions that reaffirm the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and the inadmissibility of the use of force for the acquisition of territory. Resolutions 822 (1993)  853 (1993)  874 (1993) and 884 (1993) demand the immediate  complete and unconditional withdrawal of the Armenian occupying forces from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan. Furthermore  the General Assembly  the Non-Aligned Movement  the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and numerous other regional organizations adopted various decisions in support of the sovereignty  political independence and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and demanded the settlement of the conflict on the basis of those principles.Unfortunately  Armenia disregards all of those resolutions and the generally accepted norms and principles of international law and continues its military occupation of Azerbaijani lands. Armenia regularly violates the ceasefire and deliberately attacks Azerbaijani civilians  which results in the killing and wounding of inhabitants residing near the front line. Just recently  several Azerbaijani civilians who were visiting the tombs of their relatives in the occupied territories were taken hostage and tortured. Some of them were even killed by Armenian forces. It is therefore critical that the international community play a more proactive role in ending impunity for the crimes committed against the civilian population of Azerbaijan. Combating impunity is important in order to ensure sustainable peace and reconciliation.Two days ago  the President of Armenia delivered a statement here during the general debate and tried to mislead the General Assembly by distorting the facts and the situation with regard to the peace process  misinterpreting the norms and principles of international law and the relevant documents adopted within that framework (see A/69/PV.6). The President of Armenia misuses the noble principle of self-determination to cover up his country’s attempts to annex territories of the neighbouring State  Azerbaijan  through the use of force. The situation  which he tries to present as the self-determination of the Armenians living in Azerbaijan  has nothing in common with the principle of self-determination contained in the Charter of the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act. In fact  the principle of self-determination requires the return of the displaced Azerbaijanis to the Nagorny Karabakh region  where they will live together with the Armenian community in peace  dignity and prosperity within Azerbaijan. We believe in achieving that goal by political means.Azerbaijan stands for a negotiated settlement of the conflict without prejudice to its rights under the Charter of the United Nations  in particular those set forth in Article 51. The Government of Armenia must realize that the military occupation of the territory of another State does not represent a solution and that its reliance on the status quo is a grave miscalculation. Azerbaijan will never allow its territorial integrity  or the rights and freedoms of its citizens that have been violated as a result of aggression  to be compromised.The international community’s unequivocal and consistent support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Azerbaijan has been a crucial factor. It makes clear to Armenia that the current status quo  which was achieved as a result of aggression  will never be accepted. I would like to thank Member States for upholding the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations by supporting the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan. The international community does not  and will not  accept attempts to change internationally recognized borders through the use of force. Nor should the world accept double standards. To do so would take us back to the dark chapters of the past century. In that regard  the time is ripe to bring to justice those in Armenia who perpetrated acts of aggression against Azerbaijan and crimes against humanity and to impose sanctions on them."
"12",468,"BDI",69,2014,"On behalf of His Excellency Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza  President of Burundi  and the people of Burundi as a whole  I would first like to offer warm congratulations to you  Sam Kutesa  a son of Africa  for your election by acclamation on 11 June as President of the General Assembly at its current session. I would also like to acknowledge the remarkable work of His Excellency Mr. John Ashe  who presided over the Assembly at its sixty-eighth session  which he closed in this newly renovated Hall. And I take this opportunity to reiterate our gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his untiring efforts to improve the functioning of the Organization and for the results attained in a particularly difficult socioeconomic context.At this important moment  when delegations from many different parts of the globe have come together  we would like to express our appreciation for the theme of the sixty-ninth session  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”. It comes at just the right time  since we are slowly but surely and inexorably approaching the deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).Beyond that  I would also like to welcome the priorities that you have already set  Mr. President  which focus on eradicating poverty and hunger and promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth. As the authors of the report of the high-level group established to make recommendations on the post-2015 development programme put it  the theme chosen and your priorities are simultaneously ambitious and pragmatic. The report cites intense discussions in every region and in many sectors  especially on those living in poverty. The same team fosters the hope that our generation will be able to produce the transformations needed to end the poverty that is devastating people all over our planet.We should therefore emphasize that however ambitious the group’s recommendations may be  they should also take into account the realities on the ground and the fact that the transformative changes linked to the goals and indicative targets — those coming out of discussions with 5 000 civil society organizations  250 leaders of major businesses and the scientific and academic communities  along with national  regional and international consultations — can contribute to reducing hunger and poverty around the world by generating tangible economic growth that can be equitably shared in order to achieve the well-being we seek.The Millennium Development Goals were a pact of global socioeconomic solidarity for our countries. Like other nations in Africa and elsewhere  Burundi has great respect for those Goals. As the aforementioned group has rightly pointed out  the fastest reduction in poverty in the history of the world occurred during the first 13 years of the new millennium. The same group notes that the number of people living on $1.25 a day has fallen  and child mortality has declined by 30 per cent since the 2000 Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2)  while deaths attributable to malaria have been reduced by one quarter.While we should note that not every country can boast the same progress  Burundi shares the belief that it would be wrong for us to abandon the MDGs and start over at zero. On the contrary  we should continue the reforms that have produced the unprecedented progress  which is unquestionably the result of improved policies and commitment on a global scale aimed at meeting the Millennium Development Goals. We should therefore capitalize on them in order to profit further. We also subscribe to the other declared priorities  including the adoption of a post-2015 development agenda  the strengthening of cooperation and reforming the United Nations  as well as strengthening partnerships between the United Nations and other bodies.Although at the moment it seems clear that Burundi will not be able to fully meet the established Goals  I should point out that we have made undeniable progress in the areas of education and health  thanks in particular to our programmes of free education and medical care for children under five and new mothers. Besides the 3 000 classrooms and many health centres built over the past few years  we have seen positive results in other sectors  too.In the area of education  many young Burundians  including girls  who had no access to schooling in the past are now attending school. In the area of health care  we have reduced child and maternal mortality  and we are working on stabilizing the prevalence of HIV/AIDS and meeting the eligibility requirements for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria. We delivered accounts of those efforts at the Assembly’s sixty-eighth session  as well as of the reduction of deaths due to malaria.On the political front  as we indicated in our address to the Assembly at the sixty-eighth session  Burundi has been working on the process we committed to months ago for holding presidential and general elections  scheduled to begin in May 2015. In that regard  it is important to note that after the holding of successive elections in 2005 and 2010  with support from the United Nations and other partners  the entire political class  through the leaders of the authorized political parties and other parties  agreed in March 2013 on a road map for the next elections.In that regard  one must add that  thanks to that extremely valuable instrument  which should help the Burundian political parties in the holding of transparent  free and democratic elections  the Burundian Parliament adopted the electoral code by consensus. Subsequently  the Head of State promulgated it  as prescribed by our Constitution  which is the fruit of the Arusha Agreement of 2000  to which Burundi attaches great importance. Moreover  the electoral calendar was announced last June by the Independent National Electoral Commission  itself established after consultations and agreement among the political parties involved in the matter.We can therefore say that things are moving and progressing well in my country. I also wish to reaffirm loud and clear what the Head of State  His Excellency Pierre Nkurunziza  often reiterates  that the 2015 elections will be held in better conditions than previous elections and that success will be complete. The Burundian people have suffered so much from the violence that has plunged many families into mourning that we cannot afford to relapse into the errors of the past. Indeed  we made the firm commitment to bury the hatchet once and for all. That is why we have made our own the words of former Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi: “I object to violence because when it appears to do good  the good is only temporary; the evil it does is permanent”.With regard to good governance  my delegation would like to return to the institutions established during the current legislature session. The tools for improving good governance include the National Independent Human Rights Commmission and the institution of the Ombudsman  whose performance is deemed satisfactory by many of our compatriots. A national strategy on good governance and on the fight against poverty for 2011-2015 has been adopted and is being implemented.Of course  we are far from achieving the expected results  but in Burundi and elsewhere it is a long-term undertaking. What is important is that there is the political will to always move forward and meet the challenge of zero tolerance in this area eventually. In addition  performance contracts have been signed by members of the Government and by the senior Government officials in order to improve the functioning of our Administration. The establishment of the Burundi Revenue Authority has improved State revenues and reduced corruption  which was also once a common practice in our tax administration and business circles. Here too  one must point out that perfection is not yet at hand  but there is the determination and the will to resolve the scourge of corruption for good.As for the Truth and Recon.iliation Commission envisaged by the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Accord  the relevant law has already been passed by Parliament. Consultations are under way to elect its 11 commissioners  on the understanding that the filing of nominations was closed in July 2014  and an ad hoc committee for the selection of candidates has just been set up by general consensus.Concerning the participation of women in political life  we have strengthened the number of women in the country’s institutions  even going beyond the constitutional provisions in that area. The Burundian delegation provided the figures in its statement last year.With respect to the peacebuilding programme in Burundi  the coordination mechanisms  such as the coordination group of partners  hold their meetings through appropriate structures  such as clusters  strategic forums and policy forums. The same is true for the coordination of assistance  for which Burundi adopted the same structures.The mandate of the United Nations Office in Burundi will end on 31 December  and the Office will transfer its responsibilities to a United Nations country team in Burundi  preparations for which are in full swing. A joint transition programme was presented to the appropriate body on 14 May in the United Nations Office. Also  a joint steering committee and a technical transition team were established and are functioning according to their mandate.Finally  also in the context of peace consolidation  a third phase of that programme  coverning the period 2014 to 2016  will soon become operational. The themes of the programme have already been adopted by the relevant authorities.On the economic front  Burundi has held two sectoral conferences on priority areas  one in July 2013 and the other in October. Their purpose was to decide  together with bilateral partners  on ways and means to implement the commitments made by each at the conference of Burundi’s development partners held in Geneva in October 2012. The areas deemed priorities were drawn from two strategic instruments: the Burundi Vision 2025 and the Strategic Framework for Growth and the Fight against Corruption  Second Generation.The first instrument is for long-term development planning and projects Burundi’s image in 2025. It should guide policies and strategies for sustainable development from the perspective of meeting the needs of present generations without hampering or compromising future generations. The second instrument — the Strategic Framework for Growth and the Fight against Poverty  Second Generation — is anchored in Vision 2025. It is the unifying framework for all sectoral and multisectoral policies  breaking the strategic pillars of the Vision Burundi 2025 down into projects and programmes.The results obtained in the economic sphere are rather mixed. That is why the Government would again like to make an urgent appeal from this rostrum to the partners represented here that they honour the commitments made at the Geneva conference of 2012.Regarding Burundi’s post-2015 development programme  the following areas have been identified. They are: governance  inequalities  conflicts and fragility; economic growth and employment; energy  water and environmental sustainability; access to basic social services; and population dynamics and food security. That agenda was the result of an extensive national consultation that included all segments of the population. On its face  it can be seen to be a programme rooted in the continuity of change  well grounded in the transformative development of the lives of our people and consistent with the theme for this session of the Assembly.Even if regional integration does not seem to be explicitly laid out in the programme  I would like to convey to all present that regional integration is a matter to which Burundi is firmly committed and which it considers to be a common thread linking the various policy areas  with the potential to provide appropriate responses to the challenges that our country faces.At the international level  conflicts continue to tear a number of countries apart and to undermine development efforts in many others. We must mobilize our energies and work in synergy to end and eliminate such threats as terrorism  transnational organized crime  drug trafficking  human trafficking and others. In that regard  Burundi is striving  as much as possible  to do its part to help maintain peace and security in the world.Burundi was one of two countries in Africa and the world that decided to intervene in Somalia as part of the African Union Mission in 2008  and we continue to strive to contribute to the stabilization of that country to this day. In that regard  Burundi is proud of the progress made towards normalization in Somali  which promises a better future for Somalia. However  the success achieved should not obscure the enormous challenges still facing Somalia. Burundi is committed to working with the other partners to address them.Burundi has also participated in peacekeeping operations in other countries  including the Central African Republic  Côte d’Ivoire  Haiti  the Sudan and Syria  to name but a few.With regard to Mali  we are greatly satisfied that territorial integrity has been restored in that country and that the presidential elections held there were a success.Regarding the conflict in the Middle East  Burundi  like other members of the international community  is deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation in the region observed in recent weeks. That is why we urge all parties to stop armed attacks  to avoid the loss of human life and to seek negotiated settlements to their disputes.Finally  with regard to the Ebola crisis  we  like other African countries  are very concerned about the rapid spread of the Ebola virus  as was vividly described by many representatives during the Security Council meeting of 18 September (see S/PV.7268). We congratulate the Council on its adoption on 18 September of resolution 2177 (2014) on the Ebola crisis  at the initiative of the United States of America. My delegation is proud to have sponsored the resolution  along with 134 other States  early in its development.With regard to South Sudan  we urgently call on all parties to the conflict to break the cycle of violence and resolve their differences through political dialogue. In that connection  we are pleased to announce that Burundi has promised an infantry battalion of 850 men to help that young State to restore peace and security.I also wish to inform the Assembly that Burundi has made progress regarding the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in general and in the areas of education and health in particular. However  despite my country’s efforts to accelerate actions to honour the commitments made at the Millennium Summit in 2000  the international economic climate  and that in Burundi in particular  has not been favourable for their attainment. The Government of Burundi remains committed  however  to the development goals programme and will continue to work beyond 2015 to redouble its efforts to safeguard and strengthen the principles and values contained in the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2)  which is a solid foundation for the post-2015 development programme."
"13",515,"BEL",69,2014,"Myriam Riva  Emmanuel Riva  Dominique Sabrier  Alexandre Strens — these are the names of the four people brutally murdered on 24 May in Brussels. Four people were killed just because they were in a Jewish museum  an institution dedicated to culture  knowledge and intelligence. I named these four victims  but I do not forget the thousands of anonymous victims of barbarism around the world. For the abject act that took place at the Jewish Museum in Brussels is connected to the events sweeping the world right now. In Syria and Iraq  as well as in countries like Algeria  terrorists kill innocent people every day.Syria and Iraq are of special concern to us. There  defenceless people  women and children are victims of massacres  persecution  destruction and the theft of all their possessions — all because they belong to cultures  including the Muslim culture  that the terrorists do not agree with. Yet  no religion  and certainly not Islam  asserts that we must kill those who think differently. We have to say this over and over again in order to remove any excuse for these criminals who sow terror.The personal history of the alleged perpetrator of the attack against the Jewish Museum in Brussels resonates with all of us. It is that of a French jihadist who visited Syria in the ranks of the so-called Islamic State. This jihadist then moved across Europe before committing the irreparable. It is common trajectory for many of these foreign fighters. These foreign fighters are a threat to every country in the world. Security Council resolution 2178 (2014)  adopted the day before yesterday  is an important step towards a coordinated global response. We must and we shall put these terrorists in a position where they can no longer inflict harm.Beyond the humanitarian support it has already brought to the Iraqi people  Belgium recently decided to send six F-16 fighters in support of the fight against terrorism in Iraq. My country also wants to strengthen cooperation among States. Belgium wants to intensify the exchange of information at the European level and within NATO. As required by the Security Council resolution  a major preventive effort must also be made to prevent jihadist aspirants from reaching the combat zones. We must prevent the recruitment  training and transportation of our citizens who may be tempted to join terrorist groups. For minors in particular  each country must demonstrate a total vigilance regarding border control.The battle we are waging against terrorism reflects a conflict between two understandings of life: respect for human beings  which we have and the terrorists do not; defence of freedom everywhere and always  which the terrorists do not want; tolerance  while the terrorists preach and impose intolerance. For us  life is priceless; for them  it has no value.We know that military actions alone are not enough. Here  as there  what is needed is to focus on education  educational support  openness to others and the world. Our goal should be to deradicalize violent radicals. I cannot help but think that the human disaster we are witnessing is also the result of a crushing defeat — that of politicians who favoured military solutions and the notorious so-called preventive war.A few years ago  Belgium refused to participate in such an operation in Iraq. How can we not see that frustration and humiliation have further strengthened radicalism? Things being what they are  we must now deal with the emergency  and act  including militarily. But we must also consider the future and invest sustainably in civil action. Everywhere  the establishment of a State that protects its citizens must be the priority. Strengthening the rule of law and improving living conditions is the best crisis prevention. Such responses are also much less expensive than the day-to-day management of uprisings and violence. In many crises today  we see the States concerned in a position of great weakness or even virtual failure.The appointment of a new Prime Minister in Iraq sends the right signal of inclusion and tolerance. Let me mention other illustrations of this principle. With regard to the Middle East  this summer we watched in despair the launching of rockets in Israel and the massive bombing of Gaza. More than 2 100 Palestinian and 67 Israeli lives were lost in combat. War is not a solution. There is no other way to achieve peace — one based on two States coexisting in security — except by returning to negotiations. The status quo is obviously not an option. We must put the settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict back at the top of the international agenda. That settlement will also constitute an important factor in the stabilization and peace of the entire region and the world. Therefore  we welcome the efforts of President Obama in that regard  and we hope that he will continue up to the last day of his mandate to work in that direction.The Arab Spring is another example of what I am talking about. It was a legitimate revolution and it speaks to true aspirations for democracy and prosperity. We must note that in some countries  chaos and terror have long reigned over democracy  while in others we are witnessing a return to State totalitarianism. In that regard  the international community must do everything possible to encourage democracy peace and prosperity.With regard to Africa  with which Belgium shares a long common history  it is in constant forward motion and far removed from common clichés. We must strongly support its economic  educational and political development. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo  in particular in the east of the country  putting armed groups where they can no longer do harm is an urgent necessity. In Sahel  Mali and the Central African Republic  the fight against religious extremism is where our priorities should lie. We must also mobilize to support populations in Africa that are dealing with the horrific Ebola epidemic.On the fringes of Europe  we are seeing a broad destabilization. Internationally recognized borders are being violated  and Ukraine is facing a major challenge to be inclusive and representative for both the minorities and the majority of the population in Ukraine.With regard to Flight MH-17  in which six Belgian citizens died  the currently known facts are incriminating and we eagerly await the final report of the independent experts  who must have free access to the site and responses to all of their requests.We will have peace only if tolerance triumphs over barbarism. And we must act together. Therefore  I welcome the American initiative to launch a process of reflection on the role of the United Nations in peacekeeping. The role of the United Nations in the prevention and settlement of conflicts is irreplaceable. It is the only place where the representatives of the entire world can talk to each other. To be sure  the functioning of the Organization should evolve and recognize that the right to veto has sometimes been used to prevent action from being taken. I am open to the consideration that has begun in that regard. However  the common house that is the United Nations should be preserved at any price and encouraged to act. That is why I would like to thank our Secretary-General for his unwavering efforts to further improve its functioning.Our world continues to present us with insufferable contrasts. Too many human beings are today living in extreme poverty. They do not have safe access to water or basic health services and they suffer from malnutrition. Who can believe that people will resign themselves to such a situation and that there will not be yet another scandal if they do? The international community — the Group of Seven and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — are beginning to deal with tax evasion. That is extremely important  as is the fight against corruption. There will not be great human progress without a moralization of finance at the global level. Our responsibility in that regard is huge.Too many women and men do not have access to a job or to housing  only because they are of foreign origin. Too many women are subject to moral or physical violence only because they are women. Too many people — lesbians  homosexuals  bisexuals and transgender people — are persecuted and rejected only because they are different or they love differently. It is also our responsibility to denounce and combat all together and systematically those injustices and attacks on human rights.As a crossroads of many cultures  Belgium has always been one of the most open countries in the world. It has a high standard of living. And although I think they are still too great  the inequalities there are the smallest in Europe. That is largely due to the civil support  which is organized by the Belgian State. In particular  our health system is exceptional and is accessible to everyone. Moreover  Belgium is a multicultural country both through its demography and its abundant and diverse migration. In our country  the respect for the other and the culture of compromise are part of our cultural heritage.Belgium  like the European Union  is moving on a path of solidarity with peoples who are encountering difficulties. We want to help them to achieve their legitimate aspirations for a more just world. We must also remain vigilant so that we do not fall into the trap of social regression and increasing inequalities. All the ethical progress that we have achieved is precious and must be preserved.I will conclude by saying that human fraternity is not a utopia. It is what has often allowed us to make great progress. We must go beyond borders to form new types of cooperation  reduce inequalities and bring about new hope. The most powerful obstacle to war and violence is human fraternity. It is that fraternity that will enable us tomorrow to better share the planet’s resources  to offer a future to each and every child and to make sure that peace reigns everywhere and for everyone. Members of the Assembly may rest assured that my country will continue to do everything it can to bring peoples together. We believe in sharing and solidarity  and we thus find it entirely natural to continue to support Member States in their many struggles for peace and justice."
"14",560,"BEN",69,2014,"The President of the Republic of Benin  His Excellency Mr. Thomas Boni Yayi  has asked me to deliver this message to the Assembly on his behalf.At the outset  I would like to congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We pay tribute to the country of Uganda for its leadership. I would also like to congratulate the outgoing President of the General Assembly  His Excellency Mr. John Ashe  whose enthusiasm enabled consensus to be reached on important issues considered during the Assembly’s sixty-eighth session. Without a doubt  he successfully fulfilled his mandate  laying the groundwork for the post-2015 development agenda  in particular with the successful conclusion of the work of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. My gratitude also goes to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his continuing efforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations as an effective force for stability  peace  collective security and the promotion of human dignity and sustainable development. I would like to express to him my firm support for his initiatives aimed at easing tensions and settling conflict situations in order to pave the way to building a world that is more just  based on equality  justice  respect for human rights and solidarity among peoples  and to curb climate change.The theme of the current session  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  is of prime importance for the least developed countries (LDCs)  a group for which Benin serves as Chair through September 2015. It clearly describes the major work to be done and on which we should focus our energies throughout the Assembly’s sixty-ninth session in order to forge consensus around actions to be taken to make “The future we want” a reality. In that regard  the post-2015 development agenda must take into account the lessons learned and experiences acquired throughout the 15 years we have just gone through in the implementation phase of the Millennium Development Goals. Efforts must therefore be pursued to eliminate extreme poverty  promote more equal and inclusive economic growth  establish transparent and responsible institutions that are able to stimulate the process of sustainable development  bring about the professionalization of young people  and create decent jobs for the long term through the implementation of integrated social protection schemes that cover all forms of vulnerability. Once adopted  the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda should receive stepped up attention and energy so that no one will be left behind. The High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda have sent the Secretary-General their recommendations on the programme.The third International Conference on Financing for Development should be prepared with an open mind towards innovation. In that regard  it is important to create strategies and find the means to implement them in order to accelerate structural transformations in the least developed countries so as to reduce the gap that separates them from developed countries  notably with regard to access to the benefits of modernity  and in order to meet basic needs  which should now be seen as a fundamental right to be guaranteed to all human beings. It is necessary to put an end to exclusion in all its forms and at all levels and to integrate all countries affected by marginalization into the global economic growth by re-establishing the balance that has been disrupted among the three dimensions of sustainable development  namely  economic efficiency  social stability and environmental preservation.I would like to recall that the Istanbul Action Programme set as a major goal halving the number of LDCs by 2020. The Programme made the productive capacity-building of LDCs one of its foremost priorities in order to achieve that goal. With a view to mobilizing the international community to implement that effective programme  in its capacity as Chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of the Group of Least Developed Countries  Benin took the initiative to organize the Ministerial Conference on New Partnerships for Productive Capacity-Building in LDCs  held in Cotonou from 28 to 31 July.In its resolution 68/224  of 20 December 2013  the General Assembly expressed its expectations with regard to the outcomes of the Ministerial Conference. Today  I can report those outcomes to the Assembly. The Ministerial Conference adopted the Cotonou Agenda for productive capacity-building in LDCs. It advocated innovative approaches in that area through specific recommendations both for LDCs and for their development partners. It also requested that the General Assembly include on its agenda for the sixty-ninth session the issue of productive capacity-building in LDCs.On behalf of the Government and people of Benin  I would like to thank our partners  in particular  Turkey  Germany  the Netherlands  Norway  Spain and Italy  for their contribution to the success of that Conference  which is of historic importance to LCDs  since it affects a crucial aspect of their development and of their integration into the world economy. I would also like to thank Belgium  co-Chair of the Group of Friends of LDCs  and the European Union  which assisted in implementing the initiative. The Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries  Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States  the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation  the United Nations specialized agencies  funds and programmes  civil society and the private sector provided valuable technical support for the knowledgeable preparation of the Ministerial Conference. The Cotonou Agenda for productive capacity-building in LDCs will clearly be a road map for promoting the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action.In 2015  we will undertake a comprehensive review of the major efforts undertaken and the results achieved in all areas targeted by the Millennium Development Goals. The most recent performance assessments put Benin  my country  among the leading 20 countries for the greatest progress made in absolute terms of the proportion of their population that has emerged from poverty. Benin  my country  is singled out by the introduction of free kindergaren and primary education and the provision of facilities at the secondary and higher education levels for pupils and students in need  thereby allowing a significant increase in school enrolment  in particular among girls.In the area of health  the actions of my Government have improved the management and provision of services for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV/AIDS transmission  nutrition  water supply  hygiene and sanitation. On the basis of the established health-care infrastructure network  the Government was able to launch a universal health insurance plan  which provides a level of social protection to people at an affordable cost. The provision by the State of Caesarean operations  as well as free health care to children under 5 years of age  have also been life-saving measures for thousands of Beninese families. Also  efforts have been made by the Government of Benin to alleviate poverty by providing substantial support to microcredit institutions. That has had a significant impact on improving the living conditions of many rural populations.The willingness of development partners to support Benin in its vision for long-term development and in underpinning the progress made in the areas of policy and administrative governance  the management of social justice and the economic governance was strengthened by the very encouraging results of the round table on Financing for Development in Benin  held in Paris from 17 to 19 June  with funding commitments to the tune of approximately $12 billion over a period of five years.The facts demonstrate every day that peace  security  good governance at the national and the international levels and the flawless exercise of sovereign functions by States are the best guarantees for international peace  security and stability. In that regard  it is urgent to strengthen the effectiveness of the United Nations with regard to efforts to ensure better conflict prevention and to combat injustice and the various forms of criminality rampant in the world. In that connection  with regard to Africa  in general  and the Sahel region  in particular  it is necessary to improve the United Nations support mechanism in order to prevent further conflict and to promote the necessary stability for the development of the States of the region.There is a crucial need to address the root causes of conflicts  which  at the global level  are used as a pretext for extremism and terrorist organizations. I would like to welcome the mobilization of the international community and the steadfastness of the United Nations in response to the actions of those armed groups. Thanks to the effectiveness of the actions undertaken  the main theatres of conflict in Africa are seeing an easing of tension. Benin will continue to provide its modest but quality contribution to United Nations peacekeeping in that regard.Coastal African States  in particular those in the Gulf of Guinea  also face piracy and armed robbery at sea  as well as transnational organized crime. That greatly hampers their economic growth. The steps taken to address such criminality have clearly produced encouraging results. However  we need to further strengthen those steps through the ongoing vigilance and greater support of the international community in order to rapidly implement the measures adopted on the basis of the outcome of the ministerial meeting held in Cotonou on 18 and 19 March 2013 and the summit held in Yaoundé on 24 and 25 June 2013 with regard to the implementation of Security Council resolutions 2018 (2011) and 2039 (2012).Moreover  the tranquillity of West African nations has been shaken for some months by the outbreak of the Ebola virus  whose rapid spread has already caused more than 3 000 deaths  half the number of those infected. The scale of the phenomenon requires the deployment of a coordinated health mechanism throughout the countries of the region in order to contain it.From this rostrum  I commend the diligence shown by the Secretary-General and by the World Health Organization in leading the international community to take measures commensurate with the challenge to humankind and to establish a series of emergency measures to counter and to contain that global threat beyond the affected States. The crisis underscores the need to promote human security and  in particular  health security in order to increase the resilience of populations.The state of the world is undoubtedly taking a very worrying turn. Humankind is at a crossroads. It is more necessary than ever that the United Nations affirm its leadership so as to reverse the alarming trends. In that regard  it is urgent to find a negotiated solution to the situation in the Middle East  which has continued for too long. Maintaining the status quo is untenable in all respects. The recognition of Palestine as a sovereign State and a full Member of the United Nations  living in harmony with Israel  cannot be delayed any longer. Such recognition will clearly facilitate the momentum for reducing tensions in the Middle East and establish favourable conditions for a just and lasting settlement of the other conflicts and complex problems afflicting that region.Benin deplores the escalation of violence in Ukraine and the radicalization of the parties to the conflict  which is leading to increase in the loss of human lives and the damage suffered by the affected civilian populations. I would also urge the United Nations to work towards the settlement of that conflict in the higher interest of international peace and security.In addition  Benin advocates for the peaceful settlement of existing disputes in the context of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We call for the mobilization of the international community with regard to the holding and the success of the next Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapon  with an African Chair. We draw the Assembly’s attention to the issue of the funding for the preparations for the Review Conference  the responsibility for which cannot rest solely with the upcoming Chair  particularly since that country is an LDC.The universality  indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights are fundamental values for Benin. We are strongly committed to human dignity and the sacred nature of human life. For that reason  out of a national belief  Benin acceded to the international instrument for the abolition of the death penalty. That enables us to join the countries at the forefront of the global campaign for the abolition of that form of punishment. We welcome that commitment.That campaign must continue so that the idea that the death penalty  far from serving justice  instead represents a failure of justice is more broadly shared. The increasing number of countries that support the moratorium or have acceded to it by law or in deed strengthens our hope for the universal abolition of the death penalty. In the context of that campaign  the Government of Benin  in cooperation with the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights  organized a regional conference on the abolition of the death penalty in Africa in Cotonou from 2 to 4 July. The conference called on African States to abolish the death penalty throughout the continent.My Government remains committed to strengthening the principles of democracy and the rule of law and the implementation of effective development policies. That is why my Government strives daily to find ways and means of strengthening those norms in Benin  which requires the creation of jobs and opportunities for all. That noble goal can be achieved only by effectively combating corruption.The difficult times that the world is currently experiencing require both globally and nationally a united front in support of the values of mutual respect  solidarity  inter-faith dialogue and  in particular  ongoing talks between Muslim and Christian leaders in order to establish a common space of friendship  essential to the flourishing of peoples. Taking into account the seriousness of that problem in Africa  my Government decided to support an initiative of the Pan-African Social Prospects Centre  headquartered in Benin  to hold an international symposium on Islamic-Christian dialogue in Cotonou in March 2015. That multifaceted project seeks to promote education on peace and development among peoples in the context of a harmonious coexistence of religions. I encourage all people of goodwill to respect such ideals and to support Benin’s initiative.In conclusion  I recall the need for intensified negotiations to achieve the reform of the United Nations  in particular  the Security Council. Benin strongly hopes that in 2015  the seventieth anniversary of the Organization will be marked by the adoption of significant measures commensurate with the challenges and opportunities of the new era in order to make the composition of the Council fairer and more representative and its working methods more inclusive so that it can fulfil its mandate more effectively.Moreover  all our efforts must seek to achieve our shared desire to see the United Nations regain its full capacity to promote an inclusive  transparent and more effective global governance in the context of productive multilateralism so as to build a balanced world order that promotes stability and harmony to the clear benefit of our peoples. In such conditions  all Member States would be able to take the virtuous path of sustainable development and shared prosperity so that equality  peace  brotherhood and the effective solidarity of nations lead to that better world for which we yearn."
"15",606,"BFA",69,2014,"Every year  the General Assembly gives us the opportunity to get together to discuss our concerns in the various parts of the world. Here we are  meeting again to evaluate what has been accomplished and to consider new solutions to the many challenges confronting our shared responsibility. And Burkina Faso is committed  as always  to participating in this important get-together  the symbol of international solidarity.I would like to express our gratitude to President Kutesa’s predecessor  Ambassador John Ashe  for his positive record during his tenure. I also heartily congratulate the President on his election  and I am confident that his wealth of experience with international and development issues will enable him to effectively guide our work on the post-2015 development agenda  in order to formulate an ambitious new framework for development aimed at bringing our peoples growth  fairness and a better life. I would also like to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his thoughtful focus on peace and social and economic development around the world  especially in Africa. In that regard  I welcome his initiative in holding last week’s Climate Summit in New York  aimed at persuading Heads of State and Government and representatives of local authorities  the private sector and civil society of the urgent and compelling need for them to declare their contributions to the fight against climate change in firm and concrete terms.Burkina Faso also reiterates its commendation of the joint visit to the Sahel by the Secretary-General  the Chairperson of the African Union Commission  the President of the World Bank  the President of the African Development Bank and the European Commissioner for Development within the framework of the United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel  which aims to promote security  good governance  development and human rights as factors of peace and stability.Lastly  Burkina Faso welcomes the Assembly’s adoption of the Secretary-General’s Ebola initiative (resolution 69/1) and welcomes his appointment of Mr. David Nabarro as Senior United Nations System Coordinator for Ebola Virus Disease and Mr. Anthony Banbury as his Special Representative and Head of the United Nations Mission on Ebola Emergency Response. These steps will certainly help the West African subregion to strengthen its public-health systems in order to eradicate the epidemic  whose spread could permanently compromise the area’s social cohesion  development and economic integration. Burkina Faso would like to express its sympathy and solidarity with the affected countries  and it reiterates its commitment to participating in the quest for a collective solution that can ensure effective protection for the people and for health personnel  as well as the free movement of people and goods within the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).Today we can celebrate the progress made in efforts to achieve and maintain peace  as well as to achieve our development goals  despite the fact that there is still work to be done to speed up improvement of our people’s living conditions. In Burkina Faso  notwithstanding our unfavourable geographical and climatic conditions and a difficult international economic environment  we are committed  with determination and realism  to building development. In the last few decades  therefore  we have established and implemented strategic development programmes and plans designed to put our country firmly on the road to emergence. Poverty reduction  the empowerment of women and full employment for young people are some of our main objectives. For several years consecutively those efforts have enabled Burkina Faso to record average annual growth rates of around 5 per cent and achieve significant investments in a number of areas that include health  education  agriculture  and water  road and energy infrastructures.Clearly  development efforts cannot thrive without a stable  peaceful environment. To that end  our President  Mr. Blaise Compaoré  and the Government of Burkina Faso continue to work to entrench a culture of tolerance and peaceful coexistence that seeks to establish  through dialogue and consultations  the essential elements of social cohesion  a strengthened democratic process and respect for individual and collective liberties. As a member of the Human Rights Council  Burkina Faso continues to set a good example by making the promotion and defence of human rights a major focus of its Government policy on improving the people’s welfare. That has been the context for the work of Mrs. Chantal Compaoré  a goodwill ambassador for the Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children  whose commitment to dealing with the issue of female genital mutilation is an important contribution to global efforts to protect the rights of women and girls. Burkina Faso welcomes the Human Rights Council’s recent adoption of a draft resolution on “Intensifying global efforts and sharing good practices to effectively eliminate female genital mutilation”   submitted by the African Group at Burkina Faso’s initiative.We are following with concern the crises and conflicts that unfortunately continue to plague parts of the world  particularly the African continent. However  under the auspices of ECOWAS  we welcome the significant progress made over recent months in restoring peace and democracy in West Africa  especially in Guinea-Bissau and Mali. With respect to Mali  ECOWAS mediation brought about the restoration of constitutional order and the holding of free and fair elections throughout the national territory. For the continuation of the peace process in Mali  Burkina Faso welcomes and supports the efforts of the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria in the search for a lasting peace solution in accordance with the Preliminary Agreement signed in Ouagadougou on 18 June 2013. That Agreement’s ultimate goal is to restore peace  the territorial integrity of Mali and of the ECOWAS region  and cohesion among all Malian communities  in order to achieve the objectives of harmonious development and subregional integration. In Mali  as elsewhere in the Sahel subregion  armed conflicts are becoming more complex and more radicalized because of the emergence of violent extremism and terrorism closely associated with the criminal economy  which is characterized  inter alia  by trafficking in drugs  weapons and human beings. Those evils challenge us in our shared responsibility in the fight to eradicate them. It is more urgent than ever to work together by focusing on preventive measures and addressing their root causes  namely such predisposing factors as extreme poverty  youth unemployment  and the denial of rights and justice. Similarly  it is important to strengthen the rapid- response capabilities of our States and international cooperation in the exchange of information  in order to allow our defence forces and security to fight effectively against terrorist threats. In that regard  Burkina Faso expresses its deep gratitude to all partner countries  especially France and the United States of America  whose contribution to the efforts to secure the Sahel is priceless. We would now like to reiterate our total solidarity with and full support for the people and Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria  which continue to face the unprecedented rise of terrorism and religious intolerance. Other African countries are also experiencing crisis situations. We are thinking in particular of Somalia  Libya  the Central African Republic  the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Sudan. With respect to the Central African Republic  Burkina Faso salutes the efforts of the international mediator  President Sassou Nguesso  and welcomes the Brazzaville Forum  which concluded with an agreement on the cessation of hostilities. My country supports the Transitional Government  welcomes the effective establishment of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic and reiterates its readiness to contribute to efforts to restore and keep peace in Central Africa. In the light of all these crises  Burkina Faso would emphasize the urgent need to restore and maintain an environment of peace and stability in the countries concerned  without which our development and integration efforts will be in vain. In that context  no effort should be spared to protect peacekeepers who risk their lives working to provide security and comfort to civilians. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate our strong condemnation of intentional attacks against all United Nations troops in theatres of peacekeeping. As it always has  Burkina Faso will continue to participate in the collective action of peacekeeping in countries in difficulty  in particular Darfur  Mali  Guinea-Bissau  the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Haiti. We express our deep appreciation to partner countries for their various forms of support in terms of training and equipment  which allow Burkinabé troops to accomplish their tasks efficiently wherever they are sent. With respect to conflict resolution  Burkina Faso advocates dialogue and consultation  which is the basis for Burkina Faso’s consistent action when the President of our country is sought after as a mediator or facilitator. Accordingly  I welcome the adoption on 31 July by the Assembly of resolution 68/303 on “Strengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes  conflict prevention and resolution”. In that regard  my country  a member of the Group of Friends of Mediation  encourages the actions taken under the leadership of Finland and Turkey. With regard to Western Sahara  Burkina Faso welcomes the Moroccan initiative for advanced autonomy status in Western Sahara  which is a credible and realistic option for achieving a final solution acceptable to all. In the Middle East  we condemn the recent escalation of violence which has led to many casualties among civilian populations. Priority should be given to dialogue  and we hope that the unrestricted ceasefire that was signed between Palestinians and Israelis on 26 August 2014  under the auspices of the Arab Republic of Egypt  will lead to the establishment of a definitive peace between the two parties to the conflict. Accordingly  Burkina Faso welcomes the efforts of the international community aimed at creating a Palestinian State living side by side with Israel in peace  security and mutual respect. The establishment of international peace and security will be but hollow words as long as the issue of disarmament remains unresolved. Therefore  no sacrifice is too great if together we can achieve a world free of nuclear weapons  a reduction in the risk of the proliferation of conventional weapons  and the entry into force and universalization of the Arms Trade Treaty. To establish a permanent basis for peace  security and freedom  it is also necessary to create the conditions for sustainable and equitable development for all peoples. That is why my country reaffirms its strong commitment to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. We therefore have a deep interest in the development process under way for the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda  and we urge that special attention be given to vital sectors such as agriculture  renewable energy  industrialization and infrastructure. Burkina Faso reaffirms its commitment to the ideals of the United Nations based on the principles of peaceful coexistence  dialogue and peaceful settlement of disputes. It is with conviction that we welcome and strongly encourage the rapprochement of views between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of China on Taiwan and the dialogue that forms the basis for such an approach. We favour the wider participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the specialized agencies of the United Nations. We salute the spirit of understanding displayed by the international community in allowing the involvement of that country in international organizations in order to enable it to play a broader role on the world stage through its contribution to the achievement of development goals  particularly in countries like Burkina Faso. Readmitting the Republic of China on Taiwan to our Organization is worth considering. With 23 million inhabitants and a large economy  the Republic of China on Taiwan has established itself as a key player in the international arena in terms of promoting peace and contributing to development efforts. With regard to Cuba  Burkina Faso reiterates its position in favour of lifting the embargo in order to allow the Cuban people to fit harmoniously into the concert of nations. Convinced of the irreplaceable role of the United Nations in promoting multilateralism  my country supports the reforms under consideration  in particular those of the Security Council and the General Assembly. Given the nature of the new factors in the threats to international peace and security  it is necessary and equitable that other continents have permanent seats on the Security Council. That is why Burkina Faso endorses the African Common Position in favour of expanding the number of permanent members of the Security Council to take into account the expectations of the African continent. With everyone’s help and moved by a spirit of solidarity and sharing  we can strengthen the role of the United Nations as a genuine instrument of cooperation for peace  security  justice and development. "
"16",649,"BGD",69,2014,"I warmly congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I also congratulate Ambassador John Ashe for his leadership of the Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. My appreciation also goes to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his stewardship of our endeavours to realize our common vision of a world of peace  dignity and well-being for all.Four decades ago  in his maiden speech before the General Assembly  the Father of our nation of Bangladesh  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (see A/PV.2243)  described his vision for a global order  saying that the Bengali nation is pledge-bound to establish a global order  one based on peaceful coexistence  social justice and freedom from poverty  hunger  exploitation and aggression. That vision continues to guide Bangladesh’s national development policies and our engagement in global affairs.We gather at a time when the global development discourse finds itself at an important juncture. As the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) approaches its deadline  the global community is engaged in framing a transformative development agenda for 2016-2030. The theme for this session of the General Assembly is therefore quite timely. Bangladesh believes that our deliberations will help us to arrive at a balanced  pragmatic and ambitious agenda.We cannot achieve sustainable development in the absence of durable peace and security. The volatile global security situation continues to pose significant challenges to international development. Bangladesh believes that a threat to peace anywhere is a threat to humankind as a whole.In keeping with our position of principle  we continue to express our full solidarity with the Palestinian people in their legitimate struggle for self-determination. We condemn the systematic killing of hundreds of Palestinian civilians  including women and children  by Israel during the recent offensive in Gaza. We seek a permanent solution to that long-standing conflict through the creation of an independent and viable State of Palestine based on the pre-1967 borders and with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.Bangladesh strongly believes in the centrality and legitimacy of the United Nations as the custodian of global peace  security and development. Our commitment to international peace is manifest in our support for the flagship resolution 68/125 on a culture of peace and non-violence. Our peace leadership is further reaffirmed through our support to the United Nations as one of the top troop- and police-contributing countries in the Organization’s peacekeeping endeavours. We have so far contributed 128 133 peacekeepers in 54 peace missions. Bangladesh proudly contributes the highest number of women police to United Nations peacekeeping  commensurate with our credentials in the empowerment of women.Terrorism and extremism remain major impediments on the road to global peace and development. My Government maintains a zero-tolerance policy with respect to all forms of terrorism  violent extremism  radicalization and faith-based politics. We remain firm in our resolve not to allow any terrorist individual or entity to use our territory against any State.The anti-liberation forces remain active in attempting to destroy the progressive and secular fabric of our nation. They resort to religious militancy and violent extremism at every opportunity. Under the direct patronage of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party-Jamaat-e-Islami Alliance Government from 2001 to 2006  they coalesced to form terrorist groups that carried out bomb and grenade attacks and killed secular political leaders and activists. Those gruesome attacks cemented my resolve to create a strong legal and regulatory regime for countering terrorism  including the adoption of the amended Anti-terrorism Act of 2013 and the Money Laundering Prevention Act of 2012.My Government is also seeking to entrench democracy  secularism and women’s empowerment in order to defeat terrorism and extremism ideologically. We have also significantly enhanced transparency and accountability in governance by strengthening our election  anti-corruption  human rights and information commissions. To uphold peace and the rule of law and end the culture of impunity  my Government remains pledge-bound to bring to justice the perpetrators of war crimes  crimes against humanity  rape and acts of genocide committed during our 1971 war of liberation. The highly transparent  impartial and independent international crimes tribunals in Bangladesh have already completed the trials of a few key criminals who carried out heinous crimes against humanity. We hope for the international community’s full support for our people’s desire for this long-awaited rendering of justice.Our Government has integrated the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) into our national five-year plan and Vision 2021  a people-centric programme that aspires to transform Bangladesh into a knowledge-based  technology-driven middle-income country by 2021. Bangladesh has already met or is on track to meet the first six MDGs. Poverty rates have fallen from 57 per cent in 1991 to below 25 per cent today. During the past five years  our gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate remained at 6.2 per cent  despite a global recession. Our export earnings grew more than threefold from around $10.53 billion in 2006 to more than $30.5 billion for the last fiscal year. Remittances have also almost tripled  from $5 billion in 2006 to $14.5 billion  while our foreign currency reserves jumped six and a half times  from $3.49 billion in 2006 to $22 billion today.In an effort to unlock Bangladesh’s development potential  we have undertaken some massive infrastructure and connectivity projects. We have begun work on a 6.15-kilometre bridge over the great river Padma using our own resources. We will soon begin developing a deep-sea port in Sonadia  Chittagong. We are already working on upgrading our road and rail infrastructure  including expressways and river tunnels. We have reached agreements with friendly countries such as India  China and Japan to develop large-scale power plants to meet our growing demands by 2021. We are developing 18 economic zones around the country to enable potential investors to invest in Bangladesh  especially in the context of our growing integration into the regional connectivity framework. Bangladesh enjoys a clear demographic dividend  with two thirds of its workforce young  employable and capable of remaining economically active till 2031. One of our policy priorities is investing in skills development for our increasingly youthful population.With a view to developing a knowledge-based society  we are rapidly building the capabilities of our country and people in the area of modern information and communications technologies. Our people currently receive more than 200 types of service from more than 4 500 union service and information centres  while rural populations have access to health-care services from more than 15 000 information-technology-connected community health clinics and union health centres. These networks enable us to bring various crucial public services to our people’s homes at an affordable cost. Bangladesh has 117 million SIM cards with more than 78 per cent telephone penetration and 50 million Internet connections.Bangladesh’s strides in education have enabled us to achieve the MDG targets of ensuring universal primary school enrolment and gender parity in primary and secondary schools. Our Government provides students with a free education up to the twelfth grade and provides 12.8 million students  75 per cent of them girls  from poor families with monthly stipends from primary level to graduation. Each year we distribute around 318 million free textbooks to all students up to the secondary level. We are now focusing on improving the quality of education to enable our boys and girls to acquire essential life skills and grow up with a truly global outlook.For us  sustainable development implies the empowerment of women and their equal participation with men in all walks of life. Our efforts to promote women’s empowerment by enhancing their access to productive resources and representation at the national and local level are producing visible results. The Government’s pragmatic policies have helped leadership by women grow from the grass-roots to the highest levels. Bangladesh may be the only country today where women concurrently occupy the positions of Prime Minister  Speaker  leader of the opposition and deputy leader. In the judiciary  administration  the civil service  the armed forces and law enforcement agencies  10 per cent of posts are reserved for women  as are 60 per cent of primary-school teaching posts.With a view to ensuring equality  my Government has established numerous social safety-net programmes that cover more than 24 per cent of the population  notably feeding and development programmes for vulnerable groups; the Ashrayan poverty alleviation project  which provides housing and income generation for the homeless; monthly pensions for senior citizens  widows  destitute women and the disabled; maternity allowances; and food and nutrition security for rural dwellers through one-house  one-farm schemes aimed at promoting family farming. Persons with disabilities are provided with education  skills development and interest-free credit for self-employment  with a 1 per cent jobs quota reserved for them in the formal sector.The MDGs have been the most successful global anti-poverty push in history. It is due to them that the world is seeing 50 per cent less poverty than in 1990  as well as more girls in school  fewer children dying and more people with access to safe drinking water and sanitation. However  progress has been uneven and unequal within and among countries and regions. Sadly  more than 1.3 billion people still live in abject poverty. As we reflect on our new and emerging development challenges  eradication of poverty must remain at the centre of the post-2015 agenda  and we must build linkages from it to all other goals. Our new framework must achieve a balance between the three pillars of sustainable development  and it should particularly keep in mind the importance of access and the unique circumstances and diverse needs of countries such as Bangladesh. I am pleased that the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals has used a rigorous  broadly inclusive process to come up with recommendations for a set of interlinked goals and targets.In Bangladesh  we have held national consultations and remained intensely engaged in the global process. We consider the set of goals and targets a carefully balanced package and a crucial basis for the post-2015 development agenda. The future development agenda must address low-income developing countries’ long-standing constraints on resources and capacity in a meaningful way and respond to emerging risks and vulnerabilities. The post-2015 development framework must fulfil our aspirations for building an equitable  prosperous and sustainable world where no person or nation is left behind. It must also contribute to a strengthened multilateralism  go beyond the national policy space and forge international cooperation. Greater resources would be key to the success of the post-2015 agenda. There is a need for a robust and broad-based global partnership based on the principles of mutual trust  respect and common but differentiated responsibilities.Bangladesh underscores its clear resolve with regard to the financing of sustainable development by next year  in particular from the financing for development process. While it is encouraging that some developed countries have fulfilled their commitment to contributing 0.7 per cent of their gross national income (GNI) and 0.2 per cent of GNI as official development assistance (ODA) to the least developed countries (LDCs)  most other countries have yet to fulfil those goals. At the same time  in a globalized economy  the least developed and most climate-vulnerable countries  such as Bangladesh  require greater support in terms of ODA  science and technology innovation and capacity-building. All products from all LDCs must be granted duty- and quota-free access to all markets of developed countries.The world today is witnessing unprecedented human mobility within and beyond borders. Bangladesh has emerged as a key stakeholder in global migration. For instance  remittances contribute approximately 14 per cent of our GDP. Millions of our migrant workers continue to make a significant contribution to development in a range of countries worldwide. We need to acknowledge the manifold contributions that migrants and their families make to our economies and societies apart from just remittances. It is therefore logical for migration and development issues to find a well-deserved space across the emerging post-2015 framework. It is my pleasure to announce that Bangladesh will chair the ninth Global Forum on Migration and Development in 2016.No challenge is as complex  widespread and formidable as climate change  in particular for countries such as ours. A recent Asian Development Bank report estimated that the mean economic cost of climate change and adaptation for Bangladesh would be between 2 and 9 per cent of GDP by 2100. Earlier  I emphasized before the Assembly that an increase of 1°C in the temperature is estimated to lead to a 1-metre rise in the sea level  thereby submerging a fifth of the territory of Bangladesh. That could compel 30 million of our people to move elsewhere as climate migrants. For Bangladesh  climate change is a matter of bare survival.In addressing climate change  adaptation remains particularly key for us. We have a crucial need for adequate  predictable and additional climate financing  access to locally adaptable technologies and support for capacity- and institution-building. We reiterate  under United Nations leadership  in particular through the role of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  the importance of the processes for the integration of the UNFCCC  disaster-risk reduction and the sustainable development goals.The world also needs to recognize the untapped potential of an ocean-based blue economy. The coastal and small island developing States stand to greatly benefit from the balanced conservation  development and use of marine ecosystems  resources and services. We call for global support for coastal countries  such as Bangladesh  in developing the much-needed capacity  technology and institutional frameworks that will enable us to tap into blue opportunities. For that reason  we continue to support the inclusion of blue-economy principles and practices in the post-2015 framework.Bangladesh proposed a flagship resolution at UNESCO  adopted in 1999  which led to the recognition of 21 February as the International Mother Language Day for the peoples of the world. We established the only International Mother Language Institute in Dhaka to preserve the more than 6 500 mother tongues of humankind. Those are two pillars of our commitment to mother languages. I once again call on the Assembly to recognize Bangla  which is spoken by more than 300 million people  as an official language of the United Nations.This year  Bangladesh celebrates 40 years of its membership of the United Nations. On this special occasion  I should like to reaffirm  on behalf of our people  the appeal by the father of our nation  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  for our progeny at this Assembly in 1974: Let us together create a world that can eradicate poverty  hunger  war and human suffering and achieve global peace and security for the well-being of humankind."
"17",695,"BGR",69,2014,"Let me congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa of Uganda on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I also extend my warmest gratitude to Mr. John Ashe for his work as President of the sixty-eighth session.Over the past few months  Bulgaria and the Balkans have suffered unprecedented floods. Thousands of people lost their homes  crops were ruined and many innocent people died. The heavy storms were no longer news but a part of daily life. Nature once again reminded us that today  political statements alone were not sufficient. For the sake of our children and our planet  it is time to act. As a wise man once said  we did not inherit the Earth from our fathers; we borrowed it from our children. Climate change needs to be urgently addressed. I would like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for having organized the Climate Summit. Bulgaria will actively support the completion of the negotiations on the new  universal and legally binding climate agreement in 2015.Bulgaria contributed to the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and the development of the post-2015 development agenda through its successful participation in the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. The Group has fulfilled its mandate. The Group’s report  together with the report of High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda (A/67/890  annex)  will be the leading documents for our future discussions as we enter the critical phase of the debate on the post-2015 development agenda. It is crucial that all sides stay engaged and committed to the final goal — an ambitious and forward-looking framework. No real transformative post-2015 development agenda will be possible unless we address the loopholes of the current Millennium Development Goals and build upon the lessons learned. The new framework should be founded on the principles of respect for human rights  inclusiveness  good governance and the rule of law. Youth-specific targets in the areas of education  health care and employment are of paramount importance as well.Development is unthinkable without peace and security. The illegal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and the conflict in eastern Ukraine have become one of the most serious threats to peace and security in Europe since the Second World War. The security environment in the Black Sea region has been seriously affected. The illegal annexation of Crimea undermines the international order. After the Second World War  we built our world on the clear principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations. They were shattered to pieces in a matter of weeks. Bulgaria strongly supports the sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine. My country does not recognize the illegal referendum in Crimea and condemns the annexation by Russia as a violation of international law. Bulgaria joined the numerous sponsors of resolution 68/262 on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.My country welcomes the ceasefire agreement and is looking forward to the implementation of the peace plan. Bulgaria commends all international efforts for the peaceful resolution of the conflict. We welcome the strong engagement of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the initiatives of the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  as well as the efforts of the trilateral contact group. Russia should stop arming and supporting separatists in Ukraine.In a few days  Ukrainians will vote for a new parliament. They have every right to choose their own future. I sincerely hope that those elections will be a major step forward in building a democratic and prosperous Ukraine. The signing and ratification of the European Union Association Agreements of Ukraine  Moldova and Georgia represent an important milestone in the process of the European integration of those countries. The positive change witnessed today in the Balkans would not have been possible without the engine of the European integration.The escalation of violence and the humanitarian situation in Syria continue to be a source of grave concern. Millions of refugees have fled their homeland in pursuit of peace in the neighbouring countries. Hundreds of thousands have lost their lives. More than 10 000 refugees have sought asylum in Bulgaria. A lasting solution to the conflict in Syria can be achieved only through an inclusive political process. We call on the Security Council to unite. The unity of the Security Council is crucial in order for the conflict to be resolved.The Syrian crisis  along with the outbreak of violence and sectarian tensions in Iraq  has exacerbated the security and humanitarian situation in the entire Middle East region. Bulgaria strongly condemns the armed attacks and killings perpetrated by the Islamic State terrorist organization against religious and ethnic minorities and denounces the brutal execution of innocent people. Bulgaria is an integral part of the broad international coalition against terrorism. A member of the European Union and of NATO  my country lends its political support  as well as humanitarian and material aid  within the scope of its possibilities. We welcome the adoption of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) on foreign terrorist fighters.Combating radicalization  supporting State-building in Iraq and cooperating with regional partners are essential. We welcome the election of Mr. Haider Al Abadi as Prime Minister of Iraq. We hope that  under his leadership  a Government of broad representation will be established in order to preserve the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country.Bulgaria greatly values the role of the United Nations in Iraq and appreciates the contribution of Mr. Nickolay Mladenov  former Bulgarian Foreign Minister  Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq. We stand for a just and lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on the two-State solution formula. That is possible only through direct negotiations with no preconditions and in conformity with the relevant international obligations. Any durable ceasefire should address both Israeli security concerns and Palestinian demands to abolish the Gaza closure regime.The adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty was a major achievement of the international community. Just over a year later  the threshold of 50 ratifications was reached this morning. I am glad that my country is among those 50 States that have made the entry into force of that important legal instrument a reality. The Arms Trade Treaty fills a serious gap in international law. It establishes regulations for the trade in conventional arms at the global level. Now its implementation and universalization are of the utmost importance.Twenty-five years ago  the Berlin Wall fell and the democratic transitions in Central and Eastern Europe began. My country Bulgaria chose to become a modern European democracy. We put our country back on the path of freedom  independence  the rule of law and respect for human rights. Our society has proved its firm commitment to democratic values and principles. We have witnessed similar political changes across South-East Europe. The Balkan countries have become partners  sharing the same values and projects for the future. We have built bridges of trust  friendship and mutual respect. We are working together to improve links and competition in order to increase prosperity in the Balkans.Human rights  democracy and the rule of law are at the heart of my country’s foreign policy. Bulgaria’s commitment to advancing the human rights agenda throughout the United Nations system was further strengthened under the successful Bulgarian chairmanship of the Social  Humanitarian and Cultural Committee during the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Bulgaria is determined to further contribute to promoting and upholding human rights internationally as a member of the Human Rights Council for the period 2019-2021  and will rely on its partners’ valuable support of its candidature.My country welcomes the appointment of Prince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al-Husein of Jordan as the new United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights — an excellent choice by the Secretary-General. We wish Prince Zeid all success in fulfilling his mandate.We support the Secretary-General’s Rights Up Front Action Plan to safeguard human rights around the world. Bulgaria commends Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson for his insightful vision and global leadership with regard to that initiative and his valuable contribution to advancing the human rights agenda throughout the United Nations.Bulgaria is concerned about the anti-Semitic attacks that have taken place recently  especially in Europe. As a country that saved 48 000 Bulgarian Jews from deportation during the Second World War  Bulgaria strongly condemns the recurring trend of brutal and disgusting manifestations of anti-Semitism.This year  the international community is celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child  which set a universal standard for the effective promotion of children’s rights. Bulgaria commends UNICEF for its enormous contribution during that time to improving children’s lives and advancing the child agenda around the world. As a member of the Bureau of the UNICEF Executive Board this year  my country supports and actively participates in all efforts aimed at child protection and achieving results for children.My country is convinced that the United Nations reform process should continue in order to enhance the efficiency  representativeness and transparency of the entire system  and to make it more adequate and responsive to the new realities. As a member of the Eastern European regional group  Bulgaria reiterates its position in favour of allocating at least one additional non-permanent seat to the Group in an enlarged Security Council. Bulgaria aspires to serve as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the 2018-2019 term.At the end of 2016  the second term of office of the current and highly respected Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  will come to an end. My country greatly values his outstanding leadership and commitment. Bulgaria expects that  when the time comes  the States Members of the United Nations will be able to elect a worthy successor. To that end I would like to recall the relevant General Assembly resolution  which states that “[i]n the course of the identification and appointment of the best candidate for the post of Secretary-General  due regard shall continue to be given to regional rotation and shall also be given to gender equality” (resolution 51/241  annex  para. 59).Bulgaria is convinced that the time has finally come for the East European regional group to be represented at the helm of the United Nations."
"18",740,"BHR",69,2014,"At the outset  it gives me great pleasure to congratulate you warmly  Mr. President  and  through you  your friendly country Uganda upon your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I take this opportunity to wish you luck and success in the noble mission entrusted to you  and I affirm the Kingdom of Bahrain’s support for your judicious proposal regarding the formulation and adoption of a post-2015 development agenda that will build on past achievements in the context of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for the well-being of all people.It would be remiss of me not to commend your predecessor  Ambassador John Ashe  for his excellent conduct of the work of the Assembly during its sixty-eighth session and his outstanding and successful efforts.We also greatly appreciate the efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to revitalize and strengthen the Organization’s role and to realize its objectives in all fields. I commend the report he introduced earlier in the current session on the work of the Organization (A/69/1). It demonstrates the daunting responsibility assumed by our Organization in creating an environment conducive to seeking appropriate solutions to the problems and challenges that we all face.The inaugural statement by the Secretary-General at the opening of the general debate (see A/69/PV.6) shed light on a number of the challenges facing us  including climate change  the spread of diseases  particularly the Ebola epidemic in West Africa  the aggravated refugee problem  the propagation of extremism  policies of exclusion  violence  violations of human rights  particularly those affecting women  and issues related to health  education and food security.My country supports the Secretary-General’s urgent call to conclude a global climate agreement at the forthcoming Lima and Paris conferences and stresses the importance of the Green Climate Fund  designed to mitigate the effects of climate change.It is a matter of particular pride for me to mention the vigorous efforts undertaken by the Kingdom of Bahrain and the resulting successes in countering the numerous challenges and instability currently facing the region. As classified by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 2014 Human Development Report — which is based on objective statistical criteria regarding  first and foremost  health care  education  per capita income and the equality of women — the Kingdom of Bahrain is ranked among the countries with “very high human development”. That is a status achieved through persistent hard work  and we will endeavour to maintain it.Those goals  however  have never been an end in themselves. The principal objective is to achieve the well-being of Bahraini citizens and to protect all those who live within the borders of the Kingdom  an oasis of security and calm enjoyed equally by all.I am pleased to recall in that context the award bestowed on His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa by the Foundation for Coexistence among Religions in recognition of His Majesty’s outstanding contributions in the field of dialogue among civilizations and cultures. I also note that the fourteenth Conference on All Civilizations in the Service of Humanity was held in Manama in early May under the high-level patronage of His Majesty the King and with the participation of the United Nations and a distinguished group of thinkers  scholars and opinion-makers. The Conference adopted the Bahrain Declaration  which has been circulated and deposited as an official document of the United Nations (A/68/959  annex).Additionally  I would like to mention His Majesty’s initiative to establish an Arab human rights tribunal. The initiative has been approved by all States members of the League of Arab States  and the statute has been adopted. I would also like to mention the launch in Bahrain in November 2013 of the UNDP report Water Governance in the Arab Region  which calls for the adoption of a joint Arab water-management strategy.The Kingdom of Bahrain has continued to play an energetic role in the United Nations system  where it seeks to further progress through gradual and steady reform and modernization along the lines envisaged by His Majesty the King. Such reform would be based on a strategy of common denominators  continuous and open dialogue and a national exchange of views — the same strategy as led to the early achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Accordingly  the strategies and preparations for the post-2015 development agenda are also based on tireless work  determination  persistence  good faith and comprehensive planning and are aimed at promoting continual and enhanced progress and serving the interests of the Kingdom’s citizens and residents alike.Our region is going through a phase of extreme difficulty — probably the most difficult in its modern history — in which a climate of instability  chaos  tension and savage  bloody and unprecedented terrorism prevails. Of the many contributing factors  the most salient are the following.First  the accelerated emergence of terrorist groups of various global dimensions and affiliations. They thrive in our region  exhibiting the greatest savagery and callousness. Not only do they target innocent people in general  they also engage in such inhumane practices as mass murder  public beheadings and the persecution of ethnic and religious minorities  which they displace  destroying their cultural heritage  depriving them of religious freedom and causing them to flee their homes. They attack entire cities and declare war on sovereign countries in regional and international settings  in complete disregard of all religious doctrines and the intrinsic human values — tolerance  equality  moderation and respect for cultural diversity — that have enabled human civilizations  including our Arab and Islamic civilization  to coexist. These terrorist groups — they include Al-Qaida  the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Hizbullah  and their extensions and counterparts — recruit their fighters from both East and West and perpetrate horrific terrorist acts. The young and the old alike are killed  women are taken as war bounty  families are displaced and privacy is violated  the objective being to undermine security  propagate anarchy and topple regimes.Therefore  combating terrorist groups requires us to work together in three main areas. The first of these is the security and military area  owing to the worsening threat posed by these terrorist groups as they acquire heavy weapons  enabling them to occupy cities for use as safe havens and bases from which to launch the terrorist operations that disrupt the stability and security of our region.We share a common responsibility with friendly countries and our allies is to eradicate the terrorist group of ISIL. To that end  our air force  in collaboration with these countries  has targeted a number of ISIL positions. We welcome Security Council resolution 2178 (2014)  adopted on 24 September  which focuses on stopping the recruitment of foreign terrorist fighters. Also  we continue to closely monitor borders and exit and entry points so as to stop citizens of the Kingdom from contacting or joining terrorist groups and to arrest and prosecute all those who have allegedly been affiliated to them as soon as they return to the country.Secondly  we must combat all ideology that runs counter to human nature and betrays true Islam by distorting its precepts. Muslim clerics and scholars can play an important part in counteracting such distortion. We therefore call on all Muslim scholars to expose and disown ideas that are not related to Islam in any way  and we appreciate their playing a leading role in that respect. It is imperative to stand together in the face of the ideas propagated by the terrorist groups.Thirdly  we must deal with financing  as it constitutes the lifeline of the terrorist groups  enabling them to perpetrate their barbaric acts  purchase weapons and influence some young people. In that connection  the Kingdom of Bahrain will convene a high-level international conference during the first week of November to consider the financing of terrorism  how best to combat such financing and how to deprive terrorism of its sources of finance. We firmly believe that preventing the financing of terrorism will significantly contribute to overcoming terrorism and to eradicating it.The second challenge to the security and stability of our region is that of political expansionism and attempts to impose hegemony  in disregard of the sovereignty of States  and to interfere in their internal affairs. All the countries of the region  without exception  have suffered from such issues as a result of attempts to export seditious revolutions and to train terrorists in violation of international law and the principles of the United Nations. Such attempts represent an ideology that is archaic in its political dimension and in its defiance of the values and principles enshrined in numerous international instruments.One form of such interference is the exploitation of the media  in particular satellite television channels and social media  which are misused in order to distort facts and to cause instability in the region. We condemn such illegal and illegitimate practices  which contravene international values and principles.I would like to point out what the Republic of Yemen endures. With each step that it takes forward  terrorist groups rush to pursue their criminal objectives by undermining its stability and security. The Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms its support for President Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour and his tireless efforts to strengthen the national consensus achieved through a comprehensive national dialogue on the basis of the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative and the relevant Security Council resolutions.Turning to Iraq  which has suffered from flagrant interference  insecurity  hegemony and anarchy  we see some hope in the positive developments in the country. We are pleased to welcome the election of President Fuad Masum and the establishment of the new Government under Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi. We hope that such a development will enhance the political and development processes  thereby contributing to the consolidation of Iraq’s security and stability  the preservation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity and the strengthening of its links with its fellow Arabs in the region where it naturally belongs.The conflict in Syria becomes more complex and more acute every year. Innocent civilians are paying the ultimate price and losing their lives  property and dignity. The humanitarian situation deteriorates daily in the absence of a comprehensive political solution to safeguard the lives of the Syrian people and to extricate that beloved country from its protracted suffering through a comprehensive political process aimed at achieving reform and political plurality. With regard to the humanitarian aspect  we reiterate that it is necessary to overcome all impediments to the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need  in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.In that respect  I wish to express my country’s great appreciation for the humanity shown by the sisterly Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in hosting and delivering assistance to Syrian refugees. We also appreciate the humanitarian role played by Turkey and Lebanon  as well as by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.With regard to the Arab Republic of Egypt  the Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes the democratic development that has taken place in that country and the implementation of the road map through the establishment of a Constitution that reflects the will of the Egyptian people. We also welcome the presidential elections and the ongoing preparations for the holding of legislative elections so as to complete the State institutions under the Constitution.The Kingdom of Bahrain reiterates its complete condemnation of any interference in the internal affairs of Egypt. We support the efforts of President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi and the steps that he has taken to combat terrorism  to preserve the security and stability of Egypt and to pursue its strategic and active role at the Arab  regional and international levels. In that regard  I would like to commend the initiative taken by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques  King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud  King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  in announcing the convening of an Egyptian economic summit in support of Egypt and its economic development.We reiterate the historical  principled and constant position of the Kingdom of Bahrain in solidarity with the Kingdom of Morocco and our full support for its initiatives with regard to self-government for the Moroccan Sahara within Moroccan sovereignty and territorial integrity  in accordance with international legitimacy.With regard to Libya  the Kingdom of Bahrain wishes to express its grave concern about the deteriorating security situation as a result of the violent acts perpetrated by terrorist groups and the repercussions of such acts on the stability of neighbouring countries. The Kingdom of Bahrain supports the legitimate constitutional institutions represented by the elected House of Representatives and welcomes the establishment of the new Government under Mr. Abdallah Al-Thani. We hope that such a development will help to establish security and stability and to preserve the unity and territorial integrity of that sisterly country.In view of our keen interest in striving to achieve our principal goal  namely  to protect humankind from the scourge of war  conflict and disaster and to condemn attempts at hegemony and destabilization  we reiterate our call to make the Middle East  including the Arab Gulf region  a zone free of weapons of mass destruction  in particular nuclear weapons. On the basis of that principle  we support the efforts of the P5+1 to promptly find a solution to the issue of the Iranian nuclear programme  in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Convention on Nuclear Safety  without prejudice to the use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Such use is a natural right of all States under the international safeguards system.The third and last challenge is the illegal occupation of the territory of other States in breach of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations  as demonstrated by Israel’s violation of all international laws  agreements and decisions and its targeting of the Palestinian people by confiscating their land  by building or expanding settlements thereon and by imposing blockades on them. Such violations found their ugliest expression in the most recent criminal aggression against the Gaza Strip  which resulted in tremendous damage and caused the death of more than 2 000 martyrs  the displacement of a great number of Palestinians and the destruction of infrastructure.I would like to recall the words of President Mahmoud Abbas in his statement before the General Assembly  his request that international protection be provided to the Palestinian people and their territories under occupation and his demand that Israel abide by the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 (see A/69/PV.12). It is imperative to have a specific time frame for an end to the Israeli occupation and to achieve the aspirations of the Palestinian people for the establishment of an independent Palestinian State on all its territory within the boundaries of 4 June 1967  with East Jerusalem as its capital  as stipulated under the Arab Peace Initiative and the two-State solution  in accordance with international legitimacy and the relevant United Nations resolutions.In that context  we commend the pivotal role played by the Arab Republic of Egypt in order to reach a ceasefire in Gaza. We greatly appreciate its hosting  in cooperation with the Kingdom of Norway  an international conference in support of Palestine and the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip next month. We also commend the important role of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.With regard to the occupation by the Islamic Republic of Iran of the three islands Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa  which belong to the United Arab Emirates  the Kingdom of Bahrain reiterates its consistent position condemning that occupation. We call on Iran to heed the efforts of the United Arab Emirates to resolve the issue through direct negotiations or through the arbitration of the International Court of Justice.Those are the key challenges facing our region. If we overcome them  it will be relatively easy for us  within our common responsibilities  to address the international challenges that the Secretary-General described in his statement  to which I referred at the beginning of my statement. If we focus on those very serious issues  we will be on the right path towards true sustainable development and the necessary reform to meet the aspirations of all peoples.Notwithstanding the challenges that we all face  the Kingdom of Bahrain will always remain committed to moving forward on the path of development  reform and positive interaction with the international community in order to achieve our aspirations and objectives. In that respect  the Kingdom of Bahrain  in line with its firm approach towards reform under the leadership of His Majesty the King  will continue to work for the upholding of the rule of law  pluralism and active political participation. We look forward to the elections to be held on 22 November  so as to consolidate all our achievements.In conclusion  I would like to underscore the fact that in the Kingdom of Bahrain our choices are clear. Our vision is comprehensive and our strategy complementary to and in line with our Gulf  Arab and international contexts. The Kingdom always seeks to promote stability  peace  security  development and the protection of human rights. It rejects and condemns terrorism  violence and hatred and works for a society in which harmony and consensus prevail for the benefit of all and for the establishment of a promising future full of opportunity and achievement for all future generations."
"19",778,"BHS",69,2014,"Kamalesh Sharma  the Secretary General of the Commonwealth of Nations  said to us at a gathering here in New York a few days ago: “Do not be demoralized by your income  be inspired by your outcome”. That should be a driving principle as all countries  particularly the small island developing States  seek to determine what the post-2015 development agenda will be. The obstacles are many. The lip service is evident. We have hope  and our moral case is strong. We are inspired by the potential outcomes of this new development agenda.We must be people-focused and  in that regard  I remember a story told by a colleague  a Minister from the Far East  who explained his absence to a constituent at home as dealing with many of the world’s problems. “Yes”  said the constituent to him  “but the water pump in the village has not been fixed”. It is a reminder of whom we really work for in this body — not for ourselves  but for that villager who needs the pump at home to be fixed.At this session  our Prime Minister gave a comprehensive statement on climate change and the need for developed countries to honour their financial commitments in that regard. In addition  we deposited our instrument of ratification of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)  which helped to bring the number of countries to 50 and so caused the Treaty to enter into force. Furthermore  in the margins of the session  we signed a memorandum of understanding with the International Organization for Migration.There are no higher priorities for the Bahamas than these matters: the environment  fighting crime and containing illegal immigration. They go to the very root of our existence. If we do not resolve the climate change issues  there will be no Bahamas. Solving the crime problem in the Bahamas is key to our domestic peace and economic survivability. No Bahamian doubts that the control of illegal immigration is central to our survivability as a country  central to our national identity  and central to our national security. We have only to see today how illegal immigration drains our financial resources  and we do not have to look far to see how unchecked immigration in other countries has been a recipe for civil strife within their borders. We do not intend for that to happen to us. All of the efforts related to the three main themes I have just mentioned are buttressed by our work to ensure that we have a robust  strong and sustainable economy.Tourism is by far the number-one economic activity for the Bahamas. The environment is central to that business. It should therefore be no surprise that the Bahamas has adopted or established the following: the National Environmental Policy  2005; the National Environmental Management and Action Plan for the Bahamas  2005; the Bahamas National Wetland Policy  2007; the Bahamas Protected Areas Fund  2013; and the Forestry Amendment Act  2014. We believe that those policies and programmes will all help with the issue of climate change. We also believe that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the primary international  intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change. We believe that it should be completed with dispatch.The Bahamas is committed to the small island developing States processes at the United Nations. The Bahamas welcomes the convening of the World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction next year in Japan.The Bahamas is appalled by the practice of killing sharks simply for their fins. We must make the fishing of sharks a sustainable practice  as these creatures are a vital part of the global ecosystem. The Bahamas therefore assumed the chairmanship of the United Nations Save Our Sharks Coalition in December 2013. The aims of the Coalition resonate with us  and we believe that we can help save the shark from extinction.The Bahamas has been grappling with serious crimes in our society  related largely to  first  the inability of young males to settle disputes without recourse to violence and  secondly  the resulting proliferation of gang activity and trafficking in illicit drugs  small arms and light weapons  and ammunition. The Bahamas therefore became actively involved in the negotiations leading to the successful adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty and considered its adoption a landmark accomplishment for the United Nations (resolution 67/234 B). The Government believes the entry into force of the ATT will contribute to peace and security in the Bahamas and throughout our region. We deposited the instrument of ratification of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to the Arms Trade Treaty on 25 September. We continue to fight the illegal drug trade and trafficking in persons  and we are investing in social intervention programmes  like the award-winning Urban Renewal Programme  in order to fight crime.I spoke earlier of the memorandum of understanding signed with the International Organization for Migration. This is one part of a multifaceted strategy to stop the flow of undocumented non-nationals into Bahamian territory. New policies and measures are now in place  and there will be stricter adherence in the future to them to stop this trafficking. A new fleet of vessels has been purchased to support our work to stop migrant smuggling. In the last few months  the Bahamas has entered into important agreements with our immediate neighbours — Cuba  the Dominican Republic and Haiti — to come to terms with the vexing situations that impact our good relations. Those accords are on fishing and on migration. Let there be no doubt that we mean to bring illegal migration under control.Nevertheless  our relations with neighbouring countries remain good. This is all the more reason why we believe that the continued economic embargo by one neighbour against another in our region is counterproductive to the peace and good order of the region. We continue to keep matters with regard to the governance issues in our neighbour  the Turks and Caicos Islands  under review.The Bahamas looks forward to the forthcoming launch of the International Decade for People of African Descent  which will have as its theme “People of African descent: recognition  justice and development”. That theme could also be linked to the efforts of States members of the Caribbean Community in seeking the restorative justice due from the legacy of 400 years of slavery. We were heartened by the unveiling of the winning design for the permanent memorial to honour the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. We reaffirm our support for that important project.The Bahamas welcomes the convening of the third International Conference on Financing for Development  to be held in Addis Ababa  Ethiopia  in July 2015. We plan to participate in that conference  which we expect will provide a forum to address the need to demystify and replace the view that gross domestic product is the sole indicator of sustainable development — a replacement that needs to be converted into policy — as well as the matter of international cooperation in tax matters. In that regard  the Bahamas reaffirms the important role of the United Nations in addressing matters related to international tax cooperation  given its universality and legitimacy.The Bahamas reaffirms its commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all people  regardless of their station or status in society. These rights and freedoms are neither negotiable nor peripheral. As a demonstration of its commitment to human rights  I am pleased to report that the Bahamas has passed national legislation  the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities) Act  which will ensure its ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in due course. In addition  four bills have been introduced in Parliament with a view to amending the Constitution of the Bahamas to bring about full equality between men and women in law. This event will mark a significant opportunity for the people of the Bahamas to usher in a new era of equality for men and women.The Bahamas looks forward to the process of elaborating the post-2015 development agenda and to actively participating in the intergovernmental process that will lead to the adoption of this agenda in September 2015. Our vision for the post-2015 development agenda is creative  inclusive and transformative.The Bahamas endorses the idea of Security Council reform. As we look around at the tens of millions of dollars that have been  and are being  spent to bring the physical structure up to code and into the twenty-first century  why cannot we ensure that the organs of the United Nations  especially the Security Council  also reflect twenty-first-century realities?Last year  the Bahamas celebrated its fortieth year of independence. In addressing the General Assembly last year (see A/68/PV.19)  the Right Honourable Perry Christie  Prime Minister of the Bahamas  renewed the commitment of our country to playing its part in making our planet a more peaceful and prosperous place  characterized by cooperation  mutual respect and support. We believe that each country has a primary responsibility for its own development  and  throughout my statement  I have indicated our achievements and challenges in that regard. I repeat that the environment  crime and illegal migration are issues of existential significance to our country. However  despite the many challenges  we are inspired by the possible outcomes. We therefore exhort the Members of the United Nations to stay motivated and committed  for each new effort undertaken and each achievement registered brings us nearer to our development goals. Now  more than ever  we need the United Nations."
"20",803,"BIH",69,2014,"I will start with the issue that I believe is of the utmost importance today  the one causing the greatest concern. Currently  the world is in a state of chaos which is producing understandable fear and concern among its citizens as to a peaceful and secure future. There has not been so much war in the world since the late 1960s. Today  in many parts of our planet  there are low- and medium-intensity conflicts that have the potential to produce wider regional and global conflicts. From Afghanistan to Ukraine  the Middle East  Libya  Central Africa and other regions  we are witnessing armed conflicts with no chance in sight of our being able to stop them and reach a lasting peace.These conflicts are accompanied by a rarely seen escalation of all forms of violence and brutality  particularly against civilians. Increased numbers of internal civil conflicts are causing States to fall apart  some of them disappearing overnight  others arising with the support of outside enablers. We also see the public emergence of new political maps drawn with new borders  separatist movements getting stronger and international laws being violated with use of force. The situation is the result of the unilateral actions of some great Powers  double standards in international relations  the breaking of the cohesive legal world order and other actions contrary to the norms of international law.On the other hand  years of economic and financial crisis have led to dramatic social change with alarming socioeconomic consequences. Despite growing global prosperity  the gap between rich and poor countries and nations is getting wider. The middle class is getting smaller while inequality within societies is growing. Systems of social support are declining  with unemployment  especially among young people  taking on alarming proportions. Given the general situation  we must think about future development.Bosnia and Herzegovina is at present a developing country characterized by an open and fully liberal economy with foreign trade and economic ties directed towards the countries of the region and the European Union. Unfortunately  as a developing country  we are facing the problem of a high unemployment rate — over 25 per cent — a large trade deficit  lack of capital and major investment and insufficient and weak industrial production.Bosnia and Herzegovina’s economic and social situation is similar to that of the region of the Western Balkans in general. It is extremely difficult. The economic reconstruction and recovery of the country after the tragic conflict of 1991-1995 have slowed since the global economic crisis engulfed the entire world. However  while total economic growth in 2013 was 1 per cent  industrial production increased to 6.7 per cent. The biggest economic problem is the decline in foreign investment  which in 2013 was 34 per cent less than in 2012. Due to the general economic downturn in the country and countries of the region  as well as the damage caused by natural disasters and their negative effects on economic and production activities  the decline in indirect tax revenues significantly endangered the fiscal stability of the country.Regardless of current negative economic trends due to the economic crisis  we believe that by using our natural resources appropriately we can achieve an economic growth and development that would lead to long-term progress and political stabilization of the country. In order to do that  it is clear that we and the region need the support of the developed world  especially the developed countries of the European Union  the United States and Japan as well as Brazil  Russia  India  China and South Africa.We cannot achieve sustainable development that involves investment in the real sector of the economy  building and developing transportation infrastructure  poverty reduction  and the effective and rational use of resources entirely by ourselves. We are too small a country and region to achieve those objectives alone  nor do we have enough capital to build industrial facilities that adhere to green economy principles or protect natural resources and put us on a sustainable development track.When it comes to the economic determinants of sustainable development  I am convinced that most small countries share the same perspective and position. We cannot resolve issues of progress alone or prevent the emergence of the vicious cycle of poverty that threatens to undermine our societies. Therefore  in future we will need to continue to adhere to the principles of economic solidarity and mutual economic cooperation and support  and find a common framework of values and actions.In addition  given the multipolarity of the economic world  I hope that we will find more partners from developed countries on our path towards development and recovery. The world of the future should not be determined by the false choice between haves and have-nots. Apart from the issue of uncertainty for the future  every crisis entails the erroneous belief that rich countries fare better than poor ones. Indeed  one forgets that  due to global interdependence and responsibility  no one can survive alone; either we all do or nobody does.Bosnia and Herzegovina remains committed to meeting the Millennium Development Goals  despite the difficulty of their implementation  given the challenging conditions following the war and the economic crisis. Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to regional cooperation with all interested countries  based on the principles of mutual respect and common interests. Bosnia and Herzegovina is surrounded by neighbours who are also in various stages of transition and democratic reform  and we share the same problems arising from the complex processes that must be engaged on our way towards membership in the European Union.We attach special importance to regional cooperation. Bosnia and Herzegovina has good-neighbourly relations marked by long historical ties and regional interdependence with Serbia  Croatia and Montenegro and other countries of the former Yugoslavia and the Balkans.All of us gathered here today representing our countries and peoples need  in the near and distant future  to find concrete and clear solutions to the problems and challenges caused by the broadest range of sustainable development issues  as defined by a number of the United Nations conferences over the past 20 years. The sustainable development of countries  regions and groups of countries  continents and the entire world is a key element and basic starting point for further strategic steps and activities for modern humankind to resolve. The state of the world economy  environment and the contemporary society as a whole is full of problems and challenges that require our full commitment and dedication to continued growth and the expanded possibility of achieving sustainable development in the world  which unfortunately slowed down and stopped with the emergence of the global economic and financial crisis starting in 2008.I should like to say a few words about possible problems related to sustainable development in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region of South-East Europe as an important European region poised to build strong political and economic ties with the European Union and other countries worldwide.I am afraid that we in Bosnia and Herzegovina do not have the same starting position as other countries of the world in terms of inclusion in the sustainable development process of the United Nations. In 1992  when the first conference was held in Rio de Janeiro  we were at the beginning of a horrendous chapter of our history and a tragic conflict whose negative political and economic effects have continued to cause suffering in society. However  with the support of the United Nations and the European Union  today we are on the road to recovery  with the hope of achieving the ultimate goal of political success  namely  full legal integration into the European Union and the economic achievement of developed country status.This year the world is celebrating the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War. Incredibly  the current world economic and political situation resembles the situation of 100 years ago. A crisis of economic depression  social disintegration  an ineffective international system and the rise of armed conflicts and wars have led to a weakening of the optimistic driving force and a lack of global vision and joint action. The common goal that is necessary for a stable international order is fading on the horizon of spreading conflicts. It requires us to set clear priorities and seek new lighthouse beacons.This year in Bosnia and Herzegovina we marked the Sarajevo assassination that is commonly taken as the direct cause of the start of the First World War  which resulted in the deaths of more than 15 million people. At several events dedicated to the anniversary  together we have asked ourselves: Have we learned the lessons from the past of 100 years ago? When I see the local wars being fought on all sides of the world today  I am afraid that we have not learned those lessons; on the contrary and in the meantime  we have repeated the same old mistakes and made new ones.The world needs peace more than ever. It is only in peace that one can develop and prosper. The maintenance of international peace and security is imperative to the development of every country and the entire world. It is the responsibility of the Member States to find acceptable frameworks and tools to improve the security situation in the world in the interest of development and progress.In conclusion  three days ago I spoke in my capacity as a Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina  at the Climate Summit. Yesterday I met with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in the same capacity. Today  the Secretariat has allowed itself to interpret the Charter of the United Nations wrongfully  unfortunately. That is unacceptable. The future of the Organization of the United Nations is based on consensual agreement by all Member States and not the decisions of the bureaucracy."
"21",850,"BLR",69,2014,"Humankind has only one past  but many options for the future. History is such that we know only the consequences of those actions that have occurred  but not those that did not take place. What would our world look like today if  a century ago  that memorable shot had not been fired in Sarajevo  irrevocably changing the course of history? That shot set in motion a dynamic that has yet to be fully explained. For some key European countries the question of honour contained in that shot overrode both common sense and all other considerations. Millions paid with their lives for that hypocritical honour. Unfortunately  the tragedy did not end there  because the lessons of the First World War have not been learned. As a consequence  other global carnage has claimed even more human lives. Thus  the shot in Sarajevo marked nothing more than the onset of the bloodiest period in the history of humankind.For Belarus  this period was also the bloodiest in the history of its people. Located at the centre of Europe  in the very crucible of geopolitical interests  Belarus lost a third of its population during the Second World War. Even today  with 20 years of unprecedented successful and stable development  we have not recovered from that immense loss  either physically  psychologically or emotionally.This year  as the Republic of Belarus celebrates the seventieth anniversary of its liberation from the Fascist occupiers  is very important and symbolic for the country. Belarus remembers all the victims who paid with their lives for the freedom of the nation. Against this background  we do not understand and strongly condemn some attempts to revise the outcome of the Second World War  downplaying the significance of the Great Victory or desecrating the memory of the fallen heroes. The world community must not allow this to happen. Indeed  the verdict of history is unequivocal; if humankind fails to learn the lessons from past tragedies  we are bound to repeat them in the future.Let us ponder the the immediate and distant future  and indeed the present  as we mark the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War. What do current global trends tell us about the future? Undoubtedly  a multitude of factors determine the dynamics of contemporary global politics. We would identify the resistance of the majority of the world’s population to the imposition of external influences as one of the key factors. Indeed  much like in the past  the mighty of the world persist in believing that only their vision and their development model stand as universal. Therefore  they do not ask others whether they like or dislike  for instance  so-called liberal democracy or the Washington consensus. Others are just forced to choose — either they accept our recipes or face the consequences  such as threats  sanctions and colour revolutions.To be honest  we — that is  the majority — have grown accustomed to alien political and economic models being foisted upon us. We know what is going here. Someone wants our nations to feed transnational corporate capital  not ourselves. If we resist  we are punished. The pretext is always contrived — alleged violations of human rights by unruly States. Having been subjected to external attacks for many years  countries such as Belarus  Cuba  Iran and Venezuela feel such pressure especially acutely.No less dangerous  however  is another factor. Similar attempts at imposition have been made recently against our identity. Indeed  some have been doing their best to impose on us extraneous cultural preferences. For example  we are being forced to renounce the values of a traditional family and recognize instead the diversity of that institution’s forms. In other words  they are striving to strip us of our own soul. That may be just another way to subdue those who dissent against capital by turning them into soulless slaves.We are convinced that nothing will come out of it  however. The reason why the world is developing is because it is diverse. It is diversity itself that gives rise to healthy competition and creativity  which  in turn  drive human progress. Do we need uniformity and the ensuing trivial  soulless world? Of course we do not. In that regard  I appeal to those who persist in compelling others to do something that they find alien and unpleasant to give up their meaningless and futile policy. It is a road to nowhere. Their efforts only divide us. We have too many problems on our plate that require us to be united.Today  two approaches determine international relations: the ability to effect change and the ability to stand in its way. Indeed  on the one hand  one or even several countries can easily paralyse the international community in its activities; on the other  no State or group of States  however powerful  can alter the status quo without cooperating with the rest of the world. That is the paradox of globalization. We have become too intertwined and too interdependent. Sadly  the same holds true for global challenges — they too have become intertwined. It is impossible in today’s world to succeed in one area without making headway in others. There is  for instance  no simple solution to the threat of human trafficking unless we effectively tackle the problem of poverty.In short  strategies and policies to counter all contemporary threats will be effective only if they are comprehensive in scope and focus. Let us be realistic and acknowledge that we will never solve the world’s problems all at once. Our collective goal must therefore be to reduce the extent of the threat they pose to society through our constant  unswerving attention.It is precisely that attitude that must underpin our collective effort aimed at developing the post-2015 United Nations development agenda. That agenda should be both comprehensive and realistic. Its main goal should be to make globalization more even and equitable than it has been up to now. When people in different countries take to the streets to protest against globalization  they are not calling for a return to parochial nationalism. Rather  they seek a strengthened globalization; they want to make it sustainable and they want it to result in a win-win situation.Rising inequality in the world is the biggest scourge. We face a paradox. Having recently made significant progress in strengthening various forms of equality  such as gender  race and ethnic equality  we are seeing a stubborn rise in economic inequality. The international community must do whatever it takes to reverse that trend. Otherwise  we will not eradicate poverty. Climate change is another major challenge. It is inextricably linked to such issues as energy consumption  food security and water resources. We need to fully reflect this complex issue in the future agenda.To be sure  many other sectors must also be represented in this comprehensive document. In that context  Belarus attaches particular importance to the struggle against human trafficking and the strengthening of the institution of the traditional family. In the light of the significant and recognized advances we have made at the national level  we propose for the consideration of our partners specific  effective  long-term solutions to those vital issues at the global level.We need to be thinking right now about how we will implement the future agenda. We are certain that it should be carried out through the tool of thematic global partnerships. In this day and age of multiple actors and multiple threats  only effective partnerships among States  international organizations  civil society and the private sector can deliver success in addressing global problems. The State must  of course  remain the central pillar among all other partners. Moreover  what is needed is a powerful and responsible State. Only such a State can achieve the long-term complex goals arising from the post-2015 United Nations development agenda.A powerful State often frightens people on the grounds that it may potentially abuse its power and harm the people. But let us take us a look at the other side of that coin. How do people feel when they do not have a powerful State  when there is no one to protect them from resulting chaos  lawlessness and excess? I believe that both the people of Belarus and their neighbours can soberly assess arguments like these and draw the right conclusions. It is no wonder  then  that the world community selects stable and internally coherent States like Belarus to serve as a stage for addressing acute international crises. The people of Belarus very much value stability and successful development. We are convinced that those factors make us a fully responsible stakeholder in the implementation of the future global development agenda.The United Nations should play a special role in implementing the agenda. It is this universal forum where Governments and their partners seek to implement it. We are convinced that the Organization will be able to cope with the task at hand if it successfully adjusts to the constantly emerging realities of life. The issue of the reform and revitalization of the United Nations is as acute as ever  not just in its traditional institutional dimension but also in conceptual terms.As far as the latter is concerned  we believe it necessary to give a serious thought to two problems. First  we need to look for practical solutions to numerous situations where certain United Nations principles contradict each other. Secondly  there is the problem of negative consequences arising from purportedly benign international activities that are often undertaken under a United Nations mandate. Far too often  those activities seek to advance someone’s political goals  and the sponsors care little for the consequences  including chaos  lawlessness and refugee flows. Iraqi Kurdistan  for instance  stands as a typical example of such egotistical policy when it comes to the issue of refugees. We hope that the issue will be tackled ahead of the next United Nations global summit.As we look to the future  we would all be well advised to take to heart the words of the great internationalist who lived during the First World War  American President Woodrow Wilson  who said: “The interests of all nations are our own also. We are partners with the rest. What affects mankind is inevitably our affair.”"
"22",885,"BLZ",69,2014,"On behalf of the Government and the people of Belize  it is with great pleasure that I congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I would also like to take this opportunity to register Belize’s thanks to your predecessor  our own son of Caribbean soil  Mr. John Ashe  who performed his duties superbly this past year and leaves the Organization a legacy of lasting value.Mr. President  your chosen theme for this year’s session  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  is ambitious  hopeful and challenging  and Belize commends you on its selection. In the next 12 months  we will closely monitor and contribute to its crafting and evolution. The stated goal of the new agenda is to promote sustained and inclusive economic growth  safeguard the future of our planet and lead to the achievement of sustainable development  with the eradication of poverty and hunger at its core.Belize views those outcomes as more than aspirational. For us they are imperatives. Failure to attain them will have dire consequences for our nation and people. They call for a transformative mobilization of our societies at the organic level. For that to happen  we must inspire and equip every actor in our societies with the requisite tools for tackling their responsibilities and partaking in the dividends of sustainable economic growth with equity and social justice.The experiences we have had in seeking to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  however  make us less than sanguine that we will have more success with the post-2015 development agenda than we have had in meeting the Millennium Development Goals. We are mindful that the support that some developed Member States pledged to provide for our efforts with the Millennium Development Goals did not materialize in the amounts that were pledged and needed. On the whole  small countries like my own are disadvantaged by their lack of the resources and human  financial  scientific and technological capacities that are prerequisites for succeeding with such ambitious and complex initiatives. Without cooperation and support for addressing those needs from the developed States Members of the United Nations and other multilateral agencies and  crucially  through reform of the policies of the international financial institutions  Belize’s attainment of the post-2015 development agenda will be severely hampered.Looking to the future  Belize welcomes and supports the Assembly’s adoption at its sixty-eighth session of resolution 68/304  “Towards the establishment of a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes”  and hopes it will result in a robust multilateral treaty that will increase the efficiency  stability and predictability of the international financial system. In the wake of the world’s financial meltdown in 2008 and the many disasters that have occurred around the world over the past six years  necessitating large outlays of donor funding to assist the victims of such disasters  there are unmistakable and troubling indications of donor fatigue and a tendency towards isolationism and self-centredness in our global environment  a trend that does not augur well for financing the post-2015 development agenda.Belize nonetheless remains cautiously optimistic. We are encouraged by the pilgrimage to this Hall over the past week of world leaders from nations large and small  friends and foes  allies and enemies. Each spoke from this very rostrum  and each in essence voluntarily reaffirmed the conviction of their respective countries that collective action under these United Nations offers our world the only true hope of dealing successfully with the myriad problems currently afflicting mankind  whether climate change  the dreaded Ebola virus  religious fanaticism  or persistent poverty and underdevelopment.Of those maladies  Belize regards climate change as the most pernicious. While a global consensus seems to have finally been reached as to the causes  as well as the cure  for this apocalyptic phenomenon  the political will of the major emitters to take immediate  concerted and decisive action to combat it is still absent. Indeed  just as our international community was grievously dilatory in taking prompt collective action to prevent the genocidal massacre in Rwanda or the current spread of the Ebola virus in Africa  so the major emitters are being dilatory in confronting the challenges of climate change. It is evident that the threats that epidemics  pandemics and terrorism pose to our planet and humankind pale into insignificance when compared to the existential threats of climate change. Furthermore  it is equally evident that it would not be hyperbole to opine that time is not on our side. Horrendous devastation — caused by extreme droughts  huge conflagrations in our forests  intense rainfall  floods  hurricanes  melting snowcaps  warming seas and sea-level rises  and an awful and frightening increase in pestilence and diseases — is already occurring around the world.Among other things  my own country  Belize  is already experiencing coral bleaching  coastal erosion and flooding  and it is forecast that next year the entire country will be visited by severe drought. The cost of mitigating the damage that is already being done to my country and of adapting to climate change is prohibitive. It is time for the large competing emitters to put aside their mutual suspicion and commit to capping global warming at 1.5°C above preindustrial levels. While my country appreciates the pledges that have already been made to the Green Climate Fund  the amount of money needed to address global warming is exponentially larger. We do  however  remain optimistic that a robust climate change agreement will be signed in Paris in 2015.The development and security needs of nations large and small in this era of globalization have hastened the imperative of regional integration. Indeed  today it is virtually impossible for any nation to function successfully on its own in any sphere of activity. In my own country’s case  the measure of development and security we have enjoyed over the past 33 years  since gaining independence  must be credited in large part to the good relations we continue to have with our partners in the various regional integration groupings to which we belong and the excellent cooperation programmes we share with our bilateral and multilateral partners  prominent among which are the various agencies of the United Nations. However  even as we acknowledge with gratitude the tremendous contributions of our partners to our nation’s security and development  our Government is ever mindful that the primary responsibility for it rests with our Government and people. In that conviction  and given our limited resources  our Government has had to prioritize its areas of intervention. It has concentrated on providing our nation’s basic needs — security  housing  education  health care  employment and wealth generation.Highest on that list of priorities is the importance of safeguarding our country’s security and territorial integrity. Successive Belizean Governments have invested heavily in efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution of the Guatemalan territorial claim over our country. Our Government is unalterably wedded to the peaceful resolution of this claim by adjudication at the International Court of Justice. We have enlisted the support of all our international friends and partners for that decision  and the Guatemalan Government is also committed  through the Special Agreement of 2008  to the resolution of the claim by the International Court of Justice.We are convinced that wars and rumours of war and any kind of international conflict will only bring grief and cause pain  hardship and devastation. That is why we keep working assiduously with our neighbours in the region to cement friendly  peaceful  collaborative and productive relations in order to achieve development for our people. Belize is very pleased by the recent designation by the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States of our entire region as a zone of peace. We also welcome your own call  Mr. President  for the intensification of efforts towards the peaceful settlement of disputes.Domestically  Belize has enjoyed uninterrupted peace and harmony for the past 33 years. Our Government acts with alacrity and sensitivity to defuse any situation that has the potential for civil strife and disorder  and we invest substantially in our security forces  in terms of both capacity-building and equipment and transportation. In our quest for wealth generation  job creation and the attainment of sustainable development  Belize is pursuing  inter alia  the prescriptions articulated in our Horizon 2030 national development plan. In that regard  our Government is working in close concert with economic development experts from the International Monetary Fund  the World Bank  the Inter-American Development Bank and other institutions.Among the initiatives we are pursuing is a comprehensive programme of infrastructure works throughout our country  which includes the upgrading and expanding of major highways; the paving of streets in cities and towns; the installation of new drains in flood-prone areas; and the construction and upgrading of sporting stadiums and recreational community buildings. Those programmes are being executed at a total cost of $100 million.Thanks to the collaboration of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the tremendous support we receive through the Petrocaribe initiative  our Government has been able to invest in infrastructure and social programmes to the benefit of all our citizens. Our Government is cognizant of the importance of good infrastructure to our economic development. Belize is a major exporter of primary products. All our agri-products are transported by road from the farms to the factories and then to the sea ports for export. The aquaculture products and petroleum products we produce are also transported by road to our seaports. All our archaeological sites and many of our tourist resorts are also only accessible by road. It is the expectation of our Government that  with the enhancement of our network of streets and roads  our country will become more attractive to both residents and foreigners  be they tourists or investors  and that this will translate into a rapid expansion in productivity  economic growth and wealth generation.With a view to ensuring that as many Belizean workers as possible obtain employment in the infrastructure works being carried out  the Government has requested all contractors who successfully bid for the works to utilize manual labour wherever it is feasible to do so. The works are providing employment for many Belizean youth  both male and female.As a further initiative to stimulate economic development  our Government inaugurated the very first National Bank of Belize one year ago. The Bank started out modestly. It commenced operations by providing loans primarily to finance the acquisition of homes for middle-class Belizeans. Though the Bank is limited in its offerings  its establishment has resulted in an immediate and dramatic reduction of the interest rates being charged by commercial banks in the country on similar loans. That is a welcome development and a goal that our Government had tried for many years to achieve without success. The new Bank is rapidly building up its customer base and has now started to accept deposits. The prospect for young employed Belizeans to own their own homes at affordable mortgages is now greatly increased. Very many Belizeans are already landed property owners  thanks to an ongoing programme by successive Governments to make land available to them at minimal costs.Our Government is also aggressively promoting foreign direct investment. We have successfully attracted investment in petroleum extraction  agribusiness  renewable energy  tourism and business processes outsourcing.On our Independence Day  21 September 1981  Belize inherited an educational system that was designed to educate citizens for the needs of a remote colonial outpost in the industrial age  the primary economic activity of which was the export of timber and sugar. We have since been making strenuous efforts to transform that system into one capable of satisfying the needs of an independent nation in this  the twenty-first century and the information age. That is proving to be a task fraught with great difficulty. It is also an exceedingly expensive one. Our Government currently spends 26 per cent of our national budget on the education sector. However  that is not nearly enough to cover the cost of the training and education needs of our young nation. We appreciate  however  that the quality of our workforce will be a great determinant in our future development  and that we must therefore do all in our power to make our workforce the very best it can be regardless of the cost and without heeding the sacrifices we will undoubtedly have to make.To that end  our Government is engaged in a number of initiatives aimed at training and educating our population. Among those is a comprehensive teacher training and certification programme. We are resolved to have only teachers trained in pedagogy and in the various subject areas that they are expected to teach in our classrooms. Simultaneously  we are assiduously expanding our education coverage from the pre-primary to the tertiary levels. Indeed  more young people today than at any other time in the history of our nation can afford to obtain an education and can find space in an educational institution near their homes. We are also placing increasing emphasis on vocational and technical education and training and on the teaching of science  technology  engineering and mathematics. We are in the planning stage for a new institute of science and technology  and we are expanding the presence of centres for employment training across the country.Because we possess only two young universities  we make strenuous efforts to gain access to universities and other advanced educational institutions abroad for those of our students who successfully attain the matriculation requirements for entry into those institutions. We have been very successful in that initiative. The vast majority of our students attend those universities on scholarships  thanks to the generosity of our cooperation partners. Every Belizean student  male and female  who attains the requisite matriculation requirement has an equal opportunity to win a scholarship. Current data indicate that our female students are much more successful at winning scholarships than their male counterparts. Our initiatives in the education sector are contributing greatly to the increase in the competence of our workforce at every level  thereby enabling it to produce goods and services that are competitive in the world markets. In order to continue our efforts in that regard  we will need the continued support of the United Nations and its formidable network.Belize currently spends over 13 per cent of the national budget on the health sector. We seek to develop and maintain a healthy and productive population. To that end  our Government is expanding school food programmes countrywide and programmes that allow parents of low-income families to purchase food items at concessionary rates. We know that regular  balanced meals are vital to the health of our population and that it is much less expensive to keep our population healthy than it is to cure it when it is ill.We continue to strengthen our primary health-care network. We continuously upgrade facilities in our hospital and clinics with modern diagnostic equipment. Our flagship public hospital is now benefiting from a significant technological upgrade. We also recently inaugurated a brand-new neonatal wing at that hospital. For the first time in our country’s history  a state-of-the-art facility to cater exclusively to the health needs of our physically challenged children has been built. This facility is the brainchild of the wife of our Prime Minister  who serves as a Special Envoy for Women and Children in Belize. She spearheaded both the raising of the finances for its construction and the supervision of its construction.We take this opportunity also to applaud the efforts of our Special Envoy who  just a few days ago  hosted one of the largest gatherings of First Ladies and Spouses of Heads of State and Government on the subject of the empowerment of women and girls  here at the United Nations. That special event was a universal call to action on the financial health of women and girls based on the Beijing Platform for Action. We call on all Governments and international organizations to support that worthy cause.Belize expanded the coverage of our health insurance scheme in the last budget year and  through our cooperation agreement with the Republic of Cuba  we are significantly increasing the number of our health-care personnel. Indeed  only some three weeks ago we welcomed a contingent of some 35 newly trained Belizean doctors — the largest contingent of doctors ever to return to our country in a single year. Our citizens are our nation’s most valuable resource. We are resolved to invest in them  to enhance their competences and to ameliorate the quality of life of each and every one of them.The victims of global strife and global tragedies are invariably human beings. The United Nations was founded on the determination that no other generation would have to suffer the scourge of war  which we all know brings nothing but death  destruction and sorrow to humankind. Our compact is to promote and protect fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of the human person — all human persons of all nations  large and small.The devastating Ebola virus is increasing exponentially and frighteningly. While we are disappointed that international health agencies did not respond more vigorously and with greater alacrity to the Ebola outbreak many months ago  Belize welcomes the Secretary-General’s United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response.Belize endorses without reservation the call for the Republic of Taiwan to be permitted to participate in the specialized agencies of the United Nations. In this modern day and age  it is incomprehensible that we should want to deny ourselves the benefit of their expertise in dealing with global issues.If we are to remain true to the principle of inclusion as enshrined in our Charter and as promoted in the post-2015 development agenda  we must continue to advocate for the right of the Sahrawi people for self-determination.The indiscriminate killing  maiming and destruction recently meted out to innocent Palestinian civilians  especially helpless women and children  and their possessions  were an affront to decency  morality and humanity. We reiterate our support for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by diplomatic means and for the coexistence of the State of Israel and the State of Palestine in peace and security in their respective pre-1967 international borders  as recognized by the international community.Belize is convinced that any discussion of a future development agenda must include the removal of unilateral harmful practices that stifle and stagnate development  wherever they occur. In that respect  we join the rest of the international community in calling for an end to the anachronistic embargo against Cuba.Belize recognizes that foremost among our development priorities is to ensure the sustainability of the environment  in keeping with our flagship status as a haven for democracy  the promotion and protection of human rights and environmental conservation. We embrace the principle that economic growth should not come at any cost. However  neither should our people have to forgo development to protect the natural environment. We firmly believe that it is a false dichotomy to pit development against the environment. That is why we fully welcome and embrace the principle of sustainable development. Our future and the world’s depend on the entire globe embracing the sustainable development approach."
"23",932,"BOL",69,2014,"Mother Earth and humanity are suffering  stricken by the environmental  climate  financial and food crises generated by an inhumane  predatory capitalism that turns human life and Mother Earth into merchandise. Today we have an historic opportunity to build a new  different world  and we must do so without delay. The post-2015 agenda must express that mandate that Mother Earth and humanity demand of us.We welcome the proposal of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals that incorporates the proposals of Bolivia and the peoples of the world to respect Mother Earth and the concept of harmony with nature. That is not a matter of a simple political statement. It is a commitment shared with the entire world to change our visions of development to a more comprehensive  holistic vision. What we propose to the world is living well  in harmony with Mother Earth  and the construction of a culture of life  complementarity  solidarity and peace.Respect for Mother Earth has been lost. Today she is being marketed and manipulated  causing grave danger to life. Now as at no other time  the premise that man believes himself to be the lord and master of nature is more true than ever. Humankind  encouraged by capitalism  has turned everything into a market  including genetic manipulation and the destruction of human beings.Human and natural life and their happiness should be the reason why any vision  tool or focus for development exists. No vision of development makes sense if it does not respect or strengthen life. Economic growth does not in itself lead to the realization of social rights and good living. The horizon of equality calls for the distribution of wealth and the economic and political empowerment of the poor  the excluded and the marginalized. It calls for strengthening communities and building societies with solidarity  not exclusive societies based on the accumulation of wealth and governed by money  covetousness and the avarice of the market.Together with the Group of 77 and China  I must state the fundamental importance of recovering the sovereignty of our countries and peoples over our natural resources. It is only by recovering control of our natural resources that we will be able to garner greater benefits for our peoples  in particular to eliminate poverty and to invest in economic diversification  industrialization and social programmes.Each country has the right to decide on its priorities and strategies for development  but it is important that those strategies strengthen the environmental functions and the ecosystems of Mother Earth in the framework of complementarity and mutual support between productive systems  communities and nature. It is vital to strike a balance between the rights of Mother Earth  the right to development  the rights of indigenous peoples and social  economic and cultural rights  as well as the right of the poor to emerge from poverty. Complementarity and mutual support  not commercial incentives  are instruments to preserve Mother Earth. On this point we differ from the followers of the so-called green economy.An important issue to be promoted in the framework of the post-2015 agenda is the human right to water and the right of Mother Earth to enjoy water for regenerating and reproducing life. Three billion people today live in areas or regions where the demand for water exceeds its availability  and that reality will worsen as years pass. By 2030 the demand for water will have increased by 30 per cent. In 2050  four billion people will suffer from critical scarcity of water in the context of climate change.In Bolivia  in accordance with human right to water and with our Constitution  and thanks to the national programme known as My Water  we have already reached the Millennium Goals. We did so three years ahead of schedule. Declaring the human right to water means it cannot be privatized. Water is life  and it cannot be an object of profit or commercialization. Likewise  to resolve serious social inequalities  basic services such as water  electricity  telecommunications and basic sanitation  as well as education and health  must be a human right.We have a pending agenda to eradicate poverty and hunger  but for that we must also fight the pitiless  inhumane forces of capital and the market  the omnipresent power of banks and usurers who profit from consumerism and hunger. The so-called vulture funds are an expression of that. They are agents of financial rapine who live off speculation  stealing from developing countries with impunity  taking the bread from the poor  extorting and defrauding with the help of the legal systems of capitalism. They caused the financial crisis and profited from it.We must profoundly change the exclusionary structures of financial institutions  such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. That should be part of the transformation of the world financial architecture. Those organizations cannot be governed only by developed countries  which  through clever financial strategies  blackmail and oppress developing countries  especially the poorest. That is what we call eradicating financial colonialism.In the world there still exists an offensive  abusive reality — the 1.3 billion poor people and more than 800 million who are chronically malnourished — as well as the gaps between the rich and the poor. That is due to an unequal distribution of income  but also to an unequal and discriminatory access to wealth  to the means and factors to live well and to enjoy basic services. The increase in the number of hungry people in the world is due  without doubt  to the financial crisis. If not for that  there would now be 413 million fewer hungry people in the world. But the eradication of hunger and poverty is unthinkable without changing the international financial architecture.The violence of war feeds the darkest interests  such as the geopolitical control of the great Powers and corporations that promote conflicts in order to ensure their imperial or neocolonial interests. Today  it is the economic interests of capital that promote neocolonial wars. With the expense required for war campaigns  humankind could overcome many of its problems  including the Ebola virus  tuberculosis  AIDS or dengue.We have again witnessed the cruelty and barbarity of the genocidal actions of the Government of Israel against the Palestinian civilian population. We have therefore denounced Israel for violating international humanitarian law and universal human rights. We demand an investigation of the crimes committed by Israel in the Gaza Strip. The Plurinational State of Bolivia  like other Latin American countries  agrees on the profound need to reiterate the legitimacy of United Nations resolutions demanding the end of the occupation of the Palestinian territories and the construction of an independent State within the borders existing prior to 4 June 1967. That is why we again reiterate the need to recognize Palestine as a full-fledged Member of the United Nations.As Chair of the Group of 77 and China  I cannot fail to mention the important commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the Group of 77  held on 14 and 15 June in the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra  Bolivia. The Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Group of 77 and China adopted a declaration entitled “For a new world order for living well” (see A/68/948)  which confirms the principles of unity  complementarity and solidarity and the building of a new world order that establishes a more just and democratic system for the benefit of our peoples.We commend the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America-Peoples’ Trade Agreement (ALBA-TCP) on completing 10 years of tireless work towards the integration of peoples. That work goes beyond commercial profit and focuses on promoting the values of cooperation  solidarity and complementarity. In its 10 years  ALBA-TCP has become a major player in Latin America and the world.Since March 2011  150 000 people have died in Syria and 3 million people have fled as refugees to neighbouring countries. Bolivia agrees that the future and destiny of Syria must be determined by the Syrian people themselves in the full exercise of democracy  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.Bolivia condemns and rejects the interference by the United States of America in Iraq that triggered the current crisis in the country. The war unleashed in 2003 against Iraq destabilized the entire region. It was said that Iraq possessed large quantities of weapons of mass destruction. That argument remains one of the biggest lies ever told in the history of imperialism. On the basis of that lie  peaceful coexistence among social  ethnic and religious groups has been destroyed. The situation has given rise to a terrorist group called the Islamic State that is imposing a new war that threatens the entire region. Bolivia rejects the extreme violence with which that terrorist group has acted against civil society and wholeheartedly affirms that nothing justifies fratricidal violence.The invasion of Iraq  together with other historical events  has taught us a lesson that wherever the United States of America intervenes  it leaves destruction  hatred  misery and death in its wake  but it also leaves wealth in the hands of those who profit from the wars: the transnational corporations of the arms industry and the oil industry. We must make use of the culture of peace to eradicate extremist fanaticism  but also the imperial warmongering promoted by the United States  which  faced with war  threatens more war. The United Nations was created to build and promote peace  not to justify wars and invasions.Using war against war is not the same as peace. That is a perverse formula — the formula for death and endless confrontation. We must resolve the structural causes of war: marginalization  poverty  lack of opportunities  cultural and political exclusion  social discrimination  inequality  usurpation and territorial dispossession  ruthless capitalism and dictatorship of the interests of transnational corporations. Every year here we hear Mr. Obama deliver a discourse on war  arrogance and threats against the peoples of the world. It is also a discourse of extremist fanaticism.The economic  commercial and financial blockade imposed by the Government of the United States against Cuba is the main tool of United States policy in its eagerness to destroy the revolution and restore its hegemony over Cuban territory. The blockade against Cuba is the most unjust  severe and prolonged system of unilateral sanctions that has ever been applied against any country. The blockade qualifies an act of genocide. That colonial blockade must be ended immediately.We want to affirm before this Assembly the historic right of the Bolivian people to their access to the sea — a right that was trampled by a brutal invasion promoted by colonial business interests. The colonial imposition  the absence of genuine participatory democracy and the interests of foreign companies were interposed between the Bolivian and Chilean peoples  fraternal peoples who were led to a war favouring the transnationals. Because my country firmly believes in and promotes peace and harmony in our relations with all of our neighbours  we turned to the International Court of Justice in search of dialogue to resolve  peacefully and in good faith  a prolonged dispute over our sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean.Our demand does not seek to alter the international order of the limits and boundaries or to threaten international treaties  as the the Government of Chile would have people believe. On the contrary  Bolivia has invoked international law and its principles to resolve  methodically and in good faith  the issue of its sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. An effective and peaceful solution regarding Bolivia’s sovereign access to the sea would be in the interests of our peoples  the new generations  the region and the whole world. I therefore call on all countries of the United Nations system at this sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly to join us  not only Bolivia  but our neighbour Chile  in this challenge to peace  justice and rule of law.We must eradicate violence and war and denounce the imperialist warmongering of the world Powers that arrogantly believe they embody the ideals of freedom. The imperial Powers use their communication media to manipulate the wills and the emotions of the people. They lie and deceive with impunity. They divide and pit nations and communities against one another to promote wars  control strategic resources and put them at the service of their foreign capitals.This is the century of peace  but peace with sovereignty  with freedom for peoples and not with a free market. This is the century of agreements on liberty  life and peace and not for agreements on free trade in life. There will be no harmony if the arrogance of empires and their renewed colonialism harass  oppress and kill human beings  cultures and the peoples of the world. The empire of finance  the empire of markets  the empire of the arms industry must all fall to give way to the wisdom of life and life in peace and harmony.To summarize with the greatest respect and admiration for the Assembly  I would like to say that if we want to put an end to poverty  if we want to defend life and Mother Earth  our only path is to put an end to the capitalist system and imperious thinking for the well-being of humanity."
"24",979,"BRA",69,2014,"It is a great satisfaction for Brazil  which has the honour and privilege of opening this debate  to have as the President of this session of the General Assembly a son of Africa. As Brazilians we are united by ties of history  culture and friendship with the African continent  whose legacy was and always will be decisive for my country’s national identity.I open this general debate on the eve of elections in Brazil that will determine the President of the Republic  State governors and a significant portion of our Congress. Those elections represent the celebration of a democracy we achieved almost 30 years ago  after two decades of dictatorial rule. Through democracy we also advanced towards the country’s economic stability.During the past 12 years in particular  we have consolidated those achievements by building an inclusive society based on equal opportunity. The great transformation to which we are committed has resulted in a modern economy and a more egalitarian society. At the same time it has required strong civic participation  respect for human rights and a sustainable vision of development. Lastly  it has also required an engagement on the world stage characterized by a multilateral approach  respect for international law  the quest for peace and a culture of solidarity.A few days ago  the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations announced that Brazil is no longer on the World Hunger Map. That transformation is the result of economic policies that have generated 21 million jobs  raised the minimum wage and increased its purchasing power by 71 per cent in the past 12 years. Those policies have also reduced inequality. Since 2003  36 million Brazilians have been lifted out of extreme poverty  22 million of them during my Administration alone. Social policies and income- transfer programmes  coordinated within our plan for a Brazil without extreme poverty  have also contributed to those results. On the health-care front  we have been able to meet our target for reduced child mortality before the deadline set by the Millennium Development Goals.We have also made access to basic primary and middle-school education universally available  and we are now pursuing the same goal for secondary education. We are equally committed to enhancing the quality of education by  inter alia  improving curriculums and raising the profile of teachers. Vocational education has made strides  with the creation of hundreds of new schools and the professional training and development of 8 million young people over the past four years. There has been an unprecedented expansion of higher education  with the establishment of new publicly funded universities and of scholarships and financial aid that has given 3 million students access to private universities. Affirmative-action policies have enabled poor  black and indigenous students to enrol in universities on a massive scale.Finally  our efforts to tackle the challenges of building a knowledge-based society have led to the creation of a programme known as Science Without Borders  which has sent more than 100 000 undergraduate and graduate students to the world’s best universities. Through a presidential initiative  our National Congress has enacted legislation allocating to education 75 per cent of the royalties earned from pre-salt oil exploration and 50 per cent of the social fund generated by pre-salt oil revenues  with 25 per cent of pre-salt oil exploration royalties going to health care. We will thus be able to transform finite resources such as oil and gas into permanent assets — education  science and technology  and innovation. That will be our passport to the future.We have not neglected fiscal discipline and monetary stability  and we have striven to protect Brazil from external volatility. We were thus able to overcome the challenges arising from the major global economic crisis  triggered in 2008 by the collapse of Lehman Brothers  which subsequently developed into national sovereign debt crises affecting many countries. We resisted its worst consequences — unemployment  wage depreciation  erosion of social rights and stalled investment. We followed through with income distribution by stimulating growth and employment and maintaining our investment in infrastructure. Brazil jumped from the thirteenth- to the seventh-largest economy in the world. Our per capita income more than tripled  and inequality fell sharply. In 2002  more than half of Brazil’s population was poor or living below the poverty line; today three out of every four Brazilians are firmly in the middle-class and upper-income ranges. During the economic crisis  when hundreds of millions around the world were left unemployed  Brazil created 12 million new jobs. In addition  we became a primary destination for foreign investment  and we resumed our investment in infrastructure through strong partnerships with the private sector.All of those gains have occurred within the context of a sound fiscal environment. We have reduced our net ratio of public debt to gross domestic product (GDP) from about 60 per cent to 35 per cent. Our gross external debt in relation to GDP fell from 42 per cent to 14 per cent. Our international reserves increased tenfold  making Brazil an international creditor. Our annual inflation rate has also remained within the maximum and minimum range fixed by our current national targets.Although we have managed to fend off the most harmful consequences of the global crisis  we have nonetheless been acutely affected by it in the past few years  owing to the persistence all over the world of substantial economic difficulties that have had a negative effect on our growth. Here I would like to reiterate what I said at the opening of last year’s general debate (see A/68/PV.5). It is vital and urgent that we restore the momentum of the global economy  which should work to drive investment and international trade and reduce inequalities between countries  and not become a factor that ultimately slows economic development and income distribution in society as a whole.Regarding international trade  there must be a unanimous commitment to an action plan leading to the conclusion of the Doha Round. It is also imperative that we end the disparity between the growing importance of developing countries to the global economy and their insufficient representation and participation in the decision-making processes of international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The delay in expanding developing countries’ voting rights in those institutions is unacceptable. The risk to those institutions is that could lose their legitimacy and effectiveness.In July Brazil had the pleasure of hosting the sixth Summit of the BRICS countries  namely  Brazil  Russia  India  China and South Africa. We welcomed their leaders in a fraternal and fruitful meeting that pointed to important possibilities for the future. We signed agreements establishing a new development bank and a contingent reserve arrangement. The bank will cater to the infrastructure financing needs of the BRICS and other developing countries. The contingent reserve arrangement will protect them from financial volatility. Each instrument will have a capital injection of $100 billion.The current generation of world leaders — our generation — is also being called on to deal with significant challenges to peace  collective security and the environment. We have been unable either to solve old disputes or to prevent new threats. It is impossible to eliminate the underlying causes of conflict through the use of force. That has been made clear by the persistence of the Palestine question  the systematic massacre of the Syrian people  the tragic national fragmentation of Iraq  the serious insecurity in Libya  the conflicts in the Sahel and the clashes in Ukraine. Instead of leading to peace  every military intervention has worsened those conflicts. We are witnessing the tragic proliferation of civilian victims and humanitarian disasters. We cannot allow such barbaric acts to increase and violate our ethical  moral and civilizational values. Nor can we remain indifferent to the spread of the Ebola virus in West Africa. We therefore support the Secretary-General’s proposal to establish a United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response. Brazil is solidly in favour of it.The Security Council has had some difficulties in promoting peaceful solutions to those conflicts. To overcome such stalemates  a genuine reform of the Council will be required  a process that has been dragging on for quite some time. The coming seventieth anniversary of the United Nations  in 2015  appears to be an occasion conducive to achieving the progress that the situation currently calls for. I am quite certain that we all understand the serious risks arising from paralysis and inaction in the Security Council. A more representative and legitimate Security Council would also be more effective.I wish to underscore that we cannot possibly remain indifferent to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis  particularly after the recent dramatic events in Gaza. We condemn the disproportionate use of force that has strongly victimized the civilian population  especially women and children. The conflict must be properly resolved  not precariously managed  as has been the case up to now. Effective negotiations between the parties must ultimately lead to a two-State solution with Palestine and Israel living side by side in security within internationally recognized borders.Amid so many conflict situations  Latin America and the Caribbean seek to face up to the main problem that has marked our region for centuries. I am talking about social inequality. Democratic roots have become stronger  and the demand for more just  inclusive and sustainable growth has grown ever stronger. Through the Union of South American Nations  the Common Market of the South  and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  integration efforts have made tremendous headway.Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our times. To overcome that challenge  we need a sense of urgency  political courage and a keen understanding that actors have to contribute according to the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities. The recent Climate Summit  which was convened in a very timely manner by the Secretary-General  further invigorated negotiations at the level of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.The Brazilian Government will strive to ensure that the outcome of the negotiations will lead to a balanced  fair and effective agreement. Brazil has been doing its part to face up to the challenge of climate change. In 2009  during the Copenhagen Conference  we committed to a voluntary reduction of 36 to 39 per cent of our projected emissions by 2020. Between 2010 and 2013  we avoided releasing into the atmosphere an average of 650 million tons of carbon dioxide every year. Throughout those years  we achieved the lowest deforestation rates in our history. In the past decade  we have reduced deforestation by 79 per cent  without giving up our agenda of economic development and social inclusion.We have therefore shown that it is possible to grow  to include  to preserve and to protect. Such an achievement stems from the continuous and steadfast commitment of the Brazilian Government  civil society and other public and private stakeholders. We hope that developed countries  which have not only the legal but also a political obligation to lead by example  will unequivocally and concretely demonstrate their commitment to combat this problem that affects us all.At the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro  we were proud to set the foundations for a new development agenda  based on sustainable development goals applicable to both developing and developed nations. It will be crucial for us to identify the means of implementation that correspond to the magnitude of the challenges that we have committed ourselves to overcoming. We must be ambitious when it comes to financing  cooperation  national capacity-building and technology transfer  especially to ensure that the least developed countries benefit. Let me underscore  in that context  the need to establish a mechanism for the development  transfer and dissemination of clean  environmentally sustainable technologies.In addition to sustainable development and peace  the international order that we seek to build must be anchored on fundamental values. Among those values  emphasis should be put on efforts to combat all forms of discrimination and exclusion. We have a clear-cut commitment to the empowerment of women in the labour market  liberal professions  entrepreneurship  political activity and access to education  among others. My Administration has tirelessly fought violence against women in all its forms. We consider the twenty-first century to be the century of women.By the same token  the promotion of racial equality seeks to compensate Brazilians of African descent for the consequences of the centuries of slavery to which they were subjected. Today  those Brazilians account for more than half of our population. We owe them our rich and permanent legacy of cultural  religious and human wealth and values. For us  racial miscegenation is a matter of pride. Racism is not only a heinous and extremely serious crime  but it is also a scourge that we have not hesitated to fight  punish and eradicate.The same commitment that we have had to combat violence against women and African Brazilians  we have also had against homophobia. My country’s Supreme Court has recognized same-sex civil unions  thereby ensuring them the full range of civil rights arising therefrom. We firmly believe in the dignity of all human beings and in the universal nature of their fundamental rights. Those rights must be protected from all double standards and all forms of politicization  both domestically and internationally.Yet another fundamental value is the respect for public good. We all face a relentless fight against corruption. History has shown that there is only one correct and efficient way to tackle corruption; that is by ending impunity  thereby strengthening institutions that oversee  investigate and punish acts of corruption  money-laundering and other financial crimes. That is a responsibility incumbent upon each Government  a responsibility that Brazil has fulfilled by strengthening our institutions.In Brazil  we have designed and built a Government transparency portal website that gives citizens access to all information on Government spending within 24 hours after monies are spent. We have also adopted a law on access to information  which allows all Brazilian citizens the right to access Government data  except for that related to the country’s national sovereignty. We have strengthened and given autonomy to investigators as well as to those in charge of internal Government controls. We have passed laws that punish not only those who actively engage in corruption but also those who passively agree with acts of corruption. Strengthening those institutions is absolutely crucial for strengthening open and democratic governance. Brazil’s recent re-election to the Executive Committee of the Open Government Partnership will also allow us to contribute to promoting more transparent Governments worldwide.It is essential that measures be taken to effectively protect human rights  not only in the real world but also in the virtual world  as stated in resolution 68/167 on privacy in the digital age  adopted by the General Assembly in the past year. Brazil and Germany promoted an important discussion on the matter in 2013. We intend to deepen that discussion during this sixty-ninth session. For our review of such matters  the 2013 annual report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  published in May 2014  can provide significant inputs. In September 2013  I proposed from this rostrum (see A/68/PV.5) that a civil framework be development for the governance and use of the Internet  a framework based on the principles of freedom of expression  privacy  network neutrality and cultural diversity. I am pleased to note that the international community has  since then  mobilized its efforts to enhance the current Internet governance architecture. Brazil’s initiative to hold the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  NETmundial  in São Paulo in April was an important step in the process. The Meeting brought together stakeholders from various regions of the world and from multiple sectors. Discussions were held on the principles that should be followed and the actions to be undertaken in order to ensure that the Internet will continue to develop in an open  democratic  free  multisectoral and multilateral manner.The United Nations and its Member States have before them today challenges of great magnitude  which should be the priorities of this session of the General Assembly. The year 2015 must be a turning point. I am certain that we will not shy away from fulfilling  with a sense of courage and insight  our lofty responsibilities to build an international order founded on the promotion of peace  sustainable development  poverty eradication and the reduction of inequality. Brazil stands ready and is fully determined to contribute to that end."
"25",1023,"BRB",69,2014,"It is indeed a distinct privilege to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa on behalf of the Government and the people of Barbados on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. It is appropriate that I also commend his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. John Ashe  for the aplomb with which he guided the deliberations of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.The theme of this year’s Assembly — “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda” — is both timely and critical. Fourteen years ago  world leaders placed the Millennium Development Goals  a set of time-bound and measurable goals and targets  at the heart of the global development agenda. Today  we stand on the cusp of the unveiling of a future global agenda for development. This must be an ambitious  long-term project to improve people’s lives and protect the planet for future generations. The 17 goals and targets proposed by the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals must form the basis for the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda. This is especially so if we are to create a truly transformative global programme anchored in the three dimensions of sustainable development  with poverty eradication as its central objective and overarching goal.The special vulnerabilities faced by small island developing States (SIDS) and which serve to constrain our development are well known. As such  the international community recognized SIDS as a special case in sustainable development in Agenda 21 — a recognition that is echoed in the Barbados Programme of Action; the Mauritius Strategy  the outcome document (resolution 66/288  annex) of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20); and  most recently  the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action (Samoa Pathway).Despite that recognition  the Rio+20 outcome document indicated that SIDS have made less progress than most other groupings  or even regressed  in economic terms  especially in terms of poverty reduction and debt sustainability. This finding was repeated in the Samoa Pathway. The International Monetary Fund has also acknowledged that  in the past 10 years  SIDS have slid down the ladder of progress.In design  delivery and implementation  therefore  the post-2015 development agenda must as a priority address the unique and particular vulnerabilities and challenges of small island developing States. It must foster the resilience of SIDS as a key objective of global efforts. A development agenda that ignores the integration of SIDS-specific issues would be incomplete and of questionable validity.The post-2015 development agenda must also make provisions for countries like Barbados  which is both a small island developing State and a highly indebted middle-income country. We continue to suffer the devastating impact of the global economic and financial crisis and have limited scope  capacity  fiscal flexibility or policy space to respond effectively to them. We face declining export demand and decreased investment and demand for services upon which our economy is dependent  including tourism. Fiscal and financial stresses have forced us to make significant adjustments to our expenditure programmes. Against that backdrop  we face the daunting challenge of continuing to provide adequate social safety nets for the most vulnerable of our citizens in a responsible and sustainable manner.Debt servicing and debt unsustainability far too easily undermine the advances that we desire to make towards our sustainable development. Too often  the plight of middle-income countries is overlooked on the presumption that by virtue of our gross domestic product (GDP) per capita we do not require international assistance. Barbados emphatically restates that GDP per capita cannot be the sole defining criterion for access to concessionary financing. The social  economic and environmental vulnerability of countries such as ours must be taken into account.Barbados is therefore pleased to see that the United Nations Development Programme’s Human Development Report 2014  entitled “Sustaining Human Progress: Reducing Vulnerabilities and Building Resilience”  incorporates the concept of vulnerability and places emphasis on strengthening the resilience of people  communities and countries. It is our hope that those factors will give a more accurate picture of the challenges that developing countries face. On that issue  the Prime Minister of Barbados  Mr. Freundel Stuart  stated in his address at the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  held in Samoa in September  that“the time has come for new approaches to be designed to assist middle-income countries which have been graduated from access to concessional resources”.I echo that call today. I implore the international community to address the needs of middle-income countries in the elaboration of a post-2015 development agenda. Accordingly  Barbados welcomes the third International Conference on Financing for Development  to be held in Addis Ababa in July next year. The outcome of the Conference must make provisions for the special needs of SIDS and middle-income countries.Barbados is fully cognizant of the responsibility that developing countries themselves bear towards achieving their development goals. However  the reality is that  in seeking to meet those goals  the developing countries are forced to do so on an uneven playing field. The global financial and economic system and the governance process that accompanies it continue to operate in an exclusionary manner. Barbados reiterates its call for a more transparent architecture that is supportive of development objectives.Barbados has developed and implemented a cross-sectoral Green Economy Initiative  which is predicated on the fragility of our small island ecosystems. The Initiative prioritizes natural resource protection intervention  business and investment choice  human development programming and the facilitation of export market development strategies. Barbados continues to partner with the United Nations Environment Programme and  more recently  the United Nations Industrial Development Organization to promote a transition to a resource-efficient green economy. We have taken action to enact a series of incentives in support of renewable energy and energy efficiency.Our efforts to transition to a green economy will be undone if the international community does not take immediate and urgent action to address climate change. The most recent findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change underscore  yet again  the vulnerability of SIDS  particularly to the effects of climate change  sea-level rise  ocean acidification and extreme weather events. Together  they represent an existential threat to SIDS. We therefore urge major carbon emitters to take all necessary actions.Barbados welcomed the holding of the Secretary-General’s Climate Summit 2014 at United Nations Headquarters on 23 September. We hope that the momentum from the Summit will inject urgency into the proceedings of the upcoming twentieth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 20)  to be held in Lima in December. We also hope that  beyond COP 20  it will ultimately galvanize political will to conclude the negotiation of an ambitious  legally binding international climate agreement in Paris in 2015.If SIDS are to have an impact internationally  particularly at this crucial moment during the design and construction of a new global architecture for sustainable development  we must ensure that our voices are heard. We must be guided by the concept of a SIDS collectivity that recognizes strength in unity. We SIDS must speak with one voice at the international level.Any discussion on the creation of a new global sustainable development agenda must have at its core the means of implementation. Indeed  the means of implementation must be the foundation on which the agenda is based. We know that MDG 8  global partnership for development  remains one of the least fulfilled of all of the Millennium Development Goals. The international community can therefore ill afford to let the new development agenda fail as a result of a lack of adequate and reliable means to implement it. The means of implementation must encompass far more than financing. As we use the sixty-ninth session to complete the framework of the post-2015 development agenda  it is incumbent upon us to ensure that definitive and durable partnerships are made to facilitate the following elements — first  the provision of adequate financial and other resources; secondly  fair trade and market access; and thirdly  technology transfer and capacity-building  particularly in the area of data collection and statistical analysis.My country sees peace and security as enablers and indicators of sustainable development. They constitute indispensable prerequisites for human  social and economic development  as well as for progress and prosperity. Barbados therefore views the continuing crises and armed conflicts  including those in the Central African Republic  South Sudan  Syria  Iraq and Ukraine  with grave concern. Indeed  we view them with grave alarm. Armed non-State actors and terrorist groups continue to destroy lives  destabilize nations and threaten national and international peace and security.In the face of such hostilities and blatant acts of aggression  the Security Council has been paralysed. Barbados will continue to be actively engaged within the Caribbean Community in negotiations on the reform of the Security Council. We applaud Ambassador Ashe  former President of the General Assembly  for his initiative to move discussions on the issue forward. We also welcome the summary of the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform prepared by the Chair of the Open-ended Working Group. Barbados calls on all Member States to work assiduously during the current session to make substantial progress  if not to finalize  the decades-long project of Security Council reform.My country reiterates its commitment to democracy and the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We welcome the discussions that will take place during this session on the responsibility to protect. Our position is motivated by principle and objectivity  and we have no desire to see the issue politicized.The Ebola outbreak constitutes a public-health emergency of international concern and a threat to global security. It also threatens the peacebuilding and development gains of the countries most affected. It is our sincere hope that the recently adopted Security Council resolution 2177 (2014) and General Assembly resolutions 69/1 and 69/3 will accelerate the mobilization of resources to assist the affected countries and halt the epidemic.Barbados has long supported a negotiated two-State solution to the question of Palestine  the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and their right to live in peace and security in a Palestinian State within pre-1967 borders. Barbados’s position is that the State of Israel has a right to exist and the people of Israel have a right to live in security and to do so with the full and undisputed recognition of the rest of the world. The Palestinians are also entitled to enjoy the fruits of prosperity within their own sovereign State. This year’s unprecedented escalation of the crisis in Palestine revealed  yet again  the urgent need to reach a durable  negotiated solution  and we call on all parties to rededicate themselves to achieving that aim.The long-standing economic embargo on Cuba continues to be of serious concern to Barbados. The Government of Cuba has always demonstrated a willingness to assist the Caribbean  and indeed the developing world  in our quest for development. We join with the overwhelming majority of States Member of the United Nations in opposing that unilateral action and look forward to a time — the sooner  the better — when it will be relegated to the pages of history.In closing  Barbados believes that there is an inextricable link among development  international peace and security. As we stated in 1993  within the context of an “Agenda for Peace” “Where access to food  clothing  shelter  education  health and the opportunity for gainful employment is denied  democracy cannot flourish” (A/48/PV.26  p. 11).We also hold the converse to be true. There can be no real development without respect for human rights  the rule of law and democracy. We hope that much of the time and energy of this body at its sixty-ninth session will be spent on delivering a post-2015 development agenda that will redound to the benefit of us all. Barbados will continue to be in the vanguard of that effort."
"26",1055,"BRN",69,2014,"Allow me to join earlier speakers in offering my congratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. My thanks also go to our outgoing President  Mr. John Ashe  for his excellent work over the past year  especially his contribution to the discussions on the post-2015 development agenda. I offer my profound appreciation to the many United Nations officials  peacekeepers and volunteers in the field who often work in the most difficult conditions and put their lives at risk.It is also fitting to offer our thanks and gratitude to the Secretary-General and his team for tirelessly promoting the cause of this world body  especially with respect to urgent matters affecting the livelihoods and security of our peoples. I also deeply appreciate his personal support at the fifth summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the United Nations held in Brunei Darussalam last year.Today is a special occasion for me personally and for Brunei Darussalam as a nation. It marks the thirtieth anniversary of our membership in the Organization. Looking back  the world then was ideologically divided. Now we are linked by globalization and interdependence  searching for a united approach to addressing the many challenges faced by the human race. As we confront old and new problems  I believe the United Nations is best placed to address them collectively. That is its strength  a fact that is evident today as we strive to realize the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).We are fast approaching the deadline of the MDGs  and we in Brunei Darussalam are pleased to see that there is concerted global commitment and consensus with respect to eradicating extreme poverty and further promoting peace and sustainable development. Brunei Damssalam actively contributes to regional and international efforts in the areas of training and capacity-building through the Initiative for ASEAN Integration and through collaboration with the United States in an English enrichment programme for ASEAN. Similar undertakings have also been carried out through the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation.The work of the United Nations and its relevant stakeholders in leading the way forward beyond 2015 is indeed laudable. I am encouraged by the fact that we have accomplished a great deal in the current initiative. We have also learned many valuable lessons that will help carry us through our journey in the coming decades. It is reassuring to know that extensive discussions and wide-ranging consultations have been conducted to shape a universal framework for delivering and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda. I therefore welcome the new development agenda and its emphasis on the importance of a human development process that is inclusive  people-centred and sustainable.Those elements are also integral to Brunei Darussalam’s National Vision 2035  which is dedicated to improving the welfare of our people and ensuring a high quality of life. I am also pleased that there is unanimous agreement on the importance of protecting the environment. In that regard  I greatly value the convening of the United Nations climate summit to galvanize support for addressing the impact of climate change and in ensuring a dynamic and sustainable post-2015 development agenda.However  the full realization of our noble expressions for the near future and the decades to come faces many obstacles. The international and regional situation continues to be threatened by instability  injustices  social and economic inequalities and increasingly frequent occurrences of natural disasters. While there is relative peace and stability in the world  developments over the past year have reminded us of how complex security issues can cause turmoil and instability that threaten progress in long-term development. We are gravely concerned with security developments in many parts of the world. Further escalation of conflicts can weaken the international community’s resolve and ability to work together to achieve our worldwide initiatives.For its part  Brunei Darussalam has participated in United Nations peacekeeping  specifically in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and other international peace monitoring missions  such as our work in the southern Philippines. We remain committed to such endeavours.The overall outlook is further complicated by challenges that are global in nature  ranging from the impact of climate change  extremism and terrorism to the serious repercussions of pandemic diseases. Brunei Darussalam stands united with the international community in combating terrorism in all its forms and in rejecting extremism. We support all regional and international efforts to counter terrorism  and we will continue to participate in global initiatives such as interfaith dialogues and dialogues among civilizations designed to promote understanding  tolerance and respect among world communities.I call on every nation to take concerted action in working to ensure that the rapid pace of globalization and interconnectedness brings wide-ranging benefits to all our peoples and communities. In securing the positive aspects of globalization  as a community of nations we must work closely together. We must renew our approach to governance and strengthen our cooperation  especially in resolving new issues that require collective global action and unity of purpose. I would like to emphasize the importance of a comprehensive approach  especially when it comes to ensuring peace and security. Our peoples’ quality of life can be further enhanced only through inclusive economic development and equitable social progress.At the same time  all our efforts to develop our economies should not work to the detriment of our natural environment. These are areas that demand renewed commitment  partnership and creativity on the part of our global community. I would also like to underscore the importance of strengthening our capabilities in disaster management. The frequent recurrence and growing intensity of natural disasters in recent years have caused great destruction and hardship to many communities around the world. Last year  Brunei Darussalam hosted a humanitarian assistance and disaster relief exercise for military personnel from across the Asia-Pacific region  the first such event of its kind under the auspices of the ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting Plus process. During the exercise  I was very inspired as I witnessed the close cooperation and unity shown by the diverse range of participants from different nations  cultures and backgrounds  all striving together to practise saving lives.Such regional efforts are just a modest step. More important  the fundamental principles of mutual respect and trust  putting aside differences  upholding the rule of law and justice and promoting cooperation should serve as the basis for resolving conflicts  so that we can all enjoy continued peace and stability. In the same spirit  I also hope that we can overcome our differences and move forward in further opening up global trade.All our efforts to achieve the MDGs will be in vain if  at the same time  we disregard our commitment to pursuing peaceful means of settling disputes  as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The escalation of disputes and threats to international peace and security has resulted in appalling human tragedies such as the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 and the current dire situation in Gaza. Although the prospects of all-out war seem remote today  instances of worsening situations  skirmishes and brinkmanship have shown us all too well how threats of conflict and violence remain an obstacle to our long-term aspirations for a better world. For Palestine  freedom and justice are long overdue. The cycle of suffering experienced by our Palestinian brothers and sisters is a stark example of how little our development goals mean if there is no peace or stability. The Palestinian people must be granted their basic right to live in dignity and enjoy economic development. We are encouraged by the observance of the current ceasefire by the parties involved  and I greatly appreciate the efforts of other countries that have made that possible.Looking to the future  I remain hopeful. I still firmly believe that we need this Organization in order to ensure that generations to come will enjoy a secure and prosperous future. The world has changed fundamentally since the adoption of the MDGs  and I am confident that the United Nations will continue to be a source of hope. It is important that all States do everything they can to contribute positively to our Organization."
"27",1096,"BTN",69,2014,"I wish to begin by conveying the warm greetings of His Majesty the King of Bhutan. It is an honour for me to be present in this grand assembly of nations. Great men and women of our time have graced this rostrum. Yet the magnitude of the challenges we are called on to address today remains formidable — greater than any person or any country we represent.The United Nations was founded to unlock the potential of our collective endeavour to promote the peace  prosperity and progress of succeeding generations of humankind. As we approach the seventieth anniversary of the founding of our Organization  the considerable gains we have made on the social  economic and political fronts give us many reasons to be hopeful. However  we continue to be confronted by grave challenges. They include the festering wounds of age-old conflicts that threaten to spin out of control; new tensions and the resurgence of violent extremism; the irrefutable evidence of the menace posed by climate change to life on our planet; and the unconscionable inequities and injustices that contribute to the fact that millions are deprived of such basic needs as food and shelter. All of these are compelling issues that remind us that we have yet to heed the tragic lessons of the past  and that we are far from realizing the world envisaged in the Charter of the United Nations.We commend the President for his choice of the theme for this session  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”. This is an opportune moment to redefine a new era in international development and cooperation  one that can build on the successes and shortcomings of more than three decades of internationally agreed development goals  and the Millennium Development Goals in particular. The process must activate real and meaningful change for all countries if it is indeed to be transformative. For this to happen  the agenda must be anchored to the need for breakthroughs to address the hard realities on the ground in individual countries  especially with regard to capacity and financing for development.Accordingly  a collaborative approach  based on an appreciation of the unique circumstances and experience of each country and driven by the desire for true working partnerships among and within countries  will be vital. Such an approach would require changes in our development paradigm  in our beliefs regarding the sustainability of the world’s current trajectory  and in our behaviour as individuals  which shape our national character and our destiny as an international community of nations.A small  least developed  landlocked country like mine  with many less-than-ideal indicators  has to get its development priorities right. Given our small size and unique circumstances  the lessons Bhutan has learned are not universal  but certain principles may have relevance. It is in a spirit of humility and modesty that we share our experience and aspirations.First and foremost  we believe that development must be guided by a clear  home-grown vision. Ours  championed by successive monarchs  identifies people’s welfare and happiness as its central objective. Secondly  it takes good governance to unlock the full potential of a country and its people in the pursuit of effective development and peace. Thirdly  within the broader development objective  the eradication of poverty must remain an overarching aim. Eliminating the scourge of poverty must therefore form the central purpose of the post-2015 development agenda.Fourthly  strong partnerships are the key to delivering on the post-2015 development agenda. In our experience  nurturing and maintaining strong partnerships with our donors  based on trust and mutual respect  has been critical to our progress. Last but not least  there is the conservation of the environment  which is related to the issue of sustainability. A decent standard of living  with adequate education  health care and employment  is essential for people to live with self-respect  dignity and hope. But if the most basic necessities of life  air  water and food are polluted and contaminated  a decent standard of living is unsustainable. The wanton exploitation of natural resources  without any care for the health of our planet  clearly cannot go on.In a world riven by challenges of epic proportions  the centrality of the United Nations as the only truly global organization cannot be overemphasized. Yet efforts to reform its highest organ  the Security Council  remain deadlocked. While a consensus-based decision is the most desirable way forward in multilateralism  we cannot allow its absence to obstruct progress indefinitely  especially in the crucial area of peace and security.We are heading into a momentous year during which the international community will craft a new development agenda that will lay the framework for transformational change and shared prosperity. In the final analysis  no matter what brilliant concepts we introduce and breakthroughs we achieve on paper  nothing of lasting value can be achieved without a transformation of mindsets and hearts. It is there  perhaps  in our hearts and minds that we really need a paradigm shift.In the words of His Majesty the King of Bhutan:“This is a world that is shared  not between Governments and nations but among the peoples. No nation today can stand alone in achievement. There can be no lasting national progress if it does not fit into a future of global peace  harmony and prosperity. The world must progress together or fail together.”"
"28",1137,"BWA",69,2014,"It is a singular honour and privilege for me to address this gathering of the international community. Allow me  on behalf of His Excellency the President of the Republic of Botswana  Lieutenant General Seretse Khama Ian Khama  to join other delegations in extending our warmest congratulations to the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We are confident that his vast experience and dedicated service to the Government and people of Uganda will contribute significantly to the successful conclusion of this session. My delegation and I wish him every success as he embarks on this new responsibility of steering the work of the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We also extend fitting tribute to his predecessor  His Excellency Ambassador John Ashe  for his sterling leadership of the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We commend him for his tireless efforts to overcome many of the challenges confronting the international community today.My delegation welcomes the theme that the President has chosen for the current general debate  namely  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”. We consider it both pertinent and timely  especially as it coincides with ongoing efforts by Member States to formulate a new global development agenda to succeed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We shall tirelessly work with the President and the international community as we define the post-2015 development agenda. The priorities that the President has laid out for this session of the Assembly  that is  the issues of climate change  poverty eradication  the empowerment of women and gender equality  the rule of law and international peace and security  are among the most critical and central to the success and sustainability of a global development agenda.As we draw the curtain on the Millennium Development Goals  it is important that we reflect on our successes and failures in order to draw vital lessons from our experience. The global community  most notably in the developing world  has faced significant challenges in fully realizing the MDGs. That has resulted in many of our countries failing to deliver tangible development achievements to their citizens  as cogently set out in the MDGs  despite their best efforts and intentions. We continue to witness intolerable levels of poverty  disease  economic stagnation and environmental degradation  as well as other drawbacks  precipitated in large part by natural disasters and severe resource and capacity constraints.While Botswana has made impressive gains in the implementation of the MDGs  it has not been without enormous challenges  chief among which were resource and capacity constraints. The Botswana Government has strived to achieve the MDGs and improve the quality of life of its citizens by allocating a substantial percentage of the national budget to the sectors with significant bearing on the country’s development  including education  health  infrastructure  the development of human capital  and women and youth empowerment. Botswana continues to make every effort  in the remaining time before the target 2015 completion date  to finish the unfinished business remaining from the MDGs  especially Goals 4 and 5  relating to infant and maternal mortality.The outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus disease  evolving  as it did  into a public health catastrophe  is a serious setback to the achievement of the MDGs. We therefore implore the Assembly to call on all partners and organizations of goodwill to spare no effort in rescuing the West African region from that scourge.The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development of 2012 mapped a clear and strategic path for the achievement of global sustainable development  calling for an inclusive and transformative agenda that integrates the three pillars of sustainable development  namely  economic  social and environmental protection.Botswana has keenly followed the work of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  which has had as its primary objective the formulation of a single  transformative and global development agenda  as mandated by the Rio+20 outcome document. We are highly encouraged by the spirit of consultation and the collective will and commitment of the international community to craft an ambitious yet inclusive  measurable and sustainable set of goals  which should inspire and challenge us all to excel in our quest for the attainment of the future we want. I commend the co-Chairs of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals for their exceptional performance in driving the negotiation process to its logical conclusion. We look forward to the intergovernmental negotiations on the broader post-2015 development framework  which will begin during this session of the General Assembly. I assure the Assembly of our fullest cooperation and constructive engagement in those deliberations.My delegation will actively participate in all deliberations on the key development priorities outlined by the Secretary-General  in particular the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda. However  there are issues of major strategic importance to Botswana. They include climate change  landlocked developing countries  middle-income countries  countries in special situations and issues of peace and security and the advancement of human rights.On climate change  Botswana knows only too well the devastating effects of that phenomenon  which continues to cause extreme temperatures  changes in the patterns of rainfall  land degradation  desertification and persistent droughts. In that regard  we believe that addressing those problems should be a primary consideration in the current deliberations on the post-2015 sustainable development agenda. We therefore look forward to the twentieth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Lima this year  which is supposed to lay the foundation for a legally binding agreement for adoption at the next Conference of the Parties in Paris. We commend the Secretary-General for his initiative in convening the recently concluded Climate Change Summit  which successfully injected much-needed political momentum into the process as we move towards 2015.As a middle-income  landlocked developing country with particular vulnerabilities  we also strongly hope for a comprehensive account of those issues in the post-2015 development agenda. We welcome the 10-year review of the Almaty Programme of Action  to be held in November in Vienna  which will broadly consider effective mechanisms for addressing the vulnerabilities of landlocked developing countries. We hope that  during the review  special attention will also be given to countries with ever-increasing elephant populations  whose numbers not only give rise to serious animal-human conflict  but also devastate the very environment that the elephants depend on for their survival. Botswana has the largest elephant population in Africa.On issues of social development  I am delighted to inform the Assembly that Botswana is making steady progress in eradicating abject poverty  as a result of the implementation of the national poverty eradication strategy that was launched in 2010. Furthermore  we have been able to achieve universal primary education and access to HIV/AIDS treatment  care and support services. However  challenges remain on the issues of maintaining quality in education and general services.Financial support  technology transfer and capacity-building must invariably be factored into the post-2015 development agenda discussions. Failing that  our efforts towards poverty eradication and sustainable development will be rendered futile. We keenly await the adoption of the new development agenda  which will  we trust  support our individual and collective efforts to deliver our shared aspirations of a safe  secure and prosperous world for both present and future generations.Threats to international peace and security continue to be among the greatest challenges to human development. Botswana is gravely concerned about the increasing trend of instability  insecurity and violent conflict in various parts of the world. We are currently witnessing unimaginable levels of human suffering  with thousands of innocent lives being lost and the world hurtling precipitously towards calamitous levels of humanitarian crises.The Palestine/Israel conflict and the protracted brutal war in Syria defy human imagination. In Africa  the frequent eruption of violent conflicts in certain parts of our continent  now particularly in South Sudan and the Central African Republic  are distressing. Regrettably  Iraq is also under siege by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and the Nusra Front. Those terrorist groups threaten not only the stability and security of the Middle East  but the maintenance of international peace and security at large.Not only are we failing as nation States to exercise our duty and responsibility to protect populations from war crimes and crimes against humanity  we in effect inadvertently acquiesce in the annihilation of future generations. Last June  Botswana and the Netherlands co-hosted the fourth meeting of the Global Network of Focal Points on the Responsibility to Protect  in an effort to further consolidate that fundamental principle  which promotes our individual and collective sense of responsibility towards our citizens.While such efforts may be effective in terms of awareness-raising  swift and decisive action remains the domain of the Security Council. It is therefore incumbent upon members of the Security Council to demonstrate exemplary leadership and a genuine regard for their Charter responsibilities to maintain international peace and security  as mandated by Article 24 of the Charter. Botswana is deeply disappointed and concerned that some permanent members of the Security Council consistently thwart any efforts to find lasting solutions to conflict situations. Surely  responsible members of the international community would not  and should not  abdicate their solemn responsibility and allow the Council to be seemingly impelled into a state of grim paralysis as the world burns towards extinction. Just this past May  the Council failed to adopt a draft resolution seeking to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court (ICC). Needless to say  that was nothing short of a travesty of international criminal justice.Botswana’s commitment to an effective international criminal justice system remains steadfast. To that end  we continue to support the independence and credibility of the ICC as the only existing international judicial mechanism available for the investigation and prosecution of genocide  war crimes  crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. However  the role of the Security Council in facilitating the work of the ICC cannot be over-emphasized. It is our sincere hope that  going forward  reason and basic human compassion will prevail in Council decisions aimed at eliminating threats to international peace and security and at fostering a global culture of judicial accountability  inclusive governance  the rule of law and respect for human rights. In that regard  Botswana welcomes the French initiative regarding voluntary restraint on the use of the veto by the permanent members of the Security Council in situations of mass atrocities.Botswana also commends those countries  human rights defenders and humanitarian organizations that have valiantly contributed to efforts to relieve human suffering wherever it occurred around the world. We especially applaud Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his unwavering commitment to the pursuit of international peace and security  including addressing the plight of vulnerable groups in society  such as women and children.Let me conclude by reiterating and reaffirming Botswana’s commitment to the principles and ideals of the United Nations as enshrined in the Charter. We remain steadfast and resolute in our obligation as a member of the international community to contribute  in our own small way  to the creation of a peaceful  secure and prosperous world for all."
"29",1180,"CAF",69,2014,"It is an honour and a legitimate source of pride for me to speak from this rostrum on behalf of my country  the Central African Republic  on the occasion of the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly of our shared Organization.I would like first to address  on behalf of the delegation that is accompanying me and in my own name  my warm congratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Uganda  for his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. My congratulations also go to Mr. John Ashe  who successfully presided over the Assembly at its sixty-eighth session  during which the situation in my country was widely debated and was subject to numerous resolutions of the Security Council.I would especially like to express all my gratitude and that of the people of the Central African Republic to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his dynamism and commitment to my country  a commitment that was embodied in his April visit to Bangui.It is also especially important for me to solemnly address members in this Hall to express the profound gratitude of the Central African people for the international community’s unwavering and tireless commitment to my country in distress. That recognition goes especially to the Heads of State of the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC)  the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS)  the African Union  European Union  and the countries of the International Mediation under the leadership of President Denis Sassou Nguesso of the Republic of the Congo. It also extends to France and its President for their dogged determination  and to the United States of America and members of the International Contact Group on the Central African Republic for their renewed and unflagging support for the transition authorities in my country.The sixty-ninth session is being held at a time when my country is still experiencing a worrying humanitarian  security and economic situation that challenges all of us as members of the international community. The political instability and internal conflicts that have been recurring for more than two decades have plunged the Central African Republic into a situation of extreme vulnerability. Since December 2012  the Central African Republic has been shaken by one of the worst crises in its history  which has left the Central African people in a dramatic situation.Following the resignation of my predecessor on 10 January  I responded to the distressed calls of the people of the Central African Republic. My election has raised great hopes among the people of my country  who welcomed the election of the first woman President of the Central African Republic as a sign of a break with the past and the start of a new future. Since then I have felt the weight of the responsibility that has befallen me and taken stock of the situation that I had inherited.With determination  I immediately embarked upon dealing with the situation  with the support of the international community  in accordance with the road map for the transition  whose main axes are the restoration of security and peace  the resolution of the serious humanitarian crisis  the recovery of State authority throughout the national territory  the relaunching of economic activities  and  of course  the holding of free  transparent and democratic elections. Today  I rejoice that my calls to the international community to support the efforts of the transition have not remained unanswered; we have been offered multifaceted support  thanks to which the worst was avoided in my country.Those combined efforts have resulted in noticeable progress on security issues and humanitarian  economic and political matters. In terms of security  I welcome the Security Council’s adoption of resolution 2149 (2014) on 10 April  authorizing the deployment of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA)  which was a strong response on the part of the international community to the Central African crisis and which led  on 15 September  to the final transfer of authority from the African-led International Support Mission in the Central African Republic to MINUSCA. I want to thank all States that have made their troops  materiel and financial contributions available to the Mission.We have placed high hopes in the deployment of the Mission  which should contribute effectively and efficiently to securing the country’s path to peace and sustainable development. The fact remains  however  that the success of the Mission will also depend on the close involvement of the national security and defence forces  which can provide support to the Mission based on their knowledge of the terrain.I would ask the Sanctions Committee to show great understanding and to reconsider the arms embargo imposed on the Central African Republic. At the same time  it is also urgent to go beyond the Brazzaville forum  which resulted in the signing of an agreement to cease hostilities and opened the way for the disarmament of all armed groups  the reform of the defence and security sectors  and especially the implementation of the disarmament  demobilization and reintegration programme. In those areas  too  we will need substantial backing from the international community.In the humanitarian field  efforts have been ongoing since January. To date  the number of internally displaced persons has dropped from 900 000 to 175 000 people  which means that 81 per cent of the internally displaced persons have left makeshift sites to return to their communities. Despite the improvements  the humanitarian situation remains worrying in general  since it is dependent on the fragile security situation  particularly in the countryside.Efforts should be focused on the return of 400 000 refugees now in neighbouring countries. Similarly  the resources mobilized so far cover only 48 per cent of the expressed humanitarian need. In that respect  we expect other disbursements to support the return of displaced and exiled persons to their homes.With regard to the economy  the Central African Republic’s economy has been hit hard by the deep crisis. As a result  the growth rate of the country fell to minus 36 per cent in 2013  placing the country in sudden deep recession. Thanks to active diplomacy  the Central African Republic has benefited from emergency budgetary support for CEMAC and ECCAS countries  an agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund for the conclusion of a programme for the rapid disbursement of credits and budgetary support from the World Bank  the African Development Bank and the European Union  as well as agreements signed with France for budget support. Beyond the announcements that have been made  the effective disbursement of those funds will boost our country’s economic activities and set it on a path of growth. The emergency plan for sustainable reconstruction was designed to effectively respond to the economic crisis  and one of our expectations vis-à-vis the international community is that we should be given all the necessary support for the effective implementation of that plan.In order to promote political dialogue and national reconciliation and help Central Africans to live better with one another  I have always focused on pacifying hearts and minds so as to achieve genuine national reconciliation. The first step was taken in Brazzaville on 23 July. It is now time to continue the process in the Central African Republic itself  by providing our people with an opportunity to assess the situation of the country themselves and share their vision for the future of the country  and by bringing together all the parties to the crisis around a table to consider a new republican pact to recast the Central African State. The Central African Republic cherishes the ardent wish that special attention will be given to the political process  whose success will depend on the resources available for its implementation.I would like to commend the relevance of the theme that was chosen for this session of the General Assembly. That theme should lead us to take stock of the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and of emerging challenges. It comes at the right time  because our world continues to be shaken by crises of all types in Africa  the Middle and Near East  Asia  Eastern Europe and Latin America. The Ebola virus disease  which is raging throughout the West African region with the risk of expanding beyond the region  is another current challenge that has large-scale  adverse economic and humanitarian consequences in many countries. I would like to take this opportunity to extend  from this high rostrum  my most heartfelt condolences and those of the people of the Central African Republic to our brotherly countries in Africa affected by that scourge  which has claimed so many lives.I also extend my condolences and those of the Central African people to French President François Hollande and the French people for the dastardly murder of Hervé Gourdel  which has upset us all. That cowardly murder is a timely reminder of the need to step up our fight against terrorism  which remains a major threat to our planet and a real obstacle to the promotion of international peace and security. The Central African Republic calls for greater mobilization by the international community against terrorism  and in particular against the Boko Haram sect operating in Nigeria and Cameroon  not far from the borders of my country and against the Lord’s Resistance Army  which continues to rage throughout the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and some neighbouring countries.Similarly  the Central African Republic opposes the proliferation of small arms and light weapons  which continue to be traded illicitly and continue to fuel the worst conflicts throughout the world  particularly in Africa. The Central African Republic welcomes the efforts undertaken to achieve the signing of the Arms Trade Treaty and the adoption of Security Council resolution 2117 (2013) on the non-proliferation of small arms and light weapons  and we are awaiting the effective implementation of that resolution.Related to situations of war is the issue of justice and human rights. I am strongly committed to fighting impunity. The Central African Republic  as a party to the Rome Statute  will continue to support the actions of the International Criminal Court in its fight against impunity for the most serious crimes  which affect the entire international community  and especially my country. In that context  the Central African Republic supports the initiative taken by France and Mexico to cut back on the abusive use of the right of veto in the Security Council in cases involving massacres of civilian populations  war crimes and genocide.My country had been committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals  and to that end has developed a poverty-reduction strategy paper that has been implemented with tangible results  including in the areas of water  sanitation and education. That was the case until the most recent crisis unfortunately came about  which called everything into question. I should also like to draw the attention of the international community to landlocked States like mine and to call for international solidarity to ensure that substantial assistance be granted to them in order to ease the burden associated with our economic vulnerability and facilitate the implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action.I commend the efforts undertaken by the international community to stem climate change and its negative impact on the world. I strongly encourage all countries to ratify the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol and to incorporate the principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change into the new agreement to be adopted at Paris in 2015.The Central African Republic is against any and all attempts in favour of partition and threats against the territorial integrity of nations. As such  it supports the position of the Kingdom of Morocco on the Sahara issue  which is in accordance with Security Council resolutions 1754 (2007) and 2152 (2014).I cannot conclude without paying a heartfelt tribute to the work of the United Nations to promote peace throughout the world. In conclusion  I would like to express  above all  my pride at the courage and great resilience of the Central African people and their determination to rise up from the recurrent crises that have inflicted untold suffering on them. Long live the United Nations! Long live international solidarity to ensure that peace and security prevails throughout the world!"
"30",1227,"CAN",69,2014,"It is both an honour and a pleasure for me to once again address the Assembly.(spoke in English)For more than 70 years  Canada has supported the United Nations and its institutions in the pursuit of world peace. On many occasions Canadians have put their lives on the line to deter active conflict between peoples. It is a duty we accept and it is a record of which we are proud.Today  there are many embattled parts of the world where the suffering of the local populations and the threats to global security deserve our urgent attention  and I could easily use my entire time here on any one of them. There are  however  other areas of service to humankind. It is to some of those that I wish to speak tonight  for there is more to peace than the absence of war. Where human misery abounds  where grinding poverty is the rule  where justice is systematically denied  there is no real peace — only the seeds of future conflict. (spoke in French)Of course  misery and injustice are not the only roots of war. We need only look at the world today to appreciate that.(spoke in English)Then we understand how the worst of human nature — perverse ideologies  religious extremism and the lust for power and plunder — can rob people in so many places of property  hope and life itself. That is why Canada has always been ready and willing to join with other civilized peoples and to challenge affronts to the international order  affronts to human dignity itself  such as those that are today present in Eastern Europe  particularly Ukraine  in the Middle East — Iraq  Syria and elsewhere — and of course many parts of Africa.Canada’s positions on those issues are well known  and we will continue to contribute to the extent to which we are able in assisting our friends and allies in the international community to deal with those grave challenges. But while those extreme situations are being confronted  other problems — pandemics  climate change and  of course  the problems of underdevelopment — remain. (spoke in French)And we feel strongly that no effort is ever in vain if it offers peoples an alternative to conflict and the possibility of a better life for them and their families.(spoke in English)Canadians therefore seek a world where freedom  democracy  human rights and the rule of law are respected. We hold those things to be intrinsically right and good. We also believe that they are the necessary foundation for a better world for more people and are necessary for prosperity. With prosperity comes hope  and with hope  the greater inclination of free peoples everywhere to find peaceful solutions to the things that divide them. Indeed  we believe that freedom  prosperity and peace form a virtuous circle. For that reason  the growth of trade among nations and the delivery of effective development assistance to ordinary people — simple  practical aid — are the things that have become the signatures of our Government’s outreach in the world. Trade means jobs  growth and opportunities. It has made great nations out of small ones. The story of my own country  Canada  is a case in point. Historically  trade has built our country  just as today it is reshaping our world. Trade means ordinary people can support their families and even dare to dream of something much more.(spoke in French)Our Government has worked hard to establish a vast network of modern trade agreements.(spoke in English)The trade agreements we have concluded tear down the barriers of tariff and excise and enlarge markets and opportunities for buyers and sellers alike. Canada has now established such links with countries that today possess more than a quarter of the world’s people and nearly half the world’s business. And our free-trade network will grow larger yet. It is not  by the way  an exclusive club for wealthy nations.(spoke in French)Canada has already liberalized its trade with countries better known for their determination to succeed than for the size of their economies  thereby opening the way for them to access Canadian and other markets. We have no reason to stop now. As indicated by my colleague from Senegal  President Macky Sall  “Aid is needed for development  but what is needed even more is investment”. He is quite right.(spoke in English)Yet no matter how freely we trade  millions of people will need a helping hand for some time to come. Easily the most important example  and the one closest to my heart  is the worldwide struggle upon which so many of you have been engaged  in the maternal  newborn and child health initiative. Saving the lives of the world’s most vulnerable mothers  infants and children must remain a top global priority. That is  the world must honour the commitments made in this very Hall to mothers and children in the year 2000. And there has been remarkable progress.(spoke in French)Thanks to inexpensive vaccines and the combined efforts of multiple partners  more children are being vaccinated today than ever before. And as the importance of nutrition becomes better understood  more and more children are surviving. Thanks to simple  low-cost  easily accessible techniques  literally millions of mothers and children who a mere 14 years ago might have died not only survive today  but thrive.(spoke in English)I think especially of the 2010 meeting of world leaders at Muskoka  which raised about $7.5 billion dollars  $2 billion of it from private donors. Based on that  the United Nations launched what the Secretary-General called the “Every woman  every child” initiative  with the goal of saving 16 million lives by 2016. An important aspect of that work has been monitoring both the receipt of monies pledged and how they are used. The assurance of full accountability has allowed recipients to plan with greater certainty and donors to give with confidence. With His Excellency President Kikwete of Tanzania  whom we have just heard  it was my honour to co-chair the World Health Organization’s Information and Accountability Commission linked to that initiative.On this  we have a clear vision  and that vision is achievable. We know how to help a great many of those vulnerable people. We have seen what can be done. We want simply to rally the passion and the will to make it happen. We are preventing deaths  and we can prevent more — deaths of thousands of children every day from easily preventable causes. We can stop the thousands of mothers dying in childbirth who would survive with relatively little intervention. We also know who we need to be working with — new partnerships that bring together Governments and agencies of the United Nations  including the World Health Organization  the World Food Programme and UNICEF  with the private sector  partnerships that are producing real results and taking us to new heights of excellence.Here I am thinking of the Maternal  Newborn and Child Health Network in Canada  a group that represents a broad base of Canadian civil society and is a key implementing partner on the ground. As many representatives know  in May in Toronto  Canada hosted the world’s leading actors on that subject. We heard the success stories — for example  the Micronutrient Initiative through which 180 million children received vitamin A  pills that cost pennies but drop child mortality by 25 per cent. We heard about the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization and how during the three-year period between 2010 and 2013  immunizations saved the lives of 2 million children.We have partnerships to deliver better nutrition and partnerships to deliver better measurement  because vital statistics are critical. One cannot manage what one cannot measure. And in that mission  we measure progress in precious lives saved. So every child needs a birth certificate.(spoke in French)We also heard that in the world today is a greater obligation with regard to accountability  not only with regard to the vast sums of money pledged  but also the way in which that money is spent.(spoke in English)So our consensus was clear. We have seen success  and we have momentum. Saving the lives of children and mothers is a fight we can win. To get it done  two things are needed now: political focus and renewed financial commitment. I therefore urge the Assembly  in the strongest terms  to ensure that  maternal  newborn and child health remains a clear and top priority in the evolving post-2015 development agenda — and one of a limited number of priorities. That is the political focus we need. Then there is the financial commitment. I know we all have many competing priorities. But we have come so far that to stop now would be a tragedy.I must say I was very encouraged this afternoon at the Secretary-General’s “Every woman  every child” event  when President Kim of the World Bank and other leaders announced new financing for the Bank’s Global Financing Facility for Every Woman Every Child. That Facility will help developing countries access the financing required to improve their health systems. I was pleased to announce that Canada would financially support the World Bank’s Global Financing Facility for Every Woman Every Child. (spoke in French)We urge other countries to do likewise because to provide viable solutions to prevent the tragic death of women and children  we need to increase budget allocations on the part of both donors and the developing countries.(spoke in English)In closing  let me just say this. There are many individual countries and many specific causes that will rightly occupy our deliberations here this week. Let us also not forget to look beyond those crises at the long-term opportunities and efforts that can truly transform the world. We have it in our power to create a better kind of world for our children’s children than the one we have today.And we should  for it was never the intention of the founders of the United Nations — Canada being one of them — that ours would be a world where terrorists could get the resources necessary to sow death and destruction but where workers and families could not get jobs and opportunities  or where mothers and children could not obtain the necessities required to live and thrive.The world that Canada strives for is the world that the founders of the United Nations wanted from the beginning  as boldly articulated in their Declaration of 1 January 1942 — a world where “life  liberty  independence and religious freedom” are defended  where “human rights and justice” are preserved  and where all join “in a common struggle against savage and brutal forces seeking to subjugate the world”. In such a world  there can be prosperity for the impoverished  justice for the weak and  for the desperate  that most precious of all things  hope.It is easy to look at the many problems of the world today and become despondent. Yet for all our failings  there has been  for most of humankind  tremendous progress in my lifetime. Therefore  I am enough of an optimist to think that because we can create a more prosperous  fairer and hopeful world  not only should we  but indeed  I believe we will find the will to do so."
"31",1242,"CHE",69,2014,"“A world in which people know how to solve their problems in peace without violence; a world of freedom and mutual respect; a world where all young people can look forward to finding work that allows them to live a happy life.”That  in his own words  is the world that a young man from my country would like to see. His name is Damian Vogt. He is in this Hall and represents Switzerland’s youth at the United Nations. This week we work here together to make that world a reality.A little more than a year ago  another young person stood in this very place and addressed the world. She said:(spoke in English)“I speak not for myself  but for all girls and boys ... Those who have fought for their rights: their right to live in peace; their right to be treated with dignity; their right to equality of opportunity; their right to be educated.”(spoke in French)The entire world still remembers the words of Malala Yousafzai. The entire world still remembers her courage. What a difference in the lives that Malala and Damian have known. What a difference between going to school only at the risk of your life and going to school as a right — the right to a better life. And yet  Malala and Damian  like millions of other young people around the globe  want exactly the same thing: peace  human dignity  freedom and equality  an education  and an opportunity to work. The youth of today have a right to expect from all of us  we who represent the nations  that we truly will be united in our commitment to do everything within our power to place in their hands tomorrow a world where humanity is synonymous with security  freedom and prosperity.It is a century now since the outbreak of the First World War  and 75 years since the beginning of the Second World War. The memory of those cataclysmic events imposes a duty on humankind to work towards greater security and freedom  to bring about the conditions for prosperity  and to become an Organization of genuinely united nations that is effective as a true assembly of States at the service of the people. Here at the heart of the United Nations  Switzerland wishes to do its part by making the following twin objectives a priority: strengthening international security and reforming the United Nations.The security challenges are immense. At no time since the Second World War has humankind seen so many people displaced. More than 50 million men  women and children have been torn from their homes. The story of each and every one of them is a human tragedy. Caught up in this current of insecurity are also 75 million young people who  without work  face a future without prospects. We are talking about one young person in 10 in the world  and in certain regions one in two. Worse still  in ever more regions throughout the globe there are waves of instability assailing the rule of international law and  in particular the principles of humanitarian law  which are being ignored  violated  and swept away in the deluge.This is extremely worrisome in the Middle East  above all in Syria and Iraq. Switzerland condemns in the strongest terms the brutal acts of the self-proclaimed Islamic State and the groups that have allied themselves with it. Islam can  and must  like other religions  be a messenger of peace  humanity and fraternity. As for the nations  they can and must be truly united as a constant reminder at all times and in all places of the supremacy of law over force.Where serious violations occur  investigations must be carried out. Here  the independent commissions of inquiry play an essential role  especially that of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic  to allow for genuine reconciliation and lasting peace. Switzerland and 60 other States have requested the Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. We have also committed ourselves to an increase in our humanitarian aid in the region. The crisis in Syria must be dealt with as a whole  and we call on the parties to return to the negotiating table and to work towards a political solution.Switzerland calls on the Iraqi Government to ensure accountability. It joins the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in calling on Iraq to consider accession to the Rome Statute.With regard to all forms of extremism that can lead to acts of terrorism  it is important also to address their root causes to show young people that violence holds out no promise for the future. The establishment in Geneva of the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund was an important step in this direction.The world in 2014 has witnessed a conjunction of many crises — in the Middle East  in the Maghreb  in Africa  and also in Europe  where war returned this year with the crisis in Ukraine. This situation weakens the security of the entire continent.Violations of the Helsinki principles and of international law  whether in the form of an illegal annexation of territory  such as that of Crimea by Russia  or of military incursions in eastern Ukraine  demand a firm response from the international community. But such a response must also be balanced  leaving room for dialogue and cooperation so that open discussion remains possible. To simply isolate Russia from the rest of Europe will not solve any problems and will only create more  in Europe and beyond. Stability can be restored in Ukraine and in Europe if we succeed in resolving this crisis by working with Russia  not against it.That stability will be all the more sustainable if the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) — of which Switzerland this year holds the chairmanship — is able to re-establish a firm basis for security cooperation between the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian regions. Switzerland  in its capacity as current chair of the OSCE  fully supports the vital work of the contact group for Ukraine and Russia. We are currently taking steps to increase funding for the special civil monitoring mission  that will also require additional support from the participating States  and we welcome the excellent cooperation with the United Nations.In today’s unstable world  Switzerland has made an active commitment to achieving greater security by focusing its efforts there where it can make the greatest contribution — the prevention of conflicts. The prevention of violence means  first and foremost making certain that a proper education is available to all and that there are opportunities for every young person. We welcome the Secretary-General’s Global Education First Initiative. Switzerland is working to promote education through massive open online courses and seeks to encourage the development of dual vocational training  combining school studies with on-the-job apprenticeships. This calls for a joint commitment on the part of the State and the social partners.In addition  preventing tensions from arising requires knowing how to give everyone a voice. At the heart of Switzerland’s history lies a willingness to share power  to engage in direct dialogue with minorities  and to distribute authority between central and local government — an emphasis on consultation rather than on confrontation. In order to better prevent and manage tensions in the world  we must strengthen the mediation capacities of both the United Nations and regional security organizations  particularly those of the largest among them  the OSCE.Switzerland has decided to augment its contributions to international development and humanitarian cooperation. In the coming year we will be allocating funds for this purpose amounting to the equivalent of 0.5 per cent of our gross national income. In other words  to help the neediest inhabitants of our planet  each person in Switzerland will be contributing a little over one dollar every day.The post-2015 process provides us with the chance to transform the world’s challenges into opportunities. There must be a single agenda for universal sustainable development  with shared objectives. We must all act to ensure that they are truly achieved. If all nations are genuinely united  it lies within our power to make certain that no one in the world need face a future of destitute poverty. It is within our power to make certain that the creation of jobs and wealth  and thus also companies doing business contribute to the development of human rights and help to foster respect for the limited resources of this Earth.Today there are crises that cannot wait for the outcome of discussions on an agenda  no matter how sustainable it may be. Switzerland has increased its humanitarian commitment to the fight against the horror of Ebola. Swiss-based research centres  among the best in the world  are working to arrange for the clinical testing of vaccines. Similarly  we must also do all we can every day to protect the world’s youth from the horrors of war. The place of children and young people is in school and with their families and not on the battlefield. Switzerland is intensifying its efforts to provide better health protection for women  especially young girls  and has also launched an action plan to combat the phenomenon of child soldiers  who are being deprived ofthe right to be simply children.In order to meet these challenges we will need not only the common will of the United Nations but also an organization that functions in an effective  transparent  and democratic fashion. “We the peoples of the United Nations” are the opening words of the United Nations Charter. They are a reminder that the United Nations must first listen to and serve the people of this world. In concrete terms  this means that it must strengthen bodies that are dedicated to the prevention of conflicts. Switzerland applauds the initiative of the Secretary-General to strengthen the commitment of the United Nations to human rights  particularly in sensitive regions. My country has launched an appeal for the allocation of additional funds for those important activities.There is also a need to strengthen the United Nations special political missions to prevent conflicts and reinforce the activity of the Peacebuilding Commission. The United Nations must devote all its energy to its work in the field to serve the people. It must avoid getting lost in an administrative maze. Together with eight other countries  Switzerland has commissioned a group of experts to draft recommendations for the reform of planning and budgeting processes.Lastly  the ability of the United Nations to be effective in dealing with the challenges it faces depends on the legitimacy it enjoys as well as its ability to be transparent and inclusive in the Security Council. The permanent members ought not to use their veto to block action designed to prevent or put an end to genocide  crimes against humanity  or war crimes. Switzerland welcomes the French initiative for a voluntary agreement by the five permanent members to restrain their veto power in cases of mass atrocities.One day  many years ago  a young man travelling across the north of Italy was horrified by the suffering he witnessed on the battlefield at Solferino in the 1800s. The young man’s name was Henri Dunant. With the help of local women  he cared for the wounded soldiers. Later  when he returned home to Geneva  he dedicated himself to raising public awareness of the tragedy that had taken place. Through his commitment  the Red Cross Movement was born. Through his persistence  the first Geneva Convention was signed  150 years ago in 1864. This document — which I am holding up here and will give to the President of the General Assembly — is a reproduction of the original  in which States committed themselves to providing assistance to wounded soldiers and ensuring respect for humanitarian principles. Thus  international humanitarian law was born.Yet today  150 years later  humanitarian law is too often violated or ignored. Switzerland and the International Committee of the Red Cross were given a mandate to consult States and to issue recommendations. We will present next year a specific proposal to strengthen respect for humanitarian law and to put in place some joint machinery and an institutional framework. For the past 150 years  the spirit of Geneva  the spirit of international law  has shone forth throughout the world like a beacon  a place of peace  a home to humanitarianism and a refuge for humankind. Geneva is a gift  both for Switzerland and for the world  and we would like to strengthen its role further by finding useful solutions for humankind. Like Malala and Damian  Henri Dunant dreamed of peace  freedom and prosperity for the world. His story — the story of the Red Cross and the Geneva Conventions — is a message of commitment. The action of each one of us can make a difference.In a few days  Switzerland will rename one of the highest mountain peaks in the Alps. It will henceforth be known as Dunant Peak  after Henri Dunant  the first recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Here  where the nations come together  we have the power to move mountains  as long as we stand united  working together to make the dreams of Damian and Malala and all young people in the world a reality. We owe them a better world. We are capable of building that world together  if we find the will to work as nations truly united in dialogue and action — united nations  whose Governments draw their strength from the people  for the people; united nations who draw their inspiration from the youth for the youth."
"32",1288,"CHL",69,2014,"At the end of the twentieth century  we imagined that the twenty-first century would bring greater progress and peace for all and that it would be free of the tragedies that had convulsed the world. Indeed  we have seen hopeful signs of development in many dimensions. Yet paradoxically  we see all around us the symptoms of crises that  while they may be more localized  have more devastating humanitarian consequences. These challenges include regional wars  ethnic and religious tensions  humanitarian crises  the trampling of human rights  the break-up of several States  climate change  deepening inequality  cross-border terrorism and the spread of terrible pandemics such as Ebola  all of which require a firm  urgent response on the part of the international community.That instability  along with a lack of social cohesion  poses a threat to peace  security  human rights  development and democracy. This affects not only countries or States  but the actual men and women who inhabit them. In other words  it is a threat to all we believe in — everything that constitutes the basis of the agreement on which the United Nations was founded and everything that is our raison d’être as leaders of our societies. That is why the United Nations remains irreplaceable as an institution for addressing global challenges and for agreeing on the actions needed to resolve them  even if some of those actions have not produced the desired results.The Security Council has contributed to addressing and preventing crises. One response has been the design of robust peacekeeping operations with a strong emphasis on the protection of civilians. However  on many occasions Council members have been unable to act with unity. That undoubtedly undermines the legitimacy and credibility of the principal organ responsible for international peace and security.This year has seen a significant rise in the number of humanitarian crises around the world  in particular in the number of complex emergencies with regional impacts that indirectly affect already-fragile States. We are concerned about the 3 million refugees created by the crisis in Syria; about the actions of terrorist groups such as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant; about the cruel violence that the world has witnessed in Gaza. We express our solidarity with the victims and categorically condemn the use of violence. Any action in this area must be taken within the context of international law. We believe that the international community should seek political solutions and inclusive negotiations to facilitate action by the Security Council. For our part  we are prepared to increase our humanitarian commitments and shall consider accepting refugees from those conflict zones.We are also concerned about the situation in Ukraine. Here the position of Chile is clear. We believe that the principle of territorial integrity must be respected and that  at the same time  the rights of minorities must be protected. We believe that a solution can be found to prevent an escalation of violence  sanctions and tensions that may well spread throughout the planet.Generally speaking  we wish to reaffirm our belief in the need to respect the integrity of State borders. International law is clear and unambiguous. Any action designed to affect existing boundary treaties creates room for legal uncertainty and could jeopardize international peace and stability. In that context  we continue to believe that reform of the Security Council is a pending issue requiring political decision and swift action. We reiterate our support for the enlargement of the Council and for the aspirations of Germany  Brazil  Japan and India to become permanent members. In addition  Chile favours a serious debate on the French proposal to limit the right to veto in the case of crimes involving the responsibility to protect.We acknowledge the Secretary-General’s efforts to achieve a more inclusive global governance in which the post-2015 development agenda and the sustainable development goals occupy a central place and require the political support of Governments and societies in all regions. The post-2015 process provides a great opportunity to tackle the social and development issues common to all societies and regions  using a comprehensive approach  through specific and measurable goals. Women and peace and security is an item on the agenda of the Security Council to which Chile  as a member of the Council  attaches priority. Since the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000)  the world has made progress in the protection of women and girls in armed conflicts.Our efforts to empower women and promote initiatives to combat violence against women and girls have been tireless. Thanks to those efforts  today women are at the centre of the new development and peace architecture. We believe that the full incorporation of women in every area of society — including the economy  politics  and culture — is a prerequisite for their full development. It  therefore  should also be a priority in the post-2015 development agenda  as should early childhood development  which is something that has to do with the future of our societies.I come from Latin America  a region of middle-income countries that has its own dreams  challenges and tasks. For us  sustainable development  security  the quality of governance and  above all  inequality and social cohesion are the most pressing problems. We want those challenges to appear in the post-2015 development agenda  which must be inclusive and reflect the situation in all regions of the world.We believe that inequality is one of the greatest threats to countries’ development and international security. It fosters social unrest and prevents us all from moving towards inclusive development and ending exclusion and poverty  which in turn can lead to resentment and violence. Therefore  overcoming inequality  with its many faces  must occupy a central place among the post-2015 development goals. We also believe that the United Nations system should have the tools for measuring specific progress in a universal agenda to combat inequality.Chile is dealing with the challenge of inequality decisively and over the long term. Today in Chile  there is a common belief in the need for change — change specifically designed to substantially improve equity and inclusion. Having made great progress  Chile would like to consolidate and move ahead but recognizes that a society that has undergone profound and rapid changes faces new challenges.Public opinion and political evolution tell us that the time has come to take meaningful steps through substantive reforms providing the essential basis for moving towards a more dynamic  inclusive and equitable development. That is a basic condition for moving towards a better society for all. To that end  we have recently adopted a tax reform to ensure greater equity  fiscal sustainability and the resources necessary to carry out an education reform that will ensure a quality education  free of charge  and opportunities for all. Chile will not achieve development while dragging the burden of inequality. We all know that  which is why the tax reform has received cross-cutting support.We are also introducing long-awaited political reforms to enhance our democracy and institutional legitimacy. We have already adopted a law allowing Chileans residing abroad to vote. Progress is being made on the reform to alter the electoral system by eliminating the existing bias and motivating citizens to participate  since now every vote will count. And we want to move towards a new Constitution with fully democratic foundations and content. We launched a productivity and growth agenda to stimulate the economy  promote sustainable development and create decent jobs  as a basic prerequisite for achieving a lasting reduction in inequality and enhancing opportunities. Ultimately  we want to broaden the scope of rights to bring them into line with our enhanced capability as a country.Climate change exacerbates inequalities and intensifies threats. There is a collective duty to act  and Chile is convinced that Latin America has a big contribution to make in this debate. Climate change aggravates inequalities because it has the greatest impact on the most vulnerable. Chile has only a marginal effect on the problem  since it accounts for only 0.25 per cent of carbon emissions  but it undoubtedly suffers the consequences of climate change  as do many others. Therefore  we want to be part of the solution. Since we understand that this entails a global commitment  differentiated actions and binding obligations  we voluntarily made a commitment to reduce our emissions by 20 per cent by 2020. Several other Latin American countries have made similar voluntary commitments. We should like to propose here that there be some type of accountability  which would facilitate compliance and would help to set an example for the countries that are lagging behind.The Organization must ensure the efficiency and consistency of multilateralism as a special forum for tackling the major global issues in an inclusive manner  creating international regimes and promoting cooperation arrangements in priority areas for our peoples. Our country trusts multilateralism  and we believe that participating in the system involves both rights and responsibilities. Because we want to contribute to the solution of global problems  we are a member of the Security Council and the Human Rights Council  we aspire to membership in the Economic and Social Council  and we are contributing to peacekeeping operations  including the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. That Mission  in which a number of Latin American countries are engaged  is a tangible action of solidarity to support the democratic consolidation of a sister country.We believe  therefore  that it is a political imperative to strengthen multilateralism in three fundamental ways. The first is by enhancing the Secretary-General’s ability to take initiatives. In the context of the functions envisaged in the Charter  it is essential to continue support for the political leadership of the Secretary-General to take preventive action and respond to urgent situations that jeopardize the dignity of people and international peace and security.The second relates to fieldwork. The ability of the system to take action in the field is a basic prerequisite in order for the Organization to be relevant to people’s demands and real problems. As the former Executive Director of UN-Women  I had the privilege of seeing the conviction  solidarity and dedication with which United Nations staff help to promote the ideals  principles and mandates of the system.The third area of focus is development and cooperation. The process of constructing a post-2015 development agenda requires renewed efforts to provide official development assistance and to promote innovative financing mechanisms  encouraging partnerships between countries  international bodies  civil society and the private sector.Chile is interested in a greater coordination of initiatives and instruments to facilitate South-South cooperation between middle-income countries while seeking out ways in which their essential contribution can be made effective. I would also like to note that in Chile we have enacted legal provisions to open our economy fully to imports from the 48 least developed countries  without duties or quotas.I would like to conclude by reiterating the irrevocable commitments made by Chile’s successive democratic Governments to the work of the United Nations. Those commitments reflect universal principles and values  as they promote the protection  dignity and fundamental rights of all individuals and contribute to crisis prevention  dialogue  reconciliation and post-conflict management. Our convictions and efforts will always be aimed at enhancing the legitimacy of collective action to meet people’s concerns and demands. We believe that  with an effective and real effort on the part of the international community  we will be able to deal successfully with exceptional crises and  first and foremost  build a world in which all inhabitants live together in peace and dignity."
"33",1334,"CHN",69,2014,"This year marks the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War. A distinguished thinker in modern China  Yan Fu  described the devastation caused by the war: “How sad that the air is heavy with the stench of war”.Next year will be the seventieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Over 2 billion people across the world were affected by that calamity. In China alone  the aggression committed by Japanese militarists left more than 35 million Chinese soldiers and civilians dead or injured.The United Nations was established to keep the scourge of the two World Wars from occurring again  and it embodies the fervent hope of all countries for peace and stability. To achieve that goal  the Charter of the United Nations presented a grand vision of joint efforts to build a better world.In this world  we should treat each other as equals. The principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity must be upheld. The pursuit by different countries of economic and social development must be respected. Their right to independently choose their own social systems and development paths must be safeguarded. We should be open and inclusive. Only in that way can we open the door of dialogue and exchange and achieve harmony among countries with different social systems  religions and cultural traditions. We should pursue mutually beneficial cooperation. Each country should align its own interests with those of others and work to maximize areas where their interests converge.Only by helping one another can countries prosper. We should jointly initiate a new thinking for win-win and all-win progress and reject the old notion of a zero-sum game  or the winner takes all. We should uphold justice. It is imperative to promote greater democracy and the rule of law in international relations  to apply fair and just rules to tell right from wrong and settle disputes  and to pursue peace and development within the framework of international law. All parties should jointly uphold the authority and effectiveness of the United Nations and reform and improve the global governance structure.As we have seen in Gaza  Iraq  the Central African Republic and South Sudan  our world is far from peaceful. In the face of all those who have been killed in war  we must ask ourselves how we can keep the tragedies from recurring. In the face of women and children displaced by fighting  we must ask ourselves when they can return home. In the face of incessant conflicts  we must ask ourselves how we can open the door to lasting peace. To address those problems  China believes that we should do the following.First  we should seek political solutions. To beat swords into ploughshares may take time and effort  but history and reality have repeatedly demonstrated that to meet violence with violence will not lead to enduring peace  and the use of force will only create more problems than solutions. Coercive action should be authorized by the Security Council. If a country places its domestic law above international law and interferes in other countries’ internal affairs at will  or even seeks regime change  the international community cannot but question the legitimacy of its actions.Secondly  we should accommodate the interests of all parties. Parties to a conflict should reject the zero-sum approach  address each other’s concerns in negotiations and endeavour to meet each other half way. They should seek to meet their legitimate concerns through consultations in a mutually accommodating way. When conducting mediation  the international community should uphold justice and take an objective and balanced position. Countries should not be partial to any party in the conflict. Still less should they avail themselves of the opportunity to pursue their own agenda.Thirdly  we should promote national reconciliation. The ongoing armed conflicts are largely caused by ethnic and sectarian tensions. The process of national reconciliation and the process of political settlement should be advanced in tandem with each other. All parties should uphold the Charter of the United Nations  develop and practice a culture of inclusion and tolerance and uproot the seeds of hatred and retaliation  so that the fruit of inclusion and amity will grow on post-conflict land.Fourthly  we should uphold multilateralism. We should give full play to the role of the United Nations and observe international law and the basic norms governing international relations. Chapter VII of the Charter is not the only means for the Security Council to maintain international peace and security. We should make better and full use of the means of prevention  mediation and conciliation stipulated in Chapter VI.Given their familiarity with local developments  we should leverage the strengths of regional organizations and countries and support them in addressing regional issues in ways suited to their regions.The conflicts in Ukraine remain a cause of concern. We welcome and support the Minsk ceasefire agreement and urge all parties in Ukraine to strictly implement it and seek a comprehensive  sustained and balanced political solution through political dialogue and negotiation. China hopes that the various ethnic groups in Ukraine will live in harmony and that Ukraine will live in peace with other countries. That is the fundamental way for Ukraine to achieve long-term stability and security. China hopes that the United Nations will play its due role in finding a proper solution to the Ukrainian crisis and supports the international community’s constructive efforts to ease the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine.China supports Iraq in upholding its sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity. The formation of the new Iraqi Government has provided an important opportunity. We hope that the Iraqi Government will lead its people in a joint endeavour to develop their country in the spirit of inclusion and reconciliation. China calls for providing more humanitarian assistance to support Iraq. To help the Iraqi people overcome difficulties and to achieve peace and stability in their country is the shared responsibility of the international community.China firmly opposes all terrorist acts and supports the international community in responding to the threat posed by terrorist forces in a coordinated and concerted way in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions. China believes that in conducting international counter-terrorism cooperation  we should take a multipronged approach and address both the symptoms and root causes of terrorism  and that the United Nations and the Security Council should fully play leading roles. There should be no double standard when it comes to fighting terrorism; still less should terrorism be identified with any particular ethnic group or religion.As new developments emerge in the global fight against terrorism  the international community should take new measures to address them. In particular  it should focus on combating religious extremism and cyberterrorism  resolutely eliminate the root causes of terrorism and extremism  block channels that spread them and crack down hard and effectively on the use of the Internet and other new means of communication by terrorists to instigate  recruit  finance or plot terrorist attacks.The Syrian crisis has continued for nearly four years. It is negotiation  not fighting  that offers solutions. China urges all parties in Syria to end the fighting and violence immediately  cooperate fully with United Nations humanitarian assistance operations and help bring an end to the suffering of innocent civilians as soon as possible. We urge all the parties to act in the overall interests of the future and fate of their country and people  demonstrate the necessary political will  actively support the mediation efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy  and follow a middle way that draws on workable practices from other countries and regions  suits Syria’s national conditions and accommodates the interests of various parties  in order to give peace a chance.The Palestinian issue is an open wound on the conscience of humankind. China calls on Israel and Palestine to agree on a durable ceasefire  and it urges Israel to lift its blockade of the Gaza Strip and stop building settlements. At the same time  Israel’s legitimate security concerns should be respected. We hope that Israel and Palestine will choose the way of peace and resume and advance the peace talks as soon as possible. The aspirations and legitimate demands of the Palestinian people for an independent nation must not remain unmet indefinitely. Advancing peace in the Middle East calls for the concerted efforts of many  not of one or two countries alone. The Security Council should play its rightful role  and we support its efforts to take action in response to the demands of Palestine and the League of Arab States.Negotiations on the Iranian nuclear issue have entered a crucial stage. All the parties should display good faith  continue their efforts in a spirit of mutual respect  equality  collaboration and accommodation  and work hard on the most difficult issues  so that a win-win agreement that is comprehensive  fair and balanced is arrived at as soon as possible.The two sides of the conflict in South Sudan should establish a ceasefire immediately  organize an active political dialogue that addresses the interests of the people in South Sudan in general and  through the mediation of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development  work with all the country’s ethnic groups and parties to speedily reach a fair and balanced solution and achieve national reconciliation and ethnic unity. South Sudan is the youngest Member of the United Nations. The South Sudanese people deserve a life of hope and vitality  not the devastation caused by conflicts and wars.China welcomes the election of Mr. Ashraf Ghani as the new President of Afghanistan and Mr. Abdullah Abdullah as its Chief Executive  and will continue to support the Afghan people in their work to achieve a smooth political  security and economic transition and to build jointly with them an Afghanistan that enjoys unity  stability  development and amity. We support an Afghan-led and -owned peace process  with the international community fulfilling its commitment and responsibility to Afghanistan and its people. China will host the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the Istanbul Process so that we can give Afghanistan fresh support as it stands on the threshold of a new era.On the issue of the Korean peninsula  China calls on all the parties to act objectively and impartially  remain committed to the goal of denuclearizing the peninsula  firmly uphold its peace and stability  and endeavour to resolve the issues through dialogue and consultation. The Six-Party Talks remain the only viable and effective way to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula  and we now have the pressing task of restarting the talks as soon as possible. The issue should be tackled through a sustainable  irreversible and effective dialogue process that addresses all the parties’ concerns in a comprehensive and balanced way. Since there are still many uncertainties on the peninsula today  all the parties concerned should exercise restraint  refrain from provocative acts  work harder to help ease tensions and jointly uphold peace and stability.While the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) established by the United Nations in 2000 have contributed greatly to improving human survival and development  global development is still a task for the long term. The international community is not only dealing with the formidable challenges of reducing poverty  eradicating hunger and improving education and the health of women and children  it is also facing new challenges in the form of the environment  climate change and energy and resource security.Next year is the deadline for meeting the MDGs  and the post-2015 development agenda will take over this historic mission. Building on past progress and also breaking new ground  the international community should formulate more effective plans and take more robust action to advance humankind’s shared development. As we see it  the development agenda should have three goals. First  it should advance people’s well-being  with a focus on eradicating poverty and encouraging development. Secondly  it should promote inclusiveness  in the interests of supporting social equity and justice. Thirdly  it should ensure the implementation of all these things. Based on the principles of diversity in development models and shared but differentiated responsibilities  the agenda should aim to enhance global partnerships for development and improve implementation tools and mechanisms.Climate change is a challenge that all humankind is facing. Mr. Zhang Gaoli  Vice Premier of the State Council  led the Chinese delegation to this year’s Climate Summit at the United Nations as a special envoy of China’s President. We congratulate the United Nations on the Summit’s success and hope that the political momentum it generated will translate into effective actions for improving international cooperation on climate change. All parties should work to conclude negotiations on a new post-2020 climate-change regime as scheduled  by the end of 2015  in accordance with the principles of shared but differentiated responsibilities  equity and respective capabilities  with the aim of creating fairer and more equitable and effective arrangements for international cooperation on climate change.The Ebola epidemic  which is raging in some African countries  has once again sounded the alarm on global health security. As a good brother and partner of Africa  with whom it shares the good and the bad  China will continue to stand firmly with the African people and to support and assist them to the best of its ability. We will also take an active part in the relevant international assistance efforts. China calls on the World Health Organization  the United Nations and other international agencies to work closely with the international community  come up with new initiatives for strengthening global health security and provide more assistance to developing countries  particularly in Africa.Next year is one of special historic significance  as it marks the seventieth anniversary of victory in the anti-fascist world war  the founding of the United Nations and victory in the Chinese people’s war against Japanese aggression. Remembering the past makes us cherish peace  and recalling history will help to guide us as we embrace the future. China welcomes the inclusion of the seventieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly as an important opportunity.When we look back on what happened 70 years ago  the historical facts are clear  and a final verdict has been pronounced on what was right and what was wrong. History should not be falsified or truth distorted. Today  70 years later  let us jointly uphold human justice and conscience so that those who attempt to deny aggression and distort history will have nowhere to hide. Let us jointly defend the Charter of the United Nations and the outcomes of the Second World War  so that that vision of a world free of war  with lasting peace  will take deep root in our hearts and pass from one generation to the next."
"34",1368,"CIV",69,2014,"Like the other Heads of State and Government who preceded me at this rostrum  I  too  would like  on behalf of the delegation of Côte d’Ivoire and on my own behalf  to extend to you  Sir  our warmest congratulations on your well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session and to assure you of our full support throughout your mandate. Your election to this post does honour to your country  Uganda  and  beyond its borders  to the entire African continent.My congratulations also go to His Excellency John Ashe  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session  for his outstanding guidance of the work of the Assembly throughout the past year. I should like in particular to commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his dedication to the objectives and ideals of the Charter of our Organization.Now that the stage has been set and the ground prepared  as we were urged to do at the sixty-eighth session  the time is now ripe to translate into reality our commitment and our vision of a world free from the ravages of the poverty and vulnerability that still affect millions of individuals.I welcome  therefore  the relevance and the scope of the theme of this session  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  which is taking place in the framework of the continuation of the previous session and reflects our commitment to meet together the challenge of development.Since the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  in September 2000  and one year before the deadline for their implementation  it should be noted  as rightly stressed by the Secretary-General in his recent report  that the main objectives have been  or are in the process of being  achieved on a global scale and that considerable efforts will be needed in order for regions such as sub-Saharan Africa to in their turn succeed in doing so.At the national level  thanks to the efforts of my Government  the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals is tirelessly being pursued within the framework of the implementation of the national development programme and the strengthening of cooperation with our partners. We will use the time between now and the deadline of the end of 2015 to accelerate efforts to reduce poverty  improve maternal and child health  consolidate the remarkable progress made in the fight against HIV/AIDS and concerning access to primary education  and  finally  ensure access to clean drinking water for all of our compatriots.In the past three years  Côte d’Ivoire has made a significant qualitative leap forward in the implementation of the MDGs and intends to continue with that same dynamic process. We entered the twenty-first century determined to conquer poverty and inequality  and to build a world of opportunity. The MDGs have been the vehicle for this great ambition and the impetus for a solidarity of the kind rarely expressed in this forum. At a time when the world that we wish to see post-2015 is taking shape  the MDGs are becoming clearer. We must finally give the most vulnerable peoples a decent life; we must also give our planet a reprieve and the opportunity to exist for centuries to come.The post-2015 agenda should pay particular attention to the priorities of the developing countries  particularly those of African countries  as set out in the African Common Position  which my country supports. The intergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda should therefore be inclusive and balanced and achieve specific  measurable objectives so as to facilitate their ownership by States and regions.The adoption of the post-2015 development programme next year will take place in a favourable economic context for Africa. Indeed  Africa has become one of the most attractive regions for international investors and one of the most dynamic in the world  with the annual growth rate of its gross national product at 4.5 per cent on average over the past 15 years. Africa offers unique opportunities in the areas of infrastructure  energy  agriculture  employment and the capability of ensuring food security for the continent. The health sector and that of combating climate change are also active.Africa is entering an era of progress and development that will depend on its security environment. Indeed  the unprecedented spread of terrorism from the Horn of Africa to the Sahelo-Saharan area  the explosion of maritime piracy  various types of criminal trafficking  and  more recently  the resurgence of pandemics such as Ebola haemorrhagic fever  which has been ravaging certain countries in West Africa  are threatening the African continent and risk making it lose a decade of human progress and economic growth. Unlike the wars of yesteryear  these trans-border threats will in the long term spare no State and no region. That is why we must face them collectively.The current international mobilization against terrorism and extremism is very positive. However  it would benefit from being extended to Africa in order to sustainably destroy the terrorist movements that are now active at the doors of Europe. Africa must not be the forgotten continent in the fight against terrorism.I know that Africa is not alone in facing these threats. I would like to reiterate here my sincere gratitude to our bilateral and multilateral partners  including France  the United States of America  the United Nations  the European Union and the African Union  which all are by our side. I should like in particular to thank President François Hollande for the decisive role played by France in the resolution of the crises in Mali  Guinea-Bissau and the Central African Republic  as well as for the convening of the Elysée Summit for Peace and Security in Africa and the recent conference of heads of State on the question of Boko Haram in Nigeria.I wish to thank President Barack Obama for the important measures he announced in August at the United States-Africa Summit  which will help to strengthen African capacities to combat terrorism. I also wish to thank him  and  through him  the American people for the bold  outstanding measures taken by the Government of the United States of America to help West Africa to overcome the Ebola epidemic. Those measures  in addition to those taken by the World Health Organization  non-governmental organizations  France  the United Kingdom  the World Bank  Japan  the European Union and other countries  must serve as an impetus for an international mobilization.In the same spirit  I would like to acknowledge the support provided by the international community to the brotherly country of Nigeria in its fight against the terrorist group Boko Haram  and commend the African Union for its decisive involvement in Somalia. The fact remains that  with respect to the Sahel and the fight against Boko Haram  the major Powers and the United Nations need to go further in their support for the continent and show the same determination as that has been demonstrated by France against the terrorists in northern Mali.For Africa  security is the primary sustainable development goal that must be achieved. In the quest for stability and security  the consolidation of the continent’s various partnerships is a true lifeline to the future. Those partnerships also provide solidarity  openness and development. They must ultimately enable us to pursue together the fight for the eradication of poverty  while taking into account the three dimensions of sustainable development: the economic  social and environmental dimensions.Sustainable development is inclusive  and that is what we want for our people. In that respect  I recall the need to focus on developing methods for cleaner production and for reversing the current trend of global warming. In the light of the pronouncements we made at the Climate Summit  held on 23 September here in New York  a final effort will certainly be needed to reach an ambitious climate agreement in 2015 at the Paris summit.I would like now to turn to the situation in Côte d’Ivoire. My country is at peace and at work. It has regained its partners’ trust  as shown in particular by the definitive return of the African Development Bank to Abidjan. Thanks to the unity of Ivorians  the strength of our national institutions and the reforms undertaken by the Government  economic growth continues to be strong and is close to reaching double digits.At this stage in my country’s path towards economic transformation and inclusive development  the major work that remains is that of strengthening national reconciliation and caring for and protecting the most vulnerable of my countrymen. That will involve  fundamentally  restoring meaning to the concept of solidarity and the national pact underpinning the Ivorian nation. Today  Côte d’Ivoire is an ambitious nation that has set a course towards democratic institutions and exemplary governance.Let me conclude by highlighting that a better world for all is possible. We all need to believe in it and work with determination to achieve it. The sustainable development goals will be achieved if national efforts are supported by the expected level of official development assistance  the level to which the developed countries have committed. The post-2015 development agenda will be an asset that will enable our countries to meet the challenges our people and especially our youth will face in a changing world."
"35",1411,"CMR",69,2014,"The President of the Republic of Cameroon  His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya  has requested me to convey to members  the Secretary-General and his fellow staff his warm greetings and to deliver his statement before the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.“Next year  we should adopt the post-2015 development agenda in follow-up to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Throughout the sixty-eighth session  our representatives actively worked to develop new goals to pick up the MDG torch. That important task  since it concerns the raison d’être of the Organization  is not finished. It will be incumbent upon the President to see it through. I am sure that he will succeed. Rest assured of the full and wholehearted cooperation of my country in that regard.“For the post-2015 period  the United Nations seeks a transformative agenda that gives priority to the eradication of poverty and hunger  as well as to sustained and inclusive economic growth. Cameroon fully shares that vision.“In Cameroon  since 2010  we have implemented a strategy for growth and employment whose primary purpose is indeed the reduction of poverty. The measures taken in that regard aim in particular at creating jobs and improving the living conditions of the population. The recovery of our economy and our public finances  which has fostered the return of growth  bodes well for the success of our efforts. However  such progress  substantial and significant as it is  has not yet enabled us to eradicate poverty. In the areas of education  health care  access to water and electricity  roads  et cetera  there is still a long way to go in order to meet the needs of our people.“Most of the countries targeted by the MDGs — the developing countries — face similar situations. That is why  like the President  we support a transformative post-2015 agenda. That will clearly require some changes to our approach to development. It should no longer be seen as an external process but  rather  as an expression of the wishes and needs of the target populations. Moreover  that is the common position of the African countries.“Following a review of the MDGs  it will also be necessary to establish a follow-up mechanism for the goals of the new system. Finally  we will inevitably have to change the way in which development aid is financed in order to improve its effectiveness.“Once those conditions are met  we should work on the most important matter of all  namely  ensuring security. For it goes without saying that without security there can be no development. Take the example of my country  which is proud of having been a haven of peace and stability for decades. To the east  since March 2013  the Central African Republic has seen its security situation severely deteriorate: massacres and population displacements have jeopardized any hope of development  not to mention the flux of tens of thousands of refugees towards Cameroon. In the far north  attacks by the Boko Haram group  which is more concerned about imposing shariah law than improving the living conditions of populations  threaten the integrity of our territory. There  too  the lack of security has caused thousands of displaced persons to flee to my country. It is estimated that in recent months Cameroon has hosted more than 200 000 refugees from all kinds of origins. It goes without saying that my country will continue to honour its tradition of hospitality. However  if that situation should continue  there is no guarantee that we will have the resources to deal with it.“The time allocated to me does not allow me to mention the other areas of tension and conflict  whether in Africa  the Middle East or Eastern Europe. The causes and issues are varied. I will therefore limit myself to urging the parties concerned to negotiate and to seek peaceful solutions.“That is the path that Nigeria and Cameroon chose to settle the dispute between them  some years ago  over the Bakassi peninsula. It enabled us to find a solution conforming with international law and  above all  to seal an unfailing friendship between our two countries. Moreover it was  I should stress  in harmony with the ideals of the Charter of our Organization.”"
"36",1455,"COD",69,2014,"I am delighted to be here today to once again make a contribution  on behalf of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  to the debate on the present and future of humankind. I am especially delighted as this sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the international situation is particularly delicate. If we are not careful  three of its phenomena in particular will surely delay us in achieving our agreed goals. I am referring to the issues of terrorism  the resurgence of Ebola in Africa and the many threats to peace in various areas around the globe.Despite the commendable efforts of States and international organizations  terrorism  an extreme form of human intolerance  continues to claim victims — as many in number as they are innocent — around the world. Africa  which was once spared this type of senseless violence  is today at its epicentre. The people of Libya  Mali  Kenya  Somalia  Nigeria and many other countries in Europe  America and Asia are regularly bereaved by attacks  hostage-taking and summary executions. All States Members of our Organization must face the threat collectively  as a moral obligation and the only effective strategy to eradicate this barbarism surely and quickly.Since the previous session of the General Assembly  a major public health problem has also hindered Africa on its path towards development  namely  through the loss in human lives caused by Ebola in some countries of sub-Saharan Africa. In less than six months  the disease has claimed over 2 000 lives  including approximately 40 in my own country. Africa is leading a heroic battle against the virus. It deserves support.I am grateful to the international community  which is aware that  beyond the affected African populations today  all of humankind is under threat and which has extended its touching and effective solidarity to the affected countries. I thank the international community for its significant technical and logistical support in the response against the epidemic. In the future  I hope to see this fine example of human brotherhood prevail over the blind competition we see so often  and for it to occur with equal fervour in other sectors.As for the Democratic Republic of the Congo  which is being touched for the seventh time by this scourge  we have not only managed to contain this new epidemic at its origin — in Boende territory  Equateur province — but also provided support to the fight against the epidemic in West Africa. Now that we have all but mastered the situation within the country  the Democratic Republic of Congo is ready to once again send its experts to the other affected countries.I take this opportunity to announce from this rostrum that  on the basis of its over 30 years of experience in the management of Ebola outbreaks  in October the Democratic Republic of the Congo will set up multidisciplinary training centres to train health personnel to respond adequately  in terms of quality and quantity of care  to the needs of African countries that have been or could in the future be affected by such an epidemic.As for the wars that are engulfing various parts of the world  including the Middle East  Ukraine  Syria  Iraq  Libya and the Central African Republic  we should first recall that the United Nations was created following a world war  in order to establish mechanisms capable of preventing  or at least managing  situations that bring the world only grief and despair; and then we should ask ourselves why at this point  decades after the San Francisco Conference  humankind seems unable to maintain and guarantee peace. Knowing that in this area any contribution is welcome  I would like to reaffirm the commitment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to working tirelessly for peace and stability in Africa and around the world. That is the reason for the presence of Congolese troop and police contingents in the Central African Republic.The issue of peace is fundamental because  without it  humankind cannot realize or implement a transformative development programme  as the central theme of this session has it. Nor can that goal be achieved as long as terrorism is not contained and epidemics such as Ebola are not defeated. From experience  we Congolese know that there is no challenge that cannot be met provided there is the will  the way and the determination. We all know where my country was barely 13 years ago. Today I am happy to say that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is standing on its feet once more. It is a country where a newfound peace is consolidated a little more every day; a country whose economy is one of the most dynamic on the continent  with an inflation rate close to zero  a growth rate that has exceeded the African average for almost a decade  and steadily increasing foreign exchange reserves; a country undergoing total reconstruction  with roads  schools  hospitals and much other infrastructure being built at an unprecedented rate and speed.On the political front  consolidating democracy and strengthening national cohesion remain our top priorities. In that regard  I wish to confirm that our forthcoming elections will soon be held according to the schedule set by the relevant national institution  the Independent National Electoral Commission. Every effort is bring made to ensure that our country will emerge from them stronger  more peaceful and more united.Regarding security  through the application of a judicious mix of political dialogue  diplomacy and military action we have moved steadily closer to the goal we have set ourselves of banishing negative forces from our land and thus helping to bring peace to the eastern part of the country and to our neighbours. In order to consolidate peace and improve social conditions for the people  we are working to improve the business climate so as to stimulate investment  promote greater added value locally and create more jobs.As can be seen  my country has resolutely taken the road of reconstruction  development and re-emergence and the defeat of poverty  injustice and inequality. It is an undeniably daunting task  and we still have some way to go to achieve our ultimate goal. But the people of the Congo are tackling it with enthusiasm and selflessness  determined as never before to make our march towards progress irreversible and to propel the country to a level of development commensurate with its potential. To do that  we must preserve stability at all costs  and that is what we will put the majority of our efforts into from now on. And we count on the support of our partners in prioritizing everything that may involve.Before concluding my remarks  I would like to reiterate the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s continuing plea for Africa to be fairly represented in the decision-making organs of the United Nations  particularly the Security Council. The fact is that it does not make sense that Africa  a continent with six of the 10 fastest-growing economies in the world today  whose growth rate and youthful population are portents of future demographic power and whose forests  freshwater reserves and arable lands make it essential to the implementation of sustainable development strategies  does not have a permanent seat within the entity responsible for ensuring peace and international security. It is high time that this changed. It is a question of fairness  and it is also a condition of our collective effectiveness."
"37",1502,"COG",69,2014,"I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to the President on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. At the same time  I would like to welcome the wise choice that he has made to view his mandate as an extension of the work of Ambassador John William Ashe  his predecessor  to whom I pay a well-deserved tribute. I also commend the President on having chosen a theme for the sixty-ninth session that invites us to engage in a comprehensive consideration of the post-2015 agenda. I would also like to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and reiterate to him the unwavering support of the Republic of the Congo for the efforts he expends with devotion and selflessness at the head of our Organization.The world is in turmoil. Humankind lives in fear of tensions and conflicts  which exist virtually everywhere; of terrorism  which has become the bogeyman of States; of old and new epidemics that plague societies  especially the poorest among them; of the persistent disparities among and within States; and of climate change  which threatens our planet. Those are the challenges that arouse a feeling of great apprehension throughout the world.In turn  they make us put our faith in the United Nations  the only instrument available to the world in its search for solutions to those many problems. In that universal quest  the priority action of States must be directed above all to peace  security and the conservation of nature. For the world needs peace and security  especially wherever senseless conflicts have developed  such as in Syria  Ukraine  Iraq and between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The world needs peace and security in Africa  especially in Libya and throughout the entire Sahel-Saharan region  in South Sudan  Central Africa and the Great Lakes region. Africa needs the increased support of the international community so that Somalia can  once and for all  emerge from the abyss and so that Mali can recover its integrity and unity. It needs such support so that the Democratic Republic of the Congo  which has now experienced a degree of calm  will not again be plunged into the violence that afflicted it for so many long years. Finally  it also needs that support so that the positive developments seen in the Central African Republic in recent weeks with the cessation of hostilities agreement  signed in Brazzaville on 23 July  and the transfer of authority  on 15 September  from the African-led International Support Mission in the Central African Republic to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic can be strengthened to allow the Central African people to emerge from the crisis that has lasted too long.Africa needs the ongoing support of the international community to curb maritime piracy  which increasingly threatens the Gulf of Guinea  and to combat terrorism  which extends from the Sahel to the south of the continent  with the involvement of many local networks. That also applies to Boko Haram  which rages in Nigeria and seeks to spread its activities towards Cameroon  and perhaps soon to other countries if nothing is done to prevent it. The same goes for the rebel movement known as Joseph Kony’s Lord’s Resistance Army  which is still active in the Central African Republic  the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda.In Central Africa  as elsewhere on the continent  insecurity is often the result of a number of factors. There are not only war and armed violence but also poverty and endemic diseases  such as malaria  HIV/AIDS  non-communicable diseases and Ebola haemorrhagic fever. We commend the great spirit of solidarity shown by the international community in assisting the African countries affected by the Ebola epidemic to eradicate that terrible scourge. In that regard  we welcome the establishment of the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response by the Secretary-General.I would like to briefly address the issue of climate change  which  as everyone knows  remains a major threat to our planet. The Republic of the Congo  which fully shares the Common African Position  supports the conclusions of the Elysée Summit for Peace and Security in Africa of 6 and 7 December 2013. The Climate Summit held here in New York on 23 September saw the announcement of firm commitments with a view to the adoption of a universal  important and binding agreement on both mitigation and adaptation at the Paris summit in 2015.In that regard  I would like to underscore the importance for my country and for Africa of the establishment of technology transfer and innovative financing mechanisms and of ensuring the maximum benefit and real implementation of the Green Climate Fund  as well as the promotion of a substantive programme to counter climate imbalance so as to maximize the opportunities provided by combating climate change.Illicit logging and the illegal trade in fauna and flora are another serious threat to the environment and to biodiversity. In response to that international environmental crime against biodiversity  during the first half of 2015  my country will host in Brazzaville  under the auspices of the African Union and in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme  an international conference on the illegal exploitation of and the illicit trade in the wild fauna and flora of Africa.The sixty-ninth session of the Assembly of our Organization takes place on the eve of 2015  the deadline for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The review undertaken by stakeholders at all levels has shown that we have not reached those Goals owing to  inter alia  shortcomings in their initial preparation and drafting. Africa is the continent with the largest number of countries that will not have achieved some MDGs by the 2015 deadline. African leaders have adopted a Common Position on the post-2015 development agenda in order to meet those challenges. We call for the joint commitment of all members to ensure that the Common African Position is placed at the centre of our concerns in the negotiations that should lead to the adoption of an inclusive post-2015 development agenda.Before I conclude  I would like to solemnly reaffirm my country’s commitment to the promotion and protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms  the various mechanisms for the protection of human rights and the universal periodic review process  in which we have actively participated. In that spirit  Congo seeks to enrich its legal and institutional framework by strengthening its national system for the promotion and protection of human rights  with the full participation of civil society. In that context  the Republic of the Congo has decided to present  in the upcoming November elections to be held in New York  its candidature for a second term on the United Nations Human Rights Council for the period 2015-2017.Sports  as a contributor to peace and development  unites peoples. In that spirit  in September 2015 Brazzaville will host the eleventh All-African Games on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of that African youth festival.In conclusion  I reaffirm my country’s commitment to the ideals of our universal Organization and reiterate our commitment to supporting the efforts of the entire international community for peace  security and development  on which depend the well-being of humankind and the advent of the better world to which we fervently aspire."
"38",1549,"COL",69,2014,"First  on behalf of the Government of Colombia  I would like to congratulate Mr. Kutesa for his election to the presidency of the General Assembly and to express Colombia’s support for his work in promoting a post-2015 development agenda that responds to humankind’s current challenges. The sustainable development goals recently adopted after an open  transparent and inclusive negotiation process should be at the centre of that agenda.In a world full of bad news  war  terrorism and disease  I would like to bring a ray of hope to the Assembly: that  after more than half a century of conflict  Colombia will soon enjoy peace. If we achieve this goal  which Colombians have unsuccessfully sought for so long  there is hope for peace anywhere in the world  despite how difficult things may seem right now. Today  I can say to the international community that we are closer than ever before to achieving that peace. The process that has been taking place in Havana over the past two years with the guerrilla group known as the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) has been serious  realistic  credible and effective and has produced concrete results.We agreed on an agenda with five substantive points  of which we have achieved agreements on three: comprehensive rural development  political participation and the illicit drug problem. In the first of those areas  we have agreed to unprecedented investment in agricultural development  working to give farmers access to land and to generate a better standard of living for farming families. Regarding political participation  what we are striving for is very simple. We want to broaden our democracy in order to build peace and promote citizen participation  and to forever sever the link between politics and arms. Regarding the illicit drug problem  we have agreed to continue dismantling the drug mafia structures  promote a national crop substitution and alternative development programme and address the issue of consumption from a public health perspective. The agreement also includes a commitment on the part of FARC to contributing effectively to a definitive solution to the illicit drug problem and to ending any relationship it may have had with it.A Colombia without coca and without conflict was an impossible dream just a few years or decades ago. Today  I can affirm that it is a real possibility. We have already begun discussions on the last two substantive points of the plan: the victims and the end of the conflict. This war has left in its wake millions of victims who never had a voice before and who are now at the centre of the process. We are working to fulfil the rights of victims to justice  truth  reparations and non-recurrence. Above all  we are working to ensure that there are no more victims.In an act that I believe to be without precedent in the history of the world  representatives of the victims are explaining their situations  exposing their pain and setting out their expectations before the Government and guerrillas. The victims are the main protagonists and the main beneficiaries of the peace that we seek. Constanza Turbay  who represents the courage of our women and who lost most of her family at the hands of the guerrillas  had the opportunity to confront her victimizers  look them in the eye and to directly hear their expressions of sincere remorse. In her own words  Ms. Turbay stated that the victims are “replacing their pain with the hope of peace”. Another woman  Ms. Juanita Barragan  who spent several years of her youth within the ranks of the FARC  was able to tell her former leaders in Havana: “Please do not enlist more children to fight your war”. Today  Ms. Barragan wants to be a lawyer and to work for children. There are so many cases and so many voices that are finally being heard.We have also created a subcommittee that includes active military and police personnel. This subcommittee is beginning to consider the details of a definitive bilateral ceasefire process  as well as the demobilization and disarmament of guerrillas upon signature of the final agreement. I can therefore now report to the international community that Colombia has made substantial progress in its effort to end the armed conflict that has affected us to such a great extent  and  inevitably  impacted the region and the world.When the post-conflict phase begins  we will face immense challenges in reintegrating those who have demobilized  ensuring a State presence in conflict-affected areas  and guaranteeing civic security. The support and contributions of the international community are key in that regard  and we call for that support. I take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the many nations and multilateral agencies — especially the United Nations — for their commitment to the peace process and their willingness to provide all manner of support  not only now but also in the future as we implement those agreements in the post-conflict stage.In my inaugural speech upon taking office for a second term as President of Colombia on 7 August  I stated the following  and repeat it today before the world’s nations. While conflicts rage around the world  Colombia aspires to bring the good news for humankind that the final armed conflict in the western hemisphere is coming to an end. If we are successful  as we truly expect to be  we will be ready to share our experience with other countries. We are sure that our case can become a model and a beacon of hope for the world’s other conflicts.In Colombia  we seek peace because the suffering of our fellow citizens pains us. We do not want any more victims  or women or children involved in war. We therefore understand the pain of and express our solidarity with the many nations that today are suffering from war and unutterable atrocities  due — it must be said — to the impotence of the international community We are not oblivious to the suffering of those who live in such countries such as Syria  Iraq  Libya and Ukraine and in regions like the Sahel. We condemn the ruthless terrorism of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham. We are not indifferent to the suffering of the many families in Palestine and Israel who are victims of armed confrontations  or to the loss of life due to epidemics  such as Ebola in Africa.As we approach the Organization’s seventieth anniversary  we find ourselves at a defining moment in the consolidation of the international system embodied by the United Nations. Full respect for international law and the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter is essential to attaining lasting solutions to overcome conflict and achieve progress in fulfilling the legitimate aspirations of the people. In confrontations  we must restore the ethical principles that are fundamental to the human condition  and children  women and civilians must be spared such tragedies.Colombia favours negotiated political solutions. Today  we must ask questions that are not only rhetorical but also true. Why are there people who stand against peace? Why do some see war as the only way out? Perhaps they do so because without war they would lose their power  accustomed as they are to making a living and profiting from it  and unable as they are to imagine life without it. We have to convince the promoters of war that this is not the way  and convert them into promoters of peace. We are doing just that in Colombia  and we must do the same in every corner of the planet. The United Nations was established precisely to prevent conflict and to seek peace.Undoubtedly  the drug trade and drug trafficking are fuelling the conflicts in Colombia and elsewhere in the world. Colombia has promoted a serious  technical and objective discussion of the methods and results of the so-called war on drugs. This war has not been won  but we have had some success at the hemispheric level. Last week  at the Special General Assembly of the Organization of American States in Guatemala  we achieved hemispheric consensus on several positions and adopted a resolution that shows that we can move forward together on this issue. Those results will help us to be more prepared to be able to achieve progress at the United Nations special session on drugs that has been called for 2016.Last month  in the inaugural speech of my second mandate  I set out for Colombians the vision that will guide our actions. I want to make Colombia a country of peace  a country with equality  and the most educated country in Latin America by 2025. At the same time  this vision also draws us towards the future sustainable development goals for the post-2015 period — ambitious goals that address humankind’s most pressing social  economic and environmental problems.The good economic climate that Colombia is experiencing  progress in the social indicators  particularly poverty reduction and job creation  and the peace process itself allow us to believe in the possibility of achieving this vision. It is this Colombia  the one that is overcoming poverty  has regained control of its territory  is growing at the world’s highest levels and has successful social equality policies in order to find more fairness  which is also searching for peace.I envisage the same things for Latin America and the Caribbean as I envisage for my country — that we can be a region at peace  with greater equality and better education; a region that makes the transition from resource-based economies to knowledge-based economies; a region in which entrepreneurship and innovation are the engines of development; a region with socially and environmentally responsible companies that transform our future.As I said in the Assembly in 2010 (see A/65/PV.15)  this should be the decade of Latin America and the Caribbean. And now  before the world’s nations  I reiterate the call on my region  Latin America and the Caribbean  to remain true to that intention. To the international community  I make an impassioned appeal for us to put everything we can — everything — into ensuring that the sense of humanity overcomes war. We are losing our way when we look at the tragedies that humankind is suffering without being pained by them  without the world waking up and taking decisive action to address them. We cannot allow ourselves to lose the capacity to be shocked by war. It is time to wake up. It is time to act."
"39",1589,"COM",69,2014,"Let me begin by conveying to the United States authorities my delegation’s heartfelt gratitude for their always warm hospitality in hosting this great annual event here in New York. I also express my sincere congratulations to the President and wish him full success in conducting the work of the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. Finally  on behalf of my delegation and myself I renew our full gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his commitment to serving our Organization.The current session — the sixty-ninth — is taking place at a crucial moment in the history of our Organization  a crucible of multilateralism and global diplomacy that has  over time  become an ever more precious and indispensable tool for peace and security in the world. The session is being held on the eve of our Organization’s seventieth anniversary  which we will celebrate one year hence in this beautiful city of New York. We will celebrate it here  at a venue renowned for the discussions and ongoing dialogue that place humankind and the environment at the forefront of concerns  with a view to fostering peace in international relations. In the light of the wisdom and experience of its 69 years  our Organization must find fresh strength and vitality and renew its commitment to a world continually faced with challenges and threats that change and become more unpredictable with each passing day.The current session also provides us with an important opportunity to carry out a comprehensive assessment of our Organization’s work and undertake the preparations to ensure that 2015 will be the year of reform  on the occasion of our seventieth birthday. Clearly  as part of that process  we should take greater account  first  of new complications  such as those related to the extreme vulnerability of small island developing States  in accordance with the recommendations of the recent Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  held in Apia. Secondly  we should work to ensure better representation for developing countries  particularly those in Africa  which today includes not only areas that are seeing significant economic growth but also some that are afflicted by great poverty and often bloody conflicts that slow their development and are an obstacle to their peoples’ welfare.Meanwhile  it is vital that the long-hoped-for reform of our Organization include ensuring that the Security Council takes on the role of coordinator in the fight against the new global scourge of terrorism. In any event  as a country committed to and involved in the East African Standby Force  the Union of the Comoros fully appreciates the Security Council’s responsibilities in helping to promote  guide and supervise the prevention and resolution of conflicts in Central Africa  Nigeria and Mali  as well as Libya  Syria  Iraq  Ukraine and any country in crisis. All are sources of tension that undermine peace in various parts of the world and have become fertile breeding grounds for international terrorism. It is in that context  and especially in the wake of the recent and bloody armed attacks on our Palestinian brothers in Gaza  that I would like to stress the urgent need for a just and immediate solution to the question of Palestine  which  sadly  is almost as old as our Organization.In order to maintain and build peace in a constantly changing world  we must focus unfailingly on conflict prevention  while continuing to support efforts to solve crises as they arise. Our community of nations has a duty to take the initiative on issues that may ruin our Organization’s credibility if not dealt with fairly. That is the case with my country  which  admitted as a Member of the United Nations under resolution 3385 (XXX)  of 12 November 1975  in affirmation of the importance of respecting the unity and territorial integrity of the Comoro Archipelago  consisting of four islands  still awaits the completion of its decolonization process. In that regard  in my address to the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session (see A/68/PV.10)  I discussed our new approach to reaching an agreement with France on a fair solution that is consistent with the principles governing our Organization.In keeping with the commitment I expressed from this rostrum  I would like to inform the Assembly that the high joint council proposed by the Paris Declaration has been established. This monitoring body began its work in November 2013 and is preparing to meet again at the end of this year. At its second meeting  the issues it will address will include that of people’s movement between the archipelago’s four islands  in an effort to end the tragedies that afflict Comorian families daily — tragedies that generally go unnoticed by international public opinion but are deeply damaging to my people’s collective consciousness. These are tragedies that are equally troublesome to the conscience of France  the great country whose humanistic values we share.In other words  quite apart from the two countries’ territorial dispute  it is extremely urgent that we end this human tragedy through a peaceful and committed dialogue between the two parties  which can only benefit from United Nations support. That is why  in the spirit of the Paris Declaration and to pave the way for building a renewed relationship focused on the future  I recently sought the support of the Indian Ocean Commission at the fourth summit for Heads of State and Government of that subregional organization  of which France and the Comoros are both members. There  the Comorian Government put the emphasis on a spirit of harmony aimed at preserving the bonds between our peoples  while reaffirming the importance of respecting the principles of international law in settling this 40-year dispute.The purpose of the Assembly’s sixty-ninth session is to define a development programme for the post-2015 period  with  as its chief aims  the eradication of poverty and hunger and the promotion of inclusive and sustainable economic growth throughout the world. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) unquestionably created a global covenant of solidarity for our nation’s socioeconomic progress. Like many countries  and like small island developing States in particular  the Union of the Comoros has made significant strides towards achieving the Goals  including improving maternal health and women’s participation in political and economic life  reducing malaria and infant mortality  fighting HIV/AIDS and ensuring equality in children’s education. However  there is still much to do  particularly in the areas of food security  access to universal health care and the deterioration of the environment. Similarly  energy  sustainable agriculture and access to drinking water for much of the population are still matters for concern.That is why  at a time when my country is negotiating entry into the World Trade Organization  we urge that the MDGs that have still not been reached be incorporated into our new sustainable development goals. We also call for strengthened strategic partnerships for development  the establishment of an equitable regime for international trade  the promotion of domestic and foreign direct investment and  lastly  greater mobilization and commitment in combating climate change. It is also vital to implement promptly the recommendations of the various climate summits  especially the Samoa Conference and the Climate Summit held here in New York on 23 September.Many indicators over the past few years  such as the rate of economic growth in various African countries  give reason to hope for a better future for development on our continent. However  Africa is having to deal with challenges related to conflict resolution and multiple threats to peace and security that no country in the world can manage alone  without international cooperation and support. One example is Ebola  a virus that is devastating various West African countries  the alarming scale and speed of whose spread represent a global threat. We welcome the steps that many countries have taken recently to help contain and eradicate this epidemic.It is on my belief in the crucial importance of international solidarity in meeting our peoples’ ever-growing needs that I base my hopes of seeing our Organization successfully negotiate its own transformation after almost 70 years of existence. Indeed  it is by rising to meet the many current challenges and fully assuming the demands of an increasingly interdependent and complex world that we will be able together to open up ways of hope for future generations."
"40",1628,"CPV",69,2014,"It is with great pleasure  Mr. President  that we participate in the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly under your presidency. My delegation joins previous delegations in congratulating you on your election  which simultaneously pays tribute to our sister nation of Uganda and recognizes your personal and professional qualities as an experienced diplomat. We wish you success in carrying out your term and assure you  Sir  of the Cabo Verde delegation’s support and cooperation.To your predecessor  the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session  His Excellency Ambassador John Ashe  we would like to and express our recognition of and appreciation for the dedicated  dynamic and able manner in which he guided the work of the previous session. We would also like to take this opportunity  on behalf of the Government of Cabo Verde  to congratulate and pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts in seeking peace and global solutions for the challenges that currently confront us and require shared political will in the pursuit of global solutions.As a small island State  Cabo Verde is particularly grateful to the Secretary-General and the international community for convening  and the success achieved in  the third United Nations Conference on Small Island Developing States  held in Samoa. We also congratulate the Secretary-General for his initiative in convening the United Nations Climate Summit 2014  as the issue of climate change is of particular importance to island States  due to our specific vulnerabilities. For us  finding solutions to the adverse effects of climate change is not just an option  but a matter of survival and territorial integrity  making it essential to mobilize the political will and international cooperation with respect to that issue. The strategies recently agreed upon in Samoa point to paths  modalities of action and effective implementation that will increase those States’ resilience and make them better equipped to deal with the consequences of climate change.Cabo Verde is pleased with the adoption of urgent measures to face climate change as one of the sustainable development goals. The achievement of that goal requires development strategies and policies that will help create a more resilient planet Earth and strengthen the means of their implementation.The data recently released in the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change focus our attention on alarming scenarios resulting from the persistent increase in global warming  which will put the more vulnerable countries in situations that may threaten their development. It should be noted that  in addition to other consequences  there will be an increase in tropical cyclones  drought and desertification  rising sea levels  ocean acidification  loss of biodiversity  weak agricultural production and food insecurity. For the Government of Cabo Verde  it is important to ensure that the negotiations that will take place next December in Lima translate into significant progress with respect to the content of the new agreement to be signed in Paris in December 2015.Raising awareness regarding the need to reduce the levels of global warming and to foster low-carbon economies must also be taken into consideration. We support reducing global warming to under 1.5°C  which is both economically feasible and a basic requirement for sustainable global development. We also hope that  as we work towards the conversion of our interests  the foundational principle of common but differentiated responsibility will be respected. A compensation mechanism for the effective and full implementation of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage should be considered. We are convinced that  if nothing is done  the consequences resulting from climate change will affect us all and that we all will pay for our inaction. As the Secretary-General of the United Nations likes to say  we are all in the same boat.International cooperation  both with respect to climate change and in other areas  is key. In order to be effective  it must be more consistent and pragmatic in national systems and international structures alike  and development financing for countries must be based on criteria reflecting their real needs and vulnerabilities.We hope that clear directives and commitments are agreed upon in the next Conference on Financing for Development  to be held in Addis Ababa in July 2015  and that they lead the way to achieving the unfinished business of Millennium Development Goal 8. We hope that they will ensure the redefinition of the criteria for the allocation of financial resources for development based on the principles adopted in Paris and reaffirmed in Busan. For Cabo Verde  a country that recently graduated into middle-income status  albeit lower-middle-income  it is important that innovative mechanisms be designed to provide for greater consistency in development financing and to support economic sustainability.The previous session of the General Assembly was convened under the theme “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. The theme chosen for this session is “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”. We are thus asked to take the next step — that is  to work on the adoption of a people-centred agenda aiming to eradicate extreme poverty and reduce inequalities among nations. That request is made in a complex and difficult international environment. In our view  it will be achievable only if there is solidarity and if the international community joins forces to promote sustainable development.The results achieved under the framework of the Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  which conducted its work during the previous session of General Assembly  point to possible actions and options for a truly transformative post-2015 agenda. With respect to Cape Verde  our country is close to achieving all the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). For us  the post-2015 agenda must reflect all lessons and assessments of the MDGs and other internationally agreed goals  and the goals for 2030 must provide for the acceleration of the development process.We would also like to briefly note that the twenty-ninth special session of the General Assembly on the follow-up to the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development was held on 22 September. The lesson that we can take away from that important event is that the post-2015 agenda must place people at the centre of the objectives and goals to be agreed upon  which also means rigorous respect for human rights. On the other hand  the common good  progress and the well-being of all citizens must be goals to be pursued by all Governments as we develop and implement our development policies and programmes.In addition to being a matter of social justice  ensuring gender equality and equity also turns out to be a smart choice  as no country can aspire to develop and establish social peace and cohesion while excluding a significant portion of its population — that is  the female population.Gender-based violence is an unacceptable phenomenon in our societies. The Government of Cabo Verde is committed to changing the reality in our country in a significant and positive way  even as we are aware that there still is much to do in that regard.The issues related to international security and the threats against peace that they represent are matters of particular concern. The recent upsurge in acts of terrorism is a genuinely dangerous threat to the territorial integrity of States and to the stability of entire regions. The systematic and massive violation of human rights and the barbarism that has come with it are altogether unacceptable. The international community cannot allow this challenge to the humanistic values of our civilization  which are also enshrined and promoted by the United Nations. The Government of Cabo Verde therefore vigorously condemns all forms of terrorism and calls on the international community to urgently take appropriate measures to stop such attempts to wreak havoc and mete out suffering to innocent people.We are particularly concerned with recent developments in the Middle East and Africa. We believe that States have the moral obligation and collective duty to fight against the subversion of the universal principles of peace  tolerance and respect for differences. We believe that the United Nations has an important role to play when it comes to respect for the principles set out in its Charter and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Cabo Verde is a peace-loving nation that favours dialogue and the peaceful resolution of disputes. We believe in and defend the principles of the Charter  as well as observance of the standards of international law  respect for human rights and the promotion of human dignity. As a result  we understand that no State or organization can replace the United Nations in playing its fundamental role of maintaining global peace and security and that any use of force can be tolerated only when exercised within the framework of the principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations.Cabo Verde sees urgency in finding a solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and believes that there is no justification for the deaths of thousands of innocent people  the unwarranted suffering of an entire population and the desolation and destruction of infrastructure in the Gaza Strip. We therefore urge the parties to begin negotiations that lead to lasting peace and that allow both States  Israel and Palestine  to live side by side in security. We also consider it important to find a negotiated means to end the conflict in Syria and to open humanitarian aid corridors.We are concerned with the conflicts that persist on our continent  such as in Libya  the Central African Republic and the Great Lakes region  as well as the actions of terrorist groups in Somalia  Mali and Nigeria. We support and stand side by side with the African Union in finding solutions to the problems that affect peace and security in those sister nations and on the continent in general.In the context of Africa  we also wish to commend the progress achieved in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  its return to constitutional order and the re-establishment of democracy. We wish our sister nation the greatest success in the pursuit of peace and development.In the West African subregion  the issue of security in general and maritime security in particular is of particular concern to the authorities of Cabo Verde. Our country is located at the confluence of routes connecting the African  European and American continents  which places us in a vulnerable situation  as these routes are also used by transnational organized crime  resulting in a direct threat to the stability of States and their democracies.Cabo Verde  in association with other States and organizations in the United Nations system  has attempted to combat the illegal activities that have unfairly punished this part of the West African subregion  such as the trafficking in drugs  arms and human beings  maritime piracy  terrorism and illegal fishing. As those are phenomena of a transnational nature  we believe that no country in the subregion is in a position to effectively combat them without greater international cooperation and the combination of efforts  means and strategies. Therefore  we would like to count on more consistent support from the international community.The Security Council has rightly determined that the current Ebola epidemic in West Africa is a threat to international security. The situation in the three countries most affected by the epidemic should prompt the international community to engage in more organized and coordinated actions to provide aid  more effectively save lives and prevent the spread of the disease to neighbouring countries  to the rest of Africa and to the world.Cabo Verde welcomes and supports the efforts made by all nations and organizations involved in that struggle  particularly the Secretary-General’s initiatives in that regard. The inclusion of this issue in the Security Council agenda  the adoption of resolution 2177 (2014) by unanimity  and the debate that followed (see S/PV.7268) are an unequivocal expression of the international community’s awareness of the priority that must be given to the efforts to halt and control the epidemic  which could have catastrophic consequences for our affected sister nations  particularly the Republics of Guinea  Sierra Leone and Liberia  to which Cabo Verde offers its friendship and solidarity."
"41",1674,"CRI",69,2014,"I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa  former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uganda  on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. We wish him the greatest success in carrying out his duties.Whirlwinds of oppression and violence  anxiety  desperation and the systematic violation of human rights affect many corners of the world. We are witnessing an upsurge in violence and armed confrontations and an increase in atrocious crimes and extremism with an ever increasing number of displaced persons  humanitarian crises and deplorable acts that remain unpunished.We are also concerned in particular about the universal dimension of the crisis caused by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS). That reality requires the coordinated and forceful multilateral action of the international community in accordance with the relevant bodies of the Organization. We have seen the images and heard the screams of pain and distress rising out of Gaza  Iraq  Syria  Ukraine  Afghanistan  Mali  Libya  the Sudan  South Sudan  Somalia and the Central African Republic. The cries can also be heard in Central America  where thousands of children and young people cross borders alone heading towards the United States of America  fleeing violence and a lack of opportunities in pursuit of dreams that can turn into nightmares. The Assembly can never put aside the future of those children because  in many ways  the girls and boys of Central America who travel alone are also our sons and daughters.Costa Ricans are not indifferent to the terror of armed conflicts  less still to the suffering of the millions of victims of its most abject manifestations. As a nation  we have always stood with our sister nations in our efforts to bring an end to war and to establish peace. The conflicts that torment us often emerge from the fragile situations of States and their institutions: extreme poverty  corruption and impunity. In all of them  serious human rights violations have occurred. None of those conflicts broke out without prior warning. Ther were clear warning signs. In some cases  the threat was identified but no action was taken  as in Syria. In other cases  the danger was not acknowledged in time  as in South Sudan. However  in all such cases  the victims are those who are most vulnerable and most need our help but who cannot make their voice heard. They are the reason that we are here today.Faced with the loss of human lives  we have reason to ask ourselves if we have kept the solemn promise that accompanied the founding of the United Nations 69 years ago. Do all Members of the Organization refrain from resorting to the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of other States? In some cases  that is so  in others not  but the failure to act is unacceptable. When States disregard that promise  the system of the United Nations is called to action. Otherwise  it becomes weak. It loses its essence. It loses its spirit.The greatest challenge facing the international community  the United Nations and the Security Council — the challenge I wish to talk about today — is maintaining international peace and security as essential common goods. If we want peace  we must prepare for peace. Maintaining international peace and security begins with a culture of peace. As an unarmed democracy and home to the University for Peace  the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights  Costa Rica believes that the culture of peace and education for peace must be an absolute priority. We are convinced that peace  like war  is not the product of a human or an historic destiny but is borne of the very freedom of the human being.Maintaining international peace and security is not restricted to dealing with conflicts. The Organization was founded on the ashes of two world wars precisely in order to prevent them. Prevention begins at the State level  with the strengthening of democracy and its institutions  good governance and a social welfare State founded of the rule of law as a basic prerequisite for the promotion of development and fair and inclusive societies. Prevention is also founded on a solid and functioning multilateral system. Costa Rica values and encourages the preventive diplomatic measures provided for in Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations  which include mediation  good offices and early warning.As part of the Group of Friends of Mediation  I would like to highlight Costa Rica’s leadership in negotiating General Assembly resolution 68/303  which seeks to acknowledge the key role that regional and subregional organizations play in mediating and managing conflicts. To date  that is the first General Assembly resolution on mediation to recognize that role. Its inclusion is therefore a true achievement of the General Assembly.Maintaining international peace and security requires all States to resolve our disputes peacefully in line with the Charter of the United Nations and in strict accordance with international law and agreements. Costa Rica firmly believes in and implements all aspects of international law. We therefore underscore in particular the role of the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court. Peace cannot take root where there is impunity. When war crimes  genocide and crimes against humanity have been committed  those responsible must be investigated and put on trial  including by the International Criminal Court when the national jurisdiction proves insufficient.Our country opposes the weakening of the Rome Statute and any proposed reform that could promote tolerance for impunity. Once again  we remind the Security Council of its authority and responsibility to refer to the International Criminal Court cases that occur in non-States parties. That is the only approach we recognize. Our only weapon is and will always be international law.Maintaining international peace and security also necessitates strengthening the single global Organization charged with defending them. The Security Council must progress from a reaction mentality towards one of action  and reaffirm its moral and political commitment to all humankind. It must be vigilant  strategic and proactive. It must be democratic  efficient  transparent and inclusive. My country has objected to the use of the veto to obstruct measures aimed at preventing or resolving conflict. Costa Ricans are amazed by the way some permanent Council members have invoked the principal of sovereignty to block intervention by the Council at a moment when it should have acted to prevent rivers from turning red with the blood of innocent victims.We reiterate our call on the permanent members to refrain from using the veto  especially in situations of genocide  crimes against humanity  war crimes and mass human rights violations. We therefore welcome the French proposal for a code of conduct addressing the use of the veto. In that spirit  Costa Rica supports the Secretary-General’s Rights Up Front Action Plan so as to place human rights at the centre of the prevention activities of the United Nations. Given our serious and unshakeable commitment to human rights  I respectfully ask the Assembly to back Costa Rica’s re-election to the Human Rights Council in October.Our poet Jorge Debravo said that we Costa Ricans“have the obligation to fight for a better future for man  for a wonderful future. It is not an option for us to remain silent. It is not an option for us to be observers or simple witnesses to the struggles of our nations. In a time like this  remaining neutral is to betray humanity’s future”.Because silence is not an option for us  we condemn the indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas and its use of human shields  just as we condemn the use of disproportionate force in military operations carried out by the Israel Defense Forces. We demand respect for the ceasefire and the negotiation of a permanent solution based on two States living side by side in peace and harmony.Because silence is not an option for us  we reject the transfer of conventional weapons to existing conflict zones. As one of the world leaders in the negotiations that led to the Arms Trade Treaty — an idea originally proposed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former-President Óscar Arias Sánchez — we urge States to reconsider their laws and policies regulating the transfer and availability of arms and munitions  with a view to preventing access by those who would use them in violating human rights and international humanitarian law. To trade in death is to become an accomplice to atrocities. In that context  it would be appropriate to ask the Assembly: What is the ethical — not legal or regulatory — difference between trafficking arms that kill young people in less-developed countries and trafficking in drugs that lead to the same result in the planet’s richest countries?Because silence is not an option for us  Costa Rica rejects the use of explosive weapons in densely populated areas of Syria  Gaza and eastern Ukraine. Costa Rica urgently calls on Member States to develop stricter rules and commitments to prohibit and restrict their use  not only because they violate international humanitarian law  but also because taking action on that issue  here and now  is critical to reducing incentives to non-combatants to take up arms and join the extremists.Because silence is not an option for us  we also condemn the use of cluster munitions in Syria  South Sudan and eastern Ukraine. As the host of the Fifth Meeting of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions  which took place in San Jose from 2 to 5 September  my country will continue to reject the manufacture  use and trade of those weapons. We rejoice that our beloved Central America has become the first region of the world to be declared free of cluster munitions  and reiterate our commitment to continuing to promote the Convention’s universalization.Because silence is not an option for us  we reiterate our rejection of nuclear weapons. No State should develop or possess nuclear weapons. Maintaining and updating nuclear weapons requires immense economic and human resources that are necessary for responding to the key challenges of our time  such as achieving the Millennium Development Goals and the sustainable development goals. Costa Rica is ready to negotiate a new  legally binding instrument on nuclear disarmament and calls on States to honour their commitments in that regard.There can be no peace without sustainable development. There can be no peace in the world so long as there is poverty. There can be no peace in the presence of extreme wealth disparity. There can be no peace while we destroy humankind’s habitat. There can be no peace while large sectors of humankind lack guaranteed access to drinking water. There can be no peace so long as we fail to understand that all of humankind and Planet Earth’s biodiversity can and must thrive and live together. There can be no peace while we fail to guarantee all human rights — civil  cultural  economic  political and social — and in particular the right to development.Because we yearn for peace  we call on the nations of the world to join us in defining the post-2015 development agenda. In just one year’s time  the General Assembly will be tasked with adopting the international framework for achieving sustainable development. The challenge we will face is colossal; we must therefore humbly acknowledge that  despite progress  the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals has been  at best  insufficient.I am convinced that the new sustainable development agenda must be a tool primed for action  with precise objectives  clear targets and indicators that will allow us to measure and monitor its success. In addition  it must result from a broad international consensus  including open and transparent negotiation processes that involve not only the Member States  but also other international actors and civil society organizations whose experience will significantly enrich the final agreement.We are facing the most serious threat in our history — the very survival of our species. Actions taken to confront it must not be timid. On the contrary  every public policy  national and international alike  must take climate change into account as a determining factor. Costa Rica celebrates the vision of the Secretary-General in convening the Climate Summit at the opening of this session. Now is the time to demonstrate our political commitment to achieving a legally binding instrument on climate change by 2015. In addition  we demand robust action on the part of those countries that contribute most to global warming. Their production and consumption methods must be completely revised as their impact on the planet’s most impoverished people — the ones most affected by climate change — is undeniable. If humankind is to survive  we must reverse the current trend.Three years ago  33 countries came together to establish the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC). Its agenda is underpinned by full respect for the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. Its objective is to build diverse  equitable  fair and egalitarian societies  where eradicating poverty and hunger are given priority status. I salute the nations  members of this community.In an international context of increasing military tension and armed conflict  and with the realization that a region’s prosperity and stability can contribute to international peace and security  CELAC member States have declared Latin America and the Caribbean a zone of peace. As President Pro Tempore of CELAC  Costa Rica reiterates its commitment to preventive diplomacy and the peaceful resolution of disputes  with the aim of forever eradicating both the use and the threat of force from our region.Costa Rica trusts that the United Nations will maintain international peace and security in order to promote sustainable development and ensure genuine respect for all human rights. At a time when we must control the reflexive use of coercive measures as a first course of action  when anxiety and despair are unsettling many  it is essential to re-establish hope. When faced with fear  we must have confidence. When faced with conflict  we must turn to peace. When faced with rejection and prejudice on the part of others  we must offer a caring and fraternal embrace. When faced with death  we must think of life.With faith in dialogue and consultation  I have come to the General Assembly to ask that we declare peace — that we conscientiously and decisively work together towards a culture and education for peace; towards strengthening of the social State based on the rule of law  as well as its institutions and our economies; towards conflict prevention and resolution of international controversies by peaceful means; towards a renewed role for the Security Council; towards an end to and a reversal of climate change; and towards sustainable development from which not one person in the world is excluded.I have come to tell the Assembly that silence is not an option for us. We must raise our voices when confronted with actions and situations that go against the universal principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. I have come to inspire us to work together on new paradigms for sustainable development  human security and peace for the whole world.The Costa Rican poet Julieta Dobles Yzaguirre wondered: “Will the Earth in the new millennium/ become that common home?” I would like to respond to the poet with her own words: “No one is saved alone./ Perhaps in sharing words and actions/ peace will finally break out.”"
"42",1743,"CUB",69,2014,"We live in a globalized world that is moving towards multipolarity in an age characterized by the threat to the survival of the human species. The United States Government and NATO will not be able to reverse that trend with a new world division through the force of arms. However  there is a serious risk that in trying to do so  they render the world ungovernable.The huge nuclear and conventional arsenals that have been built up  the imposed annual military expenditure that amounts to $1.75 trillion and the increase in military budgets to 2 per cent of the gross domestic product required of all States members of NATO will not help to address or to resolve issues such as poverty  hunger  epidemics or waves of migration or to overcome the global economic  environmental. food  energy and water crises.As has already been demonstrated  wherever the so-called unconventional warfare described in the 2010 United States Special Forces Army Training Circular 18-01 and the innovations of the 2010 United States Quadrennial Defense Review are practised  chaos ensues through the destabilization or destruction of States  the proliferation of violent and extremist groups and the tearing apart of nations  cultures and religions  thereby seriously jeopardizing regional and international peace and security. It is necessary to condemn the militarization of cyberspace and the illegal and covert interference in the information systems of some countries in order to use them in aggressive actions against third countries to stir up conflict  as well as global espionage on Governments and entire societies.The extraterritorial application of United States laws to the detriment of other sovereign nations is becoming increasingly aggressive and encourages the use of unilateral sanctions  in particular financial sanctions  as a tool of foreign policy. The use of its courts of justice to impose multimillion-dollar fines  including on its allies  under decisions that violate international law  has become a means of punishment and threat and a way to spuriously obtain financial resources. Governments  by failing to defend their own sovereignty and to apply their own laws so as to protect the standards of the international financial system and the legitimate interests of their nations and those of their companies and citizens  are creating the conditions necessary for the proliferation of such practices  which jeopardize the independence of all States and the rule of international law.Media empires  increasingly linked to the hegemonic goals of the Western Powers  continue their misinformation campaigns  shamelessly and cynically manipulate facts and create public opinion matrices that promote aggression. We need another international order  where there is no room for the philosophy of war and the plundering of natural resources.The foreign intervention in Syria must stop. It is inconceivable that Western Powers encourage  finance and arm terrorist groups to set them against a State  while trying to combat their crimes in another State  as is now happening in Iraq. The United States Government violates international law when it launches  in contempt of the United Nations  unilateral bombings without respect for sovereign borders or States under the guise of dubious coalitions.The attempt to deploy NATO up to Russia’s borders will have serious consequences for international peace and security and for the stability of Europe. The sanctions against Russia are immoral and unjust. The strategic American deployment in the Asia-Pacific region will create dangers for the sovereignty of all nations in the area.Israel’s crimes against the Palestinian people  most recently in the Gaza Strip  should not remain unpunished under the protection of a veto in the Security Council. Palestine should already be a State Member of the United Nations  established within the 1967 borders  with East Jerusalem as its capital.The General Assembly must exercise the prerogatives conferred on it by the Charter of the United Nations in the current dangerous and unstable international situation  which is full of threats and challenges. The Security Council should be rebuilt on the basis of democracy  transparency and the fair representation of the countries of the South  which are discriminated against  as permanent and non-permanent members. It should be built on credibility and strict observance of the Charter  without double standards  obscure procedures or the anachronistic veto. The Organization needs profound reform and the defence of its principles. The Secretary-General should be the defender and guarantor of international peace.The 1.2 billion people who live in extreme poverty  the 842 million people who suffer chronic hunger  the 774 million illiterate adults and the 57 million uneducated children affirm that the Millennium Development Goals — which are questionable from a methodological point of view — were a mirage. There has been and still is a lack of political will in the Governments of industrialized States  where blindness and ineffective selfishness prevail. Insatiable transnational businesses increasingly focus on the ownership of huge resources. The unequal distribution of wealth is increasingly ruthless.It is necessary  inevitably  to establish a new international economic order. In these circumstances  the discussions on the post-2015 development agenda give us little reason to hope. However  we must try to reach agreement  as that is the most urgent task. It must be the result of an inclusive intergovernmental negotiation. The resulting document should not be the interpretation of a few parties to the consensus  but rather of the consensus itself.It is urgent to make sub-Saharan Africa a priority. It is essential to confront jointly and decisively  with sufficient and genuine cooperation  the Ebola epidemic that is affecting some countries of the continent. Cuba has decided to maintain its medical cooperation in the 32 African countries where more than 4 000 specialists are working and is willing to extend its cooperation  under the auspices of the World Health Organization (WHO)  to other  most affected countries  as has been reported. Our doctors and paramedics will do so completely voluntarily.We call on the international community  particularly industrialized countries with substantial means  to forcefully respond to the call of the United Nations and WHO to supply financial  health and scientific resources right away in order to eradicate the scourge and prevent it from claiming more lives. The necessary resources should also be contributed to support the African Union’s Agenda 2063  which sets forth the road map for the development of the region.In the past five decades  325 000 Cuban health workers have assisted 158 nations of the South  including 39 African countries  where 76 000 have worked. Also  38 000 physicians were trained free of charge in 121 countries; of those  3 392 were in 45 African nations. If Cuba  small and subject to a blockade  has been able to do that  how much more could have been done for Africa with the cooperation of all  especially of the richest States?At the second Summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  in Havana  we agreed on what is needed to achieve the goal of making societies more just and inclusive. It is indispensable that there be a better distribution of wealth and income  the eradication of illiteracy  quality education for all  real food security  health systems with universal coverage  and the fulfilment of other human rights.The solemn Proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a zone of peace  signed by the Heads of State and Government  enshrines respect for the principles and norms of international law  the promotion of a culture of peace  nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament  and the inalienable right of every State to choose its political  economic and social system. We also undertook to make Latin America and the Caribbean a region free from colonialism and expressed support for the inalienable right of the people of Puerto Rico to self-determination and independence.The Havana summit recognized that the current economic  financial and environmental crises have delivered particularly harsh blows to small island developing States  including the nations of the Caribbean. Their efforts to improve the welfare of their populations should not be punished by calling them middle-income countries through schematic calculations of per capita income  without taking into account their specificities and vulnerabilities.In CELAC  the region of Latin America and the Caribbean has found a native and legitimate space to forge from its rich diversity the essential unity to fulfil the dreams of our heroes  achieve the complete independence of “Our America” and make a substantial contribution to creating balance in the world. In that effort  there have been significant developments — the meeting between the Union of South American Nations and Brazil  the Russian Federation  India  China and South Africa (BRICS); the meeting between the leaders of China and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean; and the establishment of the China-CELAC Forum in Brasilia in July  as had been agreed in Havana. We welcome the Fortaleza Declaration  also adopted in July in Brazil  at the sixth summit of the BRICS countries — whose economies account for 25 per cent of world gross domestic product and almost 40 per cent of the population of the planet — as well as the setting up of a development bank and a foreign exchange reserves common fund  which are important for the countries of the South and for the construction of a new international financial architecture.We express our solidarity with the Bolivarian and Chavista revolution  which  under the leadership of President Nicolas Maduro  is battling to fend off destabilizing actions and foreign interference. We support the worthy fight being waged by Argentina against speculative capital funds  and we oppose the interventionist decisions of the United States courts that are violating international law. In addition  we reiterate our strong support for the legitimate rights of Argentina with respect to the Malvinas Islands. We also reiterate our unwavering support for the fight that Ecuador is leading against the ecological pillaging and damage caused by the activities of transnational companies.On the eve of the International Decade for People of African Descent (2015-2024)  we would recall that this year we celebrate the 210th anniversary of the independence of Haiti  whose anti-slavery and pro-independence revolution was the precursor of liberation movements in Latin America and the Caribbean. Haiti deserves special contributions for its reconstruction and development  under the sovereign leadership of its Government  in which we encourage the international community to participate. We support the claim of the Caribbean to receive reparations from the colonial Powers for the horrors of slavery.The State Department has again put Cuba on its unilateral and arbitrary list of State sponsors of international terrorism. Its real purpose is to increase scrutiny of our international financial transactions worldwide and justify the policy of blockade. During the current Administration  there has been a tightening of the extraterritorial dimension of the blockade  with a strong and unprecedented emphasis in the financial realm  through the imposition of huge fines on banking institutions in third-party countries. An example of this is the scandalous and unjust mega-fine imposed on the French bank BNP Paribas. Furthermore  the current Administration has not stepped back from promoting destabilization in Cuba. It allocates millions of dollars to that end in its budget every year and increasingly relies on undercover methods  such as the use of information and communications technology. The ZunZuneo project  sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)  which not only violates Cuban law but also the law of its own country  is the latest evidence of that.Recent disclosures about the use of young people from our continent in subversive actions in Cuba  a project funded and executed by USAID  confirm that the Cuban Government is right in its countless denunciations of the ongoing illegal plans of the United States to subvert Cuba’s internal order  in violation of Cuban sovereignty  the sovereignty of third countries and international law. We cannot fail to remember that this month marks the sixteenth year of the unjust imprisonment of three Cubans from the Cuban Five — Gerardo  Ramón and Antonio — who with the utmost altruism confronted the terrorist plans organized within United States territory against our country. I therefore reiterate  on behalf of the people and Government of Cuba  that we will not cease in our efforts to call for their return to their homeland.Cuba  for its part  remains calm and prepared for mutually respectful and responsible dialogue  based on reciprocity  with the United States Government. At the same time  Cuba continues to make progress in the updating of its socioeconomic model  despite adverse international circumstances marked by a global economic crisis and the tightening of the blockade.Updating Cuban’s economic socialist model is aimed at ensuring well-being  equity and social justice for all Cubans. The changes that we are introducing are also geared to preserving the achievements of the Revolution  which so many generations have fought for. The goal is to build an ever more just  prosperous and sustainable Cuban socialism."
"43",1789,"CYP",69,2014,"I wish to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session  and I convey my Government’s full support in the exercise of your high duties with the shared goal of promoting United Nations principles in a period of great uncertainty and instability.The General Assembly constitutes the only international forum in which all Heads of States or Governments gather together in order not only to brief international public opinion about serious issues faced by their countries  but to also deliberate on all regional and international challenges that are not country-specific and that call the international order into question.We should always bear in mind that the United Nations was created with the aim of maintaining international peace and security  thus fostering the effective protection of the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all people  irrespective of gender  racial or ethnic origin  religion or belief. For those principles at the heart of the Charter of the United Nations to be upheld  we should all realize that in an era of globalization  all Members of the Organization are bound to be affected  one way or another  by events unfolding in any country or region  although in a dissimilar magnitude and at different times. Therefore joint actions are needed  through a common understanding that despite our individual differences  the path to peace  stability and democracy can be achieved only through the United Nations. Enhancing its role  adhering to the principles of its Charter and implementing its resolutions are a sine qua non for effectively tackling both new and long-standing threats.The upcoming seventieth anniversary of the United Nations will be a significant milestone in United Nations history. Cyprus believes that it is now the right moment to intensify our efforts and commit ourselves to move ahead through self-assessment and an all-inclusive debate so as to reach a tangible outcome that will strengthen the relevance and effectiveness of the Organization. In that connection  I would like to recall the 2005 World Summit  during which world leaders agreed to an early reform of the Security Council.A year ago  when for the very first time I addressed the Assembly (see A/68/PV.12)  I conveyed my deep concern and indignation about acts that we were witnessing that undermined the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  causing regional and global insecurity  such as terrorism  the annexation of territories via illegal use of force  religious fundamentalism and the forcible displacement of millions of peoples. Unfortunately  despite our efforts  we have to admit that during the past year we have not adequately risen to meet those challenges. It is even more worrying that their extent and impact has been intensified at the expense of human lives  individual and collective social and economic prosperity and  ultimately  regional and international peace and security.Everything we are witnessing in Libya  Lebanon  Syria and Iraq  particularly following the emergence of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and the perpetration of its untold atrocities  should not leave us indifferent or passive. It is our duty towards humankind and our shared values to immediately adopt a more proactive involvement  so as to save future generations from the plague of asymmetrical threats  terrorism and bald hatred. In that connection  we welcome Security Council resolution 2178 (2014)  adopted last Wednesday  to decisively address the growing threat posed by the unprecedented flow of foreign terrorist fighters and the growth of facilitation networks fuelling conflicts around the world. We expect that those responsible for the shocking crimes committed in the past few weeks will be held accountable.At the same time  we should not ignore that deep-rooted and long-standing conflicts possess the ability to instantly ignite regional instability  cause bloodshed and endanger the lives of thousands of innocent civilians  including children. Regrettably  such events sow the seeds of animosity and of further violence that render dialogue and negotiations more difficult to conduct and to eventually bring to success.Specifically with regard to the Middle East peace process  the right of the Israeli people to statehood should not be called into question  nor should the same right for the people of Palestine. We commend the very positive role of the Egyptian Government in mediating between the two sides. At the same time  we strongly urge all interested stakeholders to discourage the activities of terrorist groups that oppose the Middle East peace process.Furthermore  we cannot remain indifferent to what is taking place in Ukraine and the repercussions on the relations between some of the most important and influential actors in the world arena — the United States  the Russian Federation and the European Union. We welcome the agreement reached in Minsk on 5 September  and we call for it to be honoured and fully implemented by all sides.Of course  above and beyond those regional conflicts  we should be vigilant and remind ourselves that other conventional and unconventional challenges pose existential dangers that we have yet to tackle. Those include  among others  human trafficking  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  and global poverty  hunger and distress  which intensify migration flows and create demographic changes and the spread of epidemic such as the recent example of Ebola. Moreover  the effects of climate change could eventually  in the distant future  turn out to be irreversible and catastrophic.Cyprus lies at the crossroads of Europe  North Africa and the Near and Middle East  a volatile region in which most conflicts take place. However  we take pride on being a member State of the European Union (EU) and in enjoying excellent relations with all our neighbours. Hence  we are considered to be an honest broker with no hidden agendas. We do realize that our geography is our destiny. We have assumed a constructive role in upholding United Nations values and principles and are contributing to peace efforts in our region  always  of course  within our capabilities.We are at the forefront of efforts to fight terrorism  human trafficking and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to provide humanitarian aid and facilities when deemed necessary. Only yesterday  Cyprus was instrumental in rescuing around 350 Syrian refugees from a fishing boat stranded in the Mediterranean  thus averting a great humanitarian catastrophe.The discovery of hydrocarbons in our neighbourhood has undoubtedly upgraded its strategic importance. Energy can serve as a catalyst for broader cooperation  thus contributing to peace and stability. and can be a means to strengthen regional and EU energy security and diversification. That would boost the economies of the countries in the area. We are ready to contribute toward that cause and even to mediate to bring together neighbouring hydrocarbon-producing and hydrocarbon-consuming countries.The year 2014 marks the fortieth anniversary of the violent division of my country as a consequence of the 1974 invasion and continuing occupation by Turkey. It is not my intention to engage in a blame game  as a plethora of United Nations resolutions and Security Council decisions not only truly reflect the historic and continuing responsibilities of those who are at fault  but also condemn the unacceptable status quo and call for the reunification of Cyprus and the withdrawal of occupation forces.What I would like to stress once more is my sincere commitment to working vigorously and with resolve to reach  through a constructive  in-depth and substantive dialogue  a settlement that will reunite Cyprus and its people  restore the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all its lawful citizens  relieve the island of the presence of occupying troops  ensure peaceful coexistence and socioeconomic collaboration among all its citizens  and guarantee the effectiveness and efficient functioning of Cyprus as an EU member State.For me  there is only one plan  and that is to reach a settlement of the Cyprus problem on the basis of what has been agreed as a compromise: the evolution of the Republic of Cyprus into a bicommunal  bizonal federation with political equality  as set out in the relevant Security Council resolutions and the high-level agreements  with a single sovereignty  a single international legal personality and a single citizenship.After months of difficult negotiations  a joint declaration was agreed between the two communities on 11 February 2014  setting out the basic guidelines and principles for reaching the framework of the agreed solution  as well as the methodology of the negotiating process. At the same time  it is extremely important that the joint declaration clearly articulates that the shared  sole purpose of the negotiating process is to end the unacceptable status quo and reach a settlement that will safeguard and respect the principles upon which the European Union is founded. Following the joint declaration and intensive negotiations between the two sides  comprehensive proposals on all chapters of the Cyprus problem have been submitted. We have now reached the phase of concentrating our efforts to bridge the differences so as to pave the way towards a viable  lasting solution.I wish to take this opportunity to warmly welcome the Secretary-General’s recent appointment of his new Special Adviser  Mr. Espen Barth Eide. We believe that that appointment at this critical juncture in the negotiation process demonstrates the United Nations’ determination to ensure that that process moves decisively forward. However  it goes without saying that what is also needed is a demonstration of a genuine will by our compatriots to negotiate in good faith and by Turkey to contribute constructively to the efforts to reach a settlement  not only in theory and rhetoric  but through practical and substantial actions.A first step towards the long-awaited demonstration of genuine political will would be the adoption of my package proposal for bold confidence-building measures that would create a win-win situation for all parties concerned  helping to build mutual understanding  confidence and good will and thereby serving as a catalyst for the ongoing negotiating process. Moreover  we expect Turkey’s sincere cooperation on the humanitarian issue of missing persons  including through granting access to all areas as required and providing the necessary information that will help shed light on their fate and alleviate the pain of their relatives.Cyprus and its citizens deserve much more than a divided country. Forty years is more than enough for all of us. It is high time for all those involved to realize that the artificial complacency with regard to the status quo benefits no one. A solution would benefit all Cypriots  Turkey  our immediate region and the international community. My ultimate vision is to relieve all Cypriots  especially the younger generation — the future of the country — of the anachronistic burden of having to live in a divided country in which they are forcibly prevented from enjoying the freedoms that are the birthright of every citizen in the world — a burden that they are not to blame for and are entitled to see redressed. I will not deviate from pursuing that vision  as that is the duty I have undertaken towards all Cypriots. Nor will I shy away from the historic responsibility to provide a stable  peaceful and prosperous and conciliatory future in my country.It would be a serious omission if  before concluding  I did not extend the sincere gratitude of my people and my Government to the Secretary-General and the Security Council for the work of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus over the past 50 years  which constitutes a prime example of the successful role that the United Nations can play in peacekeeping. While we greatly value the benefits of peacekeeping and the role played by the United Nations to that end  we consider that it is even more important to support and empower the Organization to continue its work towards peacemaking  peacebuilding and conflict prevention  particularly with regard to new and emerging threats. On my country’s behalf  I want to assure the Assembly that we will continue to offer any help deemed necessary to achieve those noble objectives."
"44",1813,"CZE",69,2014,"This year marks the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War. Yet in today’s world we are far from having achieved global peace. It therefore remains a major task for the international community to achieve it. But that is not the only task that remains. In order to achieve global peace we also have to tackle two other equally important challenges  namely  to preserve global human dignity  and global prosperity.I would like to start with global security. Europe is the continent that gave birth to the two most disastrous conflicts in human history. We Europeans have learned our lesson. A large part of our continent has been spared violent conflicts for almost 70 years. My country celebrates 25 years since our return to freedom and democracy in 1989.Yet even today a part of Europe is at war. The territorial integrity of Ukraine  guaranteed by the Charter of the United Nations and the Budapest Memorandum of 1994  was violated by the Russian annexation of Crimea and the activities of Russian-backed paramilitary separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. Despite the present armistice  we believe that it is still the responsibility of the international community to seek the de-escalation of a conflict that has caused enormous suffering to the people of Ukraine and the loss of innocent lives of Ukrainians and other people  as demonstrated by the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17.That is not all. We are alarmed at the continuing aggravation of the security situation in northern Iraq. We condemn the brutal acts of violence committed by the so-called Islamic State against local ethnic and religious minorities  as well as the murders of two innocent journalists and a humanitarian activist. Those acts constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. As we are currently seeing in Iraq  terrorism has taken on a new dimension  and we must counter it with the utmost determination. Therefore  we welcome President Obama’s strategy as well as other important international activities in that regard  including the Security Council summit on foreign terrorist fighters (see S/PV.7272).With regard to Syria  we believe that the only way to achieve a stable peace in that war-torn country and to ensure much-needed safety and legitimate rights for all Syrian people is through a negotiated political settlement between the Syrian Government and the democratic opposition. The Czech Republic  appalled by the atrocities committed by the so-called Islamic State  urges all sides of the conflict in Syria to cease violence and to start cooperating with the new United Nations Special Envoy in order to find a lasting solution.Moreover  we must not omit the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We remain deeply concerned about the humanitarian consequences of the conflict in the Gaza Strip. We have made an effort to provide assistance to the victims through humanitarian aid. However  first and foremost  the Palestinian and Israeli leaders have to make every effort  with the help of the international community  to renew genuine and comprehensive negotiations. That is the only way to reach a lasting solution that would bring about peace  dignity  security and prosperity for both Israelis and Palestinians.But there is also something else: the global dignity of human beings. In speaking of acts of violence — and the list I have provided is far from being exhaustive — we must keep looking for the causes behind those acts and seek to eliminate them. We often see that such acts result from despair and from a lack of the basic needs necessary to ensure human dignity  needs such as physical integrity  access to justice  political participation and basic freedoms  and also food  water  medical care  education  tolerable working conditions and protection against discrimination on various grounds. It is the responsibility of the international community  represented by the United Nations  to ensure that human dignity remains not only a declared principle of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights but is also put into practice worldwide. I am proud that my country can contribute to those efforts  building on the humanist legacy of my great compatriots  the first Czechoslovak President  Tomá. Garrigue Masaryk  and the first President of the Czech Republic  Václav Havel.The first precondition for human dignity is the possibility of enjoying life without threats to one’s physical integrity and physical suffering. For that reason the Czech Republic has vigorously supported the concept of the responsibility to protect  with its strong dimension of prevention and capacity-building. Yet  when a conflict cannot be prevented for various reasons  the United Nations is ultimately responsible  through its peacekeeping role  for preventing the further deterioration of the situation  loss of life and human suffering. The Czech Republic has consistently participated in various European Union (EU) missions complementing United Nations peacekeeping efforts  namely  in the EU Training Mission in Mali and in the Multinational Force and Observers mission in Sinai. I can assure members that we will remain involved in the future.National States and the international community share responsibility for protecting people from atrocities. However  if they fail  it is necessary to establish accountability for serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights. The Czech Republic continues firmly to support international criminal justice and the International Criminal Court. Our primary task is to combat impunity and to enforce the protection of civilians and vulnerable groups in armed conflicts.It is a sad reality that in too many parts of the world women are among the most vulnerable groups. We continue to witness horrifying cases of violence against women and girls  including sexual violence. We call on all States to adopt urgent measures to prevent such abhorrent incidents. When women are excluded from society and prevented from enjoying basic rights  participating in public life or simply exercising a profession  it has a massive impact not only on the country’s development but also on its overall stability. We expect the relevant United Nations bodies to step up their efforts to ensure a peaceful and dignified life for all  including women.In order to reinforce the prevention of various types of conflicts  we fully support the Rights Up Front initiative launched by the Secretary-General. We understand that it is an appeal to the United Nations and its bodies and to Member States to ensure respect for human rights  good governance  fair and free elections and genuine participation in decision-making without discrimination. The Czech Republic  as a member of the Human Rights Council  has for the second time presented a consensual resolution on political participation. In our view  giving everybody a chance to enjoy their civil and political rights through such participation is essential for building inclusive and truly cohesive societies.A life of peace and dignity is unthinkable without the enjoyment of economic  social and environmental rights. That can be achieved by fighting poverty  social exclusion and all forms of discrimination and illiteracy. I am convinced that the Czech Republic has a lot to offer in that respect. We are among the countries with the most equal distribution of wealth in the world. We are also a country with one of the lowest risks of falling into poverty in the world. We have managed to maintain a socially cohesive society  and we believe that that is one reason why our society is free of serious tensions resulting in violent conflicts. We want to contribute our experience to the efforts of the international community in order to build fair and prosperous societies across the planet.The key to building a fair society is sustainable development. To that end  we are committed to working on a post-2015 development agenda that will formulate sustainable development goals based on the 2000 Millennium Development Goals. The goals will be global in nature  universally applicable and will address persistent inequalities and new challenges facing people and our planet. The promotion of good governance  the rule of law  human rights and the empowerment of women must remain among the stand-alone priorities  but they are also cross-cutting issues linking various agendas. In that context  we look forward to the Secretary-General’s synthesis report expected by the end of the year.The Czech Republic expects that the sustainable development goals will have a true impact on the fashioning of a development policy that will correspond to the needs of present generations and improve their quality of life  but will not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. All countries  rich and poor  should therefore be committed to creating an economically viable yet more socially and environmentally sustainable future. We hope to be able to take part in that effort through our membership in the Economic and Social Council  to which we are candidates for membership starting in 2016.We are also actively involved in the EU and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  and we are ready to support all the proposals and solutions that are considered most effective to reach the new global climate agreement  hopefully to be concluded in Paris in 2015.I began by recalling the First World War and continued by enumerating three major challenges — global peace  global human dignity and global prosperity. They are enormous challenges. The United Nations has done impressive work in fostering peace  human dignity and sustainable development. I am confident that next year  when we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the Charter of the United Nations  we will have an opportunity not only to reflect honestly on where we could do better  but also to appreciate the progress that we have made together."
"45",1875,"DEU",69,2014,"The year 2014 is a special one for Europeans — a special year of commemoration. In the summer 100 years ago  European diplomacy failed and the world slid into the First World War. Seventy-five years ago  Germany attacked its neighbour Poland  plunging the world into the Second World War. Twenty-five years ago  the Berlin Wall fell  bringing an end to the world’s decades-long division into East and West.However  merely to look back and remember would not be enough in this year of commemoration. On the contrary  we must ask ourselves: what have we learned for the future? The most important lesson learned from that history was the establishment of the United Nations  for the United Nations embodies the world’s hope for peace. That hope derives from an idea which is as simple as it is revolutionary: there is peace when the world sets rules for itself and replaces the law of force with the force of law  when conflicts are resolved at the negotiating table and not on the battlefield  when the world renounces  step by step  the cynical logic of violence.To date  the United Nations has provided a universal foundation for the hope for peace. But that universality is under threat from the ghosts of the past and from new demons.In 2014 our world seems to be unraveling. Crises are coming at us thick and fast. That is why it is not enough simply to call upon the United Nations. No  we need to breathe life into that call. Hope will remain but a hope  an unattainable goal  unless States are prepared to take on responsibility. The United Nations is not a forum onto which we can shrug off responsibility. The United Nations is a forum whereby we assume responsibility.Germany  embedded in a united Europe  is prepared to take on responsibility in and with the United Nations. First and foremost we have a responsibility to the people bearing the brunt of the suffering in the crises.Next month Germany will host a conference in Berlin to mobilize urgently needed humanitarian assistance for the millions of Syrian refugees. My country will play its part  and I sincerely hope that many others will follow suit. Support is needed above all by Syria’s neighbours. They are doing a tremendous job but are also under tremendous strain due to the huge influx of displaced persons and refugees from Syria.The Ebola epidemic is raging in West Africa. It is bringing suffering and death into the homes of individual families. It is endangering the cohesion of entire societies. That is why we are sending humanitarian and medical assistance and setting up an airlift to the region. I am delighted that many volunteers in my country have responded to the call  saying  “I want to go there to help on the spot”.Above and beyond the immediate solidarity  however  we need a long-term commitment. We need the expertise of the World Health Organization and the coordinating umbrella of the United Nations  particularly in the long term as we try to strengthen States and health-care systems. Germany will contribute to both of those goals. We cannot bring the dead back to life  but we may be able to prevent far too many more people dying of Ebola who ought not to be dying if they were treated. And we must certainly make sure that the next epidemic does not have consequences as deadly as the one we are still fighting.If we are to move towards the hope of peace  we need many small steps — the commitment of individuals  bilateral diplomacy and regional initiatives. But none of that can replace the United Nations. Only the United Nations can provide a universal foundation for the hope of peace. That foundation is international law  to which everyone who belongs to the community of nations in the United Nations  and those who want to belong  has subscribed. That is what must be preserved; that is the core of our hope for peace.That is why I must here mention the conflict in Ukraine. Some people in the Hall may regard it as nothing more than a regional conflict in Eastern Europe. But I am convinced that that view is incorrect. I believe that that conflict affects each and every one of us. Not just any State  but a permanent member of the Security Council — Russia — has  with its annexation of Crimea  unilaterally altered existing borders in Europe and has thus violated international law. We must counter that dangerous sign  because we must not allow the power of international law to be eroded from the inside. We must not allow the old divisions between East and West to re-emerge in the United Nations.Because so much is at stake in that conflict  not only for the people of Ukraine but also for the future of international law  Germany and its partners have taken on responsibility and committed themselves vigorously to defusing the conflict. I am under no illusion: a political solution is still a long way off. However  just a few weeks ago we were on the brink of a direct military confrontation between Russian and Ukrainian armed forces. I am happy to say that diplomacy prevented the worst. Now the priority must be to bring about a lasting ceasefire and achieve a political solution  one based on the principles of the United Nations and preserving the unity of Ukraine.I am not discussing only Ukraine. As long as that conflict is simmering and as long as Russia and the West are in a dispute over Ukraine  there is a threat of paralysing the United Nations. We therefore need a Security Council that is able and willing to act to tackle the new and  in the long term  far more important tasks we are facing. The world of 2014 is plagued not only by the old ghost of division  but also by new demons.We are all shocked by the unspeakable brutality of the terrorists who misuse the name of God in carrying out their evil deeds. My question is  ought we not to be particularly worried that the preachers of hate are drawing in young people who have grown up in the midst of our own societies?That is why that  too  is not exclusively a regional conflict — a problem in Iraq or in Syria or in Africa  where terrorists are stamping on the fundamental rights of women and girls in particular. That barbarity is directed against every one of us  and against everything for which the United Nations stands.Precisely for that reason  our response needs to go much further than the immediately necessary humanitarian and military response. Germany is making substantial contributions to both  including militarily. But all that must be part of a political alliance against the terror of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. My country is strongly committed to that alliance  and I very much hope in particular that the societies of the Middle East  realizing that far more is at stake than just their security  will also join.In a world haunted both by old ghosts and new demons  we have to be able to pursue both paths. On the one hand  we must steadfastly continue to work towards political solutions in Ukraine  in the Middle East  in Syria  but at the same time we must tackle the huge tasks of the twenty-first century.I am referring to the fight against climate change. Germany is contributing $1 billion dollars to the Green Climate Fund. And we will support our closest partner  France  on the road to a successful Paris climate summit in 2015 and to a universal and legally binding climate convention  which we urgently need.I am also referring to the digital age. Yes  the Internet should be a global  free  open and safe space. But that is not a matter solely for Government agencies or big companies. That global  free  open and safe space must be shaped by society as a whole. If we fail to act  the vast technological possibilities will sweep aside the human dimension. We need an international law for the digital world. Resolution 68/167  which we introduced together with Brazil  has made a start in that direction  I hope  at the United Nations.I am also referring to the post-2015 agenda  because the fight against poverty begins with asking how we actually create value. How do we create prosperity? That question is not only directed at a few countries in need of help. Rather  it is a call to the whole world for more sustainable economic activity. With its shift to renewable energies  Germany has set out on a path that  although not easy  is one the world must take if we want to preserve our natural resources and if the fight for scarce resources  water and arable land is not to become the major conflict of the twenty-first century.Our children will judge us by those huge tasks. They will look back  just as we are looking back at our forebears in this year of commemoration. Having learned from two World Wars  our forebears established the United Nations as their lesson to us. If we want to continue that lesson  if we want to master the tasks facing us  then we must further develop this institution. The United Nations is not a finished product. Perhaps it will never be a finished product. It must evolve further  so that in all its parts  including the Security Council  it reflects today’s world.I believe that the United Nations is worth every effort  for in it lives the world’s hope for peace and a legal order. I assure the Assembly that my country will play its part in making that hope a reality  step by step."
"46",1934,"DMA",69,2014,"I would like to begin by congratulating His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa  former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uganda  on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank His Excellency Mr. John Ashe for his leadership of the Assembly at its sixty-eighth session  and to salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his continued efforts to promote peace  security and development throughout the world.Dominica is among six small independent States in the Caribbean that  together with three non-independent small island territories  constitute the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). The OECS States are not simply small island developing States (SIDS)  they are very small island developing States  and therefore among the most vulnerable members of the United Nations family. Twenty years after the adoption of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States  and 10 years after the approval of the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation  most of the commitments made to promote sustainable development in SIDS have yet to be delivered. However  we remain hopeful that the recently concluded third United Nations Conference on Small Island Developing States  held in Apia  Samoa  will have been a watershed moment for SIDS. We expect the draft outcome document of the Conference (A/CONF. 223/3) to create a new basis on which to address the implementation gaps that continue to stymie any movement towards sustainable development in SIDS.I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the Government and people of Samoa on hosting a major international conference. Their tenacity  determination and commitment are a demonstration of what can be achieved by SIDS  despite the many challenges they face. One major outcome of the Samoa Conference was the historic establishment of an all-SIDS — that is  SIDS-SIDS — initiative aimed at creating an international organization to serve as a platform for the development of sustainable energy in SIDS  known as SIDS DOCK. On 1 September  a treaty formally establishing SIDS DOCK as an international organization was opened for signature. Twenty of the 30 members of the Alliance of Small Island States have signed on to the treaty. As Chair of the SIDS DOCK Steering Committee  the Government of Dominica wishes to thank the host country  Samoa  the other Member States that are signatories to the treaty  our partners — Denmark  Japan  the United Nations Development Programme  the World Bank  the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  the Clinton Foundation  the secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environmental Programme  the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre — and the SIDS DOCK secretariat and all the volunteers for making that historic event possible.Unfortunately  the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the post-2015 agenda have not progressed at a pace that those of us in the SIDS group would have liked. Almost 15 years since the Millennium Declaration was adopted (resolution 55/2)  only a few countries in the developing world have registered tangible gains. The majority continue to wait for the promised improvements in their living conditions. Nonetheless  Dominica has been able to meet most of the MDGs  notably in reducing poverty  improving access to education  ensuring environmental sustainability and building strong bilateral and multilateral partnerships. Our progress in poverty reduction has been noted by the Caribbean Development Bank  which stated in its 2009 report on Dominica that“the level of poverty in Dominica has fallen from 39 per cent in 2003 to 28.8 per cent in 2009. Absolute poverty  as measured by the indigence rate  has also declined from 10 per cent in 2003 to 3.1 per cent in 2009.”Our achievements in education have also surpassed the targets set by the MDGs. Recognizing the importance of education to our development agenda  Dominica continues to make major investments in improving access to quality education for our people. To date  we can boast of universal access to education at the early childhood  primary and secondary levels  and access to post-secondary education is available to all secondary-school graduates.Dominica has always been guided by the principle of the sustainable use of its natural resources and the protection of its physical environment. For those reasons  Dominica has been called the “Nature Island of the Caribbean”. We therefore have much that we can share with the United Nations family on the subject of the sustainable use of natural resources. In our efforts to protect and ensure environmental sustainability and to rid our country of its reliance on fossil fuels for generating electricity  the Government of Dominica has invested  and continues to invest  in renewable energy. Today about 20 per cent of the island’s electricity needs are met from “clean” hydropower.Additionally  however  the Government has been pursuing the development of the country’s geothermal resources. To date  the Government has invested over $20 million in geothermal development. The first production and reinjection wells have been completed  and the results of the flow tests indicate that the geothermal reservoir has a capacity to generate sufficient electricity for domestic consumption and for export to the neighbouring French territories of Martinique and Guadeloupe. The first plant for purely domestic consumption is expected to be commissioned in 2016.Dominica’s development achievements in general  and the attainment of the MDGs in particular  have been realized through the strong  visionary and compassionate leadership of Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit and his Cabinet  complemented by our hard-working citizens and the kind cooperation of our development partners. Our partnerships with the European Union  the United States of America  Japan and other developed countries have all contributed significantly to the progress we have been able to make thus far. The recent approval by the World Bank of the Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience  which will undertake a number of infrastructure projects designed to transform Dominica into a climate-resilient and low-carbon developing country and is expected  among other benefits  to positively impact agricultural productivity and food security in our rural communities.South-South cooperation with partners from developing countries  notably the People’s Republic of China  Cuba  Morocco and Venezuela  and from the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America  has been able to complement the decreasing assistance from traditional partners. We embrace all our development partners and look forward to the deepening and strengthening of our partnerships for the benefits of all our people.In spite of those achievements  we are a long way from where we aspire to be. The spectre of the deadly Ebola disease and the scourges of HIV/AIDS and non-communicable diseases has the potential to significantly impact our people and threaten the gains made so far by small island developing States. Therefore  that myriad of challenges calls for collective global action to protect the gains that small island States like Dominica have been able to achieve over the past two decades and to lay a path for development that is sustainable and people-focused.Additionally  the impact of climate change remains an existential threat to the people throughout the world who call small island States their homes. The location  level of development and vulnerability of our islands make them very susceptible to the impact of climate change. Very often  we refer to climate change and its effects as a phenomenon that is to impact our global community at some future date. The unfortunate reality is that SIDS have already been suffering from the impact of climate change. The increasing severity of storms and hurricanes is becoming more prevalent  and with every strike the extreme weather claims lives and threatens our development efforts. According to a 2008 publication by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  the Caribbean has the second-greatest risk of hurricanes in the world. The report also highlights the increased frequency of tropical cyclones in our region.The islands of the Caribbean are also prone to earthquakes  volcanic eruptions  droughts  torrential rains with accompanying landslides and flash flooding. We in the Caribbean have therefore been on the receiving end of the impact of climate change for decades. A case in point is the impact of Hurricane Ivan  a category-3 system that devastated the island of Grenada on 7 September 2004. Hurricane Ivan exposed the vulnerability that is inherent in SIDS. Twenty-eight lives were lost and 18 000 people were left without shelter  food or belongings. A post-Ivan study conducted by the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States reported that:“The macro-economic assessment of the damages caused by Hurricane Ivan  which wreaked havoc on Grenada  inflicted damages totalling $1 billion  more than twice the value of that country’s GDP”.In more recent times  on 24 December 2013  a time outside the traditional hurricane season  the Caribbean islands of Dominica  Saint Lucia  and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines were severely affected by a trough system that brought with it heavy rains and high winds. That slow-moving weather system left behind approximately $128 million worth of direct damage. Within less than 12 hours  each of those countries suffered significant loss: Dominica — $17 million  or 3.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP); Saint Lucia — $19 million  or 1.4 per cent of GDP; and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines — $93 million  or 12.8 per cent. The indirect impacts  which include the loss of agricultural production and interruptions in other economic activities  such as tourism  would increase the overall effect significantly. The most devastating hurricane to hit Dominica in living memory was Hurricane David  on 29 August 1979  a category-5 hurricane that left the island devastated as if by war  resulting in 43 deaths and with all public utilities  infrastructure  60 per cent of homes  roads and sea defences totally destroyed.Such natural disasters affect the daily lives of our people and significantly retard our efforts to bring about social and economic development. We therefore call on all States Members of the United Nations to take immediate actions to approve a legally binding agreement to reduce the impact of climate change. The climate change agenda must be an integral part of the post-2015 agenda.The creation of wealth and the generation of economic growth are essential for the eradication of poverty and the improvement of the quality of life of our people. However  economic growth and development should be inclusive and sustainable. The creation of jobs and the delivery of social services should touch the lives of all our people  especially the indigenous people  the elderly  the disadvantaged  the disabled  the vulnerable  and those people who are excluded from mainstream society. The development of agriculture  tourism  the energy sector and industry should therefore be inclusive and sustainable.Dominica therefore joins the rest of the Caribbean Community in calling for development partners to conduct their macroeconomic and trade policies in a way that facilitates opportunities for SIDS to promote economic growth  shrink existing income gaps  reduce the levels of poverty and achieve their development aspirations. Those policies should include  but not be limited to  a change in the criteria for the graduation of SIDS from preferential access to multilateral concessionary financing. The new criteria must take into account the inherent vulnerabilities of SIDS and the need for building resilience to the impact of climate change and the vagaries of the global financial  economic and trading systems. Therefore  any measure that inhibits any State Member of the United Nations family from becoming fully integrated into the global financial and trading system should be removed.In that vein  the economic embargo against our brothers and sisters in Cuba continues to be of concern to us in the Caribbean. That unilateral action by the United States of America against our sister Caribbean island  whatever the excuses might have been 55 years ago  cannot be justified today  nor can the suffering of our brothers and sisters in the Republic of Cuba  as a result of their exclusion for 55 years from the world banking and trading system  be defended. It is well established that  whatever the objectives were 55 years ago  they are not likely to be achieved through the continuation of the embargo. The Government of Dominica therefore calls on the United States to heed the call of the General Assembly to lift the embargo against Cuba and to support the full integration of the Cuban people into the global financial and trading systems.The embargo notwithstanding  the Cuban people continue to make a tremendous contribution to human development across the globe. For decades  Cuba has been training doctors  nurses  engineers and other professionals  deploying them to provide technical assistance to developing countries as part of its South-South cooperation. Cuba also offers professional training in various disciplines to thousands of students from all over the developing world.Cuba continues to add its voice in the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking in the Caribbean and the rest of the world. It is for that reason that Dominica fails to comprehend the continued listing of Cuba as a State sponsor of terrorism. We therefore call for the removal of Cuba from the list of countries that sponsor terrorism. Our efforts in the region should be focused instead on combating the real threats to global peace and security.Similarly  the events unfolding in Ukraine are a proxy tug-of-war between the European Union and the United States  on the one hand  and the Russian Federation  on the other. The Ukrainian people are the victims of the contest  which is a throwback to the Cold War.The United Kingdom  when confronted with the question of Irish nationalism in 1918  resolved the matter through the ballot box with a county-by-county referendum on the future of Ireland. Most counties opted for independence  but five counties opted for continued union with the United Kingdom. Three years later  the island was partitioned into the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland  the latter remaining part of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom currently faces the question of Scottish independence. Once again  only last week on 18 September  the United Kingdom resorted to the ballot box to decide the matter. While the supporters of the campaign in favour of independence will be disappointed by the results  the real victors are not the supporters of the campaign for continued union with the United Kingdom but democracy itself.With that experience  the United Kingdom is uniquely placed to counsel the European Union  the United States  Kyiv and Moscow about how to grant the people of Ukraine the same opportunity to decide their destiny for themselves  according to their regional preferences and without coercion either from the East or from the West. Such an approach would end the paralysis in the Security Council  thereby creating a real partnership among the United States  the Russian Federation and China and enabling the United Nations to fulfil its mandate to assist in conflict resolution  combat the greatest threats facing the world today  namely  armed conflict and terrorism  and create a more peaceful international community.In conclusion  I wish to reiterate to the General Assembly that the impact of climate change is a major threat to the development efforts and to the very existence of small island developing States. The incidence of severe weather conditions  including coastal erosion and sea-level rise  continues to impact island States in the worst ways possible. Our ability to survive depends not only on the individual and collective actions taken by SIDS  but also on the actions of the rest of the international community.A legally binding outcome to the climate change negotiations is a critical component in a series of actions to be taken by Member States. That should be buttressed by a post-2015 agenda that includes poverty eradication  increased access to education and training  health care  potable water and sanitation  and promotes sustainable and inclusive economic development.The outcomes of the third United Nations Conference on SIDS in Samoa should serve as a blueprint for the growth and development of SIDS. That should include the restructuring of the international financial and trading architecture so that the vulnerabilities and special circumstances of SIDS are taken into account. That new configuration will allow for the development of SIDS through sustainable agriculture  tourism and inclusive industrial development. However  such efforts must be propelled by sustainable energy that maximizes the use of renewable SIDS-appropriate energy resources in the most energy efficient manner.Finally  I wish all participants in this sixty-ninth session every success in their deliberations."
"47",1978,"DNK",69,2014,"Despite our aspirations to create a more just and peaceful world  atrocities continue to take place. Every day we witness expressions of the darker side of human nature: thousands of innocent civilians besieged on a mountain in northern Iraq by heavily armed extremists; a Syrian dictator who bombs and starves his own people  leaving more than 10 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance; the persecution of people because of their religious or political beliefs  their gender or sexual orientation; disrespect for national borders  challenging the basic principles on which our rules-based international order is built; climate change causing great risks to human health  global food security and economic development and to the natural resources on which so much of our prosperity depends; and a world of more than 7 billion people with an increasing demand for key resources and an unsustainable pattern of consumption and production.The challenges we face are complex. There are no simple solutions. What is required of us is strong  collective international action  not only to manage the crises and conflicts of today but to prevent the crises and conflicts of tomorrow. I am a true believer in international cooperation and in the virtues of the United Nations  but as the world changes and we are faced with new challenges  we must find new ways to adapt.I am also confident that we will adapt  but only if we have a strong United Nations  and only if we act together. As Member States each one of us must fulfil our obligations under the Charter. That is our common commitment and our shared responsibility. I see three challenges where we  the United Nations  should act and should act now. Urgency is key.First  we need stronger international cooperation and action on peace and security. Secondly  we have to reach an ambitious international agreement on climate change next year in Paris. Thirdly  we have to agree on the post-2015 agenda for sustainable development.Of the three challenges  the first is international peace and security. This past year  we have seen the rise of a violent and intensifying conflict fuelled by extremism  in particular the horrific and brutal terrorist organization  the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). ISIL represents a distorted political ideology that must be confronted  degraded and defeated by the entire international community  including  of course  countries in the region. As we are gathered this week  the States Members of the United Nations are sending a clear message that we utterly condemn ISIL’s cowardly acts of terror and that we are unified in our firm resolve to oppose and confront its violent and extremist ideology. Let it be clear that we are determined to support the Iraqi Government in protecting its people.Denmark will stand up for our common values as enshrined in the United Nations Charter  and Denmark will support the victims of ISIL’S atrocities. We are taking part in the humanitarian relief efforts in northern Iraq  and we will continue our active contribution to the international efforts to support Iraq in the fight against ISIL. To stop the advance of ISIL  it is imperative to end the flow of foreign fighters and financing from outside. That indeed is a common obligation. It is also critical that we address the root causes of violent extremism and improve the conditions in Syria that ISIL has been able to exploit.The humanitarian situation in Syria continues to be of great concern. Though progress is difficult  we must spare no effort to seek a political solution leading to a transition from the current regime. There will always be a risk that political transition will be exploited by violent extremists. Still  history shows that democratic and inclusive Governments  open societies and a fundamental respect for human rights remain the only viable path towards stability  security and prosperity for our citizens.Bringing an end to the violence in the region will require a sustained and comprehensive contribution from every one of us. The successful removal of Al-Assad’s chemical weapons clearly demonstrated what can be achieved when we join forces in decisive international action. A coalition of Denmark  Norway  Russia  China  Finland  the United Kingdom and the United States effectively secured and destroyed those horrendous weapons of war.Our united response is also required against another growing threat. The Ebola epidemic has become a severe humanitarian  social and economic crisis for countries in West Africa. If we fail to act now  it may develop into a global health crisis  impacting millions of people. If so  we will not only be confronted with a health crisis but also with a threat to international peace  prosperity and security. It is very clear that this challenge cannot be tackled by any one nation alone. That is why we must all lend our support. The United Nations and its Member States have a common responsibility to bring Ebola under control.Ebola is not just a regional challenge; it has now become a global crisis. Denmark is committed to that cause. We have already contributed to the international response  including the United Nations humanitarian air service  and we will now increase our support. Today  I can announce that Denmark will provide a maritime transport capacity to the United Nations. With that  we will support the construction of needed housing facilities for the international health personnel in the affected areas. We will provide additional funding to the World Health Organization. As the situation evolves  we will stand ready to consider additional steps.The global community is based on international law. That law must be respected and not blatantly violated  as we have seen done in the past year. We have witnessed an unacceptable foreign intervention in Ukraine. Fundamental principles of national sovereignty and non-interference have been disrespected. The recent ceasefire is an important step on the only viable way forward  namely  a political solution. Yet  we have to see Russia’s commitment to a political solution demonstrated in action  not only in words. Throughout the conflict Russia’s self-proclaimed support to the peace process has been in stark contrast to realities on the ground.We remain fully committed to a political solution that respects Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Respect for international law and human rights should always be at the very core of peace and development  as should the rule of law and good governance. That is why Denmark strongly supports bold and significant new steps in the United Nations  such as the Secretary-General’s recent Rights Up Front initiative.This year also marks the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Together with Chile  Ghana  Indonesia and Morocco  Denmark has launched a long-term initiative for the universal ratification and implementation of that Convention. We have made significant progress  but we also need to do more to protect men and women in all parts of the world from torture and ill-treatment.My second point is about the need to advance our collective answer to the challenges posed by climate change. Earlier this year I had the privilege  together with the Premier of Greenland  of hosting a visit by the Secretary-General to Greenland. We travelled together by dog sleigh on the receding ice  and we heard the stories told by the local population about how the changes are affecting local livelihoods. Climate change is painfully visible in the Arctic. That is beyond discussion. Let there be no illusion that climate change will have only regional impacts. The changes will affect each and every one of us on this planet. That is why ambitious action is required of us now. One crucial step would be a binding global agreement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Paris next year.Since 2010  Denmark has dedicated $350 million to climate action. This year alone  we will commit more than $100 million. But Governments cannot do this alone. We need to engage the private sector and other partners to commit to action and ensure adequate climate finance and foster innovation and green solutions. Some still might fear that the green transition will limit economic growth. That is not necessarily so. For example  the Danish economy has grown by 40 per cent since 1990  while our total emissions have decreased by 20 per cent in that same period. In other words  it is possible to de-link economic growth from increased emissions. At the Secretary-General’s Climate Summit yesterday  world leaders expressed their commitment to address those issues. Now is the time to deliver on that commitment.The third and final area where Denmark sees an urgent need for action is on the post-2015 agenda for sustainable development. As stated by the Secretary-General: “Ours is the first generation that can wipe poverty from the face of the Earth” (A/68/PV.5  p. 1). That is not a message based on wishful thinking. It is based on the facts. It is within our reach and it has to be done. Over a 20-year period  from 1990-2010  700 million people have been lifted out of extreme poverty. Child mortality has been reduced by almost 50 per cent. Ninety per cent of children in developing regions now attend primary schools. That represents truly historic progress. But still we need to do more.The Millennium Development Goals were formulated almost 15 years ago  and the world has  as we know  developed rapidly since. Clearly  the new set of sustainable development goals must address and integrate the economic  social  and environmental dimensions of development.Another important factor is to ensure women’s empowerment  gender equality and the rights of women and girls. That includes sexual and reproductive health rights. In too many places those fundamental rights are still not observed. Women and young girls must have the right to decide freely whether they want to have children  when  how many  and with whom.All young people must have access to proper education. Two hundred years ago  compulsory education was introduced in my country. Education for the many and not just for the few has been a primary driver in transforming Denmark into a democratic and prosperous nation. Education has also been a driver of gender equality  and still is. That is one aspect of the post-2015 agenda that is particularly close to my heart. I have been very proud to be one of the Secretary-General’s Champions for his Global Education First Initiative. One of our key priorities must be to ensure quality education also for the most disadvantaged groups and in the most vulnerable countries.As we look at the global landscape today  insecurity is sadly on the rise. We all know who is paying the highest price. Today for the first time since the Second World War  more than 50 million people throughout the world have been displaced owing to conflict and violence. Far too many of those people are children.We need a United Nations that can help mediate  prevent and resolve armed conflicts and promote universal respect for human rights. We need a United Nations that is committed to act against climate change. And we need a United Nations that can help deliver sustainable development for all and provide effective assistance to countries suffering from the Ebola virus.But the United Nations can do nothing without the collective political will of all of us  its Member States. The world needs a United Nations that adapts to new challenges and reflects the changing global political realities. Denmark supports a reformed Security Council that fulfils its primary purpose and responsibility when peace and security is threatened. We need a United Nations based on the strong values and obligations enshrined in the United Nations Charter. More than ever  we need a United Nations that acts."
"48",2023,"DOM",69,2014,"It is an honour to participate in the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations by representing the people and the Government of the Dominican Republic. I wish to express my sincere congratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as President at the current session. I wish to thank the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for the honour bestowed on our country by inviting us to participate in the Education First initiative. As I hope that he was able to note in his recent visit to our country  the priority that education is being given in the Dominican Republic is perhaps the best indicator of the new hopes springing up in our country. It is true that news of hope is especially valuable these days when it is not very abundant.Generally speaking  the times we live in raise major challenges for the mission of the Organization — preserving peace  encouraging development  making education and health the entitlement of all inhabitants of the Earth. As we are all aware  about six years ago  a crisis that began in the financial sector of developed countries quickly spread to all productive sectors and has affected the entire planet. The consequences of the economic shock continue to be felt and were translated into tens of millions of unemployed  millions of evictions and deep cuts in social benefits in our countries.The welfare State  the instrument which produced some of the greatest advances in development and security in history  was jeopardized. Today  we live the paradox of seeing how that ideal of sustainable growth and social justice becomes more fragile in the countries of origin  while it is being reborn in emerging countries. While developed countries adopt policies of austerity and structural adjustments  which are concepts sadly familiar to Latin Americans  we see how social programmes proliferate in different corners of the planet  lifting millions out of poverty and mitigating inequality.In the Dominican Republic  we still have a long road ahead of us  but we are taking firm steps in the fight against poverty and inequality. We are a small country but we do not lack ambition. We have made the commitment to our people  our citizens  to put them at the centre of our public policy. And we have set ourselves the goal to become a developed and prosperous country  where equal opportunities will be  not an ideal  but an everyday reality.To achieve this  we have established a major domestic compact  which will be our top priority as a nation: namely  education. That is why we have doubled the current budget for public education and allocated to it 4 per cent of our gross domestic product. This will enable us to carry out the largest expansion of school infrastructure ever in our history and ensure that all girls and boys  without exception  will have access to quality public education. I am also proud to tell the Assembly that at the end of this year  thanks to the efforts of thousands of volunteers  we will be in a position to declare our country free of illiteracy.In health  that second pillar essential to the welfare State  we are also making significant progress. We have eliminated the co-payment for all public hospitals. Every year  we add 450 000 participants to the subsidized health insurance system.We are also giving priority to supporting small agricultural producers. We have been visiting rural communities every week for two years now  listening to people and seeking ways of helping them  such as by providing credits  training and infrastructure. The result of this  which is being monitored by the United Nations Development Programme  is a rebirth of the Dominican countryside  including improving its ability to feed the country and creating employment in rural communities. Thanks to that and other measures  over the past 18 months in the Dominican Republic overall poverty has been reduced by 6 per cent and poverty in rural areas by 9 per cent. In other words  in 18 months we have lifted more than half a million people out of poverty. We will continue to work tirelessly  implementing policies that put the economy at the service of the people and taking measures to combat poverty and inequality in a sustainable manner  and we will continue to create the basis of what one day will be a full welfare State in the Dominican Republic.It is an honour for us to be one of the signatory nations of the founding Charter of the United Nations  which  as everyone knows  assigned to the Organization its purpose of saving future generations from the scourge of war. We should recognize that 2014 is presenting major challenges to that noble purpose. In different latitudes of the world  there have been violent conflicts between communities  peoples or States. The contexts of those conflicts are varied  but one thing remains constant — the extent to which past grievances shape our identities today  and how dangerous it is to allow oneself to be submerged by them. We watch in perplexity and indignation the virulence with which these violent conflicts are waged in different parts of the world.The Middle East is once again the scene of the bloodiest sectarianism  which we condemn from this rostrum in all its manifestations. In the history of all nations or communities  without exception  there is a long history of disagreements  misunderstandings and quarrels that  at times  can be used to stir up the worst passions. They can be manipulated by individuals seeking to consolidate power or inflamed by extremist groups that feel that they have nothing to lose. There will always be someone who keeps old disputes alive. There will always be someone who does not mind sacrificing the true interests of the people at the time because of the wrongs of the past recorded in the history books.However  there are plenty of examples to the contrary. Throughout the world  there are people and countries that have managed to leave their past behind in order to focus on building the future that they want for their children and new generations. Whether it is building bridges between countries once in conflict  as the European Union did  or among communities that decided to share the same nation  as in the case of South Africa. Hope can and must find its way.I would also like  if I may  to bring a note of optimism from our Caribbean region. In the past year  we started a dialogue process with neighbouring Haiti that can rightly be regarded as historic. Our situation is of course unique but not to the degree that it cannot be echoed in other parts of the world. As members perhaps know  since the birth of our two Republics  there has been a long history of misunderstanding and disputes  which led to each of our countries having a distorted picture of the other.It is true that in our past there were a couple of painful chapters  which are part of our identity. However  if we limit our identity to those few chapters  it will be impoverished. Our history is very rich. It has hundreds of chapters. In many of them  we can find the inspiration to guide us towards a better future and a more complete  richer and more human identity because that is clearly an excellent basis for understanding. In both countries  there are millions of people who want better development  education  health care  security and jobs and more opportunities. Those are concrete demands that require specific measures. The truth is that  by responding to them and reaching agreements in each of those areas  in a few months we were able to achieve the progress that we had not made in decades.Little by little  we are moving forward. We are discovering that old wounds do not impede advancing on that path  but that they heal as we move forward. Our peoples demanded that we exercise the necessary courage to take the first step. We will continue to take steps until we achieve our goal of two free  sovereign and independent nations that  on the basis of their sovereignty  cooperate for the benefit of their respective peoples.I wish to take this opportunity from this rostrum at the General Assembly to make an appeal. As I have said  a new era in Dominican-Haitian relations has begun. In that new phase  we would like to enjoy the support of the international community. One of our main actions to strengthen Dominican sovereignty and to ensure the rights of people living in our territory is to provide them all the relevant documentation. As members know  many of those people are Haitian. In order to regularize their status in the territory of the Dominican Republic  they must first have identity papers from their country of origin  which many of them unfortunately lack. Haiti is making an effort to reach those Haitians and to provide them with documents that recognize them as its nationals. However  Haiti’s technical and economic resources are limited. In the past  a number of international organizations and countries have expressed their concern about the fate of Haitian migrants. We share that concern for humanitarian reasons and because it affects us as the main host country.I would therefore note that now is an excellent time to move from words to actions. With specific and relatively simple actions  the international community can have a major and lasting impact on the lives of those people. I appeal for help for Haiti. May the international community help Haiti to document its people in its territory and in ours  since documentation is the first essential step for the enjoyment of a wide-ranging body of rights. Let us not allow a few technical shortcomings to be an obstacle to such a hopeful and necessary process with as much potential as that new stage of cooperation between the Dominican Republic and Haiti.There are times when our best aspirations seem fragile. There are times when cynical people point out  under I do not know what law of the economy or in history  that we are bound to repeat the mistakes of the past. They say that poverty cannot be overcome  that the gap of inequality will always grow and that past grievances will be reborn in each new generation. However  we know that none of that is true. We know where to look to find the path of hope. We have only to look at those who are closest  that is  our own people  their basic daily needs and the hopes that motivate them to continue the struggle. If we look carefully  we see that the economy is not a prison but can be a tool for improving the lives of people. We find that the people are free. They are free to know which parts of their past they wish to use as a guide to their future and which they wish to leave aside.We will find a way to work together  as we have done with the neighbours with whom we share an island  or as we found yesterday  during the climate summit  with the other countries with which we share the planet. The citizens that we represent  increasingly better informed  demand that we live up to our responsibility and our declared commitment: to preserve peace  to promote development and to make education and health care the right of all inhabitants of the planet."
"49",2070,"DZA",69,2014,"I should like at the outset to express my satisfaction at seeing Mr. Sam Kutesa  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uganda  an African neighbour  brother and friend  presiding over this important session of the General Assembly and to assure him of our full cooperation. I should also like to hail his predecessor the outgoing President of the General Assembly  Mr. John Ashe  and to pay homage to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his work in driving forward the role and missions of the United Nations.The theme of the general debate focuses on the future and the prospects for future generations. This reminds us  on the eve of the global summit on the post-2015 development agenda and of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations  of the urgency of making a renewed commitment to multilateralism founded on international law.Given the persistence and varied manifestations of the current crisis  we must have a comprehensive vision in order to make the United Nations a builder of lasting solutions to modern global problems. We are banking on the hope that the new sustainable development goals (SDGs) will contribute to bringing about a world that makes it possible for us effectively to protect human rights  guarantee the inclusive participation of all  and ensure that everyone — particularly those living in the forlorn regions in which 40 per cent of the poorest people live — shares in prosperity.That was the formulation expressed by the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) at the seventeenth Ministerial Conference hosted by Algeria in May  in reaffirming the relevance and importance of the right to development and the pressing need to eradicate poverty  which has been identified as a global challenge and a central objective of the post-2015 development agenda. Algeria is pursuing its efforts to reach a comprehensive and ambitious agreement on the SDGs and on climate  to include  in the case of the latter  desertification and access to genetic resources. Furthermore  we must see the implementation of commitments  whether they are commitments made as official development assistance or within the Monterrey Consensus  in the Doha Declaration or at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development.At the United Nations  Algeria coordinates the NAM working group on the revitalization of the General Assembly. In that role  Algeria will continue its efforts to ensure that the NAM working group  which is the most representative in the international system  assumes its full role. At the same time  Algeria will continue to work with its partners in the African Union Committee of Ten towards Security Council reform  aimed at putting an end to the historical injustices vis-à-vis the African continent  which wants  more than anything  representation and legitimacy in the Security Council. In that context  the strengthening of cooperation and the multiform partnerships between the African Union and the United Nations should be encouraged  in particular in the context of the many conflicts and crises that continue to afflict Africa and to slow down the conclusion of its decolonization process.From that perspective  the global review that Mr. Ban Ki-moon is called upon to present in April 2015 on the question of Western Sahara  which pits the Kingdom of Morocco against the Frente Popular para la Liberación de Saguía el-Hamra y de Río de Oro  must honour the United Nations doctrine in the matter of decolonization  as well as stress the importance of the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. Algeria supports the inalienable right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination  as has been well established  and in that regard Algeria encourages the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy  Ambassador Christopher Ross  to intensify their efforts to ensure the success of that effort to move towards peace.Algeria is a stakeholder in the common destiny of the peoples of the Maghreb. Algeria’s own development has been conceived and guided by the desire to achieve the integration of the vast geopolitical space of which it is at the very centre. The policy platform on which President Bouteflika was re-elected and the five-year plan of action of his Administration hinge on a deepening of participative democracy  the modernization of the judiciary  equal opportunities for men and women  and good governance. The economic effort has allocated significant public investment in the sectors of agriculture  industry  energy  the environment and tourism  and into the diversification and modernization of the economy  all based on objectives tied to competitiveness and a substantial relaunching of growth. At the same time  Algeria is working to promote development with mutually beneficial strategic partners  based on respect for sovereignty and a balance of interests  in order to bring about opportunities for cooperation and the means of tackling the challenges and threats of a transnational nature. That cooperation excludes unilateral measures such as the embargo imposed on Cuba.The worrisome spread of the Ebola virus has been declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a global health emergency  and that reminds us tragically of the structural precariousness of human security systems  as well as of the responsibility of the international community in the treatment of health problems that affect the poor  who have no means or role in decision-making. Algeria adds its voice to that of the Secretary-General in urging the United Nations agencies and other donors  as well as non-governmental organizations  quickly to provide the international assistance needed by the African countries that have been hit by that scourge.That existential threat is yet another that Africa must collectively take on in order to ensure its rebirth  and brings with it challenges in the area of peace and security. At the behest of the stakeholders in Mali  Algeria is undertaking large-scale mediation between the Malian Government and the movements in the north of that country  working with a team that is representative of Africa and the international community as a whole. The adoption of a road map for negotiations in the Algiers process and the declaration of a cessation of hostilities have marked the effort towards the launching of substantial negotiations since 1 September  with the aim of achieving a comprehensive and definitive peace accord. The launching of those negotiations has been a source of satisfaction and coincides with the freeing of two Algerian diplomats who had been held hostage for nearly three years by a terrorist organization. I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to pay homage to the memory of our Consul in Gao and his assistant  Tahar Touati  who lost their lives during their period of captivity.The situation in Libya  a sister nation  has continued to deteriorate over the past three years. The twofold Algerian initiative to implement a common plan of action for all of the countries neighbouring Libya and for launching an inclusive dialogue towards national reconciliation  which would also seek to strengthen State institutions  has made a valuable contribution towards a collective  healthy step towards peace for the Libyan people  which we very much wish for them.The difficult state of affairs in our region requires a stepping up of efforts in the fight against terrorist groups in the Sahel and their established links to drug trafficking networks and transnational organized crime. In the global forum of the fight against terrorism  Algeria will continue to cooperate  including in its work as co-Chair of the Working Group on the Sahel  and will focus on securing borders and on preventing ransom-seeking abductions by terrorist organizations  bearing in mind the recommendations from the Algiers workshop in September 2013 and the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and Security Council.In that spirit  Algeria notes with interest the results of the high-level Security Council meeting on terrorism and foreign combatants  convened on the initiative of President Obama (S/PV.7272). We also take note of the international mobilization against transborder terrorism on a large scale  which is relevant to Iraq and Syria. The execution of French citizen Hervé Gourdel in Algeria underscores the need to strengthen the fight against terrorism in all its forms.The earth-shattering developments that affect the lives of people in the Middle East add new questions with regard to the uninterrupted role played by the international community vis-à-vis the tragedy inflicted upon the brotherly Palestinian people. The history of humankind shows that armed conflicts give rise to other conflicts and that only by working towards justice within law and morality can we find lasting solutions. The Palestinian question and the Syrian crisis must be approached along those lines. I should also like to avail myself of this opportunity to pay homage to the efforts of my compatriot  Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi  and to reiterate our support to his successor  Mr. Staffan de Mistura.The ninth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Weapons should focus on the close  complementary nature of the objectives of disarmament  non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the promotion of the peaceful uses of the atom. Let there be no doubt that much remains to be done when it comes to freeing the world of weapons of mass destruction.Algeria  as a member of the Human Rights Council  is motivated by a strong sense of responsibility to participate actively in the promotion of the universal and interdependent nature of human rights. The President of the Republic  His Excellency Mr. Bouteflika  and the Algerian authorities are working hard to improve the living conditions of Algerian citizens in many different areas. We have laws that criminalize violence against women and children  and we are strengthening the protection of the rights of divorced women and other legislative efforts that add to our political and institutional success in supporting Algerian women. We have been addressing such matters in our elected bodies and our central Government.The celebration in 2015 of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations should be an opportunity to renew the commitment of all Member States to bring new and stronger vigour  efficacy and credibility to multilateralism. We have the joint responsibility to work to establish a world that is safer and fairer and shows more solidarity. This powerful juncture  at which we bring together all of our peoples within the fold of our founding values  should also be confirmed by action. There are apprehensions  uncertainties and challenges tied to fear and need  but if we face up to them the United Nations will certainly live up to its role as the last haven for the hope of humankind in a better future."
"50",2117,"ECU",69,2014,"What an honour it is to be at the General Assembly and to represent Ecuador and our citizens’ revolution. I would like to begin by congratulating President Sam Kutesa on his election to lead the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I want him to know that he will have the full support of the delegation of Ecuador during his tenure. Similarly  I want to express Ecuador’s appreciation and gratitude to our brother John Ashe for his work at the head of the General Assembly. I wish to convey the brotherly greetings and solidarity of President Rafael Correa  Minister Ricardo Patiño and the citizens’ revolution.Four years ago today  Ecuador suffered an attempted coup d’état in which there was an attempt against the life of the President of the Republic  Rafael Correa Delgado. Four years ago  democracy in Ecuador was threatened  but it prevailed. The international community’s condemnation was immediate. Countries  particularly those in the region  and the United Nations and other international organizations supported the millions of Ecuadorians who took to the streets and squares of my country  condemning the use of violence  rejecting the coup d’état  channelling the aspirations of all sectors of the population and consolidating democracy in my country.I would like to convey my appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  who immediately made statements bringing that issue to the world’s attention and sent a special mission to Ecuador to assess the situation. The effective work of Assistant Secretary-General Oscar Fernandez-Taranco and his team deserves to be remembered and appreciated.Democracy in Ecuador was strengthened  the coup plotters were isolated and the law and the will of the people  as expressed at the ballot box  prevailed over the interests of small  but powerful  groups  which were then left behind in history. On the night of 30 September 2010  all the Heads of State of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) met in Buenos Aires to support the Ecuadorian Government and President Rafael Correa. As a result of that meeting  the 12 countries of South America adopted an additional protocol to the Constitutive Treaty of UNASUR  which added a democratic clause that seeks to discourage a breakdown of  or threat to  democracy in the region. In Ecuador and in South America we are not returning to the past; we cannot return to the past. The use of force as a means of expression and of resolving differences will not return. That became clear on 30 September 2010. We have chosen the path of law and dialogue to build a better world and future for our peoples.The Government of Ecuador — the Government of the citizens’ revolution — has suggested the implementation of a radical change in the State’s structures and its political and development model. Ecuador’s position internationally is therefore in line with that reality. “Sumak Kawsay”  which in the language of our ancestors means “living well”  is built on a daily basis through a new model based on a socially inclusive and supportive economy  supported through a citizen-based democracy and sustained in its planning. The changes made by the Government of the citizens’ revolution in Ecuador are clearly in line with the Millennium Development Goals and the post-2015 agenda and reflect the values encapsulated in the Human Development Index of the United Nations. Let me briefly mention some of the achievements of the citizens’ revolution over the past seven and a half years.Approximately 1 136 000 Ecuadorians — 10 per cent of the population — have been lifted out of poverty. We reduced the rate of unemployment to 4.9 per cent in 2013  which is the lowest in Latin America. We have maintained a policy of wage increases  and Ecuador now has the highest rates in real values in the region. Moreover  Ecuador is the leader in Latin America and the Caribbean in reducing inequality  which is a major problem afflicting our region. The country’s competitiveness is no longer based on labour scarcity or exploitation  but rather on public investment in roads  ports  airports  telecommunications  power generation and systems of justice and security for our citizens. Public investment in Ecuador is the highest in the continent  at 15 per cent of our gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013 — three times the Latin American average. Thanks to that effort  we have moved up 15 places in terms of our competitiveness  according to the World Economic Forum.We have universal basic education  which fulfils one of the 2015 Millennium Development Goals. Child and youth labour have been substantially reduced. There are 82 public schools that have been registered with the International Baccalaureate Organization  and it is expected that  by 2017  500 schools will offer the International Baccalaureate. Thanks to the educational changes under way in Ecuador  179 290 students have moved from the private education system to the public education system. In other words  in the past two years  19 per cent of students left private schools to study in State schools. As I said  we are experiencing a true revolution in education.Ecuador has invested some 2 per cent of our GDP in higher education  which is more than double the average for Latin America. In the seven and a half years it has been in office  the Government of Ecuador has funded 8 000 scholars abroad  most of whom are enrolled in masters and doctoral programmes at the best universities in the world. That represents the largest investment in scholarships in terms of GDP in Latin America.I have mentioned all those achievements of our citizens’ revolution — and many more exist  but I cannot mention them owing to a lack of time — because those achievements were at stake on 30 September 2010  four years ago today. Those advances were made possible because democracy prevailed and because the Government of Ecuador continues to work for the well-being of its people.The most important challenge facing the Ecuadorian State  along with the fight against poverty  is changing its economy  and that means changing the production matrix of our country. To ensure sustainability in our domestic and production model  we are committed to boosting our productive development  trade flows and non-speculative foreign direct investment in target sectors  such as technology transfers and the financing of strategic projects. The fundamental objective of Ecuador’s foreign policy is therefore to assist in promoting the internal development of the country  balancing that with its international relations. That means expanding its political  trade  economic and social networks with an alternative and complementary view of the integration scheme that the country has traditionally had at the global level.Ecuador reiterates its concern with regard to the challenge of global warming. As we change our production and energy model  my country is promoting the generation of renewable energy sources with fewer greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere  the mass use of induction cookers and the optimization of the use of raw materials  reducing waste as much as possible. However  the ability of developing countries to meet the goals of a post-2015 development agenda is directly proportionate to developed countries’ continuing provision of resources aimed at the timely implementation of plans and projects for addressing natural disasters caused by weather events exacerbated by human activity  based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.My country was grateful for the Secretary-General’s invitation to the Climate Summit held here on 23 September. We are pleased with the decisions some developed countries have made on their national plans for mitigating and adapting to climate change  particularly the announcement by some  including France  that they would be increasing the capitalization of the Green Climate Fund. Despite those efforts  the Fund will not reach its target of $15 billion by the end of the year. We  the developing world  would like to see more ambitious national plans and policies on the part of the developed countries if the global consequences of this irrefutable scientific reality are to be addressed.Ecuador’s foreign policy is now making it a priority to strengthen South-South relations with a view to the sovereign integration of our peoples and the creation of new areas for regional governance. In that regard  Ecuador is working to achieve harmonious South American and Latin American integration  to build a multipolar world and to democratize our international organizations  with the goal of creating a more just and equitable world order. We are promoting multilateralism and working on innovative integration processes  cooperation for development and a harmonious political dialogue. In that context  UNASUR  the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) are very relevant entities and are national priorities in our efforts to create improved integration mechanisms.Regarding UNASUR  I am pleased to announce that its new headquarters will soon open in Quito  at the centre of the world  the point where two hemispheres and the South American brotherhood meet. In January 2015 Ecuador will take over the rotating chairship of CELAC  with the purpose of reinvigorating the regional integration agenda in Latin America and the Caribbean and furthering our political cooperation  while continuing to base integration on respect for pluralism and States’ diversity. The Government of Ecuador initiated the creation of this integration mechanism  and it has been a major undertaking. CELAC does not exclude any Latin American or Caribbean State; we have firmly rejected unilateral embargoes and sanctions  and our ongoing struggle is about fighting inequality and poverty.We must overcome and end injustice. It is therefore unacceptable that the United States of America’s blockade of our sister Republic of Cuba has been going on for more than 50 years  and that despite the fact that Cuba has been supported by the Assembly for 21 years. We also condemn Cuba’s inclusion in the list of countries that sponsor terrorism.We would like to reiterate once more that we must call for a settlement through dialogue of the conflict over Argentina’s Malvinas Islands. The United Kingdom should comply with the more than 40 resolutions adopted by the Assembly on the subject. We also support Argentina in its efforts to address the pernicious effects of speculative hedge funds. Argentina is not alone in that fight  and it can count on the backing and solidarity of Ecuador and our entire region.Concerning Palestine  I would like to state that on 17 July the Government of Ecuador firmly condemned Israel’s military incursion into Palestinian territory and called for an immediate end to Israel’s military operations and the indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population in the Gaza Strip. My country has appealed to the international community to shoulder its responsibility for preventing such indiscriminate attacks in the interests of saving innocent lives and maintaining international peace and security. As proof of our support for the Palestinian cause  Ecuador decided to establish a diplomatic presence there  and it is now up and running in Ramallah. Meanwhile  just a few days ago we sent humanitarian assistance to Gaza  and we will shortly send a second humanitarian assistance convoy there for the use of the Palestinian national authorities.In 2016 Ecuador will host the Africa-South America Summit  a responsibility requiring considerable preparation and providing an opportunity to draw up joint policies that unite us with our African brothers. The time has come to further strengthen the relationship between Africa and Latin America  and Ecuador has therefore decided to open new embassies in Algeria  Nigeria and Angola in the near future. We will also strengthen our existing embassies in Africa  and we will be opening additional diplomatic missions there in a second phase. We intend to work with our African brothers for our mutual benefit and shared opportunities.For Ecuador  it is a source of pride and a heavy responsibility to be hosting the forthcoming third United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development  Habitat III  in 2016. Thus in one year  2016  we will host the meetings of the CELAC Heads of State  the Africa-South America Summit and Habitat III.For over a year  we have undertaken intensive work to address the main issues stemming from the rapid urban growth that we have seen in our countries  issues that were raised at the most recent World Urban Forum  last April in Medellín  Colombia. We hope to continue to generate synergies in order to move towards a new global agenda for sustainable urban development that we will take up at Habitat III.The Government of Ecuador  in its efforts to build a just and equitable society  has sought in recent years to implement a system of rights in terms of habitat and urban development. The principle guiding its action — “the right to the city” — is understood not as a unitary right  but as a set of interrelated rights linked to the land. Policies for habitat  human settlements and housing are expressions of the State’s aspiration to build  as I mentioned  a society of living well  through public regulation in line with the concept that Ecuador promotes  namely  harmony with nature. Ecuador is the only country in the world that sets forth in its Constitution “the right to nature”.With respect to the reform of the United Nations system  Ecuador has actively and constructively made profound and comprehensive proposals for change in some international organizations  with a view to making them more efficient  democratic  participatory and inclusive. We aspire to their universalization and transparency  as well as to increased and equitable representation  consultation and decision-making on the part of all States  especially the developing countries. Consistent with that  the Government of Ecuador has advocated the reform of the global governance system  in order to democratize decision-making and improve transparency in the management of all multilateral organizations. Many Members of this Organization join us in that approach.Ecuador proposes marking a turning point with respect to the United Nations system  as with its current structure it is not addressing the international tensions and disputes or the troubled international situation. Ecuador seeks to democratize the Security Council  which should be composed of clusters  in order to find a balance  ensure representativity and protect the principle of the equality of States. Only in that way can the Council play its role in maintaining peace and international security.We are at the threshold of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. We have a historical obligation to modernize and democratize the Organization  strengthening the role of the General Assembly in such decision-making as the election of judges to the International Court of Justice and the election of the Secretary-General.At present  we are concerned that  despite the progress made in 2014  a great many threats continue to loom over humankind. Situations of armed conflict  humanitarian crises  violations of human rights and breaches of international law threaten entire populations  demanding an urgent response from the international community. The Government of Ecuador has expressed its conviction regarding the need to respect international law and reach negotiated and peaceful solutions. It has totally rejected all forms of interference and unilateral action that violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  trample on human rights or disregard international law. We also strongly condemn all terrorist acts  whether perpetrated by irregular groups or in the name of a State. Ecuador has condemned the actions of the Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria.Those global challenges must be dealt with by the United Nations  as the most appropriate forum to address and respond to the difficult situations that we are facing. It will surely have the support and solidarity of all Member States.Let us endeavour to ensure that international law is the standard that governs our actions. A few months ago  in this very Hall  Member States adopted a resolution which called for respect for the right to privacy in the digital age (resolution 68/167). The same label has been applied to another abuse — global surveillance. Once again we are in a situation where we are being monitored and spied on. Ecuador  along with several other countries  co-sponsored a draft resolution put forward by Germany and Brazil and  with the adoption of that legal instrument  a new process for defining human rights — the right to privacy — was initiated. The resolution  adopted by consensus  constitutes a rejection of an abusive posture. The abuse was brought to our attention by an Australian citizen who felt that the world should know what was being done with sovereignty.The decision of that Australian citizen led to the harshest persecution  which caused him to seek protection for his life in the light of the real threats he had received. I am referring to Julian Assange  who is now associated with Ecuador because  after reviewing the merits of his case  we granted him asylum. Two years have passed in the new life of Mr. Assange  two years without freedom of movement  two years in which he has been confined to a small space waiting for justice. There it is again  Sir  that dream of justice.When asylum is granted  it is primarily by immediate recognition and respect for a fundamental human right — the right to life. What has been difficult is convincing the counterpart — the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland — that in this situation the fundamental human rights of Julian Assange should be taken into account. Ecuador will continue to work tirelessly to find a solution in this case. To that end  we hope to have the support of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Kingdom of Sweden.I appeal to the Kingdom of Sweden to enforce one of the most important legal principles recognized internationally and by the Swedish legal system: effective judicial protection. After four years  the Prosecutor’s Office of that country has been unable to take statements from Julian Assange  even though under Swedish law this could have been done in another country  even though Ecuador repeatedly offered its judicial cooperation  and even though Julian Assange’s lawyers expressed their willingness to cooperate.Turning to another subject  and with this I will conclude my statement  I would like to speak about transnational corporations. In recent years  there have been increased demands brought by transnational corporations in international arbitration courts against the States and peoples of the South. Those multimillion dollar disputes  such as the Chevron-Texaco case in Ecuador  threaten the tax resources and jeopardize the validity and legitimacy of the national jurisdiction of the States concerned. The scale of the problem could even compromise the development plans of the countries of the South  in Latin America and other regions of the world.In that context  we are also establishing  within the framework of UNASUR  a regional arbitration centre that will  inter alia  provide legal advice in investment disputes. We are also creating a code of conduct for arbitrators and mediators within UNASUR. And we are establishing  with other regions of the world  an observatory on transnational corporations. All of that is aimed at creating support mechanisms that can analyse  monitor and respond to States’ requests so as to prevent and solve investment disputes. Ecuador  together with South Africa  has also submitted a proposal in the Human Rights Council aimed at creating a binding instrument to impose international human rights legal obligations on transnational corporations. For the time being  a working group is being established to consider that initiative. My country attaches special importance to the matter  and we will work to reach an understanding with States because that is an extremely important issue. We are confident that we will have the States’ full support.Finally  I wish to reiterate to the Secretary-General Ecuador’s gratitude for the appointment of the former Vice-President of the Republic  Mr. Lenín Voltaire Moreno Garcés  as Special Envoy on Disability and Accessibility. Ecuador will continue to support all initiatives of the Organization to promote and protect the rights of people with disabilities and their families.At the beginning of my statement  I pointed out some achievements of the citizens’ revolution in the past seven and a half years. The changes brought about have had a profound impact and have caused a historic transformation. My country also wishes to work with all Member States to achieve a true transformation of the United Nations. We have enormous challenges ahead to promote development  maintain peace and reduce inequality and poverty. Ecuador is fully committed to working together on that historic task. I hope to see fellow Member States in the Hall next year at the seventieth session of the General Assembly  when we can then celebrate important decisions that we have taken."
"51",2162,"EGY",69,2014,"At the outset  it gives me pleasure to congratulate the President of the Assembly and his friendly country on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We are confident that he will lead its work wisely  and we will lend him our support as he undertakes his duties. I take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to his predecessor for his untiring efforts as President of the Assembly at its previous session. I also reiterate our full support to the Secretary-General as he strives to realize the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.I stand before the Assembly today as one of the sons of Egypt  from the cradle of human civilization. From this rostrum  I first salute the great people of Egypt. Allow me to also salute the thousands of Egyptians who travelled from Egypt and various parts of the United States and who are in the city today to say that the new Egypt is coming. From this rostrum  I salute the great people of Egypt  who have made history twice in the past few years: first  when they revolted against corruption and despotism and claimed their right to freedom  dignity and social justice; and then when they held fast to their identity and  energized by patriotism  rose up against exclusion  refusing to succumb to the tyranny of a faction which  in the name of religion  put its narrow interests before the interests of the people.Those are simply snapshots of the defining moments Egypt has witnessed recently. They are only milestones in the longer journey that Egyptians  fuelled by their dreams and aspirations  have embarked upon  towards a better day and a more prosperous future. The world is starting to grasp the reality of what happened in Egypt and to understand the circumstances that drove Egyptians to intuitively take to the streets to rebel against the forces of extremism and darkness that  once in power  undermined the foundations of the democratic process and national institutions and sought to impose a state of polarization in order to break the unity of the people.The upsurge in extremism and violence perpetrated in the name of religion that the region is currently witnessing is evidence of the true objectives of those groups that exploit religion. We have warned against them over and over again. They have transformed the values of justice  compassion and mercy  which are treasured by Judaism  Christianity and Islam  into grim sectarianism and destructive civil and regional wars that continue to claim the lives of innocent people of different religions.The Egyptian people understand — as do I  given the responsibilities that I have shouldered since my election as President — that the path towards achieving our goals began with the building of a civil democratic State  guided by the principles we sought to embody and adhering to the road map for the future agreed upon by the Egyptian national powers. That road map will be completed when parliamentary elections are held  following the presidential election and constitutional referendum through which Egyptians expressed their free will. Our aim is to build a new Egypt — a State that respects rights and freedoms  honours its duties and ensures the coexistence of its citizens without exclusion or discrimination; a State that respects and enforces the rule of law  guarantees freedom of opinion for all and ensures freedom of belief and worship for its people; and a State that is determined to achieve growth  prosperity and a promising future that meets the aspirations of its people.To that end  Egypt began implementing an ambitious comprehensive programme to spur development until 2030  with the aim of laying the foundations of a free-market economy that is capable of attracting investments in a secure and stable environment. The New Suez Canal project  a gift from Egyptians to the world  is proof of the seriousness of our intent and of the resolve of the new Egypt to forge a better tomorrow for its youth. That is why I invite members to participate in the economic conference that will be held in Egypt in February 2015 to achieve development and build the future  not only for Egypt  but for the entire region.Those steps briefly reflect the gist of the social contract embraced by Egyptians in their new Constitution. It is to build a better today and a brighter tomorrow for our youth and to establish a State that is armed with strong institutions and governed by the rule of law; a State that respects the judiciary and ensures its independence and applies the principle of the separation of powers; and a State that is not held back by a form of terrorism that thinks that it can conquer and repress our nation.Egypt has suffered from the scourge of that terrorism since the 1920s  when it concealed its poisonous viewpoints behind religion to reach power and establish the caliphate state  relying on armed violence and terror to achieve its objectives and in the process giving rise to a handful of extremists who commit atrocities in the name of religion. Here I stress that we should not allow them to abuse Islam and offend the 1.5 billion Muslims who cherish its noble values. Religion  by virtue of its holiness and sanctity  cannot be put to the test by humans and judged whether it has succeeded or failed.Terrorism is a plague that does not differentiate between developing and developed societies as it spreads. Terrorists come from different societies. They are not bound together by any true religious faith. That is why it is imperative that we all intensify our cooperation and coordination efforts  pursuant to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and in fulfilment of its objectives  to end the support provided to those terrorist organizations that enables them to continue perpetrating crimes.The problems facing our region emanate from the space provided to the local and regional forces of extremism and the state of polarization that often leads to division and strife. They have become a serious danger that threatens the very existence of the State and attacks its identity. That has produced fertile ground for terrorism and its organizations to grow and gain influence.In this regard  the crises facing some countries of the region could be resolved by following a two-pronged approach aimed at building the nation State. The first is the application of the principles of equality of all citizens and respect for the rule of law  based on a social contract and national consensus  while ensuring the enjoyment by all of all rights  especially the right to development. That will safeguard societies from exploitation and prevent them from succumbing to extremism. The second aspect is a decisive confrontation with the forces of extremism and terrorism and with any attempt to impose opinions through intimidation and violence or to force exclusion through rejection in all its forms.Egypt  in agreement with Libya’s neighbouring countries  has actually put forward an initiative that sets specific steps and a clear vision to end the plight of that kindred country. We can build on that initiative to achieve a comprehensive political solution that strengthens Libya’s elected institutions and ensures an end to the bloodshed  while preserving its territorial integrity. Success requires effectively halting arms trafficking into Libya and dealing relentlessly with the extremist movements that resort to weapons and violence and do not recognize the democratic process.Despite the heartrending humanitarian situation in fraternal Syria and the destruction and loss of innocent lives resulting from the crisis  I am confident that it is possible to establish a political framework that will ensure that the aspirations of the Syrian people are met without compromising with terrorism or replicating the circumstances that the Syrians initially rebelled against. I emphasize that Egypt supports the Syrian people’s aspirations to a safe and secure life that ensures Syria’s stability and the unity of its people and preserves its territorial integrity.The formation in the brotherly country of Iraq of a new Government approved by the Parliament is a significant development that restores hope in the possibility of improving the situation and for success in internal and external attempts to achieve stability  restore the areas that have fallen under the control of the terrorist group Daesh  maintain Iraq’s territorial integrity  end the bloodshed.Despite the multitude of crises threatening our region  some of which I have mentioned  the Palestinian issue remains a top priority for Egypt. Palestinians still aspire to establish their independent State on the territories occupied in 1967  with East Jerusalem as its capital  on the basis of the principles of the peace process that was established in the 1970s  following an Egyptian initiative. Those principles are not up for compromise; otherwise the basis of a comprehensive peace in the region would erode and the values of justice and humanity would vanish. The continued deprivation of the Palestinian people of their rights is undoubtedly exploited by some to inflame other crises  achieve hidden goals  fragment Arab unity and impose trusteeship on Palestinians under the guise of realizing their aspirations.I am confident that certain challenges will require us to work seriously and with a clear vision to achieve the ambitions of our people for democracy  development and human dignity and for our youth and their aspirations for a brighter future. Our success will guarantee the future of our people.From this rostrum  I call upon everyone to address the Ebola epidemic. In many African countries  combatting the disease is a collective responsibility. We must be able to assist those countries that need help  while providing protection to our own people. Distances have become shorter  due to modern advances  thus increasing the threat. As a strong State  Egypt bears a special responsibility. In the 1990s  Egypt confronted terrorism and extremism. I am confident that it will succeed in uprooting terrorism by virtue of its national identity. Egypt will always be a beacon of civilization  supporting cohesion in the region. Egyptians will never hesitate to assume their role to that effect.Egypt considers the security of the Arab States integral to its national security  on the basis of our common heritage and destiny and our longing for the stability of a region that is important and crucial to the world. Egypt’s vision of international relations is founded on respect for the principles of international law  treaties and conventions  based on mutual respect and mutual interests and benefits.As the Assembly knows  Egypt was a founding Member of the United Nations and has ever since strongly contributed to realizing its goals  especially in peacekeeping  peacebuilding and development. From that standpoint  Egypt’s aspiration to a non-permanent seat on the Security Council in 2016 and 2017 stems from its desire to use its membership to achieve the purposes of the Organization and protect the interests of developing countries  especially in Africa  as well as to accelerate the reform of the United Nations system as part of a broader vision based on the principle of equality of all nations. I therefore invite Member States to support Egypt’s candidature for the Security Council.I have conveyed in all humility the message of the Egyptian people  women  men  youth and the elderly. It is a message of hope  of will and of determination to work. It is a message of openness  calling for cooperation with all  to overcome all obstacles and difficulties. I wish to assure the Assembly that the Egyptian people  after their two revolutions  have become the sole source of our internal and external policies in pursuit of stability and development.Egypt today has regained its self-confidence and is upholding the principles of law and freedom. With its Arab identity and African roots  it is the cradle of the Mediterranean civilization and the beacon of moderate Islam. Egypt aspires to resolve regional disputes and uphold the principles of justice and humanity in today’s world. I am confident that Egyptians have an infinite capacity to give. We have inherited that gift from our ancestors and will remain ever generous  God willing.Long live Egypt. Long live the peace-loving peoples of the world. Long live the principles of humanity and the values of tolerance and coexistence. May peace be upon the Assembly  and the mercy and blessings of God as well."
"52",2186,"ERI",69,2014,"At the outset  Mr. President  I would like to warmly congratulate you  my brother  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session  with its theme of “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  which is both timely and appropriate. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation to your predecessor  Ambassador John Ashe  for a job well done.Next year  2015  marks the seventieth anniversary of the birth of the United Nations. The world has changed almost beyond recognition since 1945. Originally founded by 50 Members  the United Nations has seen three times that many nations join it in the intervening years. The demographic  economic  political and cultural realities of its Member States bear little resemblance to those of the past. The challenges of the time and the demands of the age are vastly different from those of the period following the Second World War  or even the past few decades. Change  rapid transformative change  is the order of the day. And yet the United Nations  the Organization that ostensibly represents the entire community of nations and the peoples of the world  remains stuck in the past. It is still thoroughly dominated by a few countries and has marginalized the overwhelming majority. Its institutions and structures are an anachronism in the modern world.More crucially  the United Nations has fallen far short of playing the primary role in pursuing the fundamental objectives for which it was established. The maintenance of global peace and security was and remains one of its cardinal goals  and yet conflicts and wars — even simultaneous and multiple wars — have become a constant feature of our lives. Many of them are waged in total disregard for the United Nations and its mandate. In Africa — from the East to the West and in the North — in the Middle East and on every other continent  extremism  terrorism and all forms of bigotry and intolerance are spreading. The record on other key principles and aspirations is also far from satisfactory  whether the issue is ending poverty  ensuring sustainable development  advancing human rights  preventing epidemics  respecting sovereignty and non-interference in the affairs of others  ensuring justice and equality or protecting the environment. The world is unquestionably facing a very grave and dangerous situation. To paraphrase the words of the Secretary-General  this is a terrible time “for the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations” (A/69/PV.6  p. 1).In order to restore the relevance and credibility of the United Nations — to turn it into a truly representative institution of all nations and peoples  where all nations  no matter how big or small  have respect for its Charter and for international law  and where all nations contribute  each according to its capabilities  to peace and security and to the welfare of people and the planet — it is imperative that we fundamentally restructure  democratize and rebuild the United Nations. The crucial and pressing need for that has been clear for several decades now  starting in the height of the Cold War and continuing through the past 25 years  during which time the world has lived through an unsuccessful attempt to impose a unipolar world. Consequently  United Nations reform has formally been on the agenda for close to two decades. No country has openly disputed the importance of restructuring the United Nations  and many workable proposals have been presented and thoroughly discussed. Yet we are no nearer to change  because of the stubborn and cynical opposition of the dominant Powers.Given the determination of those Powers to maintain their control of the United Nations and its unrepresentative and undemocratic character  the chances of genuine change in the next few years are indeed slender. It is therefore vital that all nations and peoples — as well as the political and social forces that stand for peace  independence  international law  justice  equity and sustainable development — forge a common front. They must consolidate partnerships and coordinate their efforts on the basis of a broad common strategy to stem the threats we face and to build a better and more equitable world  while at the same time containing without let-up the campaign to restructure the United Nations  eradicate poverty  prevent conflicts  address global warming and fight all forms of terrorism and extremism.Eritrea’s perspective on the need for an overhaul of the United Nations system is informed not only by the shared experience of the majority of nations  but also by its own history. The international system and the dominant Powers have dealt the Eritrean people a raw deal. First  they were denied the right to decolonization and independence to satisfy what the then United States Secretary of State John Foster Dulles in 1952 stated were in “the strategic interests of the United States in the Red Sea basin”. When the Eritrean people embarked on a 30-year armed struggle for national liberation and independence in order to advance their geopolitical interests in the Horn of Africa and the Red Sea region  the super-Powers supplied arms and advisers to their client States to crush Eritrea’s right to self-determination  and the United Nations ignored their plight. Even after achieving independence at a tremendous human and material cost and joining the community of nations  the Eritrean people are still victimized. The United Nations once again has failed to uphold an internationally endorsed  final and binding arbitration of the border decision. In fact  to add insult to injury  it has imposed unjust sanctions on their country.That travesty of justice has caused harm not only to Eritrea but to the entire Horn of Africa  which is now mired in endemic conflicts and instability. Once again and from this rostrum  Eritrea calls on the United Nations and the Security Council to redress that injustice by taking concrete measures to end the illegal occupation of sovereign Eritrean territory. The unjust and unfair sanctions  for which everyone now agrees that there was and continues to be no justification  must also unconditionally and immediately be lifted. Such long-overdue measures would contribute positively to the tireless efforts of the Eritrean people to build their nation  maintain peace  stability and harmony  improve their livelihood  lay the foundations of a strong  equitable national economy  create opportunities for youth and women  and advance regional and international engagement and cooperation."
"53",2232,"ESP",69,2014,"It is a great honour and privilege to address the General Assembly as the King of Spain at the start of my reign.I appear before the Assembly to share with the international community my country’s commitment to the universal principles and values that best define humanity. Today I have the pleasure to present what Spain — renewed but remaining true to itself and to its international commitments — can offer for peace  liberty  justice and human rights in all nations and for all persons  along with well-being and prosperity.As a nation with ancient roots and a clear global calling  Spain has contributed intensely and decisively to shaping world history. Let us recall that Spain was present at the genesis of globalization and of international law  as well as of medieval parliamentarianism and contemporary liberal democracy. With that perspective of centuries  we see clearly that our best contributions come about when we move forward while opening up to the world.Sincerely  despite our problems  I see Spanish society today as exemplary in its commitment to human dignity  in solidarity with the most marginalized. Spaniards harbour a profound sense of equality. They reject fanaticism  violence and intolerance and love peace. Spanish society is culturally and linguistically diverse  capable of overcoming difficulties responsibly and with integrity while demanding integrity and excellence as civic values intrinsic to democracy. Spain is a strong  generous and vigorous country  and I feel truly proud of it.Therefore  today we Spaniards look to the future with a firm will to share and to help to build a better reality for all peoples. Our foundations are solid  forged over centuries and strengthened especially in recent decades. The commitments Spain has made with the rest of the international community are established on those foundations.Democracy is today the essential guide of our collective coexistence. It will soon be four decades since the beginning of Spain’s political transition  which allowed us to move from a dictatorship to a political system based on freedoms and rights and marked by a desire for historical reconciliation and a true spirit of harmony. Allow me  therefore  to lay claim Spain’s political masterpiece with pride and emotion  an example for many in the world. We Spaniards have built a social and democratic order based on the rule of law that protects all citizens and Spain’s various territories in their political  geographic  cultural and linguistic diversity. Thus Spain’s firm commitment to promoting and defending democratic values in the world can always be counted on.Without forgetting the impact of the crisis  Spain’s economic development  particularly since the second half of the past century  has placed our economy among the first in the world and among the most open and competitive. Today we have achieved global leadership rankings in various sectors with a high added value and significant social impact. Bearing that in mind  Spain strongly supports a global and sustainable way of economic development that makes possible material progress and well-being  that generates employment and protects individuals and their social rights  a sustainable development model respectful of the environment  respecting international norms and with high  ethical economic values.Spain has always been a major cultural Power. We understand that in all societies  culture shapes our identity and is a source of material and non-material wealth. The strength of Spanish  a universal language shared by dozens of countries and hundreds of millions of people on all continents  decisively contributes to guaranteeing greater cultural and linguistic diversity in the international arena. That is clearly an objective of the human community  so widely diverse  represented here. The Spanish language must therefore fully assume its formal position as an official language of the United Nations and as a working language that is fully used and represented. Given the scope and depth of our cultural base  we affirm Spain’s commitment to defending cultural diversity in all of its aspects and manifestations.Spain’s history and privileged geographic position at a crossroads of continents  seas and civilizations have led it to develop a solid  universal perspective and a special connection to some regions in the world. Among them  Europe represents an obvious dimension. The process of continental integration around the European Union today is part of the national project of the Kingdom of Spain. We call for a Europe of greater unity and cohesiveness that preserves and extends the democratic and civic values that inspired its creation and that works to guarantee the prosperity of all of its citizens. We also defend a Europe that is marked by strength and solidarity that generously and effectively contributes to the peaceful progress of all regions of the world.Due to its history and culture  the Ibero-American community of nations is a substantial part of our collective identity and represents for us a true brotherhood. That sentiment extends to other areas  thanks to the cultural  historic and linguistic connections that we also maintain with other nations and peoples in the rest of the Americas  in Africa  Asia and Oceania.The Mediterranean  with its northern and southern shores  together with the Middle East and the entire Arab world  are areas very close to Spain  not only geographically  but also culturally and emotionally. That is why we affirm our will and interest in contributing to the stability of the region  as something fundamental for achieving peace in the world. It is a region in which some societies suffer the scourge of an intolerable barbarism  a criminal and atrocious violence that threatens all societies of the planet and the very values of universal human civilization.Spain’s global vocation and its commitments in democratic  economic and cultural matters that I have just mentioned are summarized by its full commitment to the Charter of the United Nations  on behalf of which we are convened here. The Charter represents one of the greatest achievements of humankind; we must therefore preserve  respect and enforce it. Thus Spain firmly believes in the United Nations and its multilateral mechanisms for preserving international peace and security and for contributing to the development of societies.We live in times marked by a proliferation of conflicts  some of which are especially devastating and have indiscriminate impacts on civilians. Our primary objective must be to prevent war  and when we fail  we must protect and assist the innocent and the injured. We must never relent in our efforts to resolve conflict through diplomacy and all of the instruments bestowed by the Charter of the United Nations. Above all  we must not lose hope  and we must remember that in spite of everything  the longing for harmony can and must prevail over even the most entrenched hatreds.A tapestry version of Guernica — a work by the universal Spaniard  Pablo Picasso — hangs outside the entrance to the Security Council Chamber. The scene depicted in this art icon still stirs our conscience and reminds us of the fatal consequences of our inability to prevent and resolve conflicts that afflict us all. It is a mistake to think that wars or man-made disasters affect only one community or one region without any impact on the others. When barbarism triumphs in one part of the world  no one is beyond its reach; we are all victims.But armed conflicts are not the only threats to the international community. Evil takes many forms and their victims have many faces: every child caught in a crisis situation or in violence  every woman who is molested or whose rights are limited simply because she is a woman  every patient who dies for lack of medicine or every abandoned elderly person  every family without food and without hope because of an unjust distribution of wealth  every journalist murdered for doing his or her duty to inform — all of these are so many appeals to our conscience and to our sense of duty  and so many calls to action.The members of the General Assembly can count on Spain as we confront  together and in the framework of international law  those who seek to destroy  through their intolerance  violence or sectarianism  the values and principles that underlie our United Nations. Spain has always demonstrated its unconditional support for the United Nations system and its active responsibility with regard to the principles that we all recognize in this Assembly: freedom  justice  equality  national sovereignty  independence and the integrity of States. Spain will continue to assume  as it has  its full responsibilities as a Member of United Nations.Against this background  Spain is taking another step forward as a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the 2015-2016 biennium. Our candidacy is an integral part of my country’s solid commitment to serve the international community more  and to serve it better. That is what we have done in the Security Council once every decade over the past 40 years  because the Assembly has trusted us. I only ask that that trust be renewed.In the past 25 years  130 000 members of the Spanish armed forces have participated in peacekeeping operations and humanitarian aid missions in all regions of the world. They have been — and  above all  have felt — part of a great collective effort to which many of the countries represented here have contributed. Similarly  in recent decades Spain has consolidated its status as one of the leading contributors to development cooperation. There is no lasting peace without lasting security  without sustainable development. There is no sustainable development without greater solidarity  both among and within nations. Furthermore  development must be accompanied by policies of inclusion that envisage the full equality of women and their incorporation in all spheres of political  social and economic life.As we can see  Spain has a spirit of solidarity. In the past 14 years  my compatriots have contributed $30 billion to global development. Of this contribution  nearly $1 billion has been earmarked for achieving the Millennium Development Goals  through a fund set up by Spain and co-led by the United Nations Development Programme. That is the largest contribution made by a single country. Specifically  one of the most important tasks of the General Assembly at this session will be to finalize the negotiations for the post-2015 development agenda and to establish the sustainable development goals. Here  too  Spain has taken a step forward by creating the first fund that is already functioning for these sustainable development goals.To a large extent  achieving sustainability involves fighting the harmful effects of climate change. The Climate Summit held yesterday and the recent Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  held in Samoa — whose organization Spain contributed to — have raised our awareness even further on this issue. They also enable us to improve our response and resilience in the face of restricted situations  especially as regards the most vulnerable States whose very survival is at risk.The sustainable development goals that we have set for ourselves are within our reach. Again  there are reasons for hope. I am thinking in particular of the progress made in Africa  a continent that is so close to Spain and where new examples of innovation and creativity are found everywhere. Africa is a continent of the present and future  where over the past decade we have seen some of the fastest-growing economies. But it is crucial to put an end to the conflicts that still afflict parts of the region and hold back its development. From the Sahel to the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region  Spain contributes to ending these conflicts by meeting its commitments  which are born out of solidarity and proximity.We believe in Africa and we are demonstrating that belief  for instance when acute crises arise such as the Ebola epidemic  which is affecting a major and growing part of the central region. I want to express the Spanish people’s solidarity with the victims and our support for those who are doing everything possible to assist them  sometimes at the cost of their own lives. And I offer my own heartfelt tribute to the humanitarian aid workers of the United Nations  whose vocation leads them to leave everything behind for the most vulnerable  wherever they may be.It has been almost 30 years since my father  King Juan Carlos  addressed this General Assembly for the first time (see A/41/PV.4). Today  as then  Spain is open to a new age. Today  as then  we take our place as active and responsible members of international community represented here. I can assure those present here that the international community  represented today in the General Assembly  can continue to count on Spain’s support and active participation in the unwavering protection of the values and interests of humankind in peace  peace that is ever more prosperous and just. Spain supports a United Nations that is not only stronger but  above all  more united — more united against bigotry  intolerance and barbarism  more united in fighting poverty  hunger and marginalization  more united so that education and health can reach all  and more united in firmly defending the dignity of all human beings."
"54",2258,"EST",69,2014,"In the 364 days since I last had the honour to address this Assembly  the world has changed dramatically. We have seen a profound change in the global security situation. We see unprecedented threats to peace and security in post-Second World War Europe and the world  while terrorism  climate change  human rights violations and the spread of the Ebola virus continue to be global challenges.We need a concerted effort to achieve peace and stability in Europe and the Middle East  and to restore the credibility of international law. No circumstances can ever justify terrorism in any form. By signing United Nations anti-terrorism conventions States have promised to prevent and investigate terrorist crimes as well as to refrain from supporting or tacitly tolerating those crimes.The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) poses a serious threat to the people of Iraq and Syria as well as the broader Middle East. This terrorist organization executes prisoners  kills civilians and commits genocidal acts against religious and national minorities. Its brutality  barbarous crimes and extreme ideology threaten all of humanity. It challenges the universal human values enshrined in United Nations documents. We must stop the terrorists. Estonia commends all global efforts to fight the ISIL and other terrorist organizations and stands ready to contribute to those efforts. I should like to welcome the adoption today of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014)  on foreign terrorist fighters.A quarter of a century ago in the annus mirabilis 1989  Europe and the democratic world celebrated an historical sea change. The Berlin Wall fell. The Cold War that had divided the world into hostile camps for half a century ended. This year we should celebrate an anniversary of the triumph of freedom and democracy. Instead  2014 has turned out to be a year when the international order as we have known it since the cold war  has been violated and put in doubt. Cynical geopolitics in international relations has once again come to the fore. The international agreements upon which the stability of the post-Second World War security architecture relied  have been compromised.Let me recall what we have collectively agreed upon. The Charter of the United Nations of 1945 declares:“All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”.In the Helsinki Final Act of 1975  all trans-Atlantic countries agreed not to use force to change borders or challenge the political independence of any State. States agreed to regard one another’s frontiers as inviolable; to refrain from making each other’s territory the object of military organized occupation. No such occupation or acquisition would be recognized as legal. In the 1990 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) Charter of Paris for a New Europe  all signatories  from Vancouver to Vladivostok  agreed to “fully recognize the freedom of States to choose their own security arrangements”.By annexing Crimea and invading Eastern Ukraine  one of the signatories has violated all of these agreements. Thus  we find ourselves in a completely new and unforeseen security environment. We must enforce the fundamental agreements upon which our peace and security rely.The Ukrainian crisis is not solely a conflict between two countries. It is not even solely a European issue. If instead of agreements and laws raw brute force will apply in international relations; if changing State borders by force will become an accepted norm  then the stability of the whole world is threatened. As President Obama said this morning  “This is a vision of the world in which might makes right” (A/69/PV.6  p. 11). And he added  “We believe that right makes might” (ibid.). So does Estonia. We believe that too.Such developments must be firmly condemned. The international community cannot leave Crimea as it is now. We cannot accept frozen conflicts created for geopolitical ends. Referendums that are in agreement with international law cannot be arranged in two weeks in the presence of foreign armed forces. The results of such referendums cannot be considered valid. Independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity must remain the fundamental rights of States and nations. That includes their right to direct their own future and to choose their allies  as stated in the CSCE Paris Charter. Such free choices by sovereign nations cannot be accepted as an excuse for aggression. However  it was not Ukraine’s wish even to choose its security arrangements that was used as justification for aggression. Its mere desire to enhance trade and political relations with the European Union  which is not a security arrangement  led to the country’s dismemberment.What can we do  then  to restore the validity of international agreements? There were warning signs of current events in Ukraine earlier. Alarm bells rang already six years ago in Georgia  but few bothered to hear the wake-up call. We must take  therefore  conflict prevention more seriously. We must support States in their choice of democracy  the rule of law and human rights and decisions that follow from that. These recent developments force us seriously to reconsider the role of the United Nations. How can one of the fundamental goals of the United Nations  global peace and security  be promoted when basic international agreements are ignored  State borders are changed  and territories are annexed through force?We cannot ignore that the Security Council has been paralysed as international justice has been manipulated and multiple crises have escalated. The Security Council needs to be reformed. Its work methods and principles must be revised  with special attention on the openness  accountability and transparency of its processes. The permanent members of the Security Council bear enormous responsibility in guaranteeing international peace. No permanent member should abuse the veto to circumvent the principles of the United Nations Charter.Human rights remain the most cherished of values of the United Nations. Unfortunately  respect for human rights can still not be assumed to be the norm. We cannot accept arguments that for some countries human rights do not apply for cultural reasons. Human rights  as stated in the Universal Declaration  are universal  inalienable and inviolable. They are based on the humanity and dignity of each and every person.No peace or justice  stability or security can be guaranteed unless the basic rights of all human beings are respected and protected in every country by all Governments. We must  moreover  pay special attention to the rights of the most vulnerable groups. Women’s rights must be protected everywhere. It is crucial that empowering women and action against gender-based violence be implemented in accordance with Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). We must respect the rights of children and minorities  as well as those of indigenous people. We must care for people with special needs.Free speech remains a crucial right. Some States have made efforts to stop the free flow of information on the Internet and to divide cyberspace along State borders. This we must avoid. The Internet must remain a universal platform for the uninhibited exchange of information. Estonia is proud to be a founding member of the Freedom Online Coalition  a community of 23 nations committed to promoting free speech online  and the multi-stakeholder model of a free and open Internet. It is a global initiative that brings together Governments  non-governmental organizations  entrepreneurs and think tanks.In April  the Freedom Online Coalition gathered in our capital and issued the Tallinn Agenda  a statement expressing our strongly shared conviction that all people are entitled to the same rights and freedoms  online as well as offline. This is not a lifestyle question. The Internet is a driver of economic growth and a key tool for development. Since the 1990s it has blossomed into a global network of nearly three billion users. Most of the next billion Internet users will come from developing countries. The United Nations post-2015 development agenda should recognize the importance of new technologies and e-services as a major contribution to the security and prosperity of the world. As we grow more dependent on digital services in our daily lives  we become more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Cyber security is essential  not just for protecting rights  but also for economic prosperity. Cyberattacks can paralyse crucial services or infrastructure. They can cause enormous economic damage. Limiting access to  or censoring the contents of the Internet  however  is not the answer to cyber insecurity.Achieving sustainable development is essential in order to tackle some of the challenges we face. Even in the current fragile security environment  we must take care of the future of the planet and work towards a world where everyone can live a dignified life  free from poverty  violence and exclusion. In today’s interdependent world  this is hard to achieve without peace and stability.The world today also faces the outbreak of a deadly virus. This is no longer a local concern of a few countries. Ebola has become an international public health emergency. Despite efforts already made by Governments and international organizations the outbreak races ahead. We support the efforts of the Global Ebola Response Coalition tasked to contain and stop the spread of the virus.Climate change is already an existential threat to some countries. It has a dramatic impact on their living conditions and their security. The small island developing States are most vulnerable. If we do not act soon enough other countries will be threatened as well. We must see this problem globally  not just from the perspective of short-term national or economic interest.The risks of conflict  violence  insecurity  financial and economic collapse  climate change  lack of resources and natural disasters are inextricably intertwined and need to be addressed comprehensively. The new post-2015 development agenda must be truly universal. Sustainable development goals are best addressed together. Progress in these fields will be guaranteed by good governance  transparency of decision-making and low corruption. Effective and accountable institutions are powerful enablers of sustainable development  and modern digital technology helps us to create them. In Estonia  we have developed an e-governance system that increases transparency and limits corruption. We have been sharing the system with all interested partners and we continue to be willing to do so.Since 8 May 1945  we have believed that we had been freed of certain ideological demons for good. Yet today we see the return of long-discredited ideas dating back to 1938. The existence of co-ethnics abroad has been used as a justification to annex territory. This is in 2014  not in 1938. So  too  we have seen a return to the ideologies of hatred  lies and propaganda. We must be clear in condemning extreme nationalism  homophobia  xenophobia and religious extremism. We need to recall and reaffirm the values that the United Nations was created to protect. The United Nations  a unique global instrument of security and peace  must succeed where the League of Nations once failed.Let us not forget that 75 years ago  on 23 August 1939  a pact was signed between Hitler’s Germany and Stalin’s Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to divide Eastern Europe into their spheres of influence. A week later  on 1 September  Hitler attacked Poland. On 17 September  two and a half weeks later  Hitler’s erstwhile ally  the Soviet Union  also attacked Poland  and the Second World War had begun.The date of 31 August this year marked 20 years since the occupation forces left Estonia — troops that were there as a result of that same Stalin-Hitler pact. Yet just a few days later on 5 September  an Estonian police officer was abducted by foreign security services on Estonian territory and taken by force to Moscow  where he is still being held in the infamous Lefortovo prison.We cannot allow anyone ever to divide countries into spheres of influence. The community of nations is only secure when its smallest members can feel secure. We cannot and will not accept threats and intimidation in twenty-first century international relations. We cannot have peace  security or prosperity in Europe  or in the world  unless we again find a way to enforce and revalidate the agreements that we have all signed and are parties to."
"55",2304,"ETH",69,2014,"It is indeed a great pleasure to see a seasoned African diplomat presiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I would like to express my warmest congratulations to him on his election to that high office. I know he is aware  as we are  that he is assuming his responsibility at one of the most critical periods in the history of this Organization and that of multilateralism in general. Those of us in the East African region know him very well as a friend and distinguished diplomat. We are confident that he will use his wisdom and experience to build consensus on a range of issues on the agenda of the General Assembly at this historic session and effectively guide its work. Let me therefore assure him of the full support and cooperation of my delegation in the successful discharge of his heavy responsibilities. I also wish to commend his predecessor for the excellent contribution he made to ensuring the success of the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Indeed  it was a remarkable session  which laid the foundation for the major task that lies ahead.This session is being held at a historic time  when we have embarked upon a major undertaking to shape the future we want for present and future generations. If we do what we must  it could be remembered in history as a session that helped us turn the corner in ensuring effective custodianship of the environment  economic justice and social responsibility. What we agreed over two years ago in Rio must be what galvanizes our common effort. We said then that poverty eradication is the greatest global challenge facing the world today and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.global warming  we are indeed playing a leading role in terms of mitigation by scaling up our efforts in renewable energy and promoting energy efficiency. It is only fair and proper that that be adequately recognized and supported.There can be no doubt that the challenge posed by climate change requires leadership and political commitment at all levels. We have no choice but to rise to that challenge by taking concrete actions to help reduce emissions and demonstrating the necessary political will to achieve a globally binding climate agreement by 2015 in Paris. Failure is not an option.What we see here at the United Nations is a readiness on the part of States to think big and focus on what unites us. That is what underlies the complex negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda. In sharp contrast to that  what we are witnessing today is a general deterioration of the global security situation. The world is passing through a turbulent period  and that is not an exaggeration. The proliferation and intensity of conflicts have significantly increased.In our part of the world  progress made over the past decade is being undermined by new cycles of violence and conflict. The crisis in South Sudan is an example. We in the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) region are doing everything we can to resolve the South Sudanese crisis through peaceful means with the support of the United Nations  the African Union and international partners. But progress  let alone a breakthrough  has not been easy to come by. The situation highlights an often encountered challenge. Progress in peacemaking can hardly be contemplated when there is a lack of sufficient commitment to a peaceful resolution of a crisis by the parties to the conflict. But IGAD is determined to expend every possible effort to find a lasting solution to the crisis through an all-inclusive political dialogue.In contrast with the situation in South Sudan and with situations in many parts of the world  the situation in Somalia has been improving over the course of the year. Al-Shabaab may not have been entirely removed as a threat  but it has been greatly degraded. The recent setback it suffered is bound to speed up its demise. The military gains made on the ground cannot  however  be sustained without progress on the political track through the establishment of local administrations and the maintenance of law and order in the newly liberated areas. In that regard  we welcome the establishment of interim local administrations in central and south-west Somalia in line with the provisional Federal Constitution. We need to continue to support Somalia in its efforts to rebuild itself and make a successful transition by 2016.Conflict is not an exclusively African phenomenon. What has become obvious lately is how much the global security situation is becoming a source of concern. Never since the end of the cold war has the global security situation been as fragile as it is today. The threat of terrorism has affected ever greater and wider areas of the world. At no time over the past many decades has the need for effective cooperation at the international and regional levels been as pressing and as urgent as it is today. That the issue of foreign fighters has become a source of major concern to many is obvious. What is required to make progress in addressing the challenge is a readiness to forge cooperation that brooks no double standards. We need to be resolute in our determination to work together.All that means that at no time in recent memory has multilateralism been as immensely crucial for the future of the world as it is today. The fact that nations are driven by the pursuit of national interests has always been self-evident. But at this juncture in world history and in the light of the many common challenges that we all face  we have no more realistic option than a commitment to enlightened national interest  which can be promoted only within the framework of multilateralism.That  in our view  is the sentiment that we should all share at the beginning of the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We cannot be oblivious to the nexus between our sustainable development agenda and the global situation of peace and security. “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  the theme of this session  requires a peaceful and stable global environment. It is also in that context that the threat of the spread of the Ebola virus should be viewed. It is both a humanitarian and a security challenge. Containing the spread of the deadly virus should be a matter of utmost priority.Let me reiterate that it is critical that we collectively address the myriad of peace and security challenges facing our world in order to facilitate progress in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals in the remaining period and to lay a solid foundation for the realization of our transformative agenda in the post-2015 era  as well as to achieve a meaningful climate agreement.I wish to conclude by stressing Ethiopia’s commitment to multilateralism  to joining hands with all like-minded countries in order to contribute to regional and international peace and security and to the successful realization of the major projects that we will undertake in connection with the post-2015 agenda. As a founding member of the Organization and as a member of the League of Nations — although Ethiopia was abandoned by the League — Ethiopia attaches the highest priority to cooperation among peoples and countries with a view to addressing common challenges. It is our conviction that might does not make right. There is no substitute for the pursuit of mutual advantages as a guideline for a realistic and just foreign policy. That is our guide for all the friendships and partnerships we have and will continue to develop."
"56",2350,"FIN",69,2014,"The events of the past months fill us with sadness. We have entered another grim era of conflicts. What has happened in Ukraine and in Syria and Iraq illustrates that. The core values and rules on which the United Nations is based have been violated. The crisis in Ukraine has a deep impact on the security of Europe. We have not experienced such breakdown since the tragedy of the Balkan wars. But I want to stress that Ukraine is not only a question limited to Europe. It should — and eventually will — concern all of us.A rule-based international system is a precondition for peace and security  for human rights and development. If we cease to protect this system  it will cease to protect us. It would be a dramatic and far-reaching mistake to let our rule-based order slip towards chaos and the law of the jungle. Unfortunately  the Security Council has not been able to uphold its responsibilities either in Ukraine or in Syria. We need to reform the Security Council. Finland supports the efforts to restrict the use of veto.I am pleased that the General Assembly adopted resolution 68/262  entitled “Territorial integrity of Ukraine”  on 27 March  by a clear majority. Yet the voice of this important body should have been even stronger  condemning Russia’s actions and charting a way towards ending violence and restoring peace. When the territorial integrity of a Member State is violated and it loses control over a part of its own area through an illegal annexation  the Member State should be able to turn to the United Nations for justice and remedy. De-escalation in Ukraine cannot happen without Russia’s active steps. Russia should control its border and prevent the flow of arms and fighters and thereby contribute to stabilization of the situation in eastern Ukraine. Only a political solution can solve this crisis. We have recently seen some steps towards that  but a lot still remains to be done.As the Secretary-General has reminded us  the international community must not abandon the people of Syria. We cannot forget those who have died or those driven from their homes — half of the population of Syria. Three million Syrians have been received as refugees in the neighbouring countries. The Syrian conflict can be solved only by political means. Finland continues to give its full support to the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria. Women in Syria  as in other conflict-driven countries  must be included in the peace process. We welcome women’s active efforts to strengthen their voices in Syria and eslewhere.The war in Syria has severely affected the security situation in the whole region. The geographic expansion of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant organization  with its horrendous terror  is a by-product of the conflict. That situation has serious consequences locally  regionally and internationally. That challenge must be tackled together through wide-ranging international cooperation. Finland will contribute to those common efforts.The international community showed determination last autumn after the chemical attacks in Syria. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Mission for the Elimination of the Chemical Weapons Programme of the Syrian Arab Republic focused on the verification and destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons programme. Finland has worked alongside the Joint Mission in that demanding operation. We must remain vigilant. In order to fulfil its United Nations commitments as well as to comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention  Syria must take further action. We must show that determination again. I strongly reiterate the appeal to the Security Council to refer the Syrian situation to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC must be used when the national justice system is not able to deliver.Those conflicts are unfolding at a time when cooperation and common efforts are more needed than ever. We share the same global challenges  such as climate change. Ebola is another serious threat. To help  Finland will double its assistance. It is critically important to us and our planet that we address them together. Here  I want to express my gratitude to the Secretary-General for his leadership in addressing those challenges.Intergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 agenda will commence soon. We should aspire to a new kind of global commitment to fulfil both the needs of mankind and planet Earth. We owe this to our children and their children. To achieve sustainable development  we need clear objectives. We need to be able to monitor our commitments in an efficient way. All resources and means should be mobilized. We cannot rely only on traditional resources any more. Public funding for development is still important for the poorest and those affected by conflicts. But at the same time  domestic resource mobilization  innovation  trade and technology and investments must play a stronger role in sustainable development.Many countries of the global South enjoy a robust economic growth. That provides an opportunity to invest in tax systems  which in turn generates public resources for sustainable development. A just tax and redistribution policy is one of the most efficient ways to reduce inequalities and fight marginalization. The rule of law and the fight against corruption play a huge role as well.I trust the Secretary-General to be both visionary and concrete when setting the scene for the intergovernmental negotiations. This process will culminate next year in this very Hall. The best way to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations next year is to adopt transformative commitments that set us on a path towards sustainable development.I started by describing the grim state of international relations. My analysis is not an excuse for inaction  but a call to redouble our diplomatic efforts. We must act with determination  and we must act now. Finland will support efforts to restore peace and prevent further damage to our rule-based international system. We must also aim high in addressing together the broader global challenges of climate change and sustainable development."
"57",2394,"FJI",69,2014,"I join those who have spoken before me in congratulating Mr. Sam Kutesa on his assumption of the office of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. Like them  I am confident that  under his leadership  the sixty-ninth session will be productive. I would also like to express Fiji’s gratitude for the leadership of Mr. John Ashe throughout the sixty-eighth session.Five years ago  I stood in this great Hall and promised the global community that my Government would introduce the first genuine democracy in Fiji’s history before the end of September (see A/64/PV.10). It is my honour to inform the Assembly that  with the support of the Fijian people  I have kept that promise. I return to the Assembly today as the duly elected Prime Minister of the Republic of Fiji. At our general election on 17 September  I led my Fiji First political movement to a decisive victory in the first election to be held under our new Constitution on the basis of equal votes of equal value. The new Constitution replaced the three previous constitutions since our independence from Britain in 1970  in which Governments were chosen under a weighted and discriminatory formula that separated the various communities and favoured some citizens over others.For nearly four decades  we laboured under a system that was undemocratic  unjust and unfair. Indeed  we were a case study of a nation that was supposedly democratic and casting itself as such  but was failing to meet some basic democratic standards — a common and equal citizenry  a common identity and a level playing field on which every citizen can excel. We have often heard it said that elections are key to having democracy. We in Fiji knew that that was not the case  because our electoral system  before it was reformed  did not give us true democracy. It did not facilitate justice  transparency or good governance. It was about reinforcing power  the power of elites  and keeping the population divided into different communal groups. That weighted system perpetuated injustice for a great many of our people  created different classes of citizens and encouraged corruption. It was a system that no advanced democracy would accept for itself. The status of any Fijian in national life depended on his or her racial origin  whether that man or woman came from one of the chiefly or business elites  and even what part of the country the person lived in.We needed a revolution to put us on the path to true democracy. And from the time that that revolution began in 2006 to our election 10 days ago  we embarked on a series of reforms that have transformed our nation. More laws were passed during this eight-year period to improve our standard of governance than in the entire 36-year period since independence. And central to that was the development of our supreme law — the 2013 Constitution — from which all other laws flow. It is the blueprint for the new Fiji. Now every Fiji Islander enjoys equal opportunity and a common identity — Fijian. That name was once reserved for the indigenous majority but now applies to everyone from the Republic of Fiji  just as the common name American applies to all from the United States or the name Australian to any Australian from Australia.A range of social and economic rights have also been enshrined in our supreme law for the first time  rights that comply with a number of United Nations conventions — the right to economic participation  a just minimum wage  education  housing  health and adequate food and water. The right to live in an environment free of pollution is a principle we hope that every nation will embrace  as we strive for the preservation and protection of our natural surroundings. So today  I am proud to report to the Assembly that Fiji is a fairer  more just society and a more compassionate society  as we step up our efforts to alleviate poverty on the back of a rapidly strengthening economy.We have also set our sights on being a smarter country by introducing free schooling at the primary and secondary levels for the first time. Plus we now have an array of scholarships and a tertiary loans scheme to enable our young people to go on to higher education. Our vision is to cement our place as a pre-eminent Pacific Island nation  a true regional hub and a Pacific beacon of prosperity and progress for our smaller neighbours. We intend to play a bigger role in the wider world to voice our collective concerns about such issues as the environment  climate change and the need to create a fairer trading system to benefit our people in the Pacific and in all developing countries.As we begin this new era in our national life  I want to thank those in the greater community of nations who have stood by us in recent years as we made the reforms that were necessary to create a better Fiji. Not everyone understood what we were trying to do. Some tried to damage us with sanctions and to degrade our quality of governance because we refused to accept their prescriptive and high-handed approach towards us. But the majority of nations recognized our right to determine our own future and came to understand that we were working not for the benefit of a governing elite but for the common good. To those in the General Assembly who gave us their support  our friends  1 extend the grateful thanks of the Fijian people.I also want to especially thank those countries that made up the Multinational Observer Group that declared our general election credible  free and fair. For the co-leaders from Australia  India  Indonesia  Canada  the European Union  Israel  Japan  the members of the Melanesian Spearhead Group  New Zealand  the Republic of Korea  Russia  South Africa  Turkey  the United Kingdom and the United States of America — I offer many thanks to them all. It has been a long and sometimes traumatic journey for our nation in the 44 years since independence: four coups  a rebellion  four Constitutions and 56 days of shame in 2000 when members of our Parliament were held hostage.Fiji has struggled to be unified and cohesive; our development was retarded by our inability to think and work as one nation  one people. But with the recent election  we have put that era firmly behind us. In our new democracy  we are all Fijians  not members of separate ethnic and religious groups. And having established a common and equal citizenry  along with a secular State  we intend to move forward together to finally fulfil our promise as a nation  to fulfil our destiny.I especially want to pay tribute today to the Fijian people. I say to them today before the world: this was their victory. Whichever candidate they chose  theirs was a vote for a better future for our nation. I pledge again that I will govern for the benefit of all our citizens  no matter who they are  where they come from or who they voted for. Mine will be an inclusive Government over the next four years. I will be the leader of all Fijians  for all Fijians. As we move our beloved nation forward  I am determined to leave no one behind. In that spirit  I extend a hand of friendship to my political opponents. Whatever our differences  let us now work together constructively in our new Parliament  when it convenes on 6 October  to improve the lives of every Fijian. We are currently enjoying the most sustained period of economic growth in our history. The possibility to create more jobs and raise the living standards of our people has never been greater. Let us join hands to put our nation first  to put Fiji first.I want to assure our Pacific neighbours of Fiji’s continuing contribution to the region as we work together and collaborate to resolve the great challenges facing us  develop our economies and improve the lives of all Pacific islanders. Fiji has played a leading role in the formation of the Pacific Islands Development Forum  an addition to the existing regional framework  which  for the first time  links Governments with civil society groups and the private sector in a joint effort to solve our development problems in a sustainable manner.Fiji is privileged to have been given the responsibility of hosting the Pacific Island Development Forum Secretariat in our capital  Suva. We were equally privileged that the outgoing Indonesian President  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyno  was our principal guest at this year’s Forum in June.In this International Year of Small Island Developing States  we need a more concerted effort to strengthen our regional institutions in order to confront the enormous challenges we face in the Pacific  namely  population growth  the unsustainable use of our ocean’s natural resources and rising sea levels caused by climate change. Climate change threatens to engulf some of our Pacific Island States altogether  and is already forcing the evacuation of coastal villages in Fiji.I repeat here what I have said in other forums: history will judge the world’s major carbon-emitters extremely harshly  unless they take immediate and comprehensive steps to reduce emissions. It is simply not acceptable  purely in moral terms  for the world to allow the small island developing States to sink slowly beneath the waves because of the selfish determination of industrialized nations to protect their own economies. Time is fast running out  and I beg Governments to act.I am also here to rededicate ourselves as a nation to the ideals of the United Nations and to its service  whenever and wherever it is required. That service is at the core of our foreign policy  whose central purpose is to be friends to all and enemies to none. It has been our privilege to chair the largest voting bloc at the United Nations  the Group of 77 and China  and this year to assume the Presidency of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme.For some 36 years now  Fiji has proudly contributed our troops to successive peacekeeping operations in Lebanon  Sinai  Iraq  Syria  Timor-Leste  South Sudan  Darfur  Liberia  Bosnia  Kosovo  Kuwait  Namibia  Cambodia and the Solomon Islands. Some of those peacekeepers have paid with their lives — as have troops from other countries — and we honour those who have fallen in the cause of peace. Last month  45 of our soldiers currently serving with the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force  were held captive. As a nation  we held grave fears for their safety  but after two anxious weeks our prayers were answered  and our men were freed. I want to thank the skilful team of United Nations negotiators who worked with our military officers and diplomats in a tireless effort to secure the release of our men. I also warmly thank those nations that came to Fiji’s assistance during that trying period. We will never forget the role played by those Governments in keeping our men safe so that they can continue to fulfil their United Nations mandate and eventually return safely to their families and friends in Fiji.I am proud to say that not once during the course of that crisis were there any calls in Fiji for the withdrawal of our troops from that  or future  peacekeeping missions. Peacekeeping is a noble cause and is our contribution to the welfare of ordinary men and women living in less fortunate circumstances far from our island home. I want everyone to know that Fiji will always be ready to serve.To strengthen our commitment to meeting our international obligations  this year Fiji opened a Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva  which is focused on strengthening our interaction with treaty bodies  such as the Human Rights Council  the International Labour Organization  the World Trade Organization  the World Intellectual Property Organization  the International Telecommunication Union and other organizations based in Geneva.In closing  Fiji looks forward to contributing positively to the work of the United Nations during the President’s stewardship of the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. On behalf of all Fijians  I pledge our full support and cooperation as the President carries out his tasks in the cause of the great global family to which we all belong."
"58",2441,"FRA",69,2014,"The Assembly will understand that I am speaking today with particular emotion  because one of my compatriots has just been the subject of a cowardly assassination in Algeria by a terrorist group linked to Daesh. His name was Hervé Gourdel. He was a man full of enthusiasm who loved mountains and thought that he would be able to pursue his passion by going to the Djurdjura area in Algeria. He was captured  and he was decapitated. That is what terrorism does. And it does not do that only to France. Several days ago it was American and British individuals subjected to the same barbarity.That group — Daesh — does not strike only those who think differently from themselves; they also strike Muslims  they strike civilian populations  and they strike minorities. They rape  they kill. That is why the battle that the international community must wage against terrorism knows no borders. The same flag must be carried  that of the United Nations  that of the values for which this Organization was founded — human dignity  freedom  the vision we must have of a world of tomorrow  a world of justice.France is fully engaged in this battle. That was the case in Africa when it was called to Mali  where  fortunately  it was joined by many African and European countries and now by the United Nations. France has been engaged whenever there is a risk. But today it is in Iraq and Syria where that threat exists. But it does not concern that region alone  because the Daesh group has decided not only to conquer territory  imagining that it will found a State; it threatens the entire world by provoking attacks  organizing kidnappings and recruiting fighters from around the world to train them and show them the barbarity of which the group is capable  so they may reproduce that horrific terrorist movement in our own countries.It is because this threat exists not only for the region but for the world that France responded to the Iraqi authorities’ appeal to provide them first with military aid through the delivery of weapons this past August and also with aerial support to keep the Daesh group from being able to continue its advance. We want to weaken it. We want to quash it.But we also know that as long as there is no settlement of the Syrian crisis  all our efforts risk being undermined. So the challenge is not only to act against Daesh  but also to achieve a political solution. We in France support the democratic Syrian opposition. We consider it the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people. In that case  too  we will not back down; we will not compromise because of threats. The Bashar Al-Assad regime deserves to be condemned because they are complicit in what has been going on for the past three years in Syria — 200 000 deaths and so many displaced persons.This is a sad time for France  with the death — the murder — of one of our citizens  but France will never give in to blackmail  pressure or barbarous acts. On the contrary  France knows what is expected of it. France knows that it upholds values  France knows it has a role to play and will never abandon that role  and that the fight against terrorism will be continued and expanded as much as necessary within respect for the rule of law and the sovereignty of States  for we make no mistake when we act. We will always act with respect for the principles of the United Nations.I also wanted to talk to about other things  but it must be understood that a great question is being asked of my country and also of the Assembly. When faced with barbarism  with terrorism  will we remain spectators  or will we be actors together in what should be a just international order? The question  if we do not respond to it  or if we respond too weakly  then terrorists will continue their business of recruitment and indoctrination. It is not weakness that will be the response to terrorism; it is force — the force of law  the force of the United Nations. At a certain point also  it will be the force of military action when it becomes necessary.I also wanted to talk about other regions of the world that are facing threats that also affect our own security. I want to talk to the Assembly about the Ebola epidemic  because I know just how much it is affecting our African friends. But again  let us look beyond those who are affected. Who can imagine that the epidemic will remain confined to just a few countries if we do not intervene? It is also a global threat. Again  the response must be a global. Therefore  France  Europe and the world must provide to the countries affected by the epidemic the necessary medical care  indispensable protection and economic assistance that is expected. Because again  if there is the slightest weakness  the slightest failure to show solidarity  all of our countries will be affected.I have also come here before the General Assembly to speak about what is happening in Europe and next to Europe  to speak about what occurred in Ukraine and the failures there to uphold principles of international law. But what is at stake today  even in Europe  is peace and ensuring that the ceasefire that was agreed can be transformed into a lasting solution to the conflict.No continent has been spared from any threat. Everything is fragile  everything is precarious  everything is vulnerable. We have to have the same awareness of the risks  the dangers and the perils that we had right after the Second World War. We must not think that all we have to do is remember; we have to think of the future  of the world we want. The world that we want is the final subject I wish to address here.The world that we want has to be one of profound change. The present disorder also threatens not only our generation but naturally those that will follow us. It threatens our very security  as there are more displaced persons resulting from climate imbalance than from wars  which are sadly so intense and deadly on our planet. France has lived up to its responsibilities in that area too. We decided to organize the climate conference in December 2015. I am pleased that thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  there was a summit here that mobilized awareness  States  financial institutions  businesses and civil society. Many events took place. We have to succeed at the Paris conference  not because it will take place in Paris  but because it is the world’s appointment with itself.There are periods in history when we have the power to decide  and decide not just for ourselves but for humankind. This is one of those moments. Therefore in Paris  we have to do everything can be done to reach a comprehensive  binding agreement that differentiates according to levels of development  everything so that there can be that Green Climate Fund  to which France has contributed $1 billion for the coming years. I hope that other countries follow our example  because we need that Green Fund to allow less developed countries to grow and to succeed in their energy transition at the same time.This is a sad moment that I am living today on behalf of France  that the French are experiencing  but it is also a moment of awakening and responsibility. For the world  for the planet  we must fight terrorism  we must act in favour of peace  we must reduce inequalities  we must also do our duty for future generations. We must ensure that the Paris conference is successful for the sake of the climate. We must make certain that the United Nations can remain faithful to the mandate given to it after a war — a terrible war. We are still facing challenges  but we are certain to meet them if we are united and come together to claim victory."
"59",2466,"FSM",69,2014,"I would like to congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election to lead the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I wish to thank him and the outgoing President  Mr. John Ashe  for their leadership. I must also commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  who has more than measured up to the tremendous tasks associated with his high Office.Allow me to extend my sympathies to the families of the victims of the tragic and appalling events that have recently unfolded around the world  from the passengers on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 to the recent beheadings by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria  to the victims of the Ebola epidemic and natural disasters. We will never forget those tragedies and the loss of lives.I am humbled to speak in this hallowed Hall for the last time as President of my island nation  the Federated States of Micronesia. Like my predecessors  I come with great respect for this honourable institution. This global Organization is best suited to address and solve the pressing issues of our global family.I have come to the United Nations compelled by the dictates of conscience. We are all stewards of God’s creation here on Earth. The bounties of Mother Nature are priceless  and we all bear the obligation to sustainably manage them.Over 30 years ago  small island countries brought the issue of climate change to the attention of the United Nations. Some Members have criticized us for focusing too much on climate change and sea-level rise  but those issues influence our every decision and affect every aspect of life in our islands. Across the globe  the deadly impacts of climate change on the environment are stark realities. Others can afford to speak of them as future threats  but we in small island countries are already facing the impacts  which are worse than science predicted.Micronesia means “little islands”  with atolls rising only a few feet above sea level. According to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  human-caused climate change is leading to sea-level rise  more frequent and more intense typhoons and severe droughts. A small increase in the sea level would be a catastrophe for the atolls of Micronesia. Our islands contribute almost nothing towards the causes of climate change  and yet we face the brunt of its adverse impacts. Climate change threatens our food and water security  the health of our population  the health of our oceans and coral reefs  our biodiversity and the very existence of our island nations.What are we doing about it? Collectively  in order for small islands to survive  the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) advocates for limiting global warming to well below a 1.5°C increase above the pre-industrial temperature. That requires immediate action from all stakeholders. Small Island Developing States (SIDS) must not be asked to fight climate change by themselves. On that note  we support the recently launched World Bank initiative on carbon pricing.Next year  the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21)  to be held in Paris  will establish a new climate change treaty  which will go into effect in 2020. However  the United Nations Environment Programme has identified a pre-2020 emissions gap. Therefore  AOSIS has also made an important proposal to the work plan on enhancing mitigation ambitions in order to close the gap.Micronesia has made an equally important proposal to amend the Montreal Protocol to phase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)  which are powerful greenhouse gases. That action can reduce the global average temperature increase by up to 0.5°C by the end of this century. Reducing HFCs and other short-lived climate pollutants can reduce the rate of sea-level rise by 25 per cent. Near-term climate mitigation will give all atolls around the globe a chance to survive.The Montreal Protocol’s success and enormous potential to protect the climate was recognized in The Economist this week. The magazine has a separate editorial entitled “Paris via Montreal: The quickest way to cut greenhouse gases is to expand the Montreal Protocol”. Indeed  the success of the Montreal Protocol in the next six months is our ticket to a successful outcome in Paris at COP 21. I commend the United States of America and China for continuing to work to fulfil their agreement to use the Montreal Protocol to reduce HFCs. I call on other world leaders to join Micronesia and adopt the proposed HFC amendment.In the face of already occurring climate change impacts  the best small island nations can do on the ground is to try to anticipate and adapt to climate change and instil the best possible disaster risk reduction and response policies. Adaptation is therefore a priority in Micronesia’s Climate Change Act  which was recognized at the recent world summit of the Global Legislators Organization for a Balanced Environment. The Act implements our nationwide integrated disaster risk management and climate change policy. The goal of the policy is two-fold: first  to achieve economic growth and self-reliance within a framework of sustainable development  and secondly  to minimize the risks associated with all human-induced and natural hazards  including those associated with climate change.Micronesia has also developed an agriculture policy to address food and water security and strengthen economic development. The policy also provides the basis for action to revitalize sustainable agriculture  while recognizing the major role played by traditional farming systems and the importance of climate-resilient crops. Other key national actions of Micronesia and other SIDS are reflected in the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership and the Palau Declaration on “The Ocean: Life and Future”.In this International Year of Small Island Developing States  the United Nations has convened a number of important conferences whose outcomes must be incorporated into the post-2015 development agenda. In that regard  I stress the critical importance of implementing the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action — Samoa Pathway — the purpose of which is to stimulate sustainable development in SIDS through durable and genuine partnerships.We note with appreciation the report by the Chairs of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals and fully endorse the proposed sustainable development goals (SDGs). We rely on our development partners to assist us in undertaking the actions identified in the Samoa Pathway and in fulfilling the SDGs in ways that are appropriate for our peoples and our cultures.Clean energy and energy efficiency are two of the key engines for advancing our sustainable and low-carbon development. Therefore  our national energy policy gives priority to energy efficiency and renewable energy. By 2020  the share of renewable energy sources will be at least 30 per cent of total energy production  while electricity efficiency will increase by 50 per cent. That will require harnessing sunshine  which we have in abundance  as well as renewable wind and marine energy resources. I call on our development partners to assist us in implementing our national energy policy  including through the SIDS Renewable Energy Initiative.Our ocean and its resources are of paramount importance  but they are threatened by climate change and ocean acidification  which damage coral reefs and could alter the migration patterns of tuna  our most commercially valuable resource. Foreign vessels  which enjoy unprecedented returns from harvesting our exclusive economic zone  need to help us maintain the health  productivity and resilience of our ocean. Micronesia must also receive fair compensation for the value of its resources.As part of a programme of sustainable use  we must reduce the amount of by-catch being discarded  bring it to shore and put it to good use. Illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU fishing) continues to threaten our ocean resources and undermines our economic sustainability. We all must abide by the rules. IUU fishing must be stopped.Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have become a leading cause of death in the Pacific. Therefore  Pacific leaders have declared NCDs an epidemic. Such diseases are lifestyle diseases  but they are compounded by climate change  which destroys our food crops and contaminates our water supplies. Tackling that multisectoral issue requires broad cooperation and support.Human trafficking is one of the most serious social diseases of modern society. It robs individuals of their dignity  particularly women and children. Profiting from human misery is despicable. Micronesia supports the eradication of trafficking in all its forms. Objective and transparent ratings of countries will help achieve that goal.We urge the establishment of the “One UN” approach for the North Pacific. We are now benefiting from the United Nations Joint Presence in the region  but we need to increase its efficiency at the country level. The One UN approach is timely as we position ourselves to implement the Samoa Pathway and the post-2015 development agenda  and it will help us address our national priorities.Despite the United Nations target of setting aside 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance  most developed nations fall far short of that goal. Small island developing States face unique challenges owing to our extreme vulnerabilities  including climate change. The need for financial and technical assistance from development partners is greater than ever  especially for human resources development and the capacity-building of domestic institutions.Internationally agreed financial mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund must be fully capitalized and sufficiently scaled up to support the post-2015 development agenda. We applaud Germany  France and six other nations for pledging specific sums. We urge those countries and the other major economic Powers that are also the major polluters to deliver the funds.My Government has liberalized its telecommunications system  and the World Bank is providing assistance in the form of grants for installing a state-of-the-art fibre-optic system in my country. That much-needed infrastructure will spur economic and social development. We continue to look to the World Bank  the International Telecommunication Union  the Asian Development Bank and other development partners to help us accelerate implementation of that new system and provide for cyber-security.The reform of the Security Council is long overdue. A reformed Council should reflect the political realities of today. It would be inconceivable to have a reformed Council without permanent seats for Japan  Germany  Brazil and India  as well as representation for Africa.Micronesia is confident that the United Nations can maintain international peace and security. It shines like a bright beacon of hope for those suffering from the ravages of war. Micronesia condemns senseless killings  no matter where they occur. The Middle East is a specific trouble spot that deserves this body’s attention. Peace can be achieved through mutual respect and economic stability  not by using civilian lives as shields.Micronesia also looks to the United Nations to effectively address the global security threats posed by climate change. Micronesia has taken an active role in the international sustainable development and climate change negotiation processes. We will continue seeking solutions to those challenges  out of the conviction that it is our moral obligation to protect Mother Nature and her bounties. All countries must work together to protect our children’s future."
"60",2509,"GAB",69,2014,"I would first of all like to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I assure him of the full support of my country. The remarkable work of his predecessor  Mr. John William Ashe  during the sixty-eighth session deserves our recognition. The same goes for the commendable and tireless efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as head of the Organization.At the previous session  we deplored and condemned the cowardly terrorist attacks on the shopping centre in Nairobi. Now  inevitably  the current session takes place in an equally worrisome context  marked by serious threats to international peace and security. First  there is the advance of the elusive Boko Haram terrorist network  which is extending its area of influence to the border of the neighbouring countries of Gabon  wreaking havoc and killing without discrimination. Then  there is the recurrence of the epidemic of the Ebola haemorrhagic fever  with an unprecedented incidence of infection  which is plunging Africa into mourning. Allow me to pay tribute to the memory of those who have lost their lives trying to help those who are ill. I also pay solemn tribute to the men and women who risk their lives in their daily fight to eradicate the pandemic.Given that the threat of Ebola is worldwide  national responses should be replaced by a comprehensive mobilization at the global level. In that regard  my country welcomes the recent steps taken by the African Union and the United Nations  as well as the many national initiatives that have been announced. I welcome the United Nations decision to dispatch an emergency medical mission to fight the Ebola epidemic in the affected countries. My country  which prevailed in its fight against several Ebola crises in the past  intends to make available the International Centre for Medical Research Centre in Franceville. The Centre’s expertise in treating that disease has been proven.I am pleased that this session allows us to debate a topic that concerns all of us  namely “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”. For Gabon  the report recently adopted by the General Assembly on sustainable development goals (A/68/970) is a solid foundation in the development of that agenda. My country welcomes the fact that African priorities  including the eradication of extreme poverty  the promotion of sustainable agriculture and industrialization  and the protection of the environment  all figure prominently in that report.I would like to recall here that Gabon entered the post-2015 development agenda process when it began to implement the Strategic Plan for an Emerging Gabon. The plan is based on a vision  an approach that has led us to define a bold development programme. That programme  of course  incorporates the concerns reflected in the Millennium Development Goals  as well as the challenges of climate change and food security. It gives pride of place to everything that promotes the maximization of our youth potential. The strategy implemented by Gabon aims to accelerate the structural transformation of its economy by moving from a rentier economy to an economy of industries and services with high added-value in the near future.In the current phase of implementing that programme  special attention is being devoted to competitiveness factors  such as the formation of human capital and the construction and upgrading of development infrastructure  including the development of a digital economy and the strengthening of energy-production capacities. Over the short term  we intend to devote greater efforts to education and training in order to improve the performance of our basic education system. The goal here is to enhance the employability of our workforce  provide a qualified labour force for our labour market and accelerate the integration of young people into the workforce. The development of agriculture  livestock  fisheries and aquaculture  as well as food security  continues to receive sustained attention from my Government. Those are all areas where we thought it best to anticipate our leap in the post-2015 development agenda.It is common knowledge that all those efforts can truly thrive only in a political  economic and social environment marked by good governance. To that end  Gabon has established various institutional instruments  such as the National Commission for the Fight against Illicit Enrichment  whose overall mission is to ensure transparency and accountability in the management of public funds. Since then  I have made the fight against corruption a priority strategic objective. Right now  large-scale inspection and verification missions are under way throughout the country with substantial results. I remain firmly convinced that  in order to establish a solid foundation for our post-2015 agenda  we need to tailor our economic environment  so as to ensure that transparency guides the awarding of public contracts and licenses  that investments produce a good return  and that economic actors respect their obligations vis-à-vis the State.Gabon’s commitment to the fight against climate change remains constant  given the seriousness of the problem. Indeed  as has already been pointed out  the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change draws attention to the harsh reality of the damage caused by climate change. It would be wrong on our part to remain insensitive in the face of what is transpiring before our very eyes. That is why I welcome the commitments made by the heads of State and Government at the end of the Climate Summit held here on 23 September.I reiterate Gabon’s determination to bear its share of our common duty. Gabon’s objective is to reduce  by 2025  more than half the greenhouse gas emissions per capita produced by every Gabonese. My country wishes to strengthen its contribution to the efforts of the international community aimed at the adoption of a more binding agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol. That is the purpose of the meeting that we will organize in Libreville from 18 to 19 March 2015  our “South Climate Initiative.” As part of that initiative  which will take place after the important Lima Conference  we  the countries of the South  want to make a structured contribution for the success of the Paris Conference. The scale of climatic upheavals caused by global warming shows that climate change is a vital  even existential question. Given the extreme seriousness of the danger confronting us  we must unite. We need to work hand in hand towards the same goal  namely  to save the planet in Paris in December 2015.In just one year  our Organization will celebrate its seventieth anniversary. That maturity should enable it to better respond to the multifaceted challenges that it faces. The effective implementation of the post-2015 development agenda must also be tackled. That is why we must continue our efforts to resolve crises and hotbeds of tension in various parts of the world.Regarding the Central African Republic  Gabon continues to actively participate in the efforts of the Economic Community of Central African States  the African Union  the United Nations and the rest of the international community in seeking to stabilize the political  security  economic and humanitarian situation on the ground.In that connection  I want to pay tribute to the Brazzaville Forum for National Reconciliation in the Central African Republic  which concluded with the signing of a ceasefire agreement. Moreover  Gabon welcomes the effective establishment of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic  which took over from the African-led International Support Mission to the Central African Republic. Regarding Mali  Gabon supports the peace process that has been launched and supports the mediation efforts by Burkina Faso  Algeria and Morocco aimed at achieving a lasting peace. In South Sudan  Gabon supports the efforts of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and the African Union in the search for a negotiated political solution between the two parties.Regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  I welcome the signing  under Egyptian mediation  of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. My hope is that that truce lasts and promotes the resumption of direct negotiations to achieve the widely shared vision of creating a viable Palestinian State existing in harmony alongside Israel in peace and security  within secure and internationally recognized borders.Regarding Western Sahara  Gabon welcomes the efforts based on dialogue and negotiations agreed to by our Organization. My country wants to reiterate its support for the Moroccan initiative  which we consider to be a courageous and realistic proposal that could lead to a lasting settlement. Finally  in terms of the embargo against Cuba  Gabon reiterates its position in favour of lifting it  because of its negative impact on the welfare of the population.Never has the terrorist threat been as strong as in recent times  jeopardizing the survival of the institutions of the countries affected by that terrible phenomenon. In Africa  Boko Haram’s activism pushes entire populations to live far from their homes and in terror  poverty and despair.In the Middle East  the so-called Islamic State has extended its gruesome reign from eastern Syria to northern Iraq. Its establishment there has been accompanied by a lengthy sequence of rape  summary executions  decapitations and punishments of all types inflicted upon all those who  in the eyes of the extremists  symbolize the rejection of their radicalization.As no nation is now spared the murderous folly of those negative entities  the fight against terrorism needs to be more concerted and organized. My country reiterates its support for international efforts undertaken to that end and reaffirms its firm condemnation of terrorist acts in all their forms and manifestations. In seeking to meet the security challenge of terrorism  we need to strengthen the operational capacities of our defence and security forces in conformity with the spirit of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.Our concerns for peace and security are compounded by other cross-cutting threats  notably the poaching of and illicit trafficking in protected species. That growing phenomenon  especially in Central Africa  constitutes a threat at three levels: ecological  economic and security. My country therefore remains wedded to the London initiative of February 2014. We reaffirm our commitment to opposing poaching and to implementing a moratorium on the ivory trade. To that end  Gabon and Germany will organize tomorrow  26 September  a side event on the issue.My country is more determined than ever to cooperate further with other States in formulating a development tool that would take into account the global concerns of our populations. That will involve  inter alia  achieving progress in the reform of the United Nations system. It is from that perspective that Gabon  like other States Members of the United Nations  adheres to the “Delivering as one” initiative. Currently at the very core of United Nations reform  that approach aims at improving the coherence of the United Nations system’s operational development activities.Respect for human dignity and for fundamental freedoms remains at the heart of my Government’s concerns. That factor underpins our chairmanship of the Human Rights Council  which we are holding in a very difficult international context marked by numerous human rights violations. Despite all those challenges  the Council has been able to react and to respond with solutions to emergency situations caused by such violations. Gabon’s leadership has allowed constructive debate and has in particular prevented a lapse into politicized and polarized discussions. I should like to reiterate my gratitude to those countries that have lent us their support to ensure the success of our mandate.From this rostrum  I encourage the inclusion of the human rights dimension in the current consideration of the post-2015 agenda. Gabon urges such inclusion  and suggests that particular emphasis be placed on the link between human rights and sustainable development. Given all this  Gabon remains committed to engaging  alongside other States  in seeking collective solutions adapted to current challenges in preparation for a better world."
"61",2556,"GBR",69,2014,"This year we face extraordinary tests of our values and our resolve. In responding to the aggression against one of our Member States  Ukraine; in seeking peace in the Middle East; in dealing with the terrifying spread of the Ebola virus in West Africa; and in overcoming what I want to focus on today  which is the mortal threat we all face from the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Syria and Iraq. Deir ez-Zor is a province in eastern Syria. Home to the Al-Sheitaat tribe it was captured by ISIL last month. Seven hundred tribesmen were executed; many were beheaded. The vast majority were civilians  Muslims who refused to take an oath of allegiance to ISIL’s sick extremist world view and who paid for this with their lives. They are not alone. Across Syria and northern Iraq thousands have suffered the same fate — Muslims  both Sunni and Shia; Christians; Yazidis; people of every faith and none.ISIL is not a problem restricted to just one region. It has murderous plans to expand its borders well beyond Iraq and Syria and to carry out terrorist atrocities right across the world. It is recruiting new fighters from all over the world. Five hundred have gone there from my country  Britain  and one of them almost certainly brutally murdered two American journalists and a British aid worker. This is a problem that affects us all and we must tackle it together.There is not one person in this Hall who will view this challenge without reference to the past  whether in Iraq or in Afghanistan. Of course it is absolutely right that we should learn the lessons of the past  especially what happened in Iraq a decade ago. But we have to learn the right lessons — yes to careful preparation; no to rushing to join a conflict without a clear plan. But we must not be so frozen with fear that we do not do anything at all. Isolation and withdrawing from a problem like ISIL will only make matters worse.We must not allow past mistakes to become an excuse for indifference or inaction. The right lesson is that we should act  but act differently. We should be comprehensive  defeating the ideology of extremism that is the root cause of this terrorism  so that we win the battle of ideas and not just the battle of military might. We should be intelligent  supporting representative and accountable Governments and working with them at their request  not going in over their heads. We should be inclusive  working with partners in the region who are prepared to be part of the solution  potentially including Iran. We should be uncompromising  using all the means at our disposal  including military force  to hunt down these extremists. Let me take each of these in turn.The root cause of this terrorist threat is a poisonous ideology of Islamist extremism. This has nothing to do with Islam  which is a peaceful religion that inspires countless acts of generosity every day. Islamist extremism on the other hand believes in using the most brutal forms of terrorism to force people to accept a warped world view and to live in a quasi-mediaeval state. To defeat ISIL  and organizations like it  we must defeat this ideology in all its forms.As evidence emerges about the backgrounds of those convicted of terrorist offences  it is clear that many of them were initially influenced by preachers who claim not to encourage violence but whose world view can be used as a justification for it. We know this world view. The peddling of lies — that 9/11 was somehow a Jewish plot  or that the 7/7 London attacks were staged; the idea that Muslims are persecuted all over the world as a deliberate act of Western policy; and the concept of an inevitable clash of civilizations.We must be clear. To defeat the ideology of extremism we need to deal with all forms of extremism  not just violent extremism. For governments there are some obvious ways we can do this. We must ban preachers of hate from coming to our countries. We must proscribe organizations that incite terrorism against people at home and abroad. We must work together to take down illegal online material like the recent videos of ISIL murdering hostages. We must stop the so-called non-violent extremists from inciting hatred and intolerance in our schools  universities and even our prisons. Of course  some will argue that this is not compatible with free speech and intellectual inquiry. But I ask “Would we sit back and allow right-wing extremists  Nazis or Ku Klux Klansmen to recruit on our university campuses?” No  so we should not stand by and just allow any form of non-violent extremism.We need to argue that prophecies of a global war of religion pitting Muslims against the rest of the world are nonsense. We need Muslims and their Governments throughout the world to reclaim their religion from these sick terrorists as so many are doing  and quite rightly doing  today. We all need to help them with programmes that channel young people away from these poisonous ideologues  and we need the strongest possible international focus on tackling this ideology  which is why here at the United Nations the United Kingdom is calling for a new Special Representative on extremism.But fighting extremism will never be enough. Communism was defeated not simply by pointing out its flaws  but by showing that the alternative of economic freedoms  democracy and the rule of law could build a better society and a better world. Young people need to see the power of a different  better  more open  more democratic path. The twentieth century taught us the vital role of representative and accountable Governments in offering their people opportunity  hope and dignity.Of course we should not be naïve. Not every country can move at the same speed or even reach the same destination. We should respect different cultures  traditions and histories. But let us be clear — the failure to meet people’s aspirations can create a breeding ground where extremist and even terrorist insurgency can take root. Governments that only govern for some of their people cause deep resentment. In Iraq  the failure of the Al-Maliki Government to represent all of the people has driven some of them into the arms of the extremists.Too often  people have been faced with a false choice between an autocratic and unrepresentative government on the one hand and a brutal insurgency  with religion misused as its rallying call  on the other. To combat this we must support the building blocks of free and open societies. In Iraq this means supporting the creation of a new and genuinely inclusive Government capable of uniting all Iraqis — Sunnis  Shia  Kurd  Christians and others. In Syria  it must mean a political transition and an end to Al-Assad’s brutality.I know there are some who think that we should do a deal with Al-Assad in order to defeat ISIL. But I think this view is dangerously misguided. Our enemies’ enemy is not our friend; it is another enemy. Doing a deal with Al-Assad will not defeat ISIL because the bias and the brutality of the Al-Assad regime were and are one of the most powerful recruiting tools for the extremists. Syria needs what Iraq needs — an inclusive  representative  democratic Government that can look after the interests of all its peoples.To those who have backed Al-Assad or who have stood on the sidelines  I would say this: “We are ready to join with you in a new political effort to secure a representative and accountable Government in Damascus that can take the fight to ISIL”. It is simply not credible for Al-Assad to lead such a government although we are prepared to look at every practical option to find a way forward.We must be inclusive  engaging the widest possible coalition of countries in this international effort. ISIL is a threat to us all  but the greatest threat is to the region. It is very welcome that a number of Arab countries have already taken part in the action to degrade ISIL. They have shown courage and leadership. Iran should also be given the chance to show it can be part of the solution  not part of the problem. Earlier today I met with President Rouhani. We have severe disagreements. Iran’s support for terrorist organizations  its nuclear programme  and its treatment of its people all need to change. But Iran’s leaders could help in defeating the threat from ISIL. They could help to secure a more stable  inclusive Iraq  and a more stable and inclusive Syria. If they are prepared to do this  we should welcome their engagement.Finally  when the safety and security of our people are at stake  we must be uncompromising in our response. That starts at home. For our part  in the United Kingdom we are introducing new powers to strengthen our ability to seize passports and stop suspects from travelling; to allow us to strip British identity from dual nationals and temporarily prevent some British nationals getting back into our country; to ensure that airlines comply with our no fly lists and security screening requirements; and to enable our police and security services to apply for stronger locational constraints on those in the United Kingdom who pose a risk. Here at the United Nations we have led in the adoption of a Security Council resolution to disrupt the flows of finance to ISIL  to sanction those who are seeking to recruit to ISIL and to encourage countries to do all they can to prevent foreign fighters joining the extremist cause.What about the role of our military? I do not believe that the treat of Islamist extremism will best be solved by Western ground troops directly trying to pacify or reconstruct Middle Eastern or African countries. But  pursuing an intelligent and comprehensive approach should include a place for our military. Our military can support the enormous humanitarian efforts that are necessary  as our Royal Air Force did in helping the millions of people who fled from ISIL. We should  together  do more to build the capability of the legitimate authorities that are fighting the extremists. That can mean training  equipping and advising  and providing technology and the other assets necessary for success. Whether it is supporting action against Boko Haram in Nigeria  against Al-Shabaab in Somalia  against Ansar al-Sharia in Libya  or against Al-Qaida in Yemen  it is right to help those who are fighting on the front line for their societies  their countries and their freedom.Along with our European partners  we have already been supplying equipment directly to Kurdish forces. We are strengthening the resilience of the military forces in neighbouring Lebanon and Jordan  and British Tornado and surveillance aircraft have already been helping with intelligence gathering and logistics support to help those taking on ISIL in Iraq.We now have a substantial international coalition in place  including Arab nations  committed to confronting and defeating ISIL. We have a comprehensive strategy to do that  with the political  diplomatic  humanitarian and military components that are needed to succeed over time. The Security Council has now received a clear request from the Iraqi Government to support it in its military action against ISIL. So we have a clear basis in international law for action  and we have a need to act in our own national interest to protect our people and our society. It is right that Britain should now move to a new phase of action. I am therefore recalling the British Parliament on Friday to secure approval for the United Kingdom to take part in international air strikes against ISIL in Iraq.My message today is simple. We are facing an evil against which the whole world should unite. As ever  in the cause of freedom  democracy and justice  Britain will play its part."
"62",2580,"GEO",69,2014,"It is a great honour for me to represent my country here at the United Nations. In recent years  the world has witnessed Georgia’s unwavering transformation to freedom  democracy and economic development. We have experienced tremendous advances  and occasional challenges  on our journey to a fuller and more open democracy. We are a vastly stronger nation than we were 20 years ago  and we are a much stronger nation than we were just two years ago. While we have made significant progress in a few short years  we are still a young democracy  and much remains to be done.I am fortunate to be part of a new generation of Georgians who grew up in the years following the Cold War. My entire life is one of being part of remarkable change. Our tremendous progress is due to the commitment of the Georgian people to democratic values and their embrace of international cooperation. Because our democratic transformation has been so hard  we do not take anything for granted. To paraphrase President Kennedy: we do not do these things because they are easy  we do them because they are hard. During difficult times  the Georgian people took to the streets in peaceful protest and made their voices heard at the ballot box to ensure that our democratic path continued. I want to express my sincere admiration for the people of Georgia and for their energy and commitment to securing our democratic progress.I would also like to express my gratitude to the international community  our partner countries represented in this Hall and international organizations  especially the United Nations  for supporting Georgia and listening to the Georgian people. Despite all the challenges that we have faced  the citizens of Georgia are full of hope. The support from the international community and international organizations continues to play a crucial role in Georgia’s progress. On behalf of the people of Georgia  we thank them. Georgia’s success is their success. Georgia’s journey is a testament to the good work done by the United Nations and our international partners.In the past two years  we have taken concrete steps to break the vicious cycle of Government corruption  impunity and an economy that benefited only a few. We have created a true democracy with a system of governance that is more open  more transparent and more accountable and that upholds the rule of law. We have established a social compact that rewards work and enterprise  while offering support for those in need.As recognized by various international organizations  the Georgia of today is another world compared to that of two decades ago  or even just two years ago. Every sector of our country has advanced dramatically  from health care and education to the economy and the rule of law. We are now at the dawn of a new day for Georgia. Our democratic institutions are stronger. Our foreign policy is making us more secure. Our growing economy is working to benefit all Georgians.We are strengthening and consolidating Georgia’s democracy. The parliamentary  presidential and municipal elections held in Georgia during this two-year period are truly something to celebrate. Because Georgia’s democracy was hard-won  there is no going back. The Georgian people will hold the Government accountable at the ballot box. My Government must earn every vote by serving the people faithfully and by achieving progress for the country.We are strengthening democratic institutions and establishing stronger checks and balances. Our new Constitution decentralizes executive power and creates greater accountability at all levels of Government. Our Parliament now functions as a true legislature. Laws are proposed  debated and amended. Committees hold hearings and question ministers. The old rubber stamp has been thrown away. We now guarantee the protection of human rights through a new human rights strategy and action plan. In addition  we are equally proud to have enacted a new anti-discrimination law that extends the protection of human rights to all Georgian citizens.We have restored the rule of law by establishing an independent judiciary and by instituting more rights for defendants. We have ended impunity by Government officials and torture and abuse in our prisons. All Georgians are now equal before the law. No one is above the law. Everyone will have the benefit of a judicial process that meets the highest international standards.We are committed to building truly strong  independent and high-quality media. The media  like civil society  are essential to a strong democracy. While I may not always agree with what the media say or write  I will always fight to make sure that they have the right to the freedom of speech.Such reforms will benefit all citizens of my country. Our goal is to unify our society through the rule of law and democracy. Our commitment to aligning more closely with the United States and Europe goes hand in hand with our commitment to continued democratic transformation. The United States is a key strategic ally of Georgia. The relationship between our countries at all levels of Government has never been stronger.Increased Euro-Atlantic and European integration is our way of returning to the family of European nations  with whom we share a history  a culture and  most important  common values. Our new Association Agreement with the European Union and our steadfast movement towards NATO membership form the foundation for that relationship and provide an umbrella for greater engagement. As German Chancellor Angela Merkel said at this very rostrum  there is no development without security and no security without development (see A/65/PV.5). Our Association Agreement is the master plan for the gradual establishment of European political  economic  social and legislative norms and standards. My country has embarked on a demanding path of wide-ranging reforms. We will deliver on our commitments.I believe that Georgia’s democratic transformation can serve as a model for other countries in the region. Today  we pledge to share our experience with nations going through similar transitions. As we deepen our European and Euro-Atlantic integration  we are also becoming a truly open and globalized economy. We are making important investments and reforms to unlock the full potential of the Georgian economy and the Georgian people. From universal health care to investments in clean energy  Georgia is becoming a twenty-first-s we pursue those reforms  we seek to implement the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015. We have become a leader in sustainable development  taking the outcomes of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development seriously. We are ready to work together with the international community to define a post-2015 development agenda that is inclusive and people-centred. That agenda will address the need to achieve economic stability  sustained economic growth  the promotion of social equity and the protection of the environment. At the same time  we are committed to enhancing gender equality  women’s empowerment and equal employment for every Georgian.The future belongs to the next generation  so the protection and development of our children to achieve their full potential must be based on greater investment in their education.A top area of concern for Georgia is the issue of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees. There are hundreds of thousands of IDPs in Georgia as a result of Russia’s military aggression. Yet Georgia is still taking in refugees from other conflict-torn regions. Sadly  the sources of new refugees are increasing  not decreasing  especially in the light of current conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.We are also doing everything we can to help our friends in Ukraine by providing humanitarian assistance  political support  technical help — such as sending doctors and medicine — and serving as a safe refuge for children affected by the conflict. We are also helping them implement reforms and strengthen their democratic institutions. The ongoing developments in Ukraine tear at our hearts. We strongly support Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. We hope that the recent peace treaties will put an end to the military operations once and for all and mark the beginning of an irreversible peacemaking process.The international community has spoken with increasing support every year for the right of return by adopting the General Assembly resolution on the “Status of internally displaced persons and refugees from Abkhazia  Georgia  and the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia  Georgia”. It is essential that the General Assembly continue to retain this humanitarian issue on the agenda and support the rights of the forcibly displaced with strength and conviction.I should now like to address my brothers and sisters in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. I say to my dear brothers and sisters  I dream of the day when we shall all live together in peace and prosperity. We are committed to the path of reconciliation and restoring Georgia’s full territorial integrity and sovereignty. We must work to find a way for them to participate in our success  including the benefits of our new European Union Association Agreement.I also call on the Russian Government to fulfil its obligations under the 2008 international ceasefire and join in the search for peace  prosperity and reconciliation. Our history and our values are a source of strength. When combined with our strategic location  this allows us to offer something unique to the world and serve as a driver of peace and security.Beyond our borders  we aim to contribute to global security as a supplier of security  not just a consumer. My country’s dedication to becoming a security contributor to the world is evident in our aspirations for European and Euro-Atlantic integration  which are the main pillars of Georgia’s foreign policy. Building on the achievements of the past two years  my country has made significant progress that reinforces our path to eventual NATO membership. The historic NATO Summit reaffirmed that Georgia will be a member of NATO in the future  and our people remain committed to this ultimate objective. As a result of the decisions taken at the Wales Summit  NATO will significantly increase Georgia’s integration and provide tangible cooperation initiatives that will increase Georgia’s capabilities and overall security.We are the largest non-NATO contributor to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF)  and we are committed to taking part in the post-ISAF mission. From the operation’s outset  our troops  including medical personnel  staff officers and training instructors  will be ready for deployment. We also plan to contribute to institution-building in Afghanistan.We stand with our allies in combating all forms of terrorism and organized crime  anywhere in the world.We are also proud to contribute to the European Union’s efforts under the Common Security and Defence Policy to build peace and security worldwide. In that context  as the second-largest participant  a Georgian battalion and a light infantry company have already started a mission under the EU-led operation in the Central African Republic.Our willingness to serve shoulder to shoulder with our allies is not the only way Georgia is serving as a global security provider. We are also taking a rational approach to reducing regional tensions and preventing conflict.Let me be clear  Georgia will never sacrifice its territorial integrity and sovereignty. However  we will continue to look for pathways to reconciliation with our brothers and sisters in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.We Georgians want a good relationship with Russia  but never at the expense of our sovereignty and independence  which we fought so hard to achieve. To that end  we are pursuing a new approach  different from that of our predecessors  in dealing with Russia. We are pursuing a two-track engagement strategy based on our being a responsible  pragmatic and constructive neighbour. On the first track  we started an unconditional dialogue with Russia on the resumption of trade  economic  cultural and humanitarian relations. On the second track  we have continued to seek a peaceful settlement of the August 2008 war and the end of Russian occupation of Georgian territory  based on the fundamental principles of international law.The first track has produced significant results and has helped reduce tensions between Georgia and Russia. Trade has reopened and Georgian exports to Russia have increased over 300 per cent. People-to-people exchanges have also increased dramatically. We are coexisting more calmly as neighbours. This approach has also increased stability in the entire South Caucasus region.However  Georgia’s efforts to reduce tensions and extend an olive branch to Russia have not been met with the same spirit of cooperation. We have taken every constructive step. Now it is time for the Russian Government to stop the occupation and start on a path to lasting peace.My country is committed to using its strategic location to connect Asia  Europe and the Middle East  thereby expanding trade from one end of Eurasia to the other. The reopening of the Silk Road is one of the greatest achievements brought about by the end of the Cold War. The Silk Road region accounts for two thirds of the world’s population and 60 per cent of its gross domestic product. If its potential is fully tapped  it will become a key force for the expansion of trade  the development of new energy resources and supply chains and the promotion of cultural exchanges. To fully unlock that potential  the international community must redouble its efforts in three key areas: trade and transport  energy  and people-to-people contacts.We have deepened cooperation with Turkey  China  Kazakhstan  Azerbaijan  Armenia  Turkmenistan  Uzbekistan and Afghanistan to integrate transportation corridors and open new routes that will bring goods from Asia to Western Europe in record time. Energy resources are a key driver of Silk Road economic development and integration.We support a key route for Caspian Sea oil and gas to travel to Europe. Last year  the Shah Deniz Consortium announced a massive expansion of the South Caucasus Pipeline through Azerbaijan and Georgia  which will bring 16 billion cubic metres of new natural gas to Europe and Turkey and thousands of new jobs to Georgia. Several days ago  I was in Azerbaijan to break ground and lay the first segment of that new pipeline. The expansion will lead to approximately $2 billion in new investment by the Consortium in Georgia alone. Of course  that will result in Georgia receiving significant quantities of natural gas to improve our economic development and security.Clean  renewable energy can also be a driver for regional energy cooperation. In Georgia  we are utilizing our massive hydropower resources to become a carbon-neutral country and to export renewable energy to our neighbours. The potential of the region is great  but more is needed to turn such potential into reality. Georgia is ready to use its location as a strategic crossroads and to do its part to fully revitalize the Silk Road. To that end  I intend to establish a Silk Road forum in 2015  and in Georgia we plan to launch an annual high-level meeting of all States and international organizations that are interested in the future of the Silk Road. The forum will discover new ideas for enhancing cooperation in the fields of transport  energy  trade and people-to-people contacts across the Silk Road. The forum will move beyond discussion to action.In conclusion  let me reaffirm that I am so very confident that our best years are ahead of us  and that our worst are now part of history. I am confident that Georgians have come together to move our nation forward and to fulfil the promise of a strong  independent and free  great Georgian nation. Working together  there is no limit on what Georgia  the region and the world can achieve. I look forward to seeing many present here today in Tbilisi."
"63",2627,"GHA",69,2014,"Change has become an overriding theme in the language of today`s social and political landscape. We speak of the need to change behaviours  attitudes and laws. We speak of the need to effect change in the areas of human rights and social justice  in education and health administration. We have come to understand the concept of change as a constant in our lives as human beings and as citizens of this world. But the question we are asking is  does change automatically signify progress?There is an old saying with which I am sure everyone here is familiar: the more things change  the more they stay the same. Sometimes  when I find myself listening to reports of the many recent developments taking place in the world  that saying comes to mind again  and I am overcome with a strong sense of déjà vu  as though we had been here before.When I hear reports about the taking of hostages and the savagery of beheadings  it is 2004 all over again  and week after week there is news of the killing of foreign hostages in Iraq. When I hear reports about Israel and Gaza  it is 2005 all over again  and Israel has launched Operation Summer Rain  immediately followed by Operation Autumn Clouds. The resulting death toll in the Gaza Strip was in the hundreds  and many of the dead were children. Similarly  in the United States  reports of police brutality against an unarmed black man take me back to 1999  when 23-year-old Guinea-born Amadou Diallo was shot 19 times by four New York City police officers  or to 1991  when Rodney King was brutally beaten by five Los Angeles police officers. Both of those incidents caused a tremendous public outcry  as did this year’s shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson  Missouri  with the singular message of “no justice  no peace”.Do such events indicate an outright regression? Does the uncomfortable familiarity of some current world events mean that  despite the changes so many individuals and organizations have worked to achieve  we have made little or no progress? I would like to believe that this is not so. I would like to believe those events of recent times are merely setbacks that will motivate us to find more sustainable solutions; they are just slight reversals on the sinuous path toward true progress.Dag Hammarskjöld  who served as the second Secretary-General of the United Nations  from 1953 until his untimely death in a plane crash in 1961  said “The pursuit of peace and progress cannot end in a few years in either victory or defeat. The pursuit of peace and progress  with its trials and its errors  its successes and its setbacks  can never be relaxed and never abandoned.”In the course of the past several months  since the beginning of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa  I have been reminded of both the importance and the practicality of those words. True progress relies on neither victory nor defeat; true progress relies on persistence  on perseverance. Just last week  on Monday  in my capacity as the Chair of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  I travelled to Liberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea — the three countries that have been most affected by the outbreak of Ebola. They are nations that are recovering from conflict. The civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone also adversely affected Guinea  which shares borders with both countries. They are nations that were struggling to rebuild their social and economic infrastructure. Even before the outbreak of Ebola  they were already operating with limited resources  an insufficient number of treatment facilities and a shortage of qualified medical personnel.So far  there have been 5 843 recorded cases of Ebola  including 2 803 deaths. The World Health Organization predicts that if the disease is not brought under control  the number of cases could easily rise to 20 000 by as early as November. What makes Ebola so dangerous is that the virus dares us to compromise the impulses that exist at the very core of our humanity — our impulse to comfort one another with love  to care for each other with the healing power of touch and to maintain the dignity of our loved ones even in death  with a public funeral and a properly marked grave.Ebola is a disease of isolation. It leaves family members afraid to embrace one another. It leaves health-care workers afraid to attend to their patients. It forces the living to abandon the cultural rites of washing  embalming and burying their dead. Instead  the dead are zipped into a secure body bag  carried on a stretcher by makeshift pallbearers in protective wear  and then tossed into a freshly dug grave.Just as individuals with Ebola are often shunned and ostracized by their communities  the initial slowness of response by the international community in many ways has left the affected countries to suffer their fate alone and in isolation. In my travels to those three countries  although I was aware that some airlines had suspended flights  I was shocked to find the airports completely vacant. Ebola is not just a Liberian problem  nor is it a Sierra Leonean or Guinean problem; it is not just a West African problem. Ebola is a problem that belongs to the world because it is a disease that knows no boundaries.We cannot afford to let fear keep us away or to let it compromise the very impulses that not only define but sustain our humanity. We must erase the stigma. To that end  my country  Ghana  has offered the use of its capital city  Accra  as a base of operations for activities geared towards the containment of the disease. I would like to commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the Security Council for establishing the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response. I would also like to acknowledge and commend President Barack Obama and the people of the United States of America for their enormous commitment to the fight against Ebola.Health officials have announced numerous times that in theory  it is relatively easy to stop the spread of Ebola because it is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids. It has been suggested that through changes in our behaviour and practices the public could potentially reduce  if not eliminate  their exposure to the virus. Yet in reality  the Ebola virus was able to spread so quickly throughout the West African subregion because of the fluidity of our borders.The free movement of people  goods and services throughout the West African subregion is something that ECOWAS has been promoting for the last several decades. It allows interaction and increased trade between our 15 member States. However  without the proper preventive measures in place  such fluidity can also enable the free movement of disease  drugs  arms  human traffickers and terrorists.Unfortunately. Africa is especially vulnerable to terrorism because its sheer size and vast terrain offers myriad places for terrorists to hide and create safe havens. With over 60 per cent of Africa’s population under the age of 35 and a significant number living in extreme poverty  terrorists also have the opportunity to recruit new members by exploiting the ignorance and disillusionment of young people who lack the skills  education and opportunity to find gainful employment.The proliferation of technology has made even the most remote areas of the continent accessible through a phone call or keystroke. What that does is facilitate communication within terrorist cells and between terrorist organizations. It would now be far too simplistic  not to mention myopic  for a nation to believe that it is dealing with any one terrorist organization  such as Boko Haram  Al-Shabaab. Ansar Al-Dine  Al-Qaida  Hizbullah  the Taliban  the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant or  recently  the Khorasan group. Because of the assistance and cooperation that exist among them  they have in fact become different tentacles of a single organism. So too must we come together as one cohesive body  united in our battle to defend our freedoms and values. We too must communicate within and among ourselves. We must cooperate and lend assistance and resources to fight and conquer the common threat we face.Since the start of the global recession  economic growth rates have generally declined and people have  by and large  become pessimistic about their future. This month  the Pew Research Center published the results of a 44-country survey conducted in the spring of 2014 to assess public views of major economic changes in the world. According to the results  a global median of 69 per cent are not pleased with the way things are going in their countries. That includes both advanced and developing economies. The concerns expressed cut across a wide spectrum of issues  such as inflation  unemployment  income inequality and public debt.My country  Ghana  is no exception. Over the past year  the public has seen an increase in the cost of living. Falling commodity prices led not only to a fall in tax revenues from companies that operate in Ghana  but they also led to a massive decline in our export earnings. That contributed to a general sense of macroeconomic instability and placed a great deal of pressure on our domestic currency  the cedi.For the past 22 years  Ghanaians have witnessed a steady improvement in the circumstances of our nation. With the return of democracy and the rule of law  six successful elections and peaceful transitions of power  Ghana became an example for other African nations turning towards democracy and constitutional rule. The stability inspired investor confidence and increased growth. Soon Ghana was deemed one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.That did not make us immune to the economic challenges that many nations were facing across the globe — quite the opposite. Instability in the global commodity markets has a direct bearing on our budgets and hence on our ability to finance our development. The global downturn exposed the weaknesses in our foundation. It alerted us to the need for change  the need to establish the proper institutions for effective economic management  institutions that will foster resilience and an ability to better absorb the blows of unexpected occurrences or outcomes.The anxieties and concerns of the Ghanaian public are understandable. Like so many African countries  Ghana has been through dark economic times  and our seemingly changing fortunes  with their uncomfortable familiarity  brought on a fear of regression. But this was merely a setback  only a slight reversal. Already  the home-grown measures of fiscal stabilization that we have taken are yielding results. Only this month  Ghana surprised its most ardent critics when it launched its third Eurobond for an amount of $1 billion. That successful flotation represents a return of investor confidence in the prospects of the Ghanaian economy. That confidence is apparent in the recent rebound of our domestic currency  the cedi  which in the last two weeks has appreciated significantly against its major trading currencies.Last year when I addressed the Assembly (see A/68/PV.12)  I explained that it is not sympathy we want in Africa; it is partnership  the ability to stand on our own feet. In an attempt to establish such a partnership  we have entered into discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  an organization that is no stranger to the process of self-assessment and the implementation of change in the pursuit of true progress. Indeed  both Ghana and the IMF have evolved  and the partnership has the potential to bring about the sort of transformation that will move Ghana from the ranks of the low middle-income countries into a fully fledged middle-income country.The coming year will mark the twentieth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women  which was held in Beijing in 1995. I would like to note with pride that it will also mark the fortieth anniversary of Ghana’s establishment of the National Council on Women and Development  which has since been renamed the Department of Gender. Ghana has a long-held commitment to the betterment of women’s lives  and my Administration has made it a priority to carry on with that tradition. In fact  much  if not all  of what we are doing falls directly in line with the areas of concern enumerated in the Beijing Platform for Action of the World Conference. My Administration boasts one of the highest number of women appointed to public office in the history of Ghana. Seven of our Cabinet ministers are women  as are the holders of several senior public service posts  and I hope that the fact that they are too numerous to list is an indication that we are reaching towards the ideal.We have submitted to Parliament an intestate succession bill  which ensures that if a spouse dies without having written a will  the surviving spouse will not be dispossessed of their marital assets. We have also submitted to Parliament a bill on the property rights of spouses  which ensures that spouses are entitled to a fair portion of property acquired during the union. There area also several other pieces of legislation designed to offer protection for and empowerment of women  such as the Domestic Violence Act  the Anti-Human-Trafficking Act  an affirmative action bill and a gender policy.I spoke earlier of isolation. Very few nations have experienced the sort of exclusion that Cuba has suffered for the last several decades as a result of the United States embargo on that country. Ghana reaffirms its position that this embargo should be lifted. Ghana also calls for a halt to the establishment of settlements in the Palestinian territories. We have consistently expressed our support for a two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian question  with the two nations coexisting peacefully.This year the world’s attention has been drawn to the urgency of addressing the growing problem of inequality and the threats that it poses to our unrelenting pursuit of peace. I would also like to draw attention to the pervasive presence of religious intolerance. At the root of all of the world’s major religions is the call for compassion  forgiveness  tolerance  peace and love. Nevertheless  the use of religious dogma and extremism as a weapon of violence persists.In this age of terrorism and political turmoil  of national  regional and ethnic conflict  it may be tempting to use the actions of a few to justify prejudice toward many. It may be tempting to combine the faithful with the fanatical. But those of us who envision a just and peaceful world cannot  and should not  yield to those temptations. Time and time again  history has shown us that the changing of a world begins with the power that rests in the hands of the people  ordinary individuals. Or  in the words of one of the greatest teachers and leaders of non-violence  Mahatma Gandhi  “You must be the change you wish to see in the world’’.Today our Jewish brothers and sisters are celebrating Rosh Hashanah  their New Year. To them  I say  “L’shana Tova.” Next week  our Muslim brothers and sisters will be celebrating Eid al-Adha  the Festival of the Sacrifice. To them  I say  “Eid Mubarak.” And  to you  Mr. President  I say  “Many thanks for the opportunity and for your kind attention”."
"64",2673,"GIN",69,2014,"Fourteen years ago  in this very Hall  the international community  in a promising move  pledged to attain a series of common goals by 2015  essentially  to eradicate poverty and achieve a prosperous and shared world in a secure environment. Now  one year before that deadline  we must recognize that humankind has not been able to create all the conditions necessary for the development we aspire to. The very foundations of our Organization are likely to be shaken if steps are not taken to deal with the immense challenges facing us.Poverty always goes hand in hand with major pandemics  undermining any glimmer of hope for the decent life to which our people are entitled. Humankind’s aggressiveness towards the environment pushes it out of the balance that is essential for its growth and for sustainable development. Fundamental rights are still being trampled on  opening the door to intolerance  frustrations and social crises. Peace and security are faltering in many countries  threatening more than ever the stability of our planet. It is clear that only a comprehensive and cooperative approach will lead us to a society free of the defects that prevent true progress.In congratulating the President of the Assembly on his election  we would like to state that he is without a doubt contributing to the momentum for a new global partnership  which we have all been hoping for and which is so crucial. Today  we wish to assure him that we will provide him with the same kind of unfailing support that we provided to his predecessor  Ambassador John Ashe  to whom we pay tribute for his leadership in seeking solutions to our issues of concern. I must address the issue of the serious health and humanitarian crisis that Sierra Leone  Liberia and Guinea are currently facing. As members know  the Ebola virus  a disease characterized by haemorrhagic fever  continues to threaten international security. Since its most recent appearance in March 2014  it has caused over 2 500 deaths and continues to cause victims. Health-care workers have not been spared.Faced with the spread of the epidemic  an extraordinary summit of heads of State and Government of the Mano River Union was held in Conakry on 1 August. The summit adopted a common strategy for fighting the disease and made an urgent appeal to the international community for a coordinated global response. At the national level  my Government declared a health emergency on 13 August. The quarantine line was reinforced by the establishment of compulsory medical checks at all border crossings and crossing places in the country  in particular airports and ports.The negative impact of the Ebola virus on the country’s economy can be seen in the decrease in trade  productivity and activity in the transport  investment and tourism sectors. To date  Guinea has suffered a loss of nearly 2.5 per cent in the growth forecast for gross domestic product. That loss could increase if adequate measures are not taken in time to stem the epidemic. There have been other adverse consequences for the affected countries  in particular in terms of borders being closed  the free movement of persons hindered  flights cancelled and nationals of the States affected by the disease stigmatized.The Ebola epidemic reminds us of the urgent need for a comprehensive approach to contain and defeat this terrible disease. We must isolate Ebola  not countries. We must counter the irrational panic that has gripped the world. Ebola is a very serious epidemic  but it is not a death sentence. Ebola can be cured.We therefore welcome the fact that several African Heads of State have joined President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita of Mali and the King of Morocco  to whom I pay tribute  and France and England  as President Alassane Ouattara of Côte d’Ivoire  President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea  President Denis Sassou Nguesso of the Republic of Congo and President Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon have decided to lift the ban on flights and the use of airports. I thank them.In my capacity as Acting Chair of the Mano River Union  I would like to welcome the appointment of the United Nations System Senior Coordinator for Ebola Virus Disease and pay tribute to the work of the World Health Organization  the United States Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta  Médecins sans Frontières  the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and other bilateral and multilateral partners who are sparing no effort to support coordinated action by the affected countries to eradicate the Ebola virus.My Government welcomes with genuine satisfaction Security Council resolution 2177 (2014)  which was co-sponsored by 134 Member States and adopted unanimously by the members of the Council  and resolution 69/1  on the establishment of a United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response. I welcome the spirit of solidarity that continues to be shown to the countries affected by the epidemic and express our gratitude to all States and organizations that have assisted us. I thank in particular President Obama  President François Hollande and the Secretary-General for their support and their call to action to all the countries of the world.Our countries have urgent needs that must be met to further boost our efforts to fight effectively against Ebola. Those needs are in a variety of areas  including strengthening our infrastructure and health systems and increasing the number of health-care workers and financial  material and logistical support  as the gaps in those areas inhibit our efforts. Promises are nice  but there is an urgent need for action on the ground. The faster we act  the better chance we have of stopping the disease.Sustainable development remains the cornerstone of the harmonious development of humankind. The international community has an obligation to end the poverty that still grips almost 2 billion people  most of whom live in Africa. Beyond the economic and social concerns  it is a matter of human dignity. It is a matter of justice and fairness. We therefore do not have the right to back off  much less to give up.Certainly  progress has been made  if unevenly  towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Illiteracy has been pushed back  although efforts are still needed to achieve the quality and equality required in the pursuit of knowledge. The essential role of women in transforming society has been further enhanced. However  family health and access to water  basic health care and social protection deserve further investment and political commitment. Worse  the digital divide has been slow to show any improvement  for lack of an adequate policy of ownership or transfers of science and new technologies. However  encouraging results have been achieved in the fight against malaria and HIV/AIDS despite the spectre of the disease  which still haunts the lives of millions of people who do not have access to antiretroviral medicine.The many challenges facing our world require an urgent  comprehensive and coordinated response. In the collective quest for well-being  Africa in particular has seen renewed growth  but it is having difficulty in translating that growth into a true engine for development. Eradicating poverty is an uphill battle. The new Africa that we aspire to should promote structural changes that enable it to acquire robust and diversified economies so as to guarantee reinvestment in value-added and environmentally friendly industries in future.In that context  the Climate Summit held on the sidelines of the current session has provided hope that a binding agreement will be adopted at the international conference to be held in Paris in 2015. It goes without saying that those measures will build on the foundation of a vibrant private sector that is underpinned by strong institutions that guarantee good governance  which is itself the crucible of inclusive development.That is why  despite the backdrop of a relentless systemic crisis and the scarcity of external resources because of unfulfilled commitments  Africa will be able to enter into the international system  gain confidence and increase intra-African trade to influence the flow of world trade. That is also why our continent will  relying primarily on its own strength — and that is extremely important — be able to become less vulnerable and build resilience through coherent strategies and the search for innovative financing to accelerate its full potential.Recognizing all those challenges  Guinea has made a decisive commitment to promoting democracy and the rule of law  which are the foundation for sustainable development. In doing so  since our assumption of the country’s leadership in 2010 we have taken measures that affect all areas of our national life. The reform of the defence and security sector ensures that our armed forces are at the service of the Republic and increases their participation in the development process and in peacekeeping in the world. The independence of the judiciary is now ensured. Our stabilized and competitive macroeconomic framework strengthens Guinea’s credibility at the international level.Guinea has been admitted to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and today has one of the most attractive mining codes. Even better  the review of all contracts allows us to make the environment safer for investors and ensures a development process that benefits Guineans while preserving our ecosystem.Of course  the development of the mining sector will rely on promoting agriculture to ensure our food security and to pass on to future generations the resources needed to shape to the world they hope for. The growth we aspire to will be even more promising as it creates decent jobs for our youth and empowers women — two sectors of society that constitute the rich and inexhaustible source of all progress.Our unquenchable desire to ensure the well-being of our people can be fulfilled only in a stable environment that is free from crises and conflicts. Multilateralism  which is the only way to realize our goals  is imperative  since our States  whether big or small  strong or weak  are determined to contribute to building a more just and equitable global society within a reformed United Nations that is responsive to the needs of humanity. In that context  Africa  the continent that is the most affected  will shoulder its responsibilities by pooling its efforts through greater regional integration  which is an essential element of a global partnership leading to a more dynamic and pragmatic peace.That is why we must be more involved in the struggle against terrorism  extremism and intolerance and the illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons  which fuel cross-border crime and maritime insecurity — the numerous scourges that hinder development. The time has come to be the true builders of our destiny. The rule of law  respect for all human rights and good governance remain intangible realities that we must promote. Likewise  the implementation of the African Peace and Security Architecture and the ability of Africa to respond quickly to crises will strengthen our credibility with regard to stabilizing the continent.I should like to stress in particular the unacceptable suffering that our Palestinian brothers are experiencing. Guinea has always clearly and unambiguously expressed its unconditional solidarity with the just Palestinian cause and firmly condemns the heinous acts committed by Israel in the Gaza Strip  which is now suffering under the yoke of a cruel and vile embargo. My country remains convinced that any viable and lasting solution to the situation in the Middle East hinges on the creation of two States living side by side within secure and internationally recognized borders  based on the pre-1967 borders.We will soon have the opportunity to take stock of the Millennium Development Goals. On the eve of that meeting and bearing in mind that we decided  at our sixty-eighth session  to set the stage for the sustainable development goals  it is clear that the implementation of those legitimate goals remains dependent both on the appropriate means for its implementation and on whether the priorities of poor countries  in particular African countries  are taken into account.That is why Guinea  which has a member on the Secretary-General’s High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda  calls for greater attention to be given to the African Common Position on the post-2015 development agenda. That is all the more relevant since  if Africa does well  the world will do better. The new Africa — more ambitious and more promising and aware of its human and economic potential — is now ready to assume its responsibilities.I again thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  who has devoted all his actions and energy into forging an adequate response on the part of the United Nations to all the challenges we face. He deserves our gratitude and respect. There is no doubt that his efforts will chart the course for the indispensable reform of the international system  so that the United Nations will be true to its original objectives of promoting peace and security and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in a world of democracy  equity and progress for all."
"65",2712,"GMB",69,2014,"Thanks be to the almighty Allah for giving me another opportunity to address this global body at a time when human civilization is teetering on the brink of a major catastrophe. Before going further  let me convey our warm felicitations to you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. While wishing you success  I would like to assure you of the support and cooperation of the Gambia during your tenure as President of the Assembly. I would also like to commend your predecessor  Mr. John William Ashe  for his able stewardship as President of the General Assembly.It is a well-known fact that injustice  iniquities  exclusion and greed all contribute to the creation of international tensions that can lead to catastrophic consequences  conflicts  wars  death and destruction. Today we witness lamentable inertia on the part of the United Nations  as powerful Member States take undue advantage of weaker Members; unjust economic and financial sanctions are imposed on other Member States; others are bullied and their natural resources looted; or wars are waged against still others  simply in the name of democracy  freedom and regime change. All of those actions are based on false pretences.That is not the scenario that the noble and distinguished gentlemen  the founders of the United Nations and its Charter  envisaged. What those great founding fathers of the United Nations intended over half a century ago was a world body committed to promoting the principles and ideals of peace and security and advancing the causes of justice and equality; freedom for all; and respect for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of States  rich or poor  black or white  big or small; and respect for the social  spiritual  religious and cultural values of all peoples. Therefore  in order to uphold the founding principles of the Charter of the United Nations  Member States must avoid the promotion of all forms of aggression  confrontation and dangerous tension by exercising maximal restraint in the pursuit of their individual or collective national interests at the expense of others. In fact  the pursuit of one’s interest at the expense of the legitimate interests and security of others is criminal.Invariably  when major tensions erupt into conflicts or wars  the world economy as a whole suffers  with major disruptions or reversals in the developing countries. That has been evident in the wake of past regional or international conflicts  when oil prices  for example  surged  with the developing countries bearing the brunt of the debilitating consequences. In short  the United Nations must be seen not as a prejudicial but rather as an all-embracing global body that stands for the interests of not only the few and the powerful but all its Member States.The Gambia acknowledges with satisfaction the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  entitled “The future we want” (resolution 66/288  annex)  and the resulting establishment of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals and associated consultative forums  including the African regional consultations on the sustainable development goals. While the Gambia appreciates the proposals of the Open Working Group on the post-2015 development framework  it is hoped that the goals and targets outlined thus far will reflect an integrated and transformative agenda that would ultimately build upon the gains made from the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in order to fully address the many difficult challenges that we face today.It is in that connection that we welcome the choice of the theme for this session  namely  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”. That theme is indeed pertinent and timely  as it gives fresh impetus to our ardent desire to identify a set of global priorities to steer the international development agenda  once the MDGs expire at the end of 2015. However  in launching that new initiative for transformative change  we must not allow novelty to mask any shortcomings of the MDGs experiment. There is a need to take stock of the achievements and failures of those Goals and indeed to renew support to those developing countries  particularly the least developed  landlocked and island developing countries  that may still have difficulties in meeting their critical MDG targets before the end of 2015.At a time when the world is facing multiple and complex challenges  there is a need to pay attention to the commanding role that the United Nations should be playing in advancing international peace and security  justice and the fundamental rights and freedoms of all peoples. The attainment of the post-2015 sustainable development goals will be elusive  unless the United Nations begins to execute its core mandate in earnest and exercises its commanding role in dealing with the host of local and international crises that are disruptive to development. A few current issues stand out on which the United Nations has yet to be seen to be playing a leading role.First  there is Ebola  a deadly haemorrhagic fever that has claimed more than 2 000 lives in West Africa  mostly in the severely affected countries of the Republics of Guinea  Sierra Leone and Liberia. The World Health Organization has warned that  if no major efforts are made immediately  more lives will be lost and the economies of those countries will come under serious strain. Already  the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have projected that  owing to disruptions in the labour force and productive sectors of the economies of those countries  declines in their respective economic growths could range from 1.5 to 3.5 percentage points  if current conditions remain unchecked.For those affected countries  all development efforts are now on hold as they grapple with that contagious and deadly disease. It is encouraging that the United States Government has committed  rather belatedly  some funds and military assets to curb the spread of that disease. That gesture is more than just humanitarian aid. It is also  as President Obama said  in the national security interest of the United States. That is true because in a globalized  interconnected world  infectious diseases can easily spread to any part of the world. It is for that reason that the United Nations should take the lead in mobilizing international support to fight Ebola  which is an evident danger not only to West Africa but to the world at large. On that note  we want to thank the Russian Federation for being one of the first major Powers to respond to the outbreak of deadly Ebola by providing scientific and medical teams to some of those countries as soon as the outbreak was announced.Secondly  for some time now  the world has been witnessing the bloodiest and most heinous form of terrorism  unleashed by satanic and sadistic human vermin disguised as Islamic militants  who are acting ostensibly in the name of Islamic purity. In reality  those sons of infamy and their shameless and deceitful claims of devotion to the peaceful and noble religion of Islam are  in fact  an insult not only to all true Muslims  but to our Prophet and humankind in general.Before the emergence of the mujahideen in Iran and later in Afghanistan in the 1980s  which was a movement subsequently associated with Islamic terrorism by the Western mainstream media in total disregard for its creation and sponsorship by the Western Powers to fight proxy wars against the Islamic revolution in Iran and the Soviets in Afghanistan  there existed no Islamic terrorism. Islam in its entire history has never been associated with violence or terrorism  as those activities are haram  or forbidden  for a Muslim. Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance and has nothing to do with the activities of those anti-Islamic bands of dangerous criminals  who spread nothing but deep-seated hatred for human life and whose sole intention is to desecrate and defame Islam.Consequently  those various treacherous hate groups cannot be associated with Islam  as our Islamic religion is pure and unique and cannot therefore be classified into varying degrees such as moderate Islam  democratic Islam  extreme Islam or violent Islam. Simply put  Islam is a pure religion that encourages the best of human behaviour and interpersonal relationships  among other virtues  as prescribed by Allah  the almighty creator. In other words  the adherents of those lunatic fringe groups of bandits and gangsters  such as Boko Haram  the Islamic State in Syria and Al-Qaida  are dangerous criminals and enemies of human civilization and development and should therefore be wiped off the face of the Earth  because we do not need them.Thirdly  the situation in the Middle East remains highly volatile  and the United Nations has been watching the cycle of violence in the region rather helplessly. In the most recent conflict between the Palestinians and Israelis  approximately 2 000 people from Gaza  mostly women and children  died at the hands of the Israeli army  and approximately 70 Israelis  all of them soldiers except for three children  lost their lives. The continuing expansion of Israeli settlements on Palestinian land  despite repeated calls for restraint by the international community  is unacceptable  as it undermines any prospects for a two-State solution. The United States Government has played a very strategic and useful mediating role in the past  but the United Nations must now take up its commanding role in seeking a peaceful settlement that is just  durable and acceptable to all the Members of the United Nations.Fourthly  as part of its core mandate in promoting global peace and security and greater understanding among peoples of different backgrounds and cultures  the United Nations must do more to advocate a culture of peace  tolerance and understanding  not only among the world’s great religions but also among Member States themselves. That is important  as we continue to witness a growing propagation of disinformation and misrepresentation  especially by the Western media  about Islam in general and the application of sharia law  particularly in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam  and sharia is the legal system in Islam and the only divine Constitution for not only the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia but all Islamic States. Therefore  the incessant criticisms and misrepresentations of the application of sharia law in Saudi Arabia or anywhere else are disrespectful and abhorrent. It is an insult to all true Muslims to describe sharia law as barbaric. As a matter of fact  the most barbaric laws are those that are not based on any divine teachings. Sharia is the legal system that the almighty Allah has prescribed for all Muslims  and we will apply it to the letter.In the same vein  the General Assembly should be commended for the designation  two years ago  of World Interfaith Harmony Week. It urged Member States to designate the first week of February each year as World Interfaith Harmony Week  when messages of goodwill and tolerance are spread through mosques  churches and other places of worship. While that was a good beginning for promoting peace and harmony among religions and peoples of different belief systems  the United Nations must do more to counter the continuing attacks on Islam  in particular by people who do not even believe in the existence of a supreme creator called Allah. Those infidels have no moral high ground to describe any religion — because they do not believe in God  and religion belongs to God — much less say anything about a religion as pure  authentic and noble as Islam.Finally  the United Nations must play its central role in addressing the injustices associated with the unilateral or bilateral application of economic and financial sanctions by one Member State against another as a coercive tool of foreign policy  because that contravenes the fundamental principles of international law  international humanitarian law and the principles and norms governing peaceful coexistence among sovereign States. In that regard  the Gambia calls on the United States Government to unconditionally end the long-standing United States embargo on Cuba  which has brought about untold hardship for the Cuban people. Is it not ironic that the Power talking today about respecting Ukrainian sovereignty and freedom to choose their own way of life is the same Power that has maintained a system of unjustifiable collective punishment against the Cuban people for almost five decades  thereby devastating their economy  simply because  just as the Ukrainians today  Cubans decades ago opted for a system of governance of their choice?That brings me to the subject of climate change. Climate change and development are inextricably linked. The impact of climate change is felt in all countries  particularly developing countries  as it undermines their ability to achieve sustainable development. While Africa is not responsible for the pollution and the other factors causing climate change  it stands to suffer the most. With 96 per cent of Africa’s agriculture being dependent on rainfall and 50 per cent of the fisheries-related jobs estimated to be lost by 2050  climate change poses dire consequences for livelihoods in Africa. The Gambia firmly believes that mitigating the adverse effects of climate change requires a timely and decisive global response. It is a challenge that should unite us  not divide us. In that regard  the Gambia joins other countries affected by climate change and like-minded groups in urging the developed countries that are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to fully implement their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.In 1974  the Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order (resolution 3201 (S-VI))  which was designed to address some legitimate concerns of developing countries  such as improving their terms of trade and other issues relating to the promotion of a more equitable international economic system. Many of the political  economic and social issues that inspired the new international economic order still remain unresolved  four decades after that historic declaration. As the post-2015 agenda attracts our attention today  we must not relegate those old concerns of developing countries to the dustbin of history. In a nutshell  their old concerns  as well as their new aspirations  must no longer be set aside. To that end  the foundation of any transformative agenda should logically begin with genuine reform of the global governance institutions  particularly the United Nations system.Given the current membership of the Security Council  the reform of that important organ of the world body is long overdue. We African leaders have for a very long time been calling attention to the need to restore the effectiveness and legitimacy of the United Nations by allocating two permanent Seats with full veto powers  as well as two non-permanent seats on the Security Council to reflect current geopolitical realities.If the demands for the reform of the Security Council in the interest of equity and justice cannot be accommodated  then concrete action must be taken for the General Assembly to assume all the powers of the Security Council and its responsibilities  including the power to impose sanctions. Under such an arrangement  all decisions of the General Assembly would have to be voted for by all Members and endorsed by the majority of its membership  thus ensuring a more democratic and transparent global body called the United Nations.On a final note  I want to call the attention of the General Assembly and the Security Council to the very frequent and mysterious sinking and capsizing of boats carrying mostly black African migrants looking for greener pastures in the West  only to end up in body bags on European shores. Strangely enough  those countries  which pretend to love Africans so much that they are always preaching to African leaders about good governance  the rule of law and respect for human life and rights  have been eerily quiet about the very dangerous  racist and inhuman behaviour of deliberately causing boats carrying black Africans to sink  selecting only a few lucky ones to be rescued and sent to concentration camps  called asylum-seeker camps. Those camps are as bad as Nazi concentration camps  and nobody  no country or human rights institution in the West has ever raised the alarm to that sort of genocide in the twenty-first century.If earlier Africans who received the European explorers before colonialism had treated them the same way  Africa would not have been colonized for 400 years. The European explorers were nothing short of people seeking greener pastures for their fellow Europeans  as Europe had  at the time  turned into brown pastures. After 400 years of colonial looting and misrule in Africa  Africa today is reduced from green to brown pastures  owing to overgrazing. Now African explorers are not only unwelcome  but are greeted with instant death on European soil. That is unacceptable.The United Nations must therefore conduct a full and impartial investigation into that man-made catastrophe  namely  the sinking or capsizing of boats carrying young Africans to Europe. If those boats are able to cross the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea  only to sink on European coasts  we must find out what deadly mysterious force exists on the European Mediterranean coasts that causes boats carrying young Africans to disintegrate and sink upon arrival. Racism  greed and hatred can only breed hatred  violence and disastrous confrontation between races. We African leaders should stand up together  I hope  to protect those young Africans from mass murder on European coasts. I hereby call on the United Nations to commission such an investigation as a matter of priority and urgency in order to avert a major racial confrontation. We have the right as Africans to defend our black people  wherever they are. As we welcomed all races to Africa  we will not accept that Africans should be treated like dogs  with impunity. That is unacceptable. If the United Nations fails to take action  we will take action. And the action we take will be determined by us.In the Gambia we do not attack people because they are white or black  or because of their religion. No foreigner in the Gambia would say  “I was attacked because I am a foreigner”. If a foreigner comes into contact with the police  it is because he has committed an offence for which even a Gambian would be arrested. If we cannot tolerate each other  the world will never see peace  because nobody can stop migration. The Almighty Allah created this world for us to move around  the same way Europeans moved around when Europe was bankrupt. Europeans came to Africa for 400 years. We never killed them. They overstayed  and some of us had to fight to get them out. Now they have overgrazed our land. We also want greener pastures  but Europeans cannot accept us. Let them send Africans back  but do not kill them. Europeans have no right to kill them.Out of the hundreds of European explorers who came to the Gambia in those days  only one European died on the River Gambia over a span of 400 years. Today  over a span of five years  more than 500 Gambians have lost their lives on European coasts. That is unacceptable. Enough is enough  and the United Nations must intervene  and intervene quickly  or else we will all live to regret our failure to take appropriate action at the right time.Geopolitical realities have changed. Let the West accept that  and with us endeavour to change along with those realities  as we move together towards the peaceful  brighter future we want. The so-called military super-Powers must know that humankind would be sent back to a pre-Stone Age should they be reckless enough to unleash World War III.We cannot have our cake  eat it as we please  and at the same time dictate to others how  when and where they should eat theirs. In the twenty-first century  humankind has a need only for super-Powers of peace and development  not for mediaeval European-style warmongers. Why can we not accept the diversity of the human race and its attendant diversity in cultures  religions and ways of life as each of its diverse groups deems fit?"
"66",2751,"GNB",69,2014,"On behalf of the President of the Republic  Mr. José Mário Vaz  and on my own behalf  and in the name of the State and people of Guinea-Bissau  I would like to congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. His election by this most representative institution of the international system is a tribute not only to his country  Uganda  but to the entire African continent. I welcome him and wish him success in guiding the work of the Assembly.We are grateful to the United Nations  and to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in particular  for the attention given to Guinea-Bissau and for the important contribution of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in our country to our political normalization process. We would also like to say a special word of appreciation to the former Special Representative of the Secretary-General  President Ramos-Horta  for his friendship with Guinea-Bissau and his dedication to his mission.We express our appreciation to and thank the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste  its Government and people. When they saw the need of their sister nation of Guinea-Bissau  they extended the hand of friendship and provided valuable and extraordinary support to our country in dealing with our crisis  for which the entire nation of Guinea-Bissau is grateful.The subregion contributed financial support in helping our Government to function  which has been key in enabling us to reach the point where we find ourselves today. We would like to express our appreciation and acknowledgement to the forces of the Economic Community of West African States Mission (ECOWAS) in Guinea-Bissau  who carried out their mission with professionalism and ensured a peaceful and orderly transition. Similarly  we commend the efforts of all our national political actors and international partners to reach the consensus required to maintain an international stabilization force after the end of the Mission’s mandate.We would like to acknowledge and thank all the member countries of ECOWAS for their support  in particular my friend and brother President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria  who chaired the Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau and provided additional and valuable support to our country. I pray for peace and tranquillity for his country and for the welfare of his people. We are also deeply grateful to President Alpha Condé of Guinea  who mediated the crisis in Guinea-Bissau. Finally  we would like to express our profound acknowledgement and gratitude to all our international partners — the United Nations  the African Union  ECOWAS  the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries and its member States  the European Union  the West African Economic and Monetary Union and the International Organization of la Francophonie  whose support was important in monitoring and managing the political transition process  as well as in holding free  transparent and fair general elections in our country.I would also like to share with the Assembly that Guinea-Bissau’s society has renewed its hope in a new political cycle and to assure it that we possess the political will and deep commitment needed to consolidate political stability  revitalize and strengthen the State’s capacity and create the basic conditions that will enable our people to realize their dreams.Guinea-Bissau is a post-conflict State with fragile institutions and scarce financial resources  suffering from the severe political  economic  environmental and social consequences of our crisis. We therefore face a complex and difficult situation  in which we call on the international community for assistance  that will be essential if we are to stabilize our country in this post-election period and achieve our goals of strengthening the State’s institutional capacity  reducing our people’s poverty and vulnerabilities  ensuring social stability  legitimizing the Government  and relaunching our economy. That approach to international assistance  at the centre of our dialogue with our international partners  is based on the Government’s agenda  which includes three key programmes: Urgent  Contingency and Medium-Term Development.Under the Urgent Programme  we must ensure food safety and social stability through support for agricultural production and distribution  improve access to food and income for some sectors of the population  provide the population with basic health  education and water and power supply services  and pay civil servants’ overdue salaries. It also includes an emergency health action plan for preventing and responding to the threat of an Ebola epidemic. The Contingency Programme’s objective is essentially to ensure the transparency and accountability of all natural-resource concession and exploitation agreements and to end the nefarious procedures that allowed our country’s forestry and fishery resources to be plundered over the past two years. The Medium-Term Development Programme will be presented to our international partners at a donor conference to be held at the end of this year or early next  and for which we are requesting the essential support of the United Nations and all our multilateral and bilateral partners.As we embark on the challenge of rebuilding Guinea-Bissau anew  we are fully conscious of the problems but filled with a patriotic spirit of collective drive and unity joining all Bissau-Guineans and  in particular  all political actors and sovereign institutions  with full confidence in an inclusive Government that incorporates all political parties represented in our Parliament  as well as civil society and the diaspora. This confidence was significantly enhanced by our national Parliament’s recent unanimous approval of the Government’s programme  which is unprecedented in the history of our democracy.While it is true that the ongoing process of political stabilization and normalization of the democratic institutions in Guinea-Bissau depends on a major national effort  it will also require unequivocal and urgent support from our regional and international partners. We must structure and coordinate our actions based on the goals established in the Government’s programme in order to lay the foundations for our country to change course and become viable.In this context  three situations demonstrate how imperative it is for us to combine our efforts. The first is the ongoing process of defence and security sector reform  including extensive steps taken in recent days towards its reorganization. We need international support in order to make those steps sustainable and irreversible. The second is the extension of the State’s presence throughout the national territory in an effective and organized manner through decentralization and local elections. The Government will lay the foundations for the municipal administrations to become operational and will adopt the national territory organization policy. The third is the extremely complex task of combating drug trafficking and organized crime. Our country’s efforts will be successful only through a collective and objective approach.Guinea-Bissau needs a robust and impactful intervention from our development partners in order not only to consolidate the success of our political transition but also to lay the foundations for a transition to development. We request the reactivation of the International Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau under the auspices of the United Nations  for the purpose of monitoring the domestic situation in our country and supporting the mobilization of international aid  which is key for us to face the challenges in our future.The new authorities in Guinea-Bissau  our Parliament  the President of the Republic and our Government chose an inclusive dialogue and political coordination as the preferred tools in our efforts to consolidate political stability and create broad consensus around the main thrusts of governance. Therefore  in addition to strengthening the democratic legitimacy of our political institutions  we wish to take clear  unequivocal and decisive steps to build broad consensus on the main issues facing our society. They would be anchored in a political protocol that establishes the main areas of legislative and executive action  including issues related to reforming the State  revising the Constitution and rebuilding the economy. A sign of this power-sharing vision for the resolution of our main problems is the inclusion of the opposition leader in our delegation to the United Nations  in order to show the world that Guinea-Bissau has embarked on a path of harmony and stability.Our subregion  West Africa  is facing an Ebola epidemic  which directly threatens several members of ECOWAS  to which we belong. Allow me to offer Guinea-Bissau’s solidarity to our sister nations where cases of contamination have been identified. I would like to note our appreciation for the international efforts in providing urgent medical assistance and to call on the international community to step up its commitment and support in combating and preventing this epidemic. We also appeal for the establishment of an effective international coalition to confront this grave threat to international security  which was recently recognized as such by the Security Council.I reaffirm my country’s position on reforming the Security Council. The enlargement of this important United Nations body is required in order to enhance the legitimacy of its representation and to reflect the new international order under discussion. Therefore  and in accordance with the African Union’s position  Guinea-Bissau calls for the designation of two permanent seats with the right of veto and five non-permanent seats in the Security Council for the African continent. We also voice our support for the designation of permanent seats on the Security Council for Brazil  Japan  Germany and India.I would like to assure the peoples and countries that have fallen victim to international terrorism of our solidarity and to renew our Government’s commitment to combating this scourge within a framework of coordinated actions undertaken jointly with our regional and international partners  according to the specific nature of the actions.We note with concern that the economic and financial embargo imposed against Cuba more than 50 years ago constitutes a serious obstacle to that country’s economic and social development  and we reiterate our call for it to be lifted.We commend and encourage the United Nations  and in particular the Secretary-General  for their renewed efforts  vision and wisdom with regard to the issue of climate change and its effects on life on our planet. The Climate Summit held here on 23 September was an eloquent testament to this fact. The main areas that may allow for viable and sustainable development emerged and seem likely to gather the required consensus for the establishment of a post-Kyoto global climate regime designed to promote the well-being of all.Sustainable development goals  the new post-2015 global development paradigm  must be rooted in the peoples’ cultures and objective realities and must undoubtedly draw their inspiration from the lessons of the Millennium Development Goals.It should be noted that climate change is no longer simply a future threat; it has now become an unequivocal threat to the present. The rising incidence of climate change that exposes our vulnerabilities is now felt and has increasingly unpredictable consequences. Human  economic and environmental losses in a vulnerable country such as Guinea-Bissau are increasing and threaten our survival and development prospects.Sea-level rise may irreversibly affect coastal areas  including entire islands  villages  cities and other seaside settlements. This situation is particularly worrisome for our country  which  with its combination of coasts and archipelagos  is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate events and may see its efforts to combat poverty and achieve development goals compromised.Despite all the difficulties that have challenged Guinea-Bissau’s efforts to fulfil our international commitments holistically  we are pleased to note that 12 per cent of our national territory consists of protected areas  which should double by 2020. Unfortunately  most of the population in developing countries with forests  such as Guinea-Bissau  continues to depend on these natural resources as their only means of survival. Therefore  in order to offset the possible loss of those resources  technological and financial alternatives must be made available to this population.I conclude my statement by thanking the United Nations and expressing our deep appreciation for the significant role that the Peacebuilding Commission has played in supporting the consolidation of political and governance stability in Guinea-Bissau. I also recognize the United Nations bodies  including the United Nations Development Programme  UNICEF  the World Food Programme  the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  the United Nations Population Fund and the World Health Organization  as well as the grass-roots groups and non-governmental organizations working on a day-to-day basis with our Government in combating poverty and the vulnerabilities of our population and advocating respect for human dignity.The people of Guinea-Bissau look forward to the active engagement of those bodies in assisting in the new phase of our accelerated efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Guinea-Bissau is poised to transform its territory into an area of peace  security  and openness for all of those who  together with our people  wish to build a more brotherly  secure  welcoming and progress-oriented society with all peoples and cultures."
"67",2791,"GNQ",69,2014,"I bring with me to this session of the General Assembly greetings of peace  friendship and solidarity from the people of Equatorial Guinea and the full readiness of their Government to contribute to our common task of maintaining peace and stability throughout the world  and promoting the harmonious development of humankind.Allow me at the outset to congratulate you  Sir  on your brilliant election to preside over the work of this sixty-ninth ordinary session of the General Assembly. Your well-deserved election is justified by the policy of peace  respect for the principles of international law and the promotion of development advocated by your country  the Republic of Uganda. Indeed  your decision to devote this session of the General Assembly to the theme “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda” is testament to Uganda’s interest in overcoming the current problems of underdevelopment throughout the world.Equatorial Guinea recognizes the relevance and importance of the topics to be debated at the two high-level meetings proposed for 2015 — one in February  to consider ways of implementing the post-2015 development agenda  and the other in March  on gender equality and the empowerment of women.We also wish to convey our sincere appreciation and congratulations to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his outstanding work at the head of the global Organization in very difficult international circumstances marked by terrorism  piracy  mercenary activities and major epidemics affecting the world today. Indeed  this session of the General Assembly bears the heavy responsibility of finding solutions to the problems of the poverty and hunger prevalent throughout the world  violence and armed conflicts  terrorism  piracy and mercenary activity  and major epidemics  such as the recent Ebola epidemic that is now laying waste to some countries in Africa. Given Ebola’s deadly effects and the lack of adequate resources to combat it  on the occasion of the award of the second UNESCO Equatorial Guinea International Prize for Research in Life Sciences  the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea announced a donation of $2 million to the World Health Organization to finance programmes to combat Ebola.The United Nations will not be able to find solutions to these thorny problems unless the role of the General Assembly  which in recent years has grown routine  is strengthened and revitalized. The United Nations will never be able to find lasting solutions to these problems if the Security Council is not governed by rules that respect the spirit of democracy and international justice. Ultimately  the United Nations will not be able to find satisfactory solutions to these problems as long as the current system of the rule of force in international relations persists.The Republic of Equatorial Guinea is therefore very concerned by the proliferation of acts of intervention that do not respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States. These interventions interrupt the process of genuine democracy in the affected countries in that they ignore the essential characteristics and idiosyncracies of those societies  thereby further fuelling divisions and the sociopolitical instability of nations. We must distinguish clearly between support for a genuine internal democratic process and interference perpetrated through pressures that lead to misunderstandings  intolerance  exclusion  resentment  hatred among citizens and fratricidal wars.In Equatorial Guinea we say that democracy is not an imported product and cannot be designed in the offices of other countries. Democracy is shaped by the application of the positive values characterizing a society  and only the people are entitled to define the model that best suits them and to beat their own path towards their own development. With this as our vision  in 1982 the Republic of Equatorial Guinea adopted the theory of democratic experimentation  which gave our own citizens  through community councils  a hand in designing their own political development  the implementation of which has given rise to the current climate of peace  stability and economic prosperity through successive political reforms.The latest of these reforms is making Equatorial Guinea a modern democratic State in which popular participation and representational politics are ensured at the highest possible level. The transfer of power is guaranteed by equal rights for all political options. Public affairs are administered with the utmost transparency  accountability and responsibility  and human rights are protected and monitored by reliable institutions.In this spirit of ensuring the participation of all citizens of Equatorial Guineans in the management and administration of public affairs  our Government has extended an invitation to all political parties — those within the country and those in the diaspora alike — to attend a national dialogue that will be held in November as an opportunity to strengthen democracy in our country as a positive experience in our democratic experiment  which has yielded fruit since its inception in 1982.Concurrently with this political process  and thanks to the peace and political stability that we have achieved  our Government has undertaken economic initiatives to develop our natural resources and position Equatorial Guinea as an economically emerging country by 2020. On behalf of the people of Equatorial Guinea  I wish to thank those countries that have been cooperating with my Government in developing our economic and trade relations  in particular the United States of America  the People’s Republic of China  the Republic of Cuba  France  Brazil  Russia and Morocco.In conclusion  and with the fervent wish to see the United Nations recover its leading role in delivering peace  security and global development  I wish the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly every success."
"68",2837,"GRC",69,2014,"This sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly is taking place in a global context full of challenges  testing the efficiency of the current international system. Greece remains fully engaged with the objectives of the United Nations  whose universal ideals have never failed to inspire us.I should like to take this opportunity to emphasize my country’s alignment with the positions of the European Union presented by the President of the European Council in his statement (see A/69/PV.9).We reiterate our support for efforts to reform the Organization  including the Security Council  so that the United Nations can better adapt to the ongoing changes of our age and strengthen its operational nature and effectiveness in the exercise of preventive diplomacy.Among the challenges at the global level is obviously that of climate change  which is an absolute priority. A new universal agreement  legally binding on all  is essential. Transition towards a new model of green economy with a low carbon footprint must be accelerated. Greece believes that the Climate Summit held this week offered a unique opportunity to intensify the efforts to achieve such a universal agreement.The Greek presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU)  during the first half of 2014  sought to stress the importance of sustainable development. A significant joint statement was adopted in the framework of the ministerial meeting of the European Union with African  Caribbean and Pacific countries that was held in Nairobi last June.The Ebola virus epidemic has become a genuine threat to global peace and security with its serious social  economic and humanitarian repercussions. An international strategy is necessary to contain the virus and to avoid an unprecedented humanitarian crisis that would precipitate the collapse of the health-care system and  eventually  of the social fabric of the States affected. Therefore we welcome the decision of the Secretary-General to establish the new mission  the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response  and we pledge that Greece will offer its full support to any initiative taken in order to combat the epidemic.The current complex security challenges require us to unite our forces  both internationally and regionally. Greece supports the strengthening of cooperation between the European Union and the United Nations in crisis management  particularly by implementing the action plan on United Nations peacekeeping operations.The world is facing a series of unprecedented crises in the Middle East and in North Africa  as well as the eastern area of the European Union. Of course  in the face of such multiple crises  a consistent and global comprehensive strategy is required. Certainly  from this standpoint the role of the United Nations  especially the Security Council  is the deciding factor. That is the only way that we will be able to deal with the critical dilemma confronting us now  the dilemma between democracy and security. But if there is to be democracy  there must be a State that is functioning and does not dissolve  as well as minimal security conditions.The Ukrainian crisis seriously affects security and stability in Europe. We are concerned by the deteriorating humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine  and we support the territorial integrity  independence and sovereignty of Ukraine.(spoke in English)We support the 5 September Minsk agreement  the full implementation of which can contribute to the resolution of the crisis through diplomatic and political means. The key is the achievement of an inclusive solution.Regarding security concerns in our neighbourhood  we welcome the adoption in Egypt of the 26 August Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire agreement  which we hope will pave the way to relaunching the political process aimed at establishing a durable peace  which is obviously a prerequisite for a comprehensive solution allowing two States  Israel and Palestine  to coexist in security.The Secretary-General’s newly appointed Special Envoy for Syria must continue efforts to ensure the effective relaunching of the Geneva II political process. That is all the more imperative given the barbaric actions of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) and other jihadist groups in Syria and the Iraqi-Syrian border regions. Foreign fighters joining jihadist terrorist organizations are a serious threat to regional and global security. As a member of the international alliance against ISIS and extreme jihadists  Greece fully supports the new Security Council resolution 2178 (2014)  on how the international community must act against ISIS and potential foreign fighters. In that regard  I wish to make special reference to the grave humanitarian situation and increasing refugee pressure on countries of the region  including Greece.Military means alone cannot eliminate the jihadist threat. We must also promote an inclusive process of reconciliation and national dialogue in Iraq to counter that threat to the country’s national unity and territorial integrity. We remain seriously concerned at the displacement of civilians  and we strongly condemn the systematic persecution of Christians and other religious communities.The region’s stability is also under threat from the ongoing violence in Libya. We strongly support the United Nations coordination of relevant international efforts. We therefore welcome the appointment of the Secretary-General’s new Special Representative.Deeply concerned at the life-threatening conditions journalists are increasingly confronting and the censorship and persecution the media are facing  Greece co-sponsored last year’s resolution 68/163  on the safety of journalists and the issue of impunity. We are now co-sponsoring this year’s draft resolution on the protection of journalists.During its European presidency in the first half of 2014  Greece emphasized Western Balkan integration into the European Union. That objective requires implementation of internal reforms in accordance with EU standards and the promotion of good-neighbourly relations through regional cooperation  reconciliation and effective confrontation of the sources of nationalism. We welcome the significant progress so far in the EU-facilitated Belgrade-Pristina talks. We hope that the two sides will continue their constructive discussions in a spirit of compromise.With respect to the issue of the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  Greece fully respects the process directed by the Secretary-General through his Personal Envoy  Mr. Matthew Nimetz  and always participates constructively and with goodwill. Greece has already taken considerable steps. We are awaiting corresponding steps from the other side. We propose a mutually acceptable compound name  with a geographical qualifier before the word “Macedonia”  for all uses and purposes  internally and internationally  erga omnes.Greece supports the European and Euro-Atlantic perspective of that neighbouring country and has long been among the top foreign direct investors there. Its European and Euro-Atlantic perspective hinges not on the name or on Greece  but on respect for the general criteria in place for all accession-candidate countries. It hinges on issues of democracy  rule of law  respect for human rights  harmonious inter-ethnic relations and freedom of the press. As the relevant European Council conclusions say  tangible steps need to be taken on those issues.This past summer marked the fortieth anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus  and the international community continues to confront the ongoing illegal military occupation of the territory of a United Nations and European Union member State. Greece fully supports the dialogue between the leaders of the two communities within the framework of the February 2014 joint communiqué and the initiatives of President Anastasiades for confidence-building measures that can create new momentum on the island.A just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem must be in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions  the high-level agreements  the February 2014 joint communiqué and the European acquis. The Cypriot people must express their agreement to such a solution through a referendum. We also attach great importance to maintaining the mandate  level and concept of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and to the Secretary-General’s good offices mission. We welcome the appointment of Mr. Eide as his new Special Adviser on Cyprus.A just and viable solution to the Cyprus issue and respect for international law  especially the international law of the sea  are two critical factors on which the full development of Greek-Turkish relations depends. These relations have great potential  and are critical to the stability of the wider region as they are relations between two NATO member States  while Greece also supports Turkey’s European perspective.Challenging times require demanding choices. The United Nations is in a position to tackle the new challenges  as it has so often done in the past  provided we all share the same vision and  most importantly  the necessary political will."
"69",2878,"GRD",69,2014,"I would like  first of all  to thank the outgoing President  Mr. John Ashe  for his sterling efforts in presiding over the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly in a year that was dedicated to island States around the world. Let me also congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa and welcome him as the incoming President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. He can count on Grenada’s support to contribute to the deliberations in a positive and meaningful way.As we gather here in New York yet again  we can celebrate the remarkable history of our institution in this beautifully refurbished United Nations Headquarters. I wish to put on record Grenada’s appreciation to the donors who contributed and to the Secretary-General for his leadership on this project. With its large open spaces and glass façade  the building’s design speaks to our ideals of transparency  openness and dialogue. The building’s mid-twentieth-century features recall the spirit of an age when space was the new frontier.The space age has given way to a new and exciting information age. Today  a young girl armed with a smartphone in Gujarat  India  can Google the same satellite images of our planet as a child in Great Britain. Exposed to the right ideas on the Internet  children — whether in Greensboro in the United States  or Grenoble in France  or Grenada in the Caribbean — can have the same seeds of hope  the same aspirations for happiness and personal growth  and the same sense of duty towards neighbourhood and planet. For aspiring young people everywhere  coming of age is symbolized by ownership  not of a car  but of a mobile phone or a computer tablet. Those are today’s vehicles on the information highway for the world’s youth seeking ideas  identity and connectedness.We come to the United Nations today to feel that sense of connectedness amid the chaos of today’s challenges. We come to these refurbished Headquarters to renew our commitment to peace and security and to revitalize our mission  not to the stars  but to work for a safer planet with shared prosperity for all. Today  in this iconic Hall  it is too soon to say “mission accomplished”  but for the most part  our original mission for dialogue and the rule of law among abiding nations has been accomplished.Sitting here among ourselves  we are  for the most part  preaching to the converted. The long-standing conflict between Israel and Palestine has given way to a realization that the only viable solution is the two-State solution. Moreover  sworn enemies in this Hall now confer on how to tackle much more sinister enemies of peace.Those new enemies have no flags fluttering proudly outside  nor electronic nameplates inside. They are not here in our space-age Hall; they are out there in cyberspace  a place where violence and hate in isolated corners can spread like wildfire across the globe. Captured on mobile phones and uploaded to the Internet  gruesome images from a remote backstreet can inflict fear in the hearts of ordinary citizens on Main Street everywhere.The shocking beheadings we see in the media are the weeping ooze from the cancerous underbelly of our world today. They are the symptoms of an insidious and pervasive unease eating away at the very foundations on which this great institution was built. And with each new escalation of violence  we feel a sense of horror not only at the acts themselves but perhaps more at our inability to act.War and insecurity in the information age have mutated so much that neither our resolutions  our agencies nor our armies are enough to break the fever of this viral menace of transnational actors. And so  looking beyond our Capital Master Plan that reimagines our twentieth-century beginnings  let us build a new Information Master Plan fit for the twenty-first century with electronic highways that will one day connect this Hall to every child in every village.The information age is a new season in the arc of our institution’s history — a new season in which everyone has a voice  be they the youths of the Arab Spring or the Occupiers of Wall Street’s winter of discontent. Today’s information age brings a new transparency between the haves and the have-nots — between the 1 per cent and the 99 per cent. Whether segmented by class  race  religion or political affiliation  inequality is the disease of our times  contributing to the political eruptions all over the world.We now have — for the first time — documented evidence of the root causes of the growing inequalities in society. A new economic treatise  entitled Capital in the Twenty-First Century  by Thomas Piketty  analyses over a century of economic data and concludes that the rich are getting richer  faster than everyone else. But there are two things that reduce income inequality. The first is the distribution of knowledge that promotes growth. The second is war  which destroys capital. The first option is a rising tide that lifts all ships; the second is a sinking stone that drowns all hope — the very antithesis of this Organization.We must focus more of our global policy on proactive interventions that promote sustainable growth. We must encourage economic growth by distributing knowledge through education  information and communication technology  as well as through skills and technology transfers. We do indeed need an Information Master Plan if we are to proactively confront threats in the twenty-first century.The World Development Report 2011: Conflict  Security and Development  published by the World Bank  acknowledges that development agencies have not yet fully adapted to the needs of the twenty-first century and that they do not yet have the capacity to adequately help fragile States. It finds that unemployment is the number-one reason for youths to join criminal gangs and contending armies. It reminds us that investing in citizen security  justice and jobs is essential to reducing violence. We know that once mass violence takes root in a society  it can take a generation or more to recover.As we look around at the violence in the world today  I ask the question: can our twentieth-century institutions cope with twenty-first-century shocks? Do we have the courage to be proactive in fostering jobs and growth  or will we wait until violence erupts? This year’s World Development Report 2014 is all about managing opportunity and managing risk  from the level of the household to the level of the international community. The essence of the report is that the benefits of proactive preparation can outweigh the costs of responding retroactively.The risks from climate shocks are among the most terrifying for Grenada and for islands around the world. Grenada places on record its appreciation for the Secretary-General’s leadership in calling for a Climate Summit. In the last four years alone  we have seen floods raging across the world. With the hottest temperatures on record in recent years  forest fires have raged across almost all continents  devouring millions of acres of forest land  causing damages in the tens of billions of dollars. Glacial retreats from the Andes to the Himalayas and from Greenland to Antarctica are moving at record speeds. We are seeing hurricanes and cyclones as never before.Two years ago  right here in New York  Hurricane Sandy struck and disabled the economic engine of the United States. It caused $68 billion worth of damage. But this represents less than 1 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States in contrast with the island States  where damages of between 10 per cent and 50 per cent of GDP are common  and  in the case of Grenada  where damages occurred totalling 200 per cent of GDP from Hurricane Ivan alone. Even as we speak  this week Grenada was plagued with unseasonably high rains that have caused numerous landslides. The value of the damage is yet to be determined. Like our neighbours Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 2013  we are forced to dedicate already scarce financial resources to repair and mitigate this.There is a link between these events and the high indebtedness of small Caribbean islands. To paraphrase the World Bank’s country assistance strategy for the Eastern Caribbean  the years when fiscal policy failed to explain increases in debt-to-GDP ratios were the same years when natural disasters occurred. Given these risks  island States need concessionary financing. This is critical to ensuring growth  jobs and economic development. For small island developing States (SIDS)  a robust economy  combined with risk-management policies and instruments  is the best combination for resilience.When our current Administration was elected 16 months ago  the indebtedness of our country was unsustainable. But the Grenadian people came together under the leadership of Prime Minister Mitchell. Unions  churches  non-governmental organizations  political parties and businesses all rallied to form a social compact to put Grenada on a firm fiscal footing. We tightened our belts and asked the Grenadian people to contribute more as we undertook our home-grown fiscal reform. The indebtedness of the SIDS must be counted among the many challenges of our time. The annual cry of the small island States to make concessionary funding available is the early-warning system for the international community. Let us settle the least developed countries graduation issue in favour of the SIDS  rather than use it as a parallel climate-negotiation tool against the SIDS.One country that is singled out for its stellar management of disasters is Cuba. We all have much to learn from Cuba on areas as diverse as disaster risk management and public-health management. Cuba sends its engineers  teachers and doctors around the world to improve the lives of others. Is it not time to fully recognize the contributions of Cuba to the international community — and if not now  then when? Is it not time to end the Cold War attitudes to Cuba — and if not now  then when? Is it not time to end the embargo against Cuba — and if not now  then when?The explosion of violence that we see in today’s trouble spots is driven by the flawed principle of disrespect for international law and the territorial integrity of Member States. There comes a time when old enemies must turn swords into ploughshares and look to a future with dignity and with hope.Just as climate change is the challenge of our time  it can also be said that climate change is possibly one of the greatest opportunities for wealth creation and shared prosperity that this generation has seen. Today  the renewable energy market is estimated to be in the order of $16 trillion  including $12 billion in the Caribbean alone. In 2012  there were some 6 million jobs in renewable energy and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) expects 17 million jobs by 2030. Today  pension funds with collective assets exceeding $12 trillion are focusing on climate risk  renewable energy and energy efficiency.Island States like Grenada are seized not only of climate challenge  but also with climate solutions. For us  a robust economy  combined with sound disaster risk-management policies and instruments  is the most sustainable form of adaptation to climate change. But in Grenada  we cannot educate our people if our schoolchildren have no access to electricity. Due to the high import costs of fossil fuels  electricity in Grenada costs four to five times higher than it does in developed countries. But countries with low electricity prices have to subsidize renewables; not so in the islands. Islands like Grenada come to the climate table  not like hapless victims cap-in-hand  but offering the international community 100 per cent renewables that can be introduced with zero subsidies.If we are to limit global carbon dioxide concentrations to 450 parts per million  then  according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fifth assessment report  our electricity sector needs a total transformation. While island States are the least of the emitters  they are the most cost-effective places for renewables. I congratulate the Small Island Developing States Sustainable Energy Initiative (SIDS DOCK)  IRENA and Sustainable Energy For All for acting on this.Grenada is working to transform its electricity sector. Solving the energy challenge for islands like Grenada will remove a drag on our economies and better position us to withstand environmental shocks. This is adaptation with prospects for jobs  growth and shared prosperity for all. I am delighted to announce that  in addition to working with Germany  the World Bank  SIDS DOCK and IRENA  Grenada has signed a groundbreaking memorandum of understanding with the United States to assist us in transforming our energy mix  as we announced in Samoa. We have also signed an memorandum of understanding with New Zealand to help us better understand our geothermal resources. Grenada will serve as the pilot country for the regional energy initiative of the United States and will work with New Zealand on geothermal energy. We welcome others to join this partnership and this unfolding success story that is Green Grenada.As we have said before  we wish to recommend the following actions. Let us operationalize the Green Climate Fund with a window for islands. Let us implement 100 per cent renewable energy in island States. Let us put a price on carbon and stop subsidizing fossil fuels. Let us decarbonize food security. Agriculture  forestry and other land use contribute 25 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Let us have greater support for climate-smart agriculture that can deliver a triple win of increasing productivity and incomes  increasing resilience to climate change  and reducing or removing carbon emissions. Grenada is pleased to be working with the Government of the Netherlands on a climate-smart agricultural alliance and on Global Blue Growth and Food Security Initiative.Blue growth is vital for the economies of island States around the world  and our tri-island State of Grenada  Carriacou and Petite Martinique sees itself as an Ocean State  given that our exclusive economic zone in the sea is over 70 times larger than our land mass. Our tri-island State is pleased to host the secretariat of the Caribbean Challenge Initiative (CCI)  which is supported by Germany and others. The CCI promotes an enhanced marine environment  and Grenada is committed to conserving its near-shore marine environment. Through reports like the Sunken Billions  the World Bank and the Food and Agriculture Organization have shown that conservation efforts are critical to ensuring maximum economic yield in fisheries.In the past 30 years  we have lost 30 per cent of our corals and mangroves. This is why Grenada welcomes efforts such as the Global Blue Growth Initiative and the Global Partnership for Oceans  and the efforts of The Economist and United States Secretary of State John Kerry to bring renewed attention to the oceans. We look forward to welcoming our partners to Grenada in January 2015 for the launch of the Global Blue Growth and Food Security initiatives.In closing  Grenada acknowledges the successes of the 2014 Third International Conference on Small Island Development States  held in Samoa  and  building on the momentum of Samoa  we look forward to the successful conclusion to the sustainable development goals process leading into the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris next year.As we move forward  let us remember that a number of the Millennium Development Goals have not been achieved. We have a duty  therefore  to re-examine our approach to peace  security and shared prosperity. We need collective action on a global consensus. We need to act now before it is too late. We must shed the old ways and adopt twenty-first-century approaches for this millennium generation if we are to bequeath to them and future generations the bounty we inherited and the bounty that they deserve."
"70",2925,"GTM",69,2014,"I would like to begin my remarks by conveying our greetings to Mr. Sam Kutesa  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. At the same time  I wish to express our appreciation to Mr. John Ashe for his recognized leadership and exceptional performance as President at the sixty-eighth session. I should also like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General for his stewardship and especially for the success of the recent United Nations Climate Summit 2014.Since September 2013  when the President of Guatemala  Otto Pérez Molina  addressed the General Assembly (see A/68/PV.12)  12 months have passed with significant progress for Guatemala in three priority areas of our domestic policy  in spite of our having to face some new challenges  including a recent prolonged drought.First  I can report that we have advanced in the battle against chronic malnutrition among children. According to an independent investigation  in one year  the program Zero Hunger has succeeded in reducing chronic malnutrition on the same scale as that achieved during the past decade  that is  by almost 2 per cent. That means that  should that trend be maintained  by the end of this Administration we will have been able to reduce the rate of chronic malnutrition beyond that achieved since 1985  proving that democracy and appropriate policies would have enabled us to make progress for Guatemalan children.Secondly  I would like to say that the Administration of President Pérez Molina has also advanced in complying with the Pact for Peace  Security and Justice. For the third consecutive year  the number of homicides in Guatemala has decreased  with a cumulative contraction of 25 per cent between 2011 and 2014. With that  we are coming closer to achieving the same levels of security recorded after the Peace Accords were signed in 1996. That progress shows that the measures taken are producing the expected results and that Guatemalan democracy is slowly winning its battle against crime and impunity  in the framework of respect for the law and compliance with human rights.With regard to that second achievement  once more we express our appreciation for the support received from the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG)  an entity that has strengthened criminal prosecution against mafia networks  some of which even infiltrated the security and justice establishment. As the final year of the mandate of CICIG approaches  after nearly eight years of cooperation with three democratically elected Governments  our assessment is that international cooperation programme  supported by the United Nations  was fully justified  since Guatemalan institutions today are better prepared to take on their constitutional role.Moreover  this last year will be critical to ensuring the institutional sustainability of the judicial investigations and procedures already under way. We thank the United Nations and the international community for joining us and leaving that great legacy for Guatemala. Our country will now have the responsibility of strengthening a system of security and justice capable of reducing impunity and ensuring the total separation between criminal networks and our public institutions.A third advancement that I would like to share with the Assembly has to do with competitiveness and the business climate. In the past two years we have advanced eight steps in the Global Competitiveness Index  established by the World Economic Forum. In fact  the World Bank has highlighted us for the second consecutive year as one of the most reformed countries in the world in terms of improving the business climate  jumping 19 positions in the respective report. That is due to the actions of the present Administration in the framework of the Pact for Oversight and Competitiveness.That improvement in the business climate is above all the result of administrative improvements that have reduced bureaucratic procedures  supported additionally by a progressive improvement in the country’s infrastructure. In addition  as we informed the Climate Change Summit  our commitment regarding economic progress is made within the context of increasing sustainability. The change in the energy matrix towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly energy sources and away from fossil fuels  which produce greenhouse gases  is being achieved by bringing into the system more plants that depend on the sustainable use of water  geothermal sources  solar energy and even natural gas.In that context  we have gone ahead with various strategic agreements with our neighbouring countries. For example  with Mexico  we can report on the projects to reconstruct and modernize border crossings on land and the signing of a historic agreement for a project that will transport gas from the Gulf of Mexico to Guatemala and all of Central America. With Belize  we are moving forward and have negotiated 15 important bilateral agreements in all areas  which we will sign in December. They will strengthen the relations not only between our Governments but also between our peoples. In the Central American Integration System  we are making progress in consolidating our integration process  and the next goal is to establish a customs union. In addition  relations between Central America and the Caribbean are becoming increasingly intensive  guaranteeing greater markets and improved economic and political relations among our countries.In the context of advances in the social  economic  security and justice areas  we cannot forget some challenges that have gained a higher profile during the current year. In that regard  I must refer to the crisis of the Central American child migrants on the border between the United States and Mexico. The crisis  provoked by diverse factors in both Central America and the United States  has alerted us to the need to move more quickly on the path towards greater prosperity  in particular for children and adolescents.We trust that the people and Government of the United States understand that the migrant crisis requires a strategic response that attacks the structural roots of the phenomenon and provides sustained actions. That implies working together to promote development and prosperity in Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador and intelligent management of seasonal work for migrants that both satisfies the demands of the labour market in the United States and provides for workers from Central America. It is also important to make the necessary efforts to regulate the situation of undocumented persons in the United States. Above all  migrants must not be criminalized  because migration is neither a sin nor a crime. It is the networks of human traffickers that are criminal  promoting corruption  extortion  kidnapping and sexual abuse.In the same vein  I cannot fail to mention the challenge posed by the shortage of rain this year in all the Central American region. The drought has led to the loss of crops of basic foods for hundreds of thousands of families  and addressing the food crisis will incur a cost of close to $50 million for Guatemala alone during the next eight months. It is clear that the drought is a result of climate change and that  without decisive action by our Government and the solidarity of the international community  many families will find themselves in a very vulnerable situation due to hunger. The speeches during the Climate Change Summit must translate into direct humanitarian assistance that reaches the most needy communities in Central America and the Caribbean. It is time to transform rhetoric into action.I would like to mention three important processes driving the United Nations that Guatemala strongly supports.First is putting together a post-2015 development agenda that must clearly embrace inclusive and sustainable development goals  including those related to promoting justice for all. In that context  we must also incorporate specific goals to avoid man-made climate change.Secondly  Guatemala is committed to supporting the 2016 special session of the General Assembly to discuss the world drug problem. President Pérez Molina  together with other Presidents of the Western Hemisphere  is determined to promote  through leadership  a frank and sincere debate on this issue  utilizing as a main reference the two declarations emanating from the General Assembly of the Organization of American States during the past 18 months. During the most recent extraordinary session  held a few days ago in my country  I was charged with transmitting to the presidency of this General Assembly and to the United Nations Commission on Drugs and Crime the text of the resolution  which I will do in due time. Our focus must be comprehensive  objective and evidence-based. And our goals must be realistic and measurable — no more dead products of the war against drugs  no more false promises. A comprehensive focus is necessary.Thirdly  Guatemala will follow up on the resolution and recommendations of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples (resolution 69/2) and work to see that the world recognizes the rights of the indigenous peoples as one of the basic platforms of the international legal architecture of human rights.Like many of the heads of delegation who preceded me in speaking  I view with growing concern the deteriorating security landscape facing various parts of the globe. The exceptional cruelty of militant jihadist groups leaves us astonished  and we energetically condemn those crimes. We support all measures to combat them  including in particular the elimination of the root causes that lead many people to those levels of fanaticism.We are also profoundly troubled by the instability in the Middle East  especially by the prolonged conflict in Syria  which has already taken an immense toll in lives and human suffering. We are concerned that in Central Europe principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  such as respect for territorial integrity  are being put to the test. We also remain concerned about tensions in various countries on the African continent and on the Korean peninsula.We believe that the United Nations offers the ideal venue in which to address those conflicts and tensions  and we reiterate our hope that dialogue  agreement and preventive diplomacy will take precedence over the use of force. In that respect  we pin our hopes on a negotiated outcome of the long-standing conflict between Israel and Palestine with the emergence of two States  living in peace within secure borders.I end my remarks by repeating what President Otto Pérez Molina said last year to the Assembly  when he congratulated the United Nations system for its ongoing commitment to seek peace and justice worldwide. Guatemala aligns itself with that statement and those same goals and can affirm with pride that we are and will always be a country that is guided by the principles set out in the Charter of the Organization. That sentiment is reflected in our commitment to peacekeeping operations."
"71",2968,"GUY",69,2014,"I wish to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at this year’s session. I wish also to commend your predecessor  Ambassador John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda  and his team  for so effectively setting the stage for what will now follow under your tenure  as it relates to the post-2015 development agenda and other critical issues that warrant the focused attention of the international community.This debate in the General Assembly is taking place on the eve of the target year set by world leaders in 2000 for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is therefore a timely moment to assess the progress that has been made  and also to understand why we could not achieve all the Goals in full. That is essential if we are to move forward with the post-2015 agenda that we are now about to finalize. I should recall that in 2000  when the eight Goals were announced  they inspired great hope and enthusiasm around the world  particularly in developing countries and among the poor. It is true that we have made tangible progress in our efforts to achieve the MDGs. Global poverty has fallen and continues to fall; many more children are attending primary schools; health services have improved for many people  resulting in a significant decline in child mortality; and the spread of HIV/AIDS and malaria has been halted and even reversed in some regions.In Guyana  despite the negative effects of the international financial situation  we have managed to keep our economy growing steadily over the past eight years. In fact  we have succeeded not only in growing our economy but also in ensuring that the growth has resulted in an improved quality of life for our people. Indeed  we are one of only 17 countries in the world recognized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations for not only meeting the goal of reducing hunger by half but also of improving their people’s nutrition. We have achieved universal primary education and are close to achieving universality for secondary education  too. We have also made important strides in housing  health  water and other social facilities. In that regard  I would like to express my country’s gratitude to all the development partners that have contributed greatly to the gains we have made in working towards the MDGs. Guyana’s success in building its health-sector capacity could not have been possible without Cuba’s assistance  which included training hundreds of our doctors  and which Cuba has done despite its own economic difficulties. We would like to join the vast majority of the countries of the world in once more calling for an end to Cuba’s economic blockade by the United States.While we should recognize the gains that have been made around the world  I hasten to point out that they have not been uniform across countries or regions. In some places the progress has been dramatic. Asia  for instance  has had remarkable success with many of the Goals. In Latin America and the Caribbean there has also been considerable progress. There are  however  some areas that have seen almost no noticeable change since 2000. In others  mainly countries ravaged by conflicts and wars  laudable gains have been reversed. Some Goals have also proven more elusive than others. Maternal mortality in particular requires additional attention. It is clear that the world could have advanced much further along the road to achieving the MDGs. Unfortunately  that did not happen  because the partnership needed to achieve every objective was not strong enough. We should therefore examine the reasons for the sub-optimal results.It is true that we all have a responsibility for the welfare of the people of the world and the state of our planet in general. The reality  however  is that some countries have far more resources than others  and some also use much more of the world’s resources. And while our responsibilities are shared  they must necessarily be differentiated. The gaps between the top and bottom segments of the world’s population are widening greatly. The concentration of wealth in the hands of a few has reached dangerous proportions. Oxfam International recently highlighted this phenomenon  and some figures are startling. Oxfam noted that the richest 1 per cent of the population of the world owns about 46 per cent of global wealth — some $110 trillion — while the bottom 50 per cent owns just about $1.7 trillion  or 0.7 per cent of the world’s wealth. That amount  $1.7 trillion  is the same as that possessed by 85 of the world’s richest people — in other words  85 persons have as much wealth as 50 per cent of the world’s population. Clearly  such a degree of inequality is unsustainable.In much the same manner  while we have all agreed on increasing development assistance to developing countries  the reality is that the net transfer of financial resources from developing to developed countries continues unabated  amounting to $200 billion in 2002 and increasing to $557 billion in 2010. That perverse trend continues today. And this transfer of financial resources is only a part of the picture. Developing countries also suffer a net loss of skills to the developed world through migration. That is after the former countries have expended huge amounts on training. In addition  our efforts in the health and education sectors are often frustrated by the high costs of school books and essential medicines  owing to the strictures of intellectual property rights. These imbalances are clearly unsustainable and can be addressed only through concerted global action.While many developing countries have shown serious determination in working towards the Goals by allocating more resources to human development  the support offered to them by developed countries  as envisaged in MDG 8  has fallen significantly short of expectations. It is extremely disappointing  to say the least  that in the face of pressing needs  only about half a dozen developed countries have kept their pledge to reserve 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance. As we prepare for yet another conference on financing for development  in Ethiopia next year  I would like to remind the Assembly that the commitment of 0.7 per cent was made over four decades ago in this very Assembly  and was reiterated in 2002 at the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey.In the light of those failures  it is imperative that the post-2015 framework include  first  a time-bound commitment for delivering official development assistance on which commitments have already been made; secondly  a global framework for managing intellectual property rights that places the development imperative at its centre; thirdly  a global trading architecture that recognizes the asymmetries in the global state of development and is suitably responsive to them; fourthly  a framework that ensures that private-sector investment is consistent with the development agenda. The recommendations of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals and of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing provide a good platform on which to build.As we craft a transformative agenda  it will be especially important to ensure that it is flexible enough to address the peculiar needs of some countries. The special circumstances occasioned by the vulnerabilities of small island and low-lying coastal developing States bear particular mention in that regard. Far too often  the progress made can be speedily reversed owing to the impacts of climate change and natural disasters. We must spare no effort to ensure that we have a legally binding agreement on this matter in 2015.Ironically  as we discuss the post-2015 development agenda  many Caribbean Community countries are being graduated from eligibility for concessionary financing  since they are classified as middle-income based on the narrow measure of gross domestic product per capita. In addition  many of those countries are heavily indebted  as they must make unavoidable investments in building and rebuilding social  economic and productive infrastructure to strengthen their resilience. We call on the international community to reconsider that approach by adding a vulnerability index to the equation. We also call for debt relief  as the debt accumulated by most of those countries makes their economies unsustainable.The most important precondition for progress is peace. Many conflicts and potential for conflicts continue unresolved  while new threats to global security have risen to dangerous levels.The situation in the Middle East is the most disturbing. Still at the heart of it is the great tragedy that is the plight of the Palestinian people. Once again  we have seen the bombing of an almost unarmed population in Gaza by one of the world’s most powerful military machines  supported and replenished by even more powerful military forces. Guyana calls for the end of the apartheid-like situation that exists in Palestine  where poverty and degradation are weapons used to repress a whole people. The people of Palestine have a right to live with dignity in their own country  and the United Nations must never compromise on the principle of self-determination.The continuing wars in Syria and Iraq are most distressing. They are leading to more extremism and a rapid descent into barbarism. That has resulted from years of financing and arming of radical forces to promote political objectives. We condemn the barbaric and grotesque killing of journalists  humanitarian aid workers and other hostages and the loss of civilian lives in those conflict areas by the murderous extremists in those countries. Guyana condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.The situation in Ukraine is another cause for concern. We must not forget that the two world wars had their origins in Europe. That is why we should exert every effort to bring all the partners to the table for a peaceful resolution. Attempting to secure military advantages is not only foolhardy but downright dangerous. The solution has to be based on justice and the aspirations of the peoples in that country.The many unresolved border issues that exist in our world are always a potential source of conflict and are often used to retard the development of countries  preventing them from improving the quality of life of their own peoples and from promoting the welfare of the region to which they belong. My own country is not unaffected by this. The United Nations must therefore redouble its efforts to assist in the resolution of such issues.We currently face a stark reminder of how fragile global welfare is in the face of singular threats such as the Ebola epidemic. Make no mistake  that is a global problem that requires an immediate global response many times greater what is currently being done. Let me acknowledge the prompt response and leadership shown by Cuba and the United States of America in rendering assistance to the countries in West Africa.In our time  we must continue the search for new approaches to many of the global problems that confront us. In today’s interconnected and interdependent world  the destinies of States and peoples are increasingly intertwined. The concerted global action that is necessary to address today’s problems can be achieved only with strong multilateralism and through relevant  responsive and more democratic global institutions.Critical issues include reforms to the Security Council and the international financial institutions. Concrete progress in Security Council reform is imperative in order to assure the continued legitimacy and relevance of that important United Nations organ. Likewise  accelerated reform of the international financial institutions is critical if we are to ensure their effectiveness in protecting global financial stability and supporting sustainable development.In conclusion  I would like to recall the proposal that Guyana made through its first democratically elected President  Mr. Cheddi Jagan  for a new global human order  on which the General Assembly has pronounced itself in several resolutions. That proposal seeks to balance the interests of developed and developing countries. It is a proposal whose time has come  and it should be pursued with other initiatives to find solutions so that we can realize the dreams of generations that came before us for peace  progress and prosperity.Just as the Millennium Development Goals provided a new focus and raised hopes in the year 2000  so today we must rekindle that spirit to eradicate poverty and inequality in the post-2015 period.Let me express our appreciation to the Secretary-General and the staff of the United Nations for their tireless efforts in carrying out the mandate of the Organization in very challenging times. I assure them that they have the full support of the people and the Government of Guyana."
"72",3013,"HND",69,2014,"I am Juan Orlando Hernández. I was born in a humble village called Rio Grande  in the department of Lempira  a region with very high rates of inequality and poverty  although that is now changing  as is my whole country. I am here in my capacity as President of Honduras  a country located in the heart of the Americas. It is a country small in size  but with a great desire to achieve development based on its own identity  and with a people who struggle daily to advance and progress  and who aspire to better living conditions.In 2009  our country suffered one of the worst political crises in its history. It led to several hundred million dollars in losses  and most unfortunately  to thousands of divided families and more poverty. That crisis caused more damage than any hurricane or natural disaster. However  today we can say that we have overcome the political crisis.Honduras is a country where full democracy is practised and there is complete freedom to choose its leaders. In addition to representative democracy  we practice participatory democracy. Proof of that is the dialogue that will lead to a compact for Honduras that will be the result of listening to the views of different sectors of society on central issues for our people. Our Everyone for a Better Life Plan includes four basic pillars: restoring peace  generating investment and large-scale employment opportunities  supporting families living in extreme poverty  and combatting corruption and promoting greater transparency in the culture of the Honduran people.Since taking office eight months ago  I have been completely devoted to recovering and maintaining peace and tranquillity  creating opportunities with fairer conditions for everybody. We need more investment to come to our country in order to create jobs that will translate into greater income for our families. To that end  Honduras has amended its Constitution to create one of the best platforms in the world for investment and employment. It is a very innovative. I am referring to the Zone for Employment and Economic Development  which is better known by its acronym ZEDE.The Honduras ZEDE model is not just another free trade zone  similar to the 3 500 that already exist in the world. Ours is different because it is comprehensive. It is a jurisdiction with four dimensions: legal  economic  administrative and political. The Honduran ZEDE is a L.E.A.P. zone  which in English means “to jump forward”. In Honduras  the ZEDE will help us take a competitive leap forward towards greater well-being. Rather than joining the race to the bottom  Honduras has decided to compete upwards  welcoming global investment through a special jurisdiction of the highest level to employ the most productive and profitable workforce in a highly favourable location at the centre of the Americas  bringing the Pacific and the Atlantic together.In the legal dimension  ZEDE offers a common law system  with compulsory arbitration and international judges. Economically speaking  we are competitive in an open market  with a series of agile simple regulations  with highly attractive and sustainable incentives for the creation of good jobs under decent conditions. In the administrative dimension  ZEDE provides a technical  non-political structure without bureaucratic obstacles that is effective for companies that must operate at the speed of the markets and technology in the twenty-first century  and with full guarantees of transparency and security within the rule of law. Finally  to attract long-term investment and ensure good jobs  we guarantee political stability and transparency based on international treaties and agreements  with the support of an international commission of 21 trustees to ensure compliance with best practices for workers and the investors. I invite everyone to discover the great opportunity Honduras offers the world.We have also created a participatory model of Government enterprises and the private sector  with mixed capital — in other words public-private partnerships. We are building an interoceanic logistical corridor linking the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean  allowing us to move cargo between both Oceans in less than six hours — I repeat  less than six hours. Our hope is to capture at least 5 per cent of the demand to move goods from one ocean to another.We have made progress  but we also recognize that much remains to be done. For example  there has been a rise in the number of Hondurans going abroad  including an unusual migration of children and vulnerable youth to North America  many unaccompanied by an adult. This migration is the result of the violence created by the movement of drugs through our territory  poverty and the lack of opportunities. Special attention must be dedicated to this phenomenon  especially in countries that are responsible for the problem either because they produce the drugs or because they are the market where the drug is consumed. We believe that this is a shared responsibility. Faced with the scant interest in solving the problem shown but those who created it  we Hondurans must stress this issue in every forum that we possibly can  because we must speak clearly and forcefully about that issue.Honduran territory is today one of the main battlefields of a war that is not our own. We did not start this war. Its strategies are decided outside Honduras  and it involves drug-consuming countries in the North and drug producing countries in the South. It is a real monster — a multinational  criminal octopus without nationalities  borders or scruples  which is dedicated to the trafficking  trade and consumption of drugs and to encouraging demand  especially in the wealthiest societies.The drugs transiting through Honduras and Central America destroy the lives and peace of our people  our youth  our children and our women. From those who orchestrate and organize the transnational activity within our territory to ordinary citizens and the children involved as pawns in drug dealing and addicts  all are affected. They are all embarking on the path of no return  which will tear apart our society  destroy families  corrupt officials and destroy institutions. I invite members to ask themselves: Who are the real culprits in this cycle of death  misfortune  mourning  struggle  blood and pain? It is not Hondurans  I can assure the Assembly of that.In forums such as this  we need to agree on the basic contours of the issue and the facts. We cannot  in the midst of crisis and without coming to useful or concrete conclusions  put forward proposals based on legalizing production and consumption  on the one hand  and on waging a merciless war on trafficking and illegal drug use  on all fronts and regardless of cost  on the other. I ask myself  and I invite members to ask themselves: Who are the true victims of this tragedy? All those who cannot live in peace in modern society are victims  as are those who cannot live in society without using drugs. Society itself is a victim  as it is unable to organize its efforts and manage its resources in a rational manner so as to create new opportunities.Honduras produces and consumes practically no drugs. We are a transit country. Unfortunately  we provide only the battlefield and the dead. We provide the resources to combat drugs’ transit through our territory  and those are resources that we are prevented from investing in meeting our development problems and challenges. I repeat: we are not responsible for the war.I think it is time to do what we have to do: respect human rights; follow what experts and our common sense are telling us; attack the problem at its root  once and for all; and do it together and throughout the affected region. We must create a multinational force capable of dealing successfully with a phenomenon that is transnational in terms of its organization  its market  its projections and its financing. This morning  President Obama called for such unity in fighting radical fundamentalists. I would ask: What is the difference between the effects of terrorist acts perpetrated by radical fundamentalists and the effects of the terrorist acts perpetrated by those who traffic in drugs? What is the difference?Today the international community is discussing what happens in other regions of the world when children  young people and families are displaced by war  violence and radical extremists. Those are all situations that we as a nation also condemn. Of course we do. However  little is being said and about the thousands of families living in the northern triangle of Central America. I do not want to believe that this issue will simply be forgotten. As human beings  we cannot allow that to happen. I would once again ask the Assembly: What is the difference between those displaced by violence in other regions and those displaced by the violence committed by drug traffickers and transnational criminals? What is the difference?One difference is that those displaced — those thousands of families and individual children — come knocking on the doors of the United States of America. As a region  we cannot continue to ignore this human drama  which affects thousands of Central Americans  especially unaccompanied migrant minors who  on their way to the United States  have been the victims of violence  transnational crime  rape  human trafficking and the organ trade. Many have died or disappeared in the desert. We cannot forget that. Those children deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. They are innocent victims. We are talking about innocent children just like our children and grandchildren. They are vulnerable human beings.I would like to inform the Assembly that yesterday  the Secretary-General kindly agreed to have me  along with the ministers of Guatemala and El Salvador  present to him the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle  which maps out an initiative to support and create opportunities so that our countrymen are able to stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with everyone in our region — and I repeat  everyone  because this cause is our common responsibility.An important part of the solution to the child migration problem is to create job opportunities for their parents there  in Central America  and to improve security for young people there  in Central America. Both issues are closely linked to the trade policies of the United States. We are not asking for financial assistance or charity. What we are asking for is just and equitable trade treatment  as is already given to other countries in the world. What we want is to jobs  to create those opportunities. Honduras supports efforts to unite the world in peace and prosperity through just trade and better access to major world markets. Within that vision  and in the context of the current negotiations  we demand that Honduras and Central America receive the same commercial treatment as Asian countries do  in order to enable us to compete.To be frank  the United States giving preferential tariffs and rules of origin to other countries and leaving Honduras and Central America out of that would lead to thousands of jobs being lost in our region and would lead more children to illegally cross the border. I say to President Obama  Congress  the North American people and the people of the world: Honduras is committed to solving the child migration issue and to fighting drug trafficking. Many of them know this  clearly  given our determination. But if there is not a reasonable degree of coherence in our countries’ trade policies  as partners  what is the real message to our people in Central America? What should Honduran children and their parents expect  in Central America?Given the many problems we face as Hondurans  we have learned to see every crisis as an opportunity  and my Government follows the Christian principles of solidarity and the common good. We are promoting a very ambitious programme called A Better Life  through which we are making small changes and solving big problems. I am pleased to note that  now  some of those with the biggest fortunes are also promoting solidarity. I invite us all to ask: How much money is enough for a human being to feel fulfilled?(spoke in English)How much money is good enough?(spoke in Spanish)A few days ago we read about the humanitarian action being undertaken by one of the world’s richest men  Mr. Bill Gates  who  through his foundation  is seeking A Better Life in terms of health for thousands of poor families by promoting scientific research into new designs for basic sanitation systems. I think Mr. Bill Gates found the answer to the question.(spoke in English)How much money is good enough?(spoke in Spanish)As we are working on the same issue  I take this opportunity  with the Assembly’s permission  to invite Mr. Bill Gates  a citizen of the world  to my country to work on this common endeavour.It is very encouraging that some of the wealthiest people in the world are not seeking the secret of eternal youth  or trying to send expeditions to other planets while our brothers are dying on this one. On the contrary  they are aware of the problems of their poorer brethren. This is going on in many countries  including Honduras  where many good businesspeople have signed on to work with our A Better Life programme and are demonstrating social responsibility by creating jobs. And that is what this is all about — solidarity and social responsibility  but not romantic social responsibility. In that regard  I would like to quote Pope Francis  a citizen of the world  whose words I hope will ring in our ears.“I have never seen a moving van following a funeral procession  but there is a treasure we can take with us  a treasure that no one can take away — not those things we have kept for ourselves  but what we have given to others”.We should think about that and consider those words. Honduras is a country where 43 per cent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day  which is not enough to pay for a person’s basic nutritional needs. That is why we are making a major effort to respond to these people’s needs through the Better Life programme  thus enabling them to live with dignity. The Better Life programme is designed to respond to the needs of 835 000 families  who are getting help in improving their homes  including providing access to drinking water and basic sanitation  decent roofs overhead and floors underfoot  family gardens and monetary support to ensure that children attend school  have improved health care and change their living conditions so as to achieve a better life.Our housing improvements include the use of clean stoves  reducing wood consumption and smoke  which is harmful to women and children’s health and which  according to the World Health Organization  kills 500 000 women around the world every year. In Central America alone  about 35 000 people die from the wood smoke emitted from dirty cooking stoves every year. With every eco or clean stove installed  we make a contribution to the rest of humankind by saving 15 medium-sized trees every year  thus helping to protect the environment. In that regard  I would like to highlight the work of former United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves initiative  whose goal is to put clean stoves in 100 million households by 2020. On this subject we share Mrs. Clinton’s vision and are working hard to achieve it.When presidents come to the General Assembly of the United Nations  they often prepare speeches they deem most appropriate and specific to the lofty heights of this great forum  but beyond the words themselves  the message I want to convey is that the most important thing is for all of us to be accepted as citizens of the world  with the same duty to fight and defend our territory  our families and our planet  with the same right to aspire to a better life  and that what is vital is the support of those who have the most to those who have the least. If my message today can reach and move a few to act  I think it will have been worth coming. I would like to remind the Assembly that if we are part of the largest forum in the world  it is because we consider ourselves to be citizens of the world  human beings with the same dignity  and therefore all of us  everyone of us  equal. Honduras is making progress; Honduras is changing; Honduras sends its greetings to all."
"73",3038,"HRV",69,2014,"The topic of this general debate  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  most fittingly depicts our common priority before the Organization’s seventieth anniversary next autumn. We are about to set the stage for strategic decisions and concrete actions that should deliver comprehensive and transformational changes at the global and national levels.Wars and armed conflicts  natural diseases  pandemic diseases  lingering poverty and many other existing or potential threats to human lives and human rights keep on emerging. If we do not react adamantly and swiftly to tackle those perils early enough in their emerging phases  we run the risk that they will increase exponentially and beyond our control. More than ever before  we must face the fact that security  development and human rights are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. They demand to be at the very heart of the post-2015 agenda.At this time  we are also witnessing a type of dangerous discord that spreads a fear of the worst possible outcome — the same kind of fear that preceded the birth of the Organization. The Charter of the United Nations provides us with so much wisdom; its words came with the experience of the scourge of war and misery. What we need at this point is to reinvigorate the same level of determination we had almost seven decades ago and to do everything we can to avoid regression.Croatia is deeply concerned about the situation in Ukraine. There is none but a peaceful solution to the conflict. The suffering of so many people is unfortunately all too familiar. Croatia echoes the call to stop the violence and to reach a political solution. Croatia strongly supports the principles of international law concerning the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.Similarly  we share the grave concern over the terrorism and violence spreading around the world  most notably in the Middle East and Africa. The sheer magnitude of destruction  the loss of lives and unspeakable atrocities  most notably those committed by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham  can be overshadowed only by the growing threat that they will not stop soon or at any border  and that they will continue to grow and devour everything our civilization stands for. A zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism and a joint global effort are needed to prevent that from happening. Croatia supports all ongoing efforts to form a coalition against the so-called Islamic State. We stand ready to make a contribution to Iraqi and Iraqi Kurdish forces.Also  although it is a difficult task  achieving a stable and sustainable peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians is an imperative. We hope that honest and serious efforts will be resumed to negotiate a comprehensive and sustainable peace agreement that will establish the grounds for a two-State solution  living in peace and security  mutually recognizing and respecting each other  and gradually transforming the entire Middle East into a region of peace and cooperation.The situation in the world brings the need for the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to the centre of our attention. In that regard  the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will be of particular importance  and Croatia hopes that the Treaty will be reinforced and strengthened as an outcome of the Conference. Croatia also commends the unprecedented international effort aimed at the destruction of the chemical weapons of the Syrian Arab Republic. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Mission’s successful work demonstrates the indispensable role of the United Nations.It is truly unnerving to be confronted with the problems and crises that I have mentioned  while our very best effort is needed to overcome obstacles such as climate change  natural disasters and the scarcity and degradation of resources  especially food and drinking water. The crises are interlinked. Therefore  we need an interlinked and integrated response to them. Again  no serious thought can be given to sustainable development without ensuring peace and security.Some conflicts could have been foreseen  prevented and even averted if the international community had acted in a timely and decisive way. While  indeed  the primary responsibility lies with the sovereign State itself  regional and global organizations have the tools  and therefore also the obligation  to assist those States. One effective method in that regard is peacebuilding  where we help post-conflict societies to stand on their own. There is a vast pool of global experience in peacebuilding that could be applied  including that of my own country. We therefore hope that the upcoming review of the United Nations peacebuilding architecture will consolidate the existing knowledge and experience and bring fresh ideas as to how to improve the overall peacebuilding process.A special role in maintaining peace and advancing development lies with women. In particular  we see the role of women in achieving successful conflict resolution and the sustainable development of post-conflict societies. We strongly advocate women’s economic empowerment for peacebuilding and development. That is why we are organizing a high-level meeting at United Nations Headquarters on the gender dimension of sustainable development within the context of post-conflict recovery on 26 September.This week  we started discussing climate change — the pressing issue of today. Croatia is as vulnerable as any other country. The devastating and unprecedented floods that we are witnessing now are proof of that. Yesterday  we all renewed our vow to boldly and ambitiously tackle that global issue  which is clearly of great importance. Croatia hopes that the upcoming Lima and Paris conferences will lead us to a global agreement in key areas  including climate financing and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. That remains one of the main pillars of the transformative post-2015 development agenda.Bearing in mind the need for progress  we have committed ourselves to implementing the Millennium Development Goals. That is our unfinished business. The implementation and evaluation of the Millennium Development Goals have made us all conscious of the fact that such a vital process needs to be continued. Croatia is pleased that  in that regard  we have been building the truly transformative and people-centred framework of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Those goals represent the central investment in our common future. We must put the maximum effort into making the SDGs a reality and into supporting their continuous implementation at all levels. Those goals represent an opportunity for long-term development that humankind cannot afford to miss. In that vein  we have supported the importance of good governance and the rule of law as the enablers and an inseparable part of sustainable development. Everyone has a role to play: national Governments  international organizations  the private sector  civil society  academia  the media and the various other stakeholders.A key principle that matters to my country is equality among all human beings  regardless of their beliefs  race  gender  national origin  ethnicity  religion  disability  sexual orientation or other status. Croatia fully supports the pivotal role of the United Nations and its human rights mechanisms  in particular the Human Rights Council  on the two tracks  namely  to further develop and strengthen the protection of human rights and to effectively respond in a timely way to the challenges of the gross violation and systematic abuse of human rights worldwide. We firmly believe that sustainable development goes hand in hand with democracy  which should be approached in a holistic manner. That said  a number of international mechanisms ensure stable democracies and sustainable development by eliminating double standards  insecurity and impunity. We therefore add our voice to the calls for universal adherence to the Rome Statute and the universal jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.As I have already mentioned  we have recently witnessed all kinds of natural disasters. Such situations demand swift and prompt national and international actions  first and foremost  to mitigate the immediate threat  as the same time as taking care of victims and delivering humanitarian aid. The outbreak of epidemic diseases also has a similar effect. A recent example is the Ebola epidemic in some West African nations. It denotes a matter for solidarity and understanding and demands the world’s immediate and comprehensive response to the multifaceted medical  social  economic and security crisis.Croatia will continue to provide assistance to the most vulnerable people  especially considering that we have rich expertise in the area of capacity-building programmes in a humanitarian crisis  in raising awareness of the dangers of landmines and other unexploded ordnance of war and in providing psychosocial support to victims of violence. In addition  let me point out that Croatia was dedicated and active in delivering humanitarian aid to the flooded regions of its neighbouring countries of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina this spring  while we ourselves also faced grave floods and their consequences in Croatia. We all need more solidarity at the regional and the global levels.One of the most important goals of my presidency has been and continues to be the promotion of dialogue and cooperation instead of conflict as a means of achieving security and stability for Croatia  as well as every other country in the world. I am proud to say that Croatia has come a long way in that respect.With the World Summit in 2005  we started reforming the United Nations system. Despite all the progress made  we have not managed to achieve concrete results with regard to the reform of the Security Council. Moreover  we would like to see the Council more engaged in preventing crises and its ongoing dedication to its Charter duties rather than to any particular interest. In order to maintain the Council’s authority  relevance and indispensability in maintaining global peace and security  its reform needs to be comprehensive and without further delay.On numerous occasions  Croatia has stated its position on Security Council reform. In our view  the enlargement should happen in both the permanent and the non-permanent categories of membership  including one additional non-permanent seat for the Eastern European States. The enlargement is closely linked to the reform of the working methods of the Security Council  including the question of the use of the veto power. Croatia welcomes and supports the initiative to establish a code of conduct with regard to the suspension of the use of the veto in cases relating to a mass crime.On another note  we strongly believe that the consolidation of the European space will be possible only through the further stabilization and security of South-Eastern Europe. We look forward to the day when all countries of the region will finally be admitted to the European Union. Croatia has been and will continue to be an advocate for a continuous and strong focus on South-Eastern Europe. The countries of the region are finding an increasing number of ways to cooperate together and to lay the foundation for the joint development of sustainable peace and stability  be it with regard to the recent devastating floods or to dealing with a difficult past  while achieving truth and justice on the issues of missing persons or of setting the stage for major infrastructure and transport projects.In conclusion  allow me to address an issue that I personally believe can be one of the best remedies for achieving social improvement  economic advance and  consequently  political stability — education. That is why I strongly support the Secretary-General’s Global Education First Initiative. Knowledge and education are major driving forces of societies and one of the most important preconditions for success and sustainable development. Disparities in knowledge and its distribution  access and application have become major factors in determining the overall success of a nation and the level of its development. It is the best guarantee that the world’s development and stability will go hand in hand and that global peace and security with thus become stronger than ever."
"74",3083,"HTI",69,2014,"Since the Charter of the United Nations was adopted in San Francisco  the international community has made it a true act of faith in setting up a new international order based on the ideals and values that elevate human dignity and encourage sustainable development and solidarity among peoples. It is an honour for me to speak before the General Assembly  convened for nearly 70 years  to address key issues of justice  universal peace and security.I take this opportunity to send Mr. Sam Kutesa my warmest congratulations on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. His proven experience on international issues and the United Nations system is a guarantee of the success of the work that will be taken up at this session. He can be assured of the full cooperation of the Haitian delegation.I commend the remarkable work of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. I pay special tribute to him for his courage and commitment to the cause of peace worldwide. As humanitarian crises and conflicts between States threaten the stability and security of peoples of the world  the Secretary-General’s leadership has repeatedly demonstrated that there is always a way to resolve our differences through dialogue  understanding and mutual respect.That is why I encourage the United Nations to continue to support the good relations between the parties on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and the peaceful and constructive approaches to establish lasting peace in East Asia and the East China Sea.We in the Caribbean have chosen to take the path of dialogue with our neighbour to the east for the good of our two peoples and in order to preserve peace in the region. We believe in the power of dialogue. We are convinced that it is always necessary to engage in negotiation and productive discussions. We readily agreed to come to the negotiating table with our friends from the Dominican Republic to set out the real problens of mutual interest for the benefit of our two peoples and to resolve half-century-old misunderstandings. We welcome the fact that a number of agreements have been reached on issues that were not always easy to resolve. We hope to be able to continue on that path towards a better understanding between two States that share the same island.Despite a challenging route  70 years later it is clear that this common project that is the United Nations has lost nothing of its topicality and relevance. At a time when hotbeds of international tension persist  the enlightened Powers of our planet must unite to preserve peace  democracy  stability  human rights and development. In that context  in line with the new realities of this century  Haiti argues strongly for concrete progress in the negotiations for United Nations reform  particularly with regard to the enlargement of the Security Council to include new permanent members.The example of inclusion must begin where the right to participation is a fundamental right expressed through the Charter of the United Nations. Our voice counts. Our leadership  being responsible  must be expressed through concrete and tangible actions when peace  the health of our environment and the health of our people are threatened. In that connection  I wish to pay tribute to our Cuban brothers  among other peoples of the world  who have supported African countries affected by Ebola.As much as we have a moral responsibility to raise our voice against injustice whatever its origin  against fanaticism  to reject repression and violence in all its forms and to fight discrimination and prejudices that hinder solidarity among peoples  we also have an obligation to recognize and encourage efforts to unite people.The legitimacy and credibility of the United Nations depends upon its ability to act quickly and respond effectively in recognizing the added value of each Member State. More than ever  problems must be addressed pragmatically. That is an urgent matter in these times of political tensions on a global scale and of the spread of some diseases that are just as devastating. Moreover  the international community is greatly challenged by the resurgence of a brutal and fanatical international terrorism in a new form. The United Nations is and remains today our best defence against those challenges through respect for the dignity of peoples and through the participation and inclusion of everyone.Allow me to present the situation in my country  the Republic of Haiti.The Haitian people are at a decisive turning point in their long march in search of stability  democracy and progress  towards the consolidation of democratic institutions established 27 years ago with the adoption of the 1987 Constitution. After more than two decades punctuated by disasters of all kinds  Haiti has made undeniable progress over the past three years in terms of consolidating democracy and the rule of law  strengthening its institutions and protecting human rights  reducing poverty and laying the foundations for sustained growth and long-lasting development. We are aware that the road that should lead Haiti to socioeconomic stability is still long. However  the obstacles  however daunting they may be  are not insurmountable.In terms of security  the situation has improved to the point where Haiti has become one of the safest countries in the Caribbean. The Government has made great efforts to strengthen the professionalism of the Haitian National Police. I maintain and reaffirm my stance on the need for a gradual and orderly withdrawal of United Nations troops from Haitian soil. That process has in fact already commenced  along with the strengthening of the operational capacity of the National Police of Haiti  which will allow it to take over from the forces of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti.I wish to make a plea for better coordination of the work of United Nations agencies with national institutions and for taking into account the real needs of the country.With regard to education  70 per cent of pupils in the first two years of primary school receive a free education. For the first time in Haiti  5 per cent of the gross domestic product is earmarked for education. Today  the net school enrolment rate has increased significantly. We are working hard to reach the Millennium Development Goals  which are set at 100 per cent in this regard  as the Assembly knows.In the area of health  we have stepped up efforts to reduce the incidence of diseases such as AIDS  malaria and vector-borne diseases. The significant increase in health centres across the country has improved access to care and led to a reduction in maternal and infant mortality. Maternal mortality fell from 350 to 157 per 100 000 live births per 100 000. Through our Ministry of Health  we were able to build and rehabilitate more than 200 health facilities. And to strengthen governance in health  we are committed to the ongoing training of our health professionals so they can provide better care and services. With regard to cholera  while assuming our duty to our fellow citizens  Haiti calls for a decisive commitment from the United Nations to contribute to the National Plan for the Eradication of Cholera.With regard to the economy  major reforms have been put in place to improve the business environment. The increased flow of foreign capital and the number of tourists visiting our country are tangible evidence of the improving business climate in Haiti. We are resolutely focused on our goal of making Haiti an investment destination  not a humanitarian destination.On the political front  Haiti will conduct free  honest and transparent elections as soon as possible for the renewal of democratic and constitutional institutions. That is a necessary step. Democratic rules require it  and I will uphold republican principles until the end. As Head of State  guarantor of the stability of institutions  I have spared no effort to find consensus among all parties and institutions involved in the organization of legislative and municipal elections. Despite the discrepancies  in the spirit of Jean-Jacques Dessalines  I am confident that together we will arrive at such consensus. I look forward to bringing my fellow citizens together around the table to provide that harmonious area marked by the purest ideals that the Haitian people have established for themselves  ideals that we remain firmly committed to.I would like to reiterate the support of the Republic of Haiti to the fight that the United Nations is leading to eradicate poverty. While waiting for the summit to be held next year in which Member States will decide on the post-2015 development agenda  I can already express the confidence of my Administration in the sustainable development goals intended to replace the Millennium Development Goals.The world currently has enormous resources. Our challenge is to find effective ways and means to ensure that they are distributed in an equitable and just manner. I remain convinced that our commitment to reduce poverty and inequality throughout the world is necessary. It is in that spirit that the Republic of Haiti joins the international community to contribute its part to meet that challenge. It is suitable  therefore  that we heighten the effectiveness of the Organization and give it the necessary and sufficient resources in the exercise of that mission.Our goal is for that truly to become the basis of a system of security and collective solidarity that is able to ensure the rule of law and to preserve peace and international security; a system able to prioritize basic freedoms and human rights; a system able to promote strong growth that is careful to respect the environment and development that responds to current needs without risking the future of generations to come. It is up to us  on the eve of the seventieth anniversary of the Charter of the United Nations  to transmit that new spirit  so indispensable to the promotion and defense of the universal values of which we are the custodians."
"75",3129,"HUN",69,2014,"“If you seek peace  prepare for war.” Those are the words of Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus’ fourth- or fifth-century tract De Re Militari  written more than 1 600 years ago. People have quoted that saying numerous times and in many circumstances. If the Assembly believes after all this that I am going to speak about the wars and armed conflicts raging throughout the world  it is mistaken. Instead  I would like to speak to the Assembly about a war and a battle that we seem to be losing. It is a war we are waging against our own natural environment and against our own human nature.Two days ago here in the General Assembly Hall  many heard the words of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and President Obama about the dire consequences of climate change (see A/69/PV.6). We heard very detailed statistics illustrating the gravity of the situation and the need for us to pool our efforts. And we have been preparing for that for a long time.When did we first notice signs of trouble with the environment? Few people may know that the first clear signal came in 1896  when a Swedish scientist wrote that an increase in the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide would lead to a temperature rise; 60 years later  we had precise measurements to substantiate his statement. Another 30 years had to pass before here  in the United Nations  it was understood that some type of treaty or agreement would be necessary in the future to deal with the issue. Another 10 years had to pass before the Kyoto Protocol was signed. Between the first realization and the Kyoto agreement a century had passed.After Kyoto  a number of conferences  scientific meetings and political gatherings were held. In recent decades  many people have spoken on many occasions about the consequences of climate change and the need to do something. Still the situation has continued to deteriorate. Let me cite one statistic. Since 1990 — that is  during the past 25 years — despite all the resolve  the Kyoto agreement and all the promises  we have seen a 30 per cent increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.Despite the fact that Mother Nature has warned us again and again  adverse climate events continue to occur one after the other. Allow me to mention a few examples from the past year. In 2013 in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India  there were freezing temperatures in January  which was unprecedented. At the same time  in Lapland in Finland — not exactly the Mediterranean region — in May the temperature had reached 31°C  while Bethlehem experienced a white Christmas that no one remembered having seen before. In Australia  over the course of 90 days last summer  123 temperature records were set.The Danube is the largest river in Europe and it has warned us again and again. Allow me to report a Hungarian example. Since before the Second World War  the Danube River has flooded many times  but until recently it had never risen to the level of 8 metres  even at the flood’s highest point. In the past four years  the Danube has risen above 8 metres on four separate occasions. In fact last year  it rose close to 9 metres.Floods  typhoons and other adverse meteorological events are taking place in regions where they have never occurred before and at unprecedented times of the year. We are meeting here in New York. Two years ago here in New York  Hurricane Sandy caused damage valued at $20 billion  and more than 40 people died. This all took place despite the fact that for years on end the New York City leadership had been cautioned by scientists that trouble would occur and that protection for embankments  among others  must be strengthened. A few hundred million dollars would have been spent to that end; instead  the damage caused by Sandy cost far more. That is why  two days ago  the Assembly heard the Mayor of New York speak of the next 35 years and the desire to reduce New York’s emissions by 80 per cent.In recent days  we have spoken on many occasions about our preparations for the 2015 Paris conference and the desire to reach an agreement there. I believe that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon needs to be recognized in that regard. He has truly done his utmost to ensure that we can reach a common conclusion in Paris in 2015. The question is  are we Member States doing all we can? Will we do all that we can to ensure success in Paris?The speeches I have heard over the past few days have not made me optimistic. The speeches I have heard deflected responsibility and reflected a type of political narrow-mindedness that is not terribly promising. Why can we not listen to the wisdom and advice of our scientists? Why can we not accept scientific results that today appear evident? Why can we not accept the signals being dispatched by our planet? Why can we not learn from all of the lessons provided by Mother Nature? Why are we not learning from our own example?There is one good example that we could learn from. It involves chlorofluorocarbon gases and the damage they cause to the ozone layer. Basically  those gases were first used in the 1950s. It took only 30 years for the ozone layer to be reduced by 40 per cent in the area above Antarctica. That was also enough time for people in every country to understand the medical consequences. I note  among others  the high incidence of dermatological cancers. It was basically only at the very last moment in Montreal that an agreement was struck  as a result of which we banned those gases. After 35 years  last week we saw the first report discussing a regeneration of the ozone layer.Regarding political narrow-mindedness  we saw examples of that in the past. I will cite one. United States President Reagan’s Secretary of the Interior  Donald Hodel  said that one way to protect against the thinning ozone layer was to purchase wide-brim hats and wear dark sunglasses. Why must we wait for the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide to result in a situation as serious as that involving the ozone layer? Why can we not  late next year  make Paris as successful as Montreal?I believe that the problem is larger than we imagine. Scientists already agree that the desired and often articulated objective of limiting the temperature increase to 2°C has become increasingly elusive. Only a few days ago  we read that the carbon dioxide concentration has never been higher than it was last year. We may well have reached the point at which  whether or not we come to an agreement today or tomorrow  scientists will tell us that all the consequences of irresponsible decisions past and present would still be felt in the future in the form of floods  typhoons and other adverse climate events.We have to come to terms with the idea — and I would say that it will be very difficult — that the coming generation  our children’s generation  will￼unfortunately have to live with that situation. We will have to pay a dear price for our irresponsible environmental policies.Today it is no longer enough to reduce emissions. It is no longer enough to agree to reduce emissions. We have to prepare for more and more serious natural events and disasters. We have to heed the advice of Nicholas Stern  who said eight years ago that if we did not spend 1 per cent of our gross domestic product (GDP) on prevention  then the environmental damage we would suffer could amount to as much as 20 per cent of GDP.I have just cited the example of New York City. A few hundred million dollars would have been enough tomitigate damages totaling several billion. The New York example tells us that we are not in the twenty-fourth hour  but in the twenty-fifth. The tragedy endured by this metropolis  the host of our meeting  again justifies the words of Vegetius  somewhat amended to the situation — if you seek calm  prepare for disaster."
"76",3176,"IDN",69,2014,"It is a great honour for me to stand once again before the Assembly — the last time I shall do so in my two terms as President of Indonesia. I could not agree more with the theme chosen for this session  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  which is very much in line with the work of the High-level Panel I have been privileged to co-chair.For the past 15 years  the international community has been working on a grand and ambitious project for humankind  the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Our hard work over the years has produced achievements that include breakthroughs in combating poverty  increasing school enrolment and improving public health. Those achievements are encouraging and  in some instances  inspiring. But humankind as a whole has not achieved all the MDG targets. The successes have been uneven  differing between regions  within regions and even within countries. We have come a long way  yet we still have a long way to go.For those who have made it  as well as for those who have yet to make it  I have learned one great lesson  which is that the most important driver of change lies in governance — not just good governance  but smart governance. Smart governance usually involves innovative leadership and active public participation. Without at least those two elements  all the hard work we put in will not produce the desired results. And with smart governance  nations can exceed their potential and leapfrog over others ahead of them. In Indonesia we have managed to increase our national per capita income by 400 per cent within just one decade  something that was beyond our wildest imagination.The quest to achieve the MDGs over the past 15 years has also reinforced the need for a more robust global partnership. There has certainly been much activity. But somehow  our efforts in the World Trade Organization  on the post-Kyoto climate  on reforming the global financial architecture and the United Nations and in many other areas have proved painfully slow.As we set forth a new global agenda for development  I believe we can draw on those years of trial and error to become more acutely aware of the promises and pitfalls of development  and of what we want and what we do not want. We do not want development that measures progress in terms of material possessions alone and ends up dehumanizing and marginalizing our citizens. What we want is sustainable development with equity.Yet the importance of our work lies beyond the issue of development  since we are now also confronted with yet another major problem. We are witnessing a worrying deterioration in the relations between the major Powers. None of us  certainly not the United Nations  can afford to bury our heads in the sand about that grim development.It is especially worrying  given that for more than two decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall  the world actually witnessed a series of promising events. Most fundamental was the fact that improved relations among the major Powers created ample space for new strategic and economic opportunities. Global trade totals have reached $23 trillion  an almost six-fold expansion since the year after the Cold War ended in 1990. The fastest growth — one and a half times as fast as during the preceding two decades — was from 2000 to 2013  the period that coincided with our work on the MDGs. The value of global investments reached almost $1.5 trillion in 2013 for a near seven-fold increase since 1990.In South-East Asia  that positive geopolitical development has allowed us to develop stronger cooperation and to develop the region’s architecture. It led to the establishment of the East Asia Summit  a vision for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) community  a progressive ASEAN Charter  a more active ASEAN Regional Forum and other institutions. And Indonesia has also been able to develop strategic partnerships with all the major Powers as well as with many emerging Powers.Today I see that the international community is concerned about the danger of the old Cold War returning. Major-Power relations are worsening  fuelled by mutual suspicion. Relationships that were previously stable and cooperative are now marked by volatility and tension. That benefits no one  and we should therefore not let it become permanent. The major Powers — indeed  all of us — have an obligation to work together to resolve the major issues of our time. To mention only a few  we must end the suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza and the rest of the occupied territory and deliver the still elusive two-State solution. We must resolve the conflict in Ukraine that is now upsetting relations between Russia and the West. And we must find an effective and durable solution to the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Iraq.To do all of this  there must be mutual accommodation. There must be a forward-looking attitude that embraces a win-win predisposition rather than a zero-sum attitude. Diplomacy must take precedence. The deficit of trust must be transformed into strategic opportunities and confidence-building. It is not enough just to call for peaceful coexistence. That is so twentieth century. Here in the twenty-first century  we need much more than conditions in which world Powers merely peacefully coexist. We need those Powers to work passionately together in order to foster strategic cooperation and to tackle global issues. They must begin to turn the trust deficit into a new strategic trust not only among themselves but also with emerging Powers and with all nations of the United Nations. Is that possible? I would say a resolute yes  for that is what has transpired in South-East Asia. In the second half of the 1960s  South-East Asian nations were poor  divided and insecure  threatened by a war raging in their neighbourhood and ignorant of one another after centuries of separation during the colonial past.The establishment of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations enabled countries in the region to form the habit of dialogue and consultation with one another and to learn to trust one another. Today  we can proudly say that the once-divided 10 South-East Asian nations now belong to ASEAN-10. Together  they are all drivers of regional affairs and masters of their own destiny. A number of sensitive inter-State and intra-State conflicts have been peacefully resolved. Those that remain are being addressed through dialogue and negotiation. Economic interdependence has become the norm of the day.Moreover  South-East Asia is on the verge of becoming a true community. We regard that as the apex of strategic trust  which we believe can be replicated everywhere. The culture of peace and coexistence that we are trying to attain in Indonesia and in the ASEAN region is clearly the antidote to the poison of fundamentalist prejudice and deep intolerance  as practised by a terrorist group in Iraq and Syria that falsely defines itself as the Islamic State. The ideology of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant not only betrays the true teaching of Islam as a religion of peace but also harms and seriously upsets the Islamic Ummah throughout the world.It has been a great privilege to forge closer bonds between Indonesia and all nations represented in this great assembly  the United Nations. As I look back  I must admit that there remain many challenges that Indonesia must resolve. Some of our efforts are already on the right track. In a world desperately grappling with climate change  we are progressively and boldly applying a moratorium on deforestation — our important contribution to reducing carbon emission. In a world of economic uncertainty  we have increased our national income per capita by 400 per cent within just a short decade.In a world witnessing rising extremism  Indonesia continues to hold firm to the values of freedom  tolerance  moderation and multiculturalism  which form the basis of our nationhood. In a world still burdened by insurgencies  we have managed to find a permanent peaceful political solution to end the 30-year conflict in Aceh province. In a world marked by turbulent transitions in the Middle East  time and again we have shown to our people and to the world that  in Indonesia  democracy  Islam  modernity and human rights go together.In a world often stigmatized by the past  Indonesia has opened a entire new chapter of peaceful relations with Timor-Leste on the basis on equality and mutual respect. In a world where territorial disputes often erupt into open conflicts  Indonesia has continued to peacefully resolve  one by one  the overlapping maritime borders with Vietnam  the Philippines  Singapore and other nations.The Indonesian and South-East Asian experiences underscore the dawn of a new age of globalism for the twenty-first century — a world that openly embraces change as opposed to being intimidated by it. What the world so desperately needs today is a pioneering spirit: the boldness to break old boundaries and to create new frontiers. Given that spirit  I believe that humankind can overcome the challenge of climate change  conquer poverty  eradicate social injustice  hasten the global economic recovery and create a culture of peace among all religions  including the Abrahamic faiths. In that spirit  we can  hopefully  end the cycle of violence  hatred  fear and humiliation that has made so many conflicts around the world seem intractable for decades and centuries.In saying that  I am neither a Utopian nor a blind idealist in understanding international relations. However  I believe that  with a strong commitment and political will  we can make the impossible possible. As we say in Indonesia  where there is a will  there is a way. We must drive the frontiers of nationalism into a new globalism  where we can devise solutions to national  regional and global issues at the same time. We must achieve a new globalism  where no nation is left behind and no nation dominates and where rights are protected and responsibilities are met. In the world of a new globalism  wars are unthinkable. In the first place  wars are fought because nations play a zero-sum game  where the winners take all and the losers weep — the game of us against them  which the “us” must win and the “them” must lose. Winners today are losers tomorrow.Let me conclude by saying that now is the time for all of us to start the serious business of building a new world of peace  prosperity and justice and of making everybody a winner by creating and nurturing the new all-inclusive “we” that leaves no one behind."
"77",3223,"IND",69,2014,"At the outset  I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.It is a truly a great honour for me to address the Assembly for the first time as Prime Minister of India. I am humbled by the hopes and expectations of the people of India. I am also mindful of the expectations of the world from our 1.25 billion people.My country  India  is home to one sixth of the world’s population. It is a nation experiencing economic and social transformation on a scale rarely seen in the history of the world. Every country’s world view is shaped by its civilization and its philosophical traditions. India’s ancient wisdom sees the world as one family  and when I say this  I wish to make it clear that each country has its philosophy. I am not talking about ideology. With the inspiration of that philosophy  a country marches ahead. India is a country that since its Vedic times  has been saying that the world  the entire globe  is a family. India is a country where  beyond nature  we have a communication  a dialogue  with nature. We never struggle with nature. That is a part of Indian life. The reason is that with that philosophy  India has been moving forward. Each country and each nation is shaped by its civilization and its philosophical tradition. India’s ancient wisdom  as I have said  sees the world as one family. India is a country that not only speaks for itself but for worldwide justice  dignity  opportunity and prosperity. We have always spoken out in support of such issues.Owing to our ideology  we have a firm belief in multilateralism. Today  as I stand here  I am equally aware of the hopes and expectations that are pinned on the General Assembly. I am struck by the sacred belief that brought us together. We established the Organization on the basis of great principles and perspectives  in the belief that if our futures are connected  we will have to work together for peace and security  for human rights and for the economic development of all. We must work together to those ends. At that time  there were only 51 countries. Today  193 sovereign flags fly in front of this building. Each new country enters on the basis of the same belief and expectation.In the past six decades  we have been able to achieve a great deal. We have ended many wars. We have established and maintained peace. We have assisted economic development in many places. We have helped to build a future for poor children. We have contributed towards the elimination of starvation and strived to save our planet. The 69 United Nations peacekeeping missions have made the Blue Helmet a symbol of peace in the world.Today  there is a surge of democracy across the world. The peaceful democratic transformation in Afghanistan shows that the Afghan people’s aspiration for peace will definitely triumph over violence. We have seen Nepal emerge from war towards peace and democracy. Bhutan’s young democracy is flourishing. There are also efforts towards democracy in West Asia and North Africa. Tunisia’s success shows that such a path of democracy is possible. In Africa  there is a new momentum for stability  peace and progress  and a new awareness is on the horizon.We have seen unprecedented prosperity in Asia and beyond founded on strengthened peace and stability. Latin America  a continent of enormous potential  is coming together in the shared pursuit of stability and prosperity. That continent may prove to be an important anchor for the global community. India looks forward to a peaceful and stable environment for its development. Our future is linked to our neighbourhood. That is why  from the very first day  my Government gave the highest priority to promoting friendship and cooperation with our neighbouring countries.I have the same policy towards Pakistan. I want to hold serious bilateral talks with Pakistan in order to improve friendship and cooperation in a peaceful atmosphere  without the shadow of terrorism. I want to hold bilateral talks with that country. However  it is also Pakistan’s responsibility to come forward and to genuinely establish the appropriate atmosphere for bilateral talks. In raising that issue in this forum  I do not know how successful our efforts will be. Some people are doubtful.Today  we need to assist the victims of the floods in Kashmir. In India  we have organized large-scale assistance. We have not stopped at only India helping Kashmir. We have also asked Pakistan to assist  since that area was also affected by the floods. We have told Pakistan that just as we were helping the flood victims in India  we would also like to help those in Pakistan. We have proposed that. We are a part of the developing world but have limited resources. We would like to share our modest resources with all those who are in dire need of assistance.Today  the world is witnessing a high level of tension and turmoil. There are no major wars  but tension and conflict abound. There is an absence of peace and uncertainty about the future. Even today  there is rampant poverty everywhere. The Asia-Pacific region  which is integrating  is still concerned about maritime security. That is fundamental to its future. Europe faces a new threat of division. In West Asia  the dividing lines and terrorism are increasing. In our own region  we are still struggling to combat terrorism and instability. For the past four decades  we have faced such a threat.Terrorism emerges in new forms and under new names. Be it small or large  in the North  the South  the East or the West  no country is free from threats. I remember when I met with world leaders 20 years ago  and we talked about terrorism. They did not quite understand it and stated that it was a law-and-order problem. Today  the entire world is witness to the slow spread of terrorism far and wide.Are we really making integrated efforts at the international level to fight against those powerful groups? I know that terrorism is a very serious problem for discussion. Even today  some countries are giving refuge to international terrorists  and they consider terrorism a tool of their policy. Good terrorism and bad terrorism — that is what we hear these days. At this time  there is a question mark regarding our struggle to fight against terrorism. The brutal return of terrorism in West Asia and its impact on countries far and near has elicited a concerted effort  which we welcome. However  the effort should involve all the countries of the region. If we want to overcome terrorism  then they must all contribute towards its eradication. We strongly emphasize this.Oceans  seas  space and cyberspace  besides contributing to our common wealth and prosperity  are becoming new theatres of conflict. In the same oceans that used to connect us  we are today hearing news of disputes. We once saw space as holding out potential for our achievements. Today  in cyberspace  which connects us in important areas  new dangers are being seen. International harmony and cooperation — on which the United Nations was founded — are needed now more than ever before. Today  we talk about an interdependent world  but have we become more united as nations? We need to think about that.Why  when we have a good forum like the United Nations  do we keep creating so many different groups? There is the Group of Four  the Group of Seven and the Group of 20 — and the numbers keep changing. Whether or not we really want to do so  we  including India  become members of them. Is it not the time to move on and leave behind those groups? When the United Nations celebrates its seventieth anniversary  how do we create a Group-of-All atmosphere? How can the General Assembly create an opportunity to solve all our problems? How can people begin to be more trustful? How can we become less competitive? We talk about unity  but then we divide the whole into different parts and pieces. Can we prevent ourselves from doing so?On the one hand  we say that our policies are interconnected; on the other  we think in terms of zero-sum gains. We think that if the other benefits  I stand to lose. Who receives the benefit and who suffers the loss? That is what we appear to be weighing. The pessimists are cynical. Like them  we are inclined to say nothing will change. It is easy to be cynical and to say nothing will change. But if we do that  we run the risk of shirking our responsibilities and putting our collective future in danger.We must unite and prepare to meet the needs of our times. We must really work for global peace. No one country or group of countries can determine the course of the world or its policies. It is imperative to have genuine international participation and partnership. We should try to promote positive dialogue and cooperation among countries. Our efforts must begin at the United Nations.It is important that we improve the Security Council by making it more democratic and participative. Institutions that reflect the imperatives of the twentieth century will not be effective in the twenty-first century. They face the risk of irrelevance. I would like to emphasize that the policies and rules we made in the twentieth century may no longer be applicable. The speed of change is very fast. It is therefore essential that  in tune with the times  we adapt and reformulate  making the necessary changes and introducing new ideas. Only when we have done that will we be relevant.We should set aside all our differences and mount a concerted international effort to combat terrorism and extremism. Towards that end  we should adopt a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. That is something which is long overdue. It must be emphasized that our combined strength to fight against terrorism should be reflected in the convention. Our country  which has endured so many terrorist attacks  knows that  so long as the United Nations fails to take the initiative in that effort  and so long as we do not adopt a convention  we cannot be successful. In such work  we must not forget to make provision for peace  stability and order in outer space and cyberspace. We must work together to ensure that all countries observe international rules and norms.We must include the host countries and troop-contributing countries in our decision-making on United Nations peacekeeping. If they are included  their confidence will increase considerably. They are ready to make major sacrifices and to give their time and energy. But if they are excluded from decision-making  then how can United Nations peacekeeping become more vital and urgent? We need to seriously consider that. Today  let us redouble our efforts in pursuit of global disarmament. Let us also spare no effort to ensure that we work tirelessly towards those goals.Globalization has created new industries and sources of employment. At the same time  billions live in the shadow of poverty. A great many countries are suffering economic deprivation  barely keeping their heads above water. What seems so difficult today was never so difficult in the past. Technology has made many things possible. Reduction in the cost of technology has made it more widely available. If we think of the speed with which Facebook or Twitter have spread around the world and cell-phone use has proliferated  then we must also believe that development and empowerment can spread with the same speed.It is up to each country to make its own efforts at the national level. Each Government must fulfil its responsibilities. International participation is also very important. At one level  it requires better coordination of policy  so that our efforts become mutually supportive  not mutually damaging. It also means that  when we craft agreements on international trade  we accommodate one another’s concerns and interests.Let us think about the scale of the need. Today  basic sanitation is out of the reach of 2.5 billion people; 1.3 billion have no access to electricity and 1.1 billion no access to drinking water. That makes it clear that more comprehensive and concerted international action is required. We cannot keep waiting for economic development. In India  the most important aspects of my development agenda are focused precisely on those very issues  which should also be at the core of the post-2015 development agenda  as they deserve our utmost attention.A world that is more habitable and sustainable is an objective we must work towards. There has been much debate and much written about that  but it takes only a brief glance around our countries to become concerned. We are very concerned indeed about issues relating to forests  wildlife  birds  rivers  water sources and the blue sky above.I would like to address three points. First  if we are to meet all of the challenges  we must fully uphold our responsibilities. The global community has agreed to work together on the basis of common but differentiated responsibility. That must continue to be the foundation of future action. That also means that developed countries must fulfil their commitments in terms of funding and technology transfer.Secondly  national action is imperative. Technology has made many things possible  such as renewable energy. We need imagination and commitment. India stands ready to share its technology and capabilities  as for example through the recently announced free access to a satellite.Thirdly  we need to change our lifestyles. Avoiding energy use is the cleanest option and would give a new direction to our economy. For us in India  respect for nature is fundamental and an integral part of spiritualism. It is part of our ideology.I would like to draw the Assembly’s attention to another idea. When we talk of climate change  we are also talking about holistic health care  connecting with nature and going back to basics. Today  I would like to underscore that yoga is an invaluable gift from our ancient tradition. Yoga embodies unity of mind and body  thought and action. It is important to coordinate all of those aspects. Such a holistic approach is valuable to our health and our well-being. Yoga is not just about exercise; it is a way to discover the sense of oneness with yourself  the world and nature. By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness  it can also help us deal with climate change. Let us work towards adopting an international yoga day.Finally  we are at a historic moment. Every age is defined by its character and remembered for how it rose to meet its challenges. Today  we are responsible to rise and meet those challenges. Next year  the United Nations will be 70 years old. We should ask ourselves whether we should wait until we are 80 or 100 years old to take action. I believe that next year will provide an opportunity for the United Nations. After a voyage spanning 70 years  we shall be able to look back and review what we have achieved  whence we began  why we left certain places  what motivated us  how we proceeded and what we have attained. What are the challenges facing us in the twenty-first century? If we can keep all of that in mind  through exchanges of views  dialogue with universities  and intergenerational discussions with young people  who can contribute ideas  then we will find the ways to connect all of those things for future generations.That is why I say that arriving at the milestone of 70 years presents us with a great opportunity that we should not waste. By taking full advantage of this moment  we could achieve a new consciousness  a new life  with new ambitions and aspirations. We could give the journey of the United Nations a new form. I therefore feel that 70 years is a great opportunity for us. Let us come together and fulfil our promise to bring improvements to the Security Council. That issue has been before us for a long time  yet there has not been much progress. We need to think very seriously about it.In preparing and implementing the post-2015 development agenda  let us come together to keep our promises. For 2015  let us come together to give a new direction and make the moment memorable by giving the world a new lease on development. The year 2015 should be a banner year in history — a turning point in history. I hope that we will all live up to its promise."
"78",3269,"IRL",69,2014,"It is my great honour to represent Ireland today at the General Assembly. Regrettably  this gathering comes at a dangerous time in global history. Delegates here represent a world facing many challenges  but they are challenges that can be tackled with unity of purpose and surmounted through strong leadership  especially from this Organization  the United Nations. Indeed  the United Nations must be at the vanguard of efforts to eradicate terrorism where it flourishes  to preserve the sovereignty of States where it is threatened and to promote and protect peace and human rights where those essential components of human dignity and human happiness are lacking.In my address this afternoon  I will focus on the conflicts that beset the Middle East and Eastern Europe  and I will do so in a way that reflects the foreign policy tenets of my country: first  dialogue and compromise as the solution to intractable conflicts between peoples; secondly  respect for the rule of law and solidarity within the international community when a democratic State is threatened; thirdly  a strong commitment to peacekeeping while preserving Irish military neutrality; fourthly  the critical importance of development; and last but not least  the promotion of human rights  in particular the rights of minorities and of women and girls in this troubled world.I will begin by outlining some thoughts on the importance of reform of the United Nations and its Security Council. We see a world beset by warfare and terror on many fronts. Heart-rending reports of escalating casualty and refugee numbers  the slaughter of innocents  the suffering of children and vulnerable adults in Iraq  Syria  Gaza  Ukraine and many other conflicts dominate the news on our airwaves and television news and on the Internet. The people we represent in the Assembly rightly expect the United Nations to be a source of action. Regrettably  too often  they see an institution that seems hamstrung and stymied in situations where it needs to be both decisive and strong.It is not that we lack the necessary instruments; the many achievements of this great Organization amply demonstrate its capacity to act decisively and effectively when the necessary political will is forthcoming. For the United Nations to meet the manifold  complex and grave challenges that are dominating this year’s session of the Assembly  the Organization must review its working methods and priorities. Resources must be directed to the areas of greatest need and used with the utmost efficiency.In particular  we must see new approaches to the work of the Security Council — something Ireland and its partners in the Accountability  Coherence and Transparency Group have been actively promoting. While Ireland would like to see the veto power in the Council ultimately abolished  we strongly welcome the initiative of France  supported by Mexico  to better regulate the use of that power by the Council’s permanent members. Moreover  Ireland supports an increase in the membership of the Security Council to more closely reflect regional balances as well as the current realities of population and economic weight in the world.The challenge of achieving peace in the Middle East remains as great as ever. As Member States  we must do more to assist the United Nations in its vital life-saving efforts in Syria and the many other humanitarian challenges confronting the broader region. I want to pay particular tribute here to the heroic role of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and its brave and dedicated staff in Gaza  11 of whom tragically lost their lives during the recent horrific conflict. We are all indebted to Pierre Krähenbühl and his colleagues for providing an indispensable lifeline to the people of Gaza over many years.Our goal must be to ensure that there is no return to the recurrent cycles of violence that we have witnessed in Gaza and southern Israel on three occasions now  most devastatingly during July and August. Each cycle of violence appears to harden attitudes on both sides of the conflict  and yet  ultimately  no one can want peace more than those most directly affected by its absence.It is widely acknowledged that the achievement of a lasting peace requires that the underlying issues that gave rise to the most recent bout of violence must be definitively addressed. The closures and restrictions that have applied to Gaza for seven long years now must be brought to an end. Equally  there must be assurances for all Israelis and Palestinians that they will not be subjected to indiscriminate violence  whether that violence comes in the form of rocket attacks targeting Israel or retaliatory strikes with devastating consequences for Gaza and its people.It is also now long past time for the attainment of a comprehensive peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. None of us is under any illusions about the difficult and painful compromises that will be involved. In essence  however  I believe that most Israelis and Palestinians recognize that the only true basis for peace and security between them lies in the realization of a just  negotiated two-State solution. It remains vital that all actions or policies that impede that prospect be avoided.While there is at least a clear vision of the difficult compromises necessary to achieve a lasting peace between the peoples of Israel and Palestine  the situation in neighbouring Syria appears at the moment to present an even greater challenge. Over the past three and a half years  almost 200 000 people have lost their lives at the hands of the State and militant groups in that vicious conflict. Ultimately  the solution to Syria’s civil war is not a military one. I strenuously urge all in the international community to fully support Special Envoy De Mistura in his efforts to promote a political settlement based on the principles of the Geneva communiqué of 30 June 2012. The flagrant violation of international law by all sides in the Syrian conflict must be confronted and referred to the International Criminal Court. All sides  particularly the Al-Assad regime  must comply with their obligations under Security Council resolutions 2165 (2014) and 2139 (2014)  and put an end to their obstruction of vital humanitarian efforts and to obscenities such as besieging communities and attempting to starve them into submission.The growth of the extremism we are now witnessing across the region is a cause for significant concern and one that I know is shared by everyone in the Assembly. The bloodlust and inhumanity that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) is displaying in those countries has shocked and appalled all civilized people. The destruction and displacement of the ancient Christian communities of northern Iraq has been harrowing to witness. The gratuitous and almost casual approach to that most gruesome form of murder  beheading; the barbaric sexual violence perpetrated against women and girls; the base corruptness of putting military weapons in the hands of children; the scapegoating of people based on their ethnicity or religion  whether Christian  Yazidi  Kurdish  Sunni  Shia or Jewish — all of that  taken together  harks back to a mentality and a culture we thought had long been consigned to the dustbin of history. The rise of ISIS  the continued activities of Al-Qaida and the growing strength of Boko Haram make it clear that there is no room for complacency in the international community when it comes to the growth of extremism. We must unite and mobilize to confront this threat  and we must do so with a real sense of urgency.Ukraine is the most dangerous political crisis to occur in Europe for several decades. The situation there has profound implications for the viability and future of an international system that upholds the rule of law. The actions of the Russian Federation  first in Crimea and then in eastern Ukraine  clearly contravene a wide range of international agreements. We should remember first and foremost the deplorable violence that has been inflicted on innocent civilians in Ukraine over many months and the serious humanitarian crisis that has ensued. There can be no military solution to this crisis. We firmly support the path of diplomatic dialogue and welcome President Poroshenko’s peace plan. We were encouraged by the Minsk agreement reached earlier this month within the framework of the Trilateral Contact Group. A sustainable political solution must be based on the principle of respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and with clear guarantees on border security  the disarmament of all illegal groups and the withdrawal of foreign forces.Ireland has a proud tradition of involvement in United Nations peacekeeping missions all over the world  beginning in 1958. Our troops have made an important contribution to international peace and stability; 82 of them have made the ultimate sacrifice. I take this opportunity to recall and salute all those who have fallen in United Nations peacekeeping operations since we met for the general debate a year ago. Today  some 370 Irish men and women are serving on United Nations peacekeeping missions  the majority in the Middle East. The environment in which they serve has become increasingly complex and challenging. As it is for the Department for Peacekeeping Operations  the safety and security of our personnel is a very high priority for us  and I warmly welcome the Secretary-General’s announcement that there will be a review of United Nations peacekeeping. That should ensure that the Organization retains the capacity to promote peace and stability internationally.The Assembly can rest assured that Irish men and women will continue to wear the blue beret with pride in service of the United Nations and in pursuit of a better world. Last week  at the high-level meeting on peacekeeping hosted by the Secretary-General and Vice-President Biden of the United States  I was pleased to announce an initiative by my Government to deliver a new programme for training African peacekeepers that will include a specific focus on areas such as the protection of civilians  gender sensitivity  human rights  leadership training and logistics.The full and equal participation of women is another essential component in building peaceful  stable societies. Women are key agents of change and must be full protagonists in our ongoing global story. Political will is a crucial element in driving women’s empowerment and gender equality going forward. Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) was a milestone in recognizing that reality  and subsequent resolutions  most recently resolution 2122 (2013)  demonstrate our resolve to pursue the goal of women’s full and empowered participation in the political process. The current agenda of the United Nations includes a welcome and necessary increase in the focus on tackling the scourge of sexual violence in armed conflict. But we must translate our global commitment into concrete action. Achieving real gender equality requires a commitment from all of us here  men and women. It is a commitment that Ireland is proud to have made  and next January we launch our second national action plan on women  peace and security. It is just part of our ongoing commitment to ensuring that women and girls can reach their full potential  live a life free from fear and fully take their place at the decision-making table.The global threat posed by the spread of Ebola in West Africa is a reminder that not all the challenges we face are man-made. Ireland is active in addressing this epidemic in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Security Council resolution 2177 (2014)  sponsored by 130 Member States  indicates the seriousness with which the world regards the problem and the need for urgent action on the part of the United Nations.Next year  2015  will be a critical one in the fight to end extreme poverty and hunger. We have 15 months to maximize progress under the Millennium Development Goals and a mere 12 in which to negotiate a new framework for international development. That framework must mark an important shift to sustainable development  with clear and ambitious targets that can help to end extreme poverty  hunger and malnutrition in a single generation. Ireland continues to play its part at the United Nations and with our partners on the ground. We have focused sharply on the continuing scandals of hunger  child stunting and maternal mortality in a world of plenty. I am pleased that last week the Human Rights Council adopted a draft resolution  led by Ireland  on the preventable mortality and morbidity of children under 5. It is indeed deplorable that some 6.6 million children under the age of 5 die annually  mainly from preventable and treatable causes.Ireland is working with its partners in Africa on the devastating impact of climate change  especially on smallholder agriculture. Last week we joined the Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture. On Thursday  I co-hosted a meeting here at the United Nations in support of the Secretary-General’s Zero Hunger Challenge. And days earlier  in Dublin  UNICEF Ireland brought to me the voices of Ireland’s young people  calling on us to strengthen our efforts and reminding me  in their words  that “It’s about us”. Ireland’s commitment to a more equal  inclusive and sustainable future for the world’s children is demonstrated in practice through our development programme and our work with our partners in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite the extremely difficult economic circumstances of recent years  we are proud that we have stabilized funding for our aid programme. The fight to end poverty and hunger will remain a central tenet of our foreign policy.Recent events worldwide have demonstrated that human rights and fundamental freedoms continue to be violated and threatened  particularly in times of conflict. In many parts of the world today  brave women and men seek to highlight and address abuses of human rights  and to stand up for those who are oppressed or without a voice. I salute the courage of those human rights defenders and pledge that we in Ireland will continue to work for decisive action  whether in the United Nations or the European Union  in order to support them. As a member of the Human Rights Council  Ireland has sought to highlight the important contribution of civil society to advancing human rights and building democratic societies.Last week  the Council adopted by consensus the significant resolution 2178 (2014)  led by Ireland  calling on States to create and maintain a safe and enabling environment in which civil society can operate. We strongly condemn all forms of persecution and discrimination based on religion or belief. The persecution of Christians and other minorities in the Middle East  and the recent rise of anti-Semitic attacks  particularly in a number of European countries  are causes of grave concern for me. Too often throughout history  the world has looked the other way when vulnerable minorities were being targeted  often as a prelude to a more serious conflict.On a more positive note  as a former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in Ireland  I felt particularly honoured last week to ratify the third Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child  reaffirming the commitment of my Government to the protection and promotion of the rights of children in Ireland.In conclusion  I believe that at its most effective this great Organization  the United Nations  is a force for good in the world and has much untapped potential. The undoubted achievements in areas  such as peacekeeping  conflict resolution  development and humanitarian action  to which Ireland is proud to contribute  should renew our faith in our collective ability and inspire us to meet the challenges that confront us now and many of those that will lie ahead in the future."
"79",3316,"IRN",69,2014,"At the outset  Mr. President  I would like to extend my sincere congratulations on your well-deserved election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I also express my appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon for all his efforts. It is my genuine hope that this year’s session of the General Assembly brings the world  in its current critical situation  a step closer to security and tranquility for human beings  which is of course a fundamental goal of the United Nations.I am from a region of the world whose many parts are currently burning in the fire of extremism and radicalism. To the east and to the west of my country  extremists threaten our neighbours  resort to violence and shed blood. They do not speak a single language; they are not of a single skin colour and not of a single nationality — they have come to the Middle East from around the world. They do  however  have a single ideology: violence and extremism. They also have a single goal: the destruction of civilization  thus giving rise to Islamophobia and creating a fertile ground for further intervention of foreign forces in our region.I deeply regret to say that terrorism has become globalized from New York to Mosul  from Damascus to Baghdad  from the easternmost to the westernmost parts of the world  and from Al-Qaida to Daesh. The extremists of the world have found each other and have put out the call: “Extremists of the world  unite”. But are we united against the extremists?Extremism is not a regional issue with which only the nations of our region have to grapple. Extremism is a global issue. Certain States have helped to create it and now fail to withstand it. Our peoples are currently paying the price. Today’s anti-Westernism is the offspring of yesterday’s colonialism. Today’s anti-Westernism is a reaction to yesterday’s racism. Certain intelligence agencies have put blades in the hand of madmen  who now spare no one. All those that have played a role in founding and supporting those terror groups must acknowledge their errors that have led to extremism. They need to apologize not only to the past generations but also to the next.To fight the underlying causes of terrorism  one must identify its roots and dry up its sources. Terrorism germinates in poverty  unemployment  discrimination  humiliation and injustice  and it grows in the culture of violence. To uproot extremism  we must spread justice and development and not allow the distortion of divine teachings to justify brutality and cruelty. The pain is exacerbated when such terrorists spill blood in the name of religion and behead in the name of Islam. They seek to keep hidden the incontrovertible truth of history that  on the basis of the teachings of all divine prophets  from Abraham to Moses  from Jesus to Muhammad  taking the life of a human being is akin to killing all humankind.I am astonished that those murderous groups call themselves Islamic. What is more astonishing is that the Western media  in line with them  repeat that false claim  which provokes the hatred of all Muslims. Muslim people  who daily recall their God as merciful and compassionate and have learned the lessons of kindness and empathy from their Prophet’s teachings  see such defamation as part of an Islamophobic scheme.The strategic blunders of the West in the Middle East  Central Asia and the Caucuses have turned those parts of the world into a haven for terrorists and extremists. The military aggression against Afghanistan and Iraq and inappropriate interference in the developments in Syria are clear examples of that erroneous strategic approach in the Middle East. As part of a non-peaceful approach  aggression and occupation target the lives and livelihoods of ordinary people. They result in various adverse psychological and behavioral consequences that are today manifested in the form of violence and murder in the Middle East and North Africa  even attracting some citizens from other parts of the world.Today  violence is being spread to other parts of the world like a contagious disease. We have always believed that democracy cannot be transplanted from abroad. Democracy is the product of growth and development  not war and aggression. Democracy is not an export product that can be commercially imported from the West to the East. In an underdeveloped society  imported democracy leads only to a weak and vulnerable Government.When commanding generals set foot in a region  do not expect diplomats to greet them warmly. When war begins  diplomacy tends to end. When sanctions set in  deep hatred for those imposing them also begins. When the atmosphere of the Middle East becomes securitized  there will be a similar response. The interests of Western countries in our region are tied to their recognition of beliefs and the desire of the people for democratic governance in the region.The establishment of Al-Qaida  the Taliban and modern extremist groups has demonstrated that one cannot use extremist groups to counter an opposing State and remain impervious to the consequences of rising extremism. The repetition of such mistakes  despite the many costly experiences  is perplexing. Let us recall that Iran had invited everyone to dialogue before the criminal act of 11 September. We also called for a world against violence and extremism before the outbreak of the current violent atrocities.In the past year  perhaps few people could have forecast the fire that rages today  but now uninhibited violence and extremism present an imminent threat to the world. It is self-evident that without an accurate understanding of the causes of the current situation  we will not be able to find the right solutions. Today  I shall again warn against the spread of extremism and the danger posed by the inadequate understanding of and incorrect approach to that phenomenon.The Middle East longs for development and is weary of war. It is the natural right of the peoples of the fertile lands of the Middle East to live in peace and prosperity. In the past  colonialism denied them that right. Today  the shadow of war and violence threatens their security.There are moderate politicians and elites in our region who enjoy the confidence of their peoples. They are neither anti- nor pro-Western. Aware of the role of colonialism in the backwardness of their nations  they do not neglect the role of their nations in reaching the development that they seek. They do not absolve the West of its misdeeds  but they are also aware of their own failings. Those leaders can assume positions of active leadership by attracting the confidence of the people in their societies and can establish the strongest national and international coalitions against violence.The voices of such leaders are the true voices of moderation in the Islamic world. They represent the familiar voice of an Afghan weary of war  of an Iraqi victim of extremism  of a Syrian fearful of terrorism and of a Lebanese worried about violence and sectarianism. I believe that if countries that claim to lead the coalition do so to continue their hegemony in the region  they are making a strategic mistake. Obviously  since the pain is better known by the countries of the region  those countries can better form a coalition and agree to shoulder the responsibility of leadership in countering violence and terrorism. If other nations wish to take action against terrorism  they must come to their support. I warn that if we do not muster all our strengths against extremism and violence  and if we fail to entrust the task to those in the region who can succeed  tomorrow the world will not be safe for anyone.Last year I tried to fulfil my country’s role in the realization of peace at both the regional and international levels by putting forward a proposal about a world against violence and extremism  which met with general support. In the tumultuous and chaotic region of the Middle East  Iran is one of the most tranquil  secure and stable nations. All the nations of the region have to keep in mind that we are in the same boat. Thus  we need broad cooperation with regard to social and political issues  as well as security and defence issues  with a view to reaching common and durable understandings. Had we had greater cooperation and coordination in the Middle East  thousands of innocent Palestinians in Gaza would not have fallen victim to the aggressions of the Zionist regime.We in the Islamic Republic of Iran consider interaction and confidence-building among the States of the region as fundamentally essential for conflict resolution. We support any measure to promote cooperation among Islamic nations to combat extremism and threats and aggression  and in that connection we are prepared to play our permanent constructive and positive role.The oppressive sanctions against Iran go on  in continuation of a strategic mistake against a moderate and independent nation in the current sensitive conditions in our region. During the past year  we have engaged in the most transparent possible dialogue to build confidence regarding Iran’s peaceful nuclear programme. We placed serious and honest negotiations on the agenda  not as a result of sanctions or threats but rather because of the will of our people. We are of the view that the nuclear issue can be resolved only through negotiation  and those who may think of other solutions would be commiting a grave mistake. Any delay in reaching final agreement only raises the costs — not only for us but also for the economies and trade of the other parties  as well as for the development and security prospects of our region. No one should doubt that compromise and agreement on that issue are in everyone’s best interest  especially that of the nations of the region.The nuclear negotiations between Iran and the 5+1 Group have continued during the past year and the past few months  with seriousness and optimism on both sides. According to all international observers  the Islamic Republic of Iran has carried out its commitments in good faith. Although some of the observations and actions of our counterparts have created certain doubts regarding their determination and realism  we hope that the current negotiations will lead to a final accord in the short time that remains.We are committed to continuing our peaceful nuclear programme  including enrichment  and to enjoy our full nuclear rights on Iranian soil within the framework of international law. We are determined to continue negotiations with our interlocutors in earnest good faith and on an equal footing  based on mutual respect and confidence and on recognized international norms and principles  removing concerns of both sides. I believe that mutual adherence to the strict implementation of commitments and obligations and avoidance of excessive demands in the negotiations by our counterparts are the prerequisites for the success of the negotiations. A final accord regarding Iran’s peaceful nuclear programme can serve as the beginning of multilateral collaboration aimed at promoting security  peace and development in our region and beyond.The people of Iran  who have been subjected to pressures especially during the past three years as a result of continued sanctions  cannot trust any security cooperation between their Government and those who have imposed sanctions and created obstacles to their ability to satisfy even their primary needs  such as food and medicine. Sanctions only create further impediments to long-term cooperation in the future. The people of Iran are devoted to certain principles and values  at the apex of which are independence  development and national pride. If that obvious fact about the nation is not understood by our negotiating partners and they commit grievous miscalculations in the process  a historic and exceptional opportunity will be lost.As the Assembly knows  during the ongoing nuclear negotiations this year  the Iranian Government took some initiatives that created favourable conditions  which resulted in the new phase  the Geneva Joint Plan of Action. We are determined to continue our confidence-building approach and transparency in that process. If our interlocutors are equally motivated and flexible  and if we can overcome the problems and reach long-standing agreement within the time remaining  then an entirely different environment will emerge for cooperation at the regional and international levels. That would allow for greater focus on some very important regional issues such as combating violence and extremism in the region.Arriving at a final  comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran will be an historic opportunity for the West to show that it does not oppose the advancement and development of others and does not discriminate when it comes to adhering to international rules and regulations. Such an agreement could bear a global message of peace and security  indicating that the only way to attain conflict resolution is through negotiation and respect  not through conflict and sanctions.Last year  the great nation of Iran broadly participated in the calm and impressive presidential election and endorsed the discourse of foresight  hope and prudent moderation. Thereafter  they support their elected Government in its effort in building the country. While some of Iran’s neighbours have fallen prey to war and turmoil  Iran remains secure  stable and calm.My Government’s principled policy is to work towards constructive interactions with our neighbors on the basis of mutual respect and with emphasis on common interests. The notion that Iran seeks to control other Muslim countries in the region is a myth fanned in recent years in the context of an Iranophobic project. Those who make such claims need imaginary enemies to sustain tensions and sow division and conflict  thereby pushing for the redeployment of national resources away from development. We work to put an end to delusional Iranophobia  setting the stage for building strategic partnerships with our neighbours.Last year I warned against the expansion of violence and extremism. This year too I warn that if the right approach is not taken in dealing with the issue at hand  we will get closer to having a turbulent and tumultuous region with repercussions for the whole world. The right solution to that quandary comes from within the region  not from outside  and must be a regionally provided solution with international support.In the Holy Koran  God the Almighty has promised those who have believed and done righteous deeds that He will surely grant them succession to authority upon the Earth and that their fears will turn into peace and security. It is my sincerest hope that our generation will endeavour to leave a more secure and developed Earth as its legacy for the next generation. I wish all present much success and many blessings."
"80",3363,"IRQ",69,2014,"I salute the General Assembly on behalf of Iraq and congratulate Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We wish him and the Secretary-General every success during the session. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General for the vital role he has played in the past years in supporting and enhancing the progress of my country  something for which we in Iraq are grateful and proud.Fourteen years ago  heads of State and Government committed themselves to the fulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015  focusing on issues that are now still vital  foremost among which are social and economic development  the protection of international peace and security  the end of the arms race  disarmament  elimination of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) — whose very name incites fear in everyone — fighting terrorism and widespread organized crime  guaranteeing human rights and the effective coordination of humanitarian assistance efforts  and promoting justice and international law. In that context  we would like to remind the General Assembly of our very bitter memory and experience as victims of WMDs in Halabja  the peaceful Kurdish city that was attacked by chemical weapons in 1988 at the hands of the dictatorial regime then in power.Next year  we will celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations as an Organization that represents international legitimacy. That occasion will allow us to express the value of the Organization and its achievements. It will also be an occasion to take up more initiatives to settle disputes by peaceful means and promote human rights and larger freedoms and equality for all. We will also be celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women  held in Beijing  which was a turning point in seeking to promote the rights of women and curb all forms of violence to which they are exposed. We need to promote efforts to protect our planet from pollution and create a sound  clean environment to fight the problems of poverty  illness and illiteracy.The success of political parties in Iraq in establishing  a few weeks ago  a Government of national unity that represents Iraqis every stripe was extremely important. It is a Government that everyone feels represents them. Its programme responds to their aspirations and hopes to move forward with their provinces into another era of stability  internal progress and rebuilding. It is a Government that seeks to build friendly relationships in the region based on understandings that guarantee peaceful coexistence among States of the region on the basis of mutual interests and good-neighbourliness.The establishment of the Government was a firm response to a real danger that was stalking us all  namely  the danger posed by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). That infamous and evil group has launched international terrorist actions to attack defenceless civilians. It has ushered in a new era and brought terror to a new level. ISIL has been able to occupy areas in more than one city in Iraq and Syria and established a State based on hatred and rejection of the Other. In the past few months  we have seen how that heinous terrorist organization committed crimes against humanity  such as killing and displacing people  committing genocide and ethnic cleansing and inflicting great suffering on all components of the Iraqi people with its horrific crimes and massacres.It has kidnapped women and sold them as enslaved captives. It has destroyed religious shrines and houses of worship  as well as cultural and historic monuments. It has oppressed components of the Iraqi people on the basis of their ethnic identities  like Turkmens and Kurds  and targeted religious and confessional minorities  including Yazidis  Christians and the Shabak. We would like to thank the free people of the world who have expressed their dismay  rejected those crimes and stood in solidarity with the victims by providing assistance.That terrorist organization disposes of huge financial and military assets. By declaring the so-called Islamic Caliphate  ISIL has become a magnet for militants and extremists in the Middle East and the world  who have declared allegiance to that obscurantist regime and started working under its command. Among the most dangerous phenomena of that transformation is the emergence of a new generation of terrorists who have American  European or other citizenship.The Iraqi Armed Forces  the Peshmerga and the Popular Defence volunteers have been able to stop the advance of ISIL and prevent its occupation of new areas. We also succeeded in breaking the siege and liberating cities that had been occupied by the terrorists of that dangerous organization. The huge humanitarian and military support that we received from United Nations organizations  the United States  the States of the European Union and other friendly States has played a vital role in assisting us in confronting that obscurantist terrorist group. We shall neever forget the support we received against that group  which confirmed to our people that we are not alone in our fight against terrorism.I would like here to express the gratitude of all the people of Iraq and our Government’s appreciation to all those who stood by us in our war against those enemies of humankind. We would like to thank those whose efforts made the Paris and Jeddah conferences a success. And we would like to thank those who made every effort to adopt a Security Council resolution that guarantees solidarity and partnership in facing terrorism and the challenges it poses to everyone.As we meet in the Assembly today  hundreds of thousands of displaced persons and refugees  who were forced to leave their homes without taking with them even the most basic possessions  look to us. Millions of defenceless civilians who have been forced to live under the oppression and tyranny of the terrorists of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) also look to us. Their protection and needs are our common responsibility. We call on the international community to stand by our side in this war against terrorism and to support our efforts and those of international organizations and friendly countries in alleviating the suffering of refugees  who hope someday to return to their homes and to get rid of ISIS.ISIS is a transnational and intercontinental organization. We reiterate here that eliminating it can be achieved only by forming a unified global front to take measures to fight the takfiri approach and dry up its connected financial  ideological  organizational and military resources. We in Iraq are determined to cleanse our land of ISIS. We would like to emphasize that eliminating terrorism in Iraq will be an important step in protecting our region and in ridding the world of that danger.Here we welcome Security Council resolution 2170 (2014)  adopted in August  which calls on Member States to prevent the support  financing and arming of ISIS terrorists  the Nusra Front and other entities related to Al-Qaida to prevent such flows into Iraq. We should also like to commend the Human Rights Council for its resolution condemning ISIS and establishing a fact-finding commission to investigate crimes against humanity committed by that group against all Iraqis.In the context of the international response to terrorism  and while we stress the importance of consolidating the value and culture of peace and coexistence in countries with multi-ethnic and multi-confessional societies  we in Iraq call for institutionalizing such a responsible position at the United Nations. Such institutions must be tasked with developing and operationalizing international solidarity  using all the means available to fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and to rid the world of its evils. We also believe that the time has come to work collectively within individual countries and with all countries in the region so that we can defuse tension about our security and achieve national understanding that contributes to limiting the space available to terrorism  which typically lives off conflict and strife. The meetings held in Jeddah  Paris and New York and the statements  declarations and resolutions adopted have sent important messages to the Iraqi people. We hope that all of them will be translated into practical measures.In the Middle East  it hurts us to see the recent suffering of the fraternal Palestinian people in Gaza and other Palestinian territories. We therefore renew our call on the international community to honour its commitment to the Palestinian people and exert concerted efforts to restore peace and return to the negotiations table in order to end the conflict and achieve lasting peace and security. For our brothers in Yemen and Libya  we hope for stability and the end of the threats of terrorism and extremism. We also wish success and progress on the democratic path chosen by the Libyan and Yemeni peoples. We hope that the fraternal Syrian people will be able to overcome the country’s dilemma. We hope that Syrians will unite in their efforts to arrive at a political solution that ends the bloodshed and preserves life. We also hope that such a solution will help neighbourly Syria to achieve democracy  peace and security in our region. Continued tension in those hotbeds in our region will only fuel extremism and extremist obscurantist ideology. That makes us all want to work together to expedite a search for solutions to the problems that contributes to creating a humanitarian environment based on civilization  culture and freedom.With regard to Ukraine  we express our concern about the dangerous escalation of the situation. We believe that the international community cannot allow any exacerbation of the conflict  with the ensuing dire consequences for civilians  whether they have been displaced or are forced to live in conflict zones.Iraq notes the results achieved by the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. The Group’s recommendations in its report (A/67/941  annex) constitute an important step and deserve our appreciation. We truly value the efforts they have made to arrive at its conclusions. However  the issue of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations does not occupy the space it deserves in the report. It should have been incumbent upon the Group to address that challenge as an objective on its own and to look into its core  manifestations  causes  repercussions and the ways to address them.Throughout this era  humankind has been able to work to promote human partnership and enhance prospects for peace  freedom  human rights  prosperity and security. I stand before the Assembly today as a representative of a country that was enervated by terror for over a decade. On behalf of the millions of families of martyrs  orphans and the bereaved  I address the Assembly to stress that we have no other option but to defeat ISIS everywhere. With will  determination and vision  we look forward to a future in which we can liberate our societies from the risks that continue to threaten us."
"81",3410,"ISL",69,2014,"Next year we will celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. As we approach that milestone  it is good to reflect on the successes of our Organization: the extensive codification of international law  advances in combating poverty and disease  and fighting human rights abuses. We have established monitoring mechanisms  such as the human rights treaty bodies  and accountability tools  such as the International Criminal Court  and agreed on historic policy targets that have transformed international cooperation  such as the Millennium Development Goals.These are not small achievements  but sitting on our laurels is not an option. The system of rule-bound relations between nations is under threat  and we must protect it. Most worrying is the growing disregard for international law. This erodes the international legal framework we have developed since the Second World War. A shocking recent example is the terrorist group operating in Iraq and Syria  the self-styled Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. As human beings  we are revolted by its brutality and appalled by its mindless destruction.The international community cannot accept the disregard for the fundamental principles of the United Nations — indeed  of human decency — shown by this group. Iceland therefore agrees with the lawful actions taken to end these atrocities by countries of the region and from other parts of the world. Iceland will contribute humanitarian aid through the United Nations agencies. No civilized nation can look the other way when the barbarism and cruelty are so overwhelming. The United Nations and international law must be centre stage  and we underscore the role of the Security Council in maintaining international peace and security.The suffering of the Syrian people and the total disrespect for humanitarian law in that civil war are equally shocking. Almost 200 000 people have died  3 million refugees are abroad  and the country is in ruins. The prolonged foreign occupation of the State of Palestine is another violation of international law. Land-grabbing continues unabated. The blockade of Gaza shows no signs of being lifted. Violations of human rights continue  including against freedom of movement  the right to freedom of speech and assembly and property rights.This summer  a pointless war between Israel and Gaza caused an unacceptable loss of life. I condemn the indiscriminate rocket attacks of Hamas and other militant organizations in Gaza against civilian targets in Israel. I also condemn the disproportionate use of force by the Israel Defense Forces  which resulted in more than 2 000 deaths in Gaza. Let the loss of life not have been in vain and let the future of Palestinian children be a future without foreign occupation. A two-State solution  with the comprehensive support of neighbouring countries and robust international peacekeeping arrangements  should be the objective. To the Palestinians I say  “Reconcile. Be your own best friends so you can build a free and sovereign Palestine ensuring fundamental rights and freedom for all”. To the Israelis  I say  “The current situation is unsustainable. Be brave  be wise and give peace a chance. The occupation of Palestine must end.”The violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity breaches the Charter of the United Nations  international law and numerous treaties. The illegal annexation of Crimea threatens security and stability throughout Europe. The credibility of the Security Council is seriously undermined when a permanent member violates the Charter by using force to change borders  and then can veto the necessary response and actions by the body empowered to maintain international peace and security. The Council is also undermined when it proves incapable of defending civilians who are subject to foreign occupation or is unable to prevent the use of chemical weapons.The United Nations was founded to ensure that the fate of nations would never again be decided at the barrel of a gun. Recent events have shown that we must reaffirm our commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and other legal instruments to safeguard the foundations of a just and peaceful world. This holds particularly true for the Security Council. In its role of maintaining international peace and security  its compass should be the Charter of the United Nations and international law  including international humanitarian law and human rights law. It should apply the law equally to all parties. The Council needs to become more solution-oriented and directly engaged. Its working methods must improve  especially the application of the veto. Iceland supports the recent French- and Mexican-led proposal for framing the veto in cases of mass atrocities. The Council should also make use of its referral power as intended by the Rome Statute.In a world riven by inequality  poverty and onflict  it is a challenge to chart a path towards the future we want. Since the most recent general debate  we have made real progress in preparing for the decisions to be taken next year on a new framework for sustainable development. The year ahead will be a test of our resolve to deliver. Iceland will participate constructively in the negotiations for the post-2015 agenda  as well as for a new regime to address climate change.Allow me to highlight a few issues that I believe to be fundamental. With an increasing world population  measures to ensure food security are more important than ever. For 3 billion people  seafood provides about 20 per cent of their intake of animal protein. Nine to 12 per cent of the global population depends on the seafood sector for their livelihood. Yet we have a paradox. Overfishing remains a widespread problem  but at the same time fisheries are greatly underperforming. With improved infrastructure and better management  the economic benefits from marine fisheries could be increased by $50 billion per year  or more than half the value of the global seafood trade.It is clear that ocean issues are one of the keys to the post-2015 development agenda. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea provides a sound legal basis on which States can harness their marine resources. Iceland remains firmly loyal to the Convention  and we build our marine policy on scientific research where sustainability guides all our decisions. The Convention on the Law of the Sea has been instrumental to Iceland’s success  yet what is often lacking is the capacity of States to implement effective monitoring and sustainable harvesting. Iceland has been sharing know-how through the United Nations University Fisheries Training Programme in Iceland  where over 1 500 experts have benefited from post-graduate studies and workshops in the field.The second key area for ensuring food security is land. Every decade  120 million hectares of land — an area the size of South Africa — are lost to desertification and drought. Climate change is contributing to an ever-faster rate of land degradation  which in turn releases greenhouse gases  creating a vicious circle. Switching to sustainable land management is therefore not only crucial to food and water security  but an important factor in mitigating and adapting to climate change. This is why Iceland argues strongly for measures to achieve a land-degradation neutral world. Iceland contributes actively to these efforts through the Group of Friends of the Secretary-General in New York and through the United Nations University Land Restoration Training Programme in Iceland.A third key area is to ensure access to affordable  reliable  sustainable and modern energy for all. No society can develop without energy  yet today over 1.3 billion people have no access to electricity. As energy production grows  it is essential to substantially increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy supply by 2030. Iceland is contributing to that effort. We have partnered with a group of countries and the International Renewable Energy Agency to identify opportunities and to support mechanisms to scale up geothermal production. In that connection  we invite Member States to join the Global Geothermal Alliance. Iceland has also been working with the World Bank on projects in the Great African Rift Valley  and we have run the Geothermal Training Programme of the United Nations University in Iceland for 35 years.In Iceland and the other Nordic countries  the revolution in women’s education and the high level of female participation in the labour market have been the basis of our welfare and economic prosperity. Without the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of society  including in decision-making  it will be impossible to make real and lasting progress in addressing sustainable development challenges. The stand-alone goal on gender equality and women’s empowerment agreed in the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals must be maintained. But we should not stop there. Gender equality must be further mainstreamed throughout the new framework. In that regard  I cannot leave out the centrality of ensuring sexual and reproductive health and rights.We must continue to fight for the full implementation of the commitments we made almost 20 years ago in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. Iceland is proud to support UN-Women in the campaign to celebrate Beijing+20. We have partnered with Suriname to lead a friends’ group of countries to galvanize support to promote gender equality and to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the Declaration. We call on Member States to join that effort and take concrete actions on the 12 themes of the Platform for Action.For our part  we want to bring men and boys to the table on gender equality in a positive way. Iceland and Suriname will convene a “barbershop” conference in January 2015  where men will discuss gender equality with other men  with a special focus on addressing violence against women. That will be a unique conference  as it will be the first time at the United Nations that we bring together only male leaders to discuss gender equality. It will provide an exceptional contribution to the Beijing+20 conference and the HeForShe campaigns.We have been reminded in recent weeks of the fragility of human beings and the need for us to work together on the biggest threats to humankind. Let me express our sympathy for and solidarity with the States suffering from the Ebola outbreak. The Government of Iceland will join in the international effort to curb the outbreak with financial contributions to United Nations agencies.Next year  the States Members of the United Nations will come together to make important decisions on how to address climate change and pursue sustainable development. In the North  Arctic biodiversity and ecosystems are threatened by climate change  and sustainable harvesting of natural resources is vital. I pledge Iceland’s commitment to work for bold decisions on the future of our planet and the increased prosperity of the world community in the year 2015. May the wise words of Nelson Mandela come true as we navigate that path: “It always seems impossible until it’s done.”"
"82",3457,"ISR",69,2014,"I come here from Jerusalem to speak on behalf of my people  the people of Israel. I have come to speak about the dangers we face and about the opportunities we seek. I have come to expose the brazen lies spoken from this very rostrum about my country and the brave soldiers who defend it.The people of Israel pray for peace  but our hopes for peace  and those of the world  are in danger  because everywhere we look militant Islam is on the march. It is not militants; it is not Islam; it is militant Islam  and typically  its first victims are other Muslims. But it spares no one. Christians  Jews  Yazidis  Kurds — no creed  no faith  no ethnic group is beyond its sights  and it is rapidly spreading in every part of the world. We know the famous American saying “All politics is local”. For the militant Islamists  all politics is global  because their ultimate goal is to dominate the world.Now that threat might seem exaggerated to some  since it starts out small  like a cancer that attacks a particular part of the body. But left unchecked  the cancer grows  metastasizing over wider and wider areas. To protect the peace and security of the world  we must remove that cancer before it is too late. Last week  many of the countries represented here rightly applauded President Obama for leading the effort to confront the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS); and yet weeks before  some of those same countries — the same countries that now support confronting ISIS — opposed Israel for confronting Hamas. Evidently  they do not understand that ISIS and Hamas are branches of the same poisonous tree.ISIS and Hamas share a fanatical creed that they both seek to impose well beyond the territory under their control. Let us listen to what ISIS’s self-declared Caliph  Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi  said two months ago. He said that the day would soon come when the Muslim would walk everywhere as a master  and that Muslims would cause the world to hear and understand the meaning of terrorism  and destroy the idol of democracy. Now let us listen to Khaled Mashal  the leader of Hamas. He proclaims a similar vision of the future. “We say this to the West”  he says. “By Allah it will be defeated  and tomorrow our nation will sit on the throne of the world”.As its Charter makes clear  Hamas’s immediate goal is to destroy Israel; but it has a broader objective. It also wants a caliphate. Hamas shares the global ambitions of its fellow militant Islamists  and that is why its supporters cheered wildly in the streets of Gaza when thousands of Americans were murdered on 9/11. That is why its leaders condemned the United States for killing Osama Bin Laden  whom they praised as a holy warrior. When it comes to their ultimate goals  therefore  Hamas is ISIS and ISIS is Hamas.And what they share in common  all militant Islamists share in common — Boko Haram in Nigeria  Al-Shabaab in Somalia  Hizbullah in Lebanon  Al-Nusra in Syria  the Al-Mahdi Army in Iraq and the Al-Qaida branches in Yemen  Libya  the Philippines  India and elsewhere. Some are radical Sunnis  some are radical Shiites. Some want to restore a pre-medieval caliphate from the seventh century. Others want to trigger the apocalyptic return of an imam from the ninth century.They operate in different lands. They target different victims. They even kill each other in their battle for supremacy. But they all share a fanatic ideology. They all seek to create ever expanding enclaves of militant Islam  where there is no freedom and no tolerance  where women are treated as chattel  Christians are decimated and minorities are subjugated  and sometimes given the stark choice: convert or die. For them  anyone can be consider an infidel  including fellow Muslims.Militant Islam’s ambition to dominate the world seems mad  but so too did the global ambitions of another fanatic ideology that swept into power eight decades ago. The Nazis believed in a master race. The militant Islamists believe in a master faith. They just disagree as to who among them will be the master of the master faith. That is what they truly disagree about. Therefore  the question before us is whether militant Islam will have the power to realize its unbridled ambitions.There is one place where that could soon happen — the Islamic State of Iran. For 35 years  Iran has relentlessly pursued the global mission that was set forth by its founding ruler  Ayatollah Khomeini  with the following words:“We will export our revolution to the entire world  until the cry ‘There is no God but Allah’ will echo throughout the world over”.Ever since  the regime’s brutal enforcers  Iran’s Revolutionary Guards  have done exactly that. Let us listen to its current commander  General Mohammad Ali Jafari  who clearly stated that goal:“Our Imam did not limit the Islamic Revolution to this country. Our duty is to prepare the way for an Islamic world Government.”Iran’s president  Mr. Rouhani  stood here last week and shed crocodile tears over what he called the globalization of terrorism. Maybe he should spare us those phony tears and have a word instead with the commanders of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. He could ask them to call off Iran’s global terror campaign  which has included attacks in two dozen countries on five continents since 2011 alone. To say that Iran does not practice terrorism is like saying Derek Jeter never played shortstop for the New York Yankees. The bemoaning by the Iranian President of the spread of terrorism has got to be one of history’s greatest displays of double talk.Some argue that Iran’s global terror campaign — its subversion of countries throughout the Middle East and well beyond the Middle East — is the work of the extremists. They say that things are changing. They point to last year’s election in Iran. They claim that Iran’s smooth-talking President and Foreign Minister have changed not only the tone of Iran’s foreign policy but also its substance. They believe that Rouhani and Zarif generally want to reconcile with the West  that they have abandoned the global mission of the Islamic Revolution. Really?Let us look at what Foreign Minister Zarif wrote in his book just a few years ago:“We have a fundamental problem with the West  and especially with America. This is because we are heirs to a global mission which is tied to our raison d’être”. A global mission which is tied to our very reason for being? Then Zarif asks a question — an interesting question  in my view. He says  “How come Malaysia” — referring to an overwhelmingly Muslim country — “does not have similar problems?” Then he answers: “Because Malaysia is not trying to change the international order”. That is our moderate.Let us not be fooled by Iran’s manipulative charm offensive. It is designed for one purpose and one purpose only — to have the sanctions lifted and the obstacles to Iran’s path to the bomb removed. The Islamic Republic is now trying to bamboozle its way to an agreement that will remove the sanctions it still faces and leave it with the capacity of thousands of centrifuges to enrich uranium. That would effectively cement Iran’s place as a threshold military nuclear Power. In the future  at the time of its choosing  Iran  the world’s most dangerous regime  in the world’s most dangerous region  would obtain the world’s most dangerous weapons. Allowing that to happen would pose the gravest threat to us all.It is one thing to confront militant Islamists on pickup trucks armed with Kalashnikov rifles. It is another thing to confront militant Islamists armed with weapons of mass destruction. I remember that last year everyone here was rightly concerned about the chemical weapons in Syria  including the possibility that they would fall into the hands of terrorists. Well  that did not happen  and President Obama deserves great credit for leading the diplomatic effort to dismantle virtually all of Syria’s chemical weapons capability. We can only imagine how much more dangerous the Islamic State — ISIS — would be if it possessed chemical weapons. Now  let us imagine how much more dangerous the Islamic State of Iran would be if it possessed nuclear weapons.Would you let ISIS enrich uranium? Would you let ISIS build a heavy-water reactor? Would you let ISIS develop intercontinental ballistic missiles? Of course you would not. Then you must not let the Islamic State of Iran do those things either  because if you do  here is what will happen. Once Iran produces atomic bombs  all the charm and all the smiles will suddenly disappear — they will just vanish. It is then that the ayatollahs will show their true face and unleash their aggressive fanaticism on the entire world.There is only one responsible course of action to address this threat. Iran’s nuclear military capabilities must be fully dismantled. Make no mistake — ISIS must be defeated  but to defeat ISIS and leave Iran as a threshold nuclear Power is to win the battle and lose the war.The fight against militant Islam is indivisible. When militant Islam succeeds anywhere  it is emboldened everywhere. When it suffers a blow in one place  it is set back in every place. That is why Israel’s fight against Hamas is not just our fight; it is everyone’s fight. Israel is fighting a fanaticism today that other countries may be forced to fight tomorrow. For 50 days this past summer  Hamas fired thousands of rockets at Israel  many of them supplied by Iran. I want members to think about what their countries would do if thousands of rockets were fired at their cities. Let them imagine millions of their citizens having seconds at most to scramble to bomb shelters  day after day. Members would not let terrorists fire rockets at their cities with impunity  nor would they let terrorists dig dozens of terror tunnels under their borders to infiltrate their towns in order to murder and kidnap their citizens. Israel justly defended itself against both rocket attacks and terror tunnels.Yet Israel faced another challenge. We faced a propaganda war because  in an attempt to win the world’s sympathy  Hamas cynically used Palestinian civilians as human shields. It used schools — not just schools  United Nations schools — private homes  mosques and even hospitals to store and fire rockets at Israel. As Israel surgically struck at the rocket launchers and at the tunnels  Palestinian civilians were tragically but unintentionally killed. There are heartrending images that resulted  and these fuelled libellous charges that Israel was deliberately targeting civilians. We were not. We deeply regret every single civilian casualty.And the truth is  Israel was doing everything to minimize Palestinian civilian casualties. Hamas was doing everything to maximize Israeli civilian casualties and Palestinian civilian casualties. Israel dropped flyers  made phone calls  sent text messages  broadcast warnings in Arabic on Palestinian television — all this to enable Palestinian civilians to evaluate targeted areas. No other country and no other army in history have gone to greater lengths to avoid casualties among the civilian population of their enemies.Such concern for Palestinian life was all the more remarkable given that Israeli civilians were being bombarded by rockets  day after day  night after night. And as their families were being rocketed by Hamas  Israel’s citizen army  the brave soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces  our young boys and girls  upheld the highest moral values of any army in the world. Israel’s soldiers deserve not condemnation but admiration — admiration from decent people everywhere.Here is what Hamas did. Hamas embedded its missile batteries in residential areas and told Palestinians to ignore Israel’s warnings to leave. And just in case people did not get the message  they executed Palestinian civilians in Gaza who dared to protest. And  no less reprehensible  Hamas deliberately placed its rockets where Palestinian children live and play.Let me show the Assembly a photograph. It was taken by a France 24 crew during the recent conflict. It shows two Hamas rocket launchers  which were used to attack us. Three children can be seen playing next to them. Hamas deliberately put its rockets in hundreds of residential areas like this — hundreds of them. That is a war crime. I say to President Abbas  these are the crimes — the war crimes — committed by his Hamas partners in the national unity Government which he heads and for which he is responsible. These are the real war crimes he should have investigated or spoken out against from this rostrum last week.As Israel’s children huddle in bomb shelters and Israel’s Iron Dome missile defence knocked Hamas rockets out of the sky  the profound moral difference between Israel and Hamas could not have been clearer. Israel was using its missiles to protect its children; Hamas was using its children to protect its missiles.By investigating Israel rather than Hamas for war crimes  the United Nations Human Rights Council has betrayed its noble mission to protect the innocent. In fact  what it is doing is to turn the laws of war upside down. Israel  which took unprecedented steps to minimize civilian casualties  is condemned; Hamas  which both targeted and hid behind civilians — that is a double war crime — is given a pass. The Human Rights Council is thus sending a clear message to terrorists everywhere: “Use civilians as a human shield. Use them again and again and again.” And you know why? Because  sadly  it works. By granting international legitimacy to the use of human shields  the Human Rights Council has become a terrorist rights council  and it will have repercussions — it probably already has — in terms of the use of civilians as human shields. It is not just our interests and values that are under attack: it is the interests and values of all of us.We live in a world steeped in tyranny and terror  where gays are hanged from cranes in Tehran  political prisoners are executed in Gaza  young girls are abducted en masse in Nigeria and hundreds of thousands are butchered in Syria  Libya and Iraq  yet nearly half of the Human Rights Council’s resolutions focusing on a single country have been directed against Israel — the one true democracy in the Middle East; Israel  where issues are openly debated in a boisterous Parliament  where human rights are protected by independent courts  and where women  gays and minorities live in a genuinely free society.The biased treatment of Israel by the Human Rights Council — that is a misnomer  but I will use it just the same — is only one manifestation of the return of one of the world’s oldest prejudices. We hear mobs today in Europe calling for the gassing of Jews. We hear some national leaders compare Israel to the Nazis. This is not a function of Israel’s policies; it is a function of diseased minds  and that disease has a name. It is called anti-Semitism. It is now spreading in polite society where it masquerades as legitimate criticism of Israel. For centuries  the Jewish people have been demonized with blood libels and charges of deicide. Today  the Jewish State is demonized with the apartheid libel and charges of genocide.In what moral universe does genocide include warning the enemy civilian population to get out of harm’s way or ensuring that they receive tons of humanitarian aid each day  even as thousands of rockets are being fired at us  or setting up a field hospital to aid their wounded? I suppose it is the same moral universe in which a man who wrote a dissertation of lies about the Holocaust and who insists on a Palestine free of Jews — Judenrein — can stand at this rostrum and shamelessly accuse Israel of genocide and ethnic cleansing. In the past  outrageous lies against the Jews were the precursors to the wholesale slaughter of our people. But no more; today  we the Jewish people have the power to defend ourselves. We will defend ourselves against our enemies on the battlefield and we will expose their lies against us in the court of public opinion. Israel will continue to stand proud and unbowed.Despite the enormous challenges facing Israel  I believe we have a historic opportunity. After decades of seeing Israel as their enemy  leading States in the Arab world increasingly recognize that together we and they face many of the same dangers. Principally  that means a nuclear-armed Iran and militant Islamist movements gaining ground in the Sunni world. Our challenge is to transform those common interests in order to create a productive partnership that would build a more secure  peaceful and prosperous Middle East. Together we can strengthen regional security. We can advance projects in water  agriculture  transportation  health care  energy and so many other fields.I believe that the partnership between us can also help facilitate peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Many have long assumed that an Israeli-Palestinian peace can help facilitate a broader rapprochement between Israel and the Arab world. But I believe that  these days  it may work the other way around  namely  that a broader rapprochement between Israel and the Arab world may help facilitate an Israeli-Palestinian peace. Therefore  to achieve that peace  we must look not only to Jerusalem and Ramallah but also to Cairo  Amman  Abu Dhabi  Riyadh and elsewhere. I believe that peace could be realized with the active involvement of Arab countries that are willing to provide political  material and other indispensable support.I am ready to make a historic compromise  and not because Israel occupies a foreign land. The people of Israel are not occupiers in the land of Israel. History  archaeology and common sense all make clear that we have had a singular attachment to this land for over 3 000 years. I want peace because I want to create a better future for my people. But it must be a genuine peace  one that is anchored in mutual recognition and enduring security arrangements — rock-solid security arrangements — on the ground. Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon and Gaza created two militant Islamic enclaves on our borders from which tens of thousands of rockets have been fired at Israel. Those sobering experiences heighten Israel’s security concerns regarding potential territorial concessions in the future.Those security concerns are even greater today. Let us just look around. The Middle East is in chaos. States are disintegrating  and militant Islamists are filling the void. Israel cannot have territories from which it withdraws taken over by Islamic militants yet again  as happened in Gaza and Lebanon. That would place the likes of ISIS within mortar range  a few miles of 80 per cent of our population. Think about that. The distance between the 1967 lines and the suburbs of Tel Aviv is similar to the distance between United Nations Headquarters and Times Square. Israel is a tiny country. That is why in any peace agreement  which will obviously necessitate a territorial compromise  I will always insist that Israel be able to defend itself  by itself  against any threat.Yet despite everything that has happened  some still do not take Israel’s security concerns seriously  but I do and I always will. That is because as Prime Minister of Israel I am entrusted with the awesome responsibility of ensuring the future of the Jewish people and the future of the Jewish State. No matter what pressure is brought to bear  I will never waver in fulfilling that responsibility.I believe that with a fresh approach on the part of our neighbours  we can advance peace despite the difficulties we face. In Israel  we have a record of making the impossible possible. We have made a desolate land flourish  and with very few natural resources we have used the fertile minds of our people to turn Israel into a global centre of technology and innovation. Peace would enable Israel to realize its full potential and to bring a promising future not only to our people and not only to the Palestinian people  but to many  many others in our region. But the old template for peace must be updated. It must take into account new realities and new roles and responsibilities for our Arab neighbours.There is a new Middle East. It presents new dangers but also new opportunities. Israel is prepared to work with Arab partners and the international community to confront those dangers and to seize those opportunities. Together  we must recognize the global threat of militant Islam  the primacy of dismantling Iran’s nuclear weapons capability  and the indispensable role of Arab States in advancing peace with the Palestinians. All that may fly in the face of conventional wisdom  but it is the truth. And the truth must always be spoken  especially in the United Nations. Isaiah  a great prophet of peace  taught us nearly 3 000 years ago in Jerusalem to speak truth to power. He said:“For the sake of Zion  I will not be silent. For the sake of Jerusalem  I will not be still until her justice shines bright and her salvation glows like a flaming torch”.Let us light a torch of truth and justice to safeguard our common future."
"83",3504,"ITA",69,2014,"I would like to greet the General Assembly and to confess how deeply moved I feel to be here. For those who have never spoken in the Assembly Hall  it remains a place of extraordinary fascination and appeal. For those who have become accustomed to being in such halls  they may consider it as something already seen and experienced. For someone like me  who is in the Hall for the first time today  the emotion is overwhelming to find oneself in the place where there is a sense of still being able to build a horizon of human rights  respect  freedom and peace. I feel the emotion of the future in a place where a great Secretary-General  Mr. Dag Hammarskj.ld  had the strength  the vision and the intuition to design a different world. For those  like us  who grew up with that model  the statement “For all that has been — thanks. For all that shall be — yes”  which Dag Hammarskj.ld wrote in his diary  the United Nations was something more than a political programme  it was the very idea of a definition of politics.Yet today  the future appears threatening. The future is frightening. The future is no longer promising. We want to believe that it is possible to return to the idea of tomorrow. It is the dream of the United Nations to return to the goal of preserving future generations from the horrors of war. Today  however  we must have the courage also to say  when looking back at the history of the Organization  that the errors of the past cannot be erased. The year 2015 is the year in which we will recall the twentieth anniversary of what happened in Srebrenica  when international institutions remained silent before one of the worst massacres and genocides that still today finds no justification. That is why we need to repeat in this Hall today that it is time for politics to return to finding a definition of a future of hope.My generation grew up hearing that history had ended  that the century that had just passed was a short century in which we had already seen everything. But history has not ended  the century we have left behind us was not short  and today  we must say that the political way is the only way to prevent the bloodletting that is causing so much grief in the Mediterranean  in the Middle East  in Ukraine and in many regions of Africa.Because of its central location  Italy has the will and the need to play a greater role in the Mediterranean. Italy  whose gift to the world is the image of the city and the public square — in the sense of an open gathering place for the community — cannot be silent when confronted with the transformation of the Mediterranean  which should be the heart of Europe and the public square for discussion and confrontation  but has all too often been transformed into a cemetery.I take the floor today one year after the Italian Government launched an important operation called Mare Nostrum. Thanks to that operation  I can stand before the Assembly and say that the men and women of the Italian Coast Guard and volunteer services have saved 80 000 human lives  80 000 people who could become doctors  musicians  workers  80 000 people who were pulled from the Mediterranean as if from a cemetery  thanks to an operation that we take pride in but that cannot be left only to Italy today. We need to say forcefully that intervention in the Mediterranean area is a strategic intervention for the international community that cannot only be left to a single force.In saying that  we need to add that the priority for that area today is Libya and our friends  the Libyan people  who are suffering through a time of transition that seems never to end. We are committed not to underestimate a hot spot in the midst of the Mediterranean that could reach a point of no return in a spiral of violence and instability in the region. Italy will continue to do its part  but we must emphasize with decisiveness and intensity in this prestigious forum that the risk of a gradual fragmentation of Libya and the negative consequences that that would trigger for the entire North African region would be catastrophic for peace and stability in the entire region. We are committed to supporting a strong and stable Libya  and we will continue to work with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Libya through our embassy  which is still open  but we want to say with great determination that the situation in Libya must be a priority for all.Another priority  especially for those today who are preparing for a discussion on the terrorist threat in the Middle East and elsewhere  is to be aware that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)  as was said yesterday with great force  is not just a terrorist threat to a specific region  but a risk for the entire community of men and women who would call themselves human. We are not dealing with a form of religious expression. Religions can both fuel the fires of a conflict and provide water to heal wounds. We believe that ISIL and the threat it represents are not connected in the slightest way with a conflict of religions.At the same time  we say forcefully that those of us who had the duty — or the good fortune  if I may speak provocatively — to visit a refugee camp  as I did in the second half of August in Erbil  Kurdistan  in Iraq  will realize that we cannot be unresponsive to the dismayed faces of so many victims of fanaticism. To see an international aid worker who shows you images on her cellphone of children who were executed  who were lined up against a wall and shot; to hear stories about young women taken to barracks in the centre of Mosul and forced  in silence and powerlessness  to satisfy all the desires of violent terrorists; to think of what is happening to journalists and hostages — requires us to say what must be said. A genocide is under way  and in the face of such activities  we know that only a unified international community can win this battle of civilization against evil. That is why I said yesterday to President Obama that the international coalition can count on Italy’s support to eliminate the threat posed by ISIL  and I continue to insist on the fact that the commitment of our country in every region and in every area of the region will be resolute and  I hope  decisive.Italy has contributed and will continue to contribute in Lebanon  through our soldiers and their commitment to supporting the United Nations peacekeeping mission deployed in the south of Lebanon. I would take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to those women and men who  from Lebanon to Afghanistan  wear the uniform of our country to make a concrete commitment to ensuring stability and peace. But at the same time  I know  we know  that there will be no peace in the region until what a great prophet of Italian political thought  Giorgio La Pira  called the “peace of the children of Abraham” has brought an end to the unresolved conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians.We will never tire of seeking peace for Jerusalem  and a ceasefire in Gaza will be consolidated and respected only if we all recognize the two-State solution and the right of the Palestinian people to finally have a homeland. As I have said before and I repeat here  it is not only a right but a duty for Israel to exist — for the sake of history  memory  innovation  democracy  freedom  of which the Israeli people give constant proof. The entire international community must support that process. Those words must be clearly heard in this Hall  where someone once dared to call into question the very right of Israel to exist.It is dialogue and politics that can prevent a return to the dialectics of the cold war. We had thought that those times were behind us  but now the tensions on the eastern borders of Ukraine risk are jeopardizing the greatest achievement of the European integration process — a continent of peace and stability. Never before had there been such a long period of peace as the one we are experiencing today in Europe.But the crisis in Ukraine has forced us to confront unexpected challenges. I believe that there is a connection between two fundamental principles — the right of the Ukrainian people to have the territorial unity of their country recognized in the face of acts of aggression that have violated its integrity  and at the same time  I hope that we can overcome the tensions with the Russian Federation  which will  I hope  return to playing its role as a global stakeholder so needed by the international community.A great expert in politics from the Italian Renaissance  Niccolò Macchiavelli  wrote  “To know how to recognize an opportunity in war and take is of greater benefit than anything else”. Macchiavelli’s words helps us understand in this moment that the Minsk Agreement is a great opportunity in the war under way in Ukraine. We must seize this opportunity for the people of Ukraine and the international community.Dialogue and reconciliation are indispensable tools in the Sudan  Somalia and in the Central African region. They are the strong point of our community as it faces newly emerging difficulties  starting with the Ebola virus and its dramatic humanitarian  social and economic consequences. Italy is doing its part and will continue to do so  following the Secretary-General’s leadership and inspiration  whom I thank for his prompt action.But I should also emphasize that political solutions are the only way forward for the year 2015  although they are often marked by complex  difficult challenges. Problems to be solved include the challenge of achieving new global governance of the Internet  as the President of Brazil mentioned yesterday (see A/69/PV.6)  and the challenge of finally making a major investment in gender equality  so that we no longer consider it newsworthy when a woman takes on a position of responsibility. I am very proud to say that for the first time in its history  women make up more than half of my Government. I am happy and pleased to say that we will never fall short in our commitment to leadership roles for women  but above all we will fight to ensure that young women can be free in developing countries and nations facing especially difficult situations.I cannot emphasize strongly enough that 2015 will be a very important year in the fight against religious discrimination. Every religious minority has the right to be defended. Never before have so many Christians been killed in regions around the world because of their faith  and never before has one of the genuine tragedies of our times been so badly underestimated. Within the international community it is especially vital that we forcefully affirm the values of equality  respect and tolerance  which are of special relevance for us in Italy when talking about the death penalty. That is why this new session of the General Assembly coincides with the presentation of a new draft resolution on abolishing capital punishment. I hope that the number of countries supporting it will continue to grow.I would like to say that I am especially excited to be able to speak about that on behalf of Italy  which has always fought at both the governmental and the non-governmental levels to make that issue a priority. Earlier in my career  I was mayor of the city of Florence  which was the first place in history to abolish the death penalty. A herald descended the steps of the Palazzo Vecchio to announce that in that State  the Grand Duchy  the death penalty had been abolished. Let us not pile more barbarous acts on other ones. I ask every State to join us in this battle for civilization.The year 2015 will also be an important one for the Expo in Milan and the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris  which we discussed two days ago  and for actions that remind us of the need for a turning point  such as in the debate over Security Council reform. We all believe that the Council must be made more effective  representative  transparent and accountable to the members of the international community. But opinions on how to achieve that goal still differ. In order to bring the various reform models closer together  the Uniting for Consensus group  to which my country belongs  continues to maintain that creating new permanent members would imperil that goal  and I reiterate our willingness to find compromise solutions.I believe that it is crucial that all those challenges be seen as subsumed within the greatest challenge of them all  one in which we must all be on the front lines. There can be no peace  no freedom  no respect until the international community puts at the centre of its strategy a gigantic  grand investment into education  schools  universities  going from house to house  village to village  piazza to piazza. We say that the most powerful weapon in affirming the values of peace and freedom is the weapon of education  of culture  of human capital  of investment in people and in the stories and freedoms of individual women and men.That is why I believe that  while we are living in difficult times  we are also living in a time when we must  as former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld put it  say yes to the future. He also said  “We are not permitted to choose the frame of our destiny. But what we put into it is ours”. We are not permitted to choose the frame of our destiny. We are living in a time of threats and problems. Yet what we can put into it is entirely ours. Within this frame of our destiny we can once again inspire others with the values of education  freedom and peace  so long as we are stay true to our history and hopeful for our future."
"84",3550,"JAM",69,2014,"I stand here today  as a representative of a nation with strong ancestral ties to the African continent  to welcome the election of Mr. Sam Kutesa to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We are confident that the experience and skills that he brings to that high Office will be invaluable as we tackle the myriad challenges that confront us today. To his predecessor Ambassador John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda  I also convey sincere appreciation for the leadership and vision that he showed in guiding our work  not the least of which was the success he achieved in setting the stage for the post-2015 development agenda.The quest for peace and development has assumed an urgency we have seldom seen. We live in a time of great instability and conflict. At the same time  millions of citizens face unbearable levels of hardship and endure unconscionable levels of suffering. Far too many of our fellow men and women are being left behind. It rests within our grasp to build a better future for our peoples. This is the time to put people firmly at the centre of our development aspirations  to tackle the root causes of conflict  to create a culture of peace and to entrench the principles of justice  equity  democracy and respect for the rule of law. Recommitment to the principles of multilateralism and fidelity to the ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are central to our efforts to accomplish those goals.In the coming months  our attention will be focused on elaborating an international development agenda for the post-2015 period. That provides an invaluable opportunity for us to address the critical challenges of poverty  inequality  global insecurity and environmental degradation. The post-2015 development agenda must have poverty eradication as its central focus. In so doing  we must give due regard to the developmental status of each country  in particular small island developing States (SIDS) and countries classified as middle-income. Implementing and delivering the post-2015 development agenda requires a strong focus on the means of implementation.The third International Conference on SIDS drew international attention to the unique vulnerabilities that threaten the very existence and survival of that group of countries. Our ability to withstand the ever-increasing risk of economic and environmental shocks requires that we forge effective partnerships with other members of the international community. In short  we cannot do the job alone. Jamaica therefore welcomes the support of the international community in joining forces with SIDS to negotiate the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway  which builds on the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy.Let me say  though  that support for SIDS must continue beyond support for the International Conference. Our concerns need to be addressed in the context of the post-2015 development agenda. Among those concerns are the full and effective integration of SIDS into the multilateral trading system  an increased voice and participation in international financial institutions  the application of more relevant methods for measuring growth and representing our state of development  and increased support for efforts to enhance our resilience to natural hazards and economic shocks.We welcome the outcome of the Climate Summit convened by the Secretary-General. The participation of business interests  civil society and a range of international institutions highlighted the importance of promoting concerted action among various stakeholders to address climate change. While the threats posed by climate change may be theoretical for some  they are very real for those of us who live in the Caribbean. In recent years we have had to deal with the increased frequency of hurricanes and their widespread impact on our land  lives and livelihoods. The financial impact of hurricanes adds to the burden of the dire economic challenges that we continue to bear. Our fellow Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries in the eastern Caribbean will no doubt share their recent experiences with floods that lasted only a few hours last Christmas but caused gross domestic product losses from which they have yet to recover.As we prepare for the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held in Lima later this year  all countries must be engaged in a cooperative effort to devise an appropriate response to climate change that will result in a steep reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions. We also need action to follow up on the additional document to be adopted by the Conference of the Parties  which may be a protocol  another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that will be applicable to all parties. In that we dare not fail. Our commitment to addressing climate change must be given effect at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties in Paris next year.This year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child  the most universally ratified human rights treaty. The year 2014 also marks the twentieth anniversary of the historic International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo. At the same time  we are on the cusp of the twentieth anniversary of the fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing  to be celebrated in 2015. This is therefore an opportune moment to evaluate the progress made in safeguarding the rights of women and children. All children have the right to live a life free from fear and violence. That is the essential prerequisite for the development of their full range of skills and talents. Earlier this year  Jamaica was pleased to host  alongside the Secretary-General’s Special Representative on Violence against Children  an interregional meeting that examined the impact of violence against children. I urge members  as we craft the post-2015 development agenda  to be seized of the importance of addressing the special needs of children and youth. We also call for special attention to be paid to achieving gender equality. Rooting out violence against women  enhancing women’s economic empowerment and promoting their equal participation at all levels of decision-making should be essential tasks in that regard.I now turn to the problem posed by the heinous activity of human trafficking  a crime of global proportions that exploits the most vulnerable among us  not the least of whom are women and children. Jamaica calls upon the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to provide a framework for Member States to develop a robust programme to help to bring an end to that affront to human dignity and freedom.We cannot ignore the link between our efforts to spur development and the need to safeguard the health of our people. The challenges to security and sustainable development posed by threats to global public health have been devastatingly illustrated by the recent outbreak of the Ebola epidemic. As we heard just two days ago from the Director-General of the World Health Organization  every day  every minute  counts in fighting the most severe public-health emergency seen in modern times. This is the time for courageous partnership  not inaction based on fear. An urgent and robust international response is required to marshal all the medical expertise and modern technologies that are at our disposal. The pandemic nature of global health threats such as Ebola and HIV/AIDS  including the silent killers of non-communicable diseases  require that we employ measures to combat them that are similar in intensity and urgency to those used in the fight against other global challenges.Jamaica is concerned that the conflicts in Syria  the Gaza Strip  Iraq  Ukraine  South Sudan and Mali pose serious threats to regional and international security. Those conflicts are neither limited in scope nor confined to national borders. The instability in Libya  Yemen and the Central African Republic is equally troubling. Of even greater concern are the resulting humanitarian crises and the widespread violations of human rights. It is undeniable that those crises are fuelled by the growing propensity to funnel and transfer conventional arms to non-State actors  including rebel groups and separatist militias. The militarization of such groups often serves to further those conflicts rather than hasten their end.Each passing day  the international community is confronted with new crises  the emergence of greater acts of barbarism  and the rise of more lethal terrorist groups. In the past few months  we have witnessed the atrocities of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the downing of a civilian aircraft in Ukraine and a United Nations peacekeeping helicopter in South Sudan. We also dare not forget that it is now 166 days since the Boko Haram terrorist group brazenly abducted 200 schoolgirls  yet their desperate plight continues.It is unfortunate that the number and scale of those crises not only place extraordinary demands on the international aid system  thereby hampering its capacity to respond  but also serve to desensitize the international community to the horrific levels of suffering being borne by civilian populations. Resolving those conflicts requires global and regional cooperation. It is clear also that conflict prevention must assume greater prominence. We cannot continue to operate in crisis mode only. Our vision is that of a United Nations transformed into a more effective instrument for preventing conflict and securing just and peaceful settlements.Recent events in Gaza demonstrate that the need for a lasting resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains as urgent as ever. Jamaica believes that the cycle of violence will continue in the absence of a negotiated political settlement based on a just  lasting and comprehensive agreement that guarantees the security of Israel and recognizes the Palestinian State within internationally recognized borders.We reiterate our commitment to disarmament  non-proliferation and arms control. In the Caribbean we are acutely aware of the pernicious impact of the proliferation of small arms and light weapons  fuelled by a dangerous nexus with the drug trade. That combination is the single greatest cause of fear and insecurity among our citizens. For the past two decades we have remained resolute in our call for a global partnership to fight that scourge. We are pleased that  with the fiftieth ratification of the Arms Trade Treaty earlier this week  that historic Treaty will enter into force on 25 December.All States  whether small or large  have a role to play in the maintenance of international peace and security. Jamaica is therefore honoured to assume the chairmanship of the First Committee at this sixty-ninth session  which reflects our commitment to advancing the objectives of disarmament  non-proliferation and arms control.Among the major milestones to be celebrated next year will be the seventieth anniversary of the International Court of Justice. Jamaica is firm in its commitment to the highest standards of respect for international justice and supports the role of the Court. Jamaica’s group of States has nominated the Jamaican jurist Patrick Lipton Robinson as a candidate for election to the International Court of Justice for the term 2015-2024. His nomination demonstrates Jamaica’s preparedness to contribute to the work of the Court and underscores that all States  regardless of size  can make a contribution to the development of the rules and norms of international law.In 2015 we expect to erect a permanent memorial to honour the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. Its location outside this very Hall will serve as a place of meditation and solemn reflection on the horrors of slavery and the need to prevent its recurrence and to address its ongoing legacy. I encourage Member States to contribute to the Trust Fund established to underwrite the cost of the memorial. Only a small shortfall remains. Let us press on to the end and meet the final goal.Jamaica looks forward to the commencement in January 2015 of the International Decade for People of African Descent  through which the international community will undertake a range of activities to address racism  xenophobia  discrimination and prejudice  as well as systemic inequalities and underdevelopment. People of African descent must be engaged directly in the range of measures that can be taken to redress the legacy of the historic wrongs they have suffered. CARICOM countries believe that reparatory justice is an important element in that process.Jamaica remains opposed to the unilateral application of economic sanctions and trade restrictions applied by one State against another. We reiterate our support for an end to the economic  financial and commercial embargo against Cuba  and urge all States that continue to apply such measures to repeal or invalidate such laws. We have it within our power to shape a world that is just and equitable and that embraces both peace and development with equal fervour. As we prepare to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations next year  we recommit to the lofty goals enshrined in the Charter — peace and security and the economic and social advancement of all people. Let us get on with the task."
"85",3596,"JOR",69,2014,"What and where is global power? I say that global power is here in this Hall  and it is ours if our countries work as one. That is the great promise of the General Assembly. The times demand that we exercise that power now and to the full.In my region  the challenges have grown significantly since I spoke here last year (see A/68/PV.5). Those who say “This is not our business” are wrong. The security of every nation will be shaped by the fate of the Middle East. Together  we can and must undertake urgent humanitarian and security measures  create durable solutions for today’s crises and provide new opportunities for dialogue  reconciliation  prosperity and peace.The terrorists and criminals targeting Syria  Iraq and other countries today are extreme reflections of a global threat. Our international community needs a collective strategy to contain and to defeat those groups. My country is at the forefront of that effort. We are leading a number of initiatives to counter extremism. As the representative of the Asia-Pacific bloc on the Security Council  we seek a strong outcome of the Security Council summit on threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts  to be chaired by President Obama this afternoon.Another critical global focus must be a decisive affirmation of mutual respect within and among religions and peoples. The teachings of true Islam are clear: sectarian conflict and strife are utterly condemned. Islam prohibits violence against Christians and the other communities that make up each country. Let me say once again that Arab Christians are an integral part of my region’s past  present and future. I call on Muslim and other leaders to work together against falsehoods and divisive actions.Jordan is honoured to have spearheaded global interfaith and intrareligious initiatives. Building on that  Jordan will introduce a draft resolution covering the general proposal that a new international offence  falling under the crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity  be considered on the basis of the aberrant new crimes against religious communities seen recently in Syria and in Iraq.Together  let us also address the conditions that extremists exploit. Radicalization thrives on injustice  insecurity and marginalization. The Assembly’s transformative development agenda can give the world’s people a better way forward through concrete programmes and investments that will change lives.We must also work actively for consensus-driven political solutions to regional crises. The security situation in Syria  Iraq and Lebanon must be addressed comprehensively. Jordan supports a united and stable Iraq with an inclusive national political process. In Syria  there must be a political solution based on reforms that give all communities a role in rebuilding their country. International influence is vital to bring the moderate opposition and the regime back to the negotiating table immediately.The heavy flow of Syrian refugees continues. My country is sheltering nearly 1.4 million Syrians. We are now host to the world’s third-largest number of refugees  and that is placing an overwhelming burden on Jordan’s people  infrastructure and already limited resources. The refugee crisis is a recognized global responsibility and demands a global solution. To date  the response has not kept pace with the real needs. There must be a concerted effort to get humanitarian assistance flowing inside Syria and to support host countries and communities  including Jordan.We cannot address the future of my region without addressing its central conflict: the denial of Palestinian rights and statehood. This year  yet again  we have seen a dangerous halt in the progress towards peace and a Palestinian State. Instead  in Gaza  we have seen another violent detour into conflict. How shall we heal the families who have lost so much? How shall we offer hope to young people whose futures are at risk? A first imperative step is to mobilize international efforts to rebuild Gaza. As we do so  we must also marshal the united global response needed to achieve a once-and-for-all lasting settlement. Such action can create the environment necessary to relaunch the final status negotiations on the basis of the Arab Peace Initiative.That approach offers a clear path — the only path — to a comprehensive settlement based on the two-State solution  international legitimacy and the terms of reference. For Israel  it offers security and normal diplomatic and economic relations with Arab and Muslim States and  for Palestinians  a viable and independent sovereign State  within the 1967 lines  with East Jerusalem as its capital. Unilateral actions that seek to pre-empt negotiations must end. Jordan strongly opposes threats to the Arab  Muslim and Christian identity of Jerusalem. As the Hashemite custodian of Jerusalem’s Muslim and Christian Holy Sites  I will continue to oppose any violation of the sanctity of the Al-Aqsa mosque.The people of Palestine seek what all humans seek. It is the common cause of the General Assembly: justice  dignity  opportunity and hope. That is our global responsibility. It is in our global power  and we must make it our global reality. Jordan stands ready to do its part."
"86",3643,"JPN",69,2014,"Humankind faces serious  unprecedented crises. Now is the time for us to stand united beneath the flag of the United Nations to confront those crises together. Japan is resolved to continue to take on great responsibility  working hand in hand with the international community.The Government of Japan is expending its best possible efforts in the fight against the Ebola virus. The international community should come together to address that crisis  which directly affects the peace and security of Africa. In that regard  Japan  as one of its sponsors  has strongly supported the adoption of Security Council resolution 2177 (2014). Japan has also supported the initiative of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  and His Excellency Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa  President of the General Assembly  to establish the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response.At the fifth Tokyo International Conference on African Development  held in Japan in the past year  the Government of Japan announced that it would set aside $500 million to address health issues in Africa and launch training programmes for some 120 000 health and medical-service providers. As a response to the Ebola outbreak  we have sent highly knowledgeable and experienced Japanese experts  as members of World Health Organization missions. We have also extended a total of $5 million in financial assistance and will provide $500 000 worth of personal protective equipment for health-care workers. Furthermore  we pledge to extend additional assistance totaling $40 million in future. We continue to be prepared to take any other measures  including the possibility of sending more experts to Africa and sharing a potentially promising drug developed by Japan’s Toyama Chemical Company and Fujifilm Holdings Corporation  which could be effective in the post-exposure phase of Ebola.The Middle East is in a state of unrest. In particular  Japan regards the activities of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant — which extends across national borders and has unilaterally declared the establishment of a so-called state — as a serious threat to international order. What is important now is to prevent extremism from taking root  while responding swiftly to the region’s humanitarian crises. To assist in that  Japan will provide $50 million of emergency assistance right away.Placing great importance on the stability of Ukraine  in March Japan swiftly announced economic assistance of up to $1.5 billion  which is now being implemented. We are also preparing new assistance towards reconstruction of the eastern part of Ukraine.Next year will be a momentous one for the United Nations. We will celebrate its seventieth anniversary. At the time the United Nations was founded  Japan was recovering from having been reduced to ashes. Since then  Japan has never for a moment forgotten the horrors of war. It set out on its post-war path abhorring the atrocities of a war that brought tragedy to innocent people both at home and in other nations and renewing its pledge towards peace. We have made a wholehearted commitment to shoulder United Nations responsibilities at home and abroad.Japan’s future lies in a straight extension of our history over the past 70 years. Our pledge to never wage war will be handed down and fostered by the Japanese people for generations to come. Peace will take root only when conflicts are deprived of places to reside within our hearts and our way of life. That is precisely why Japan is working to continue taking action at the grass-roots level around the world. Japan has been  is now and will continue to be a force providing momentum for proactive contributions to peace.Moreover  I wish to state and to pledge  first of all  that Japan is a nation that has worked to eliminate the war culture from people’s hearts  and it will spare no effort in continuing to do so. As early as the mid-1980s  Japan launched cooperation in Gaza to foster human resources. A total of more than 400 administrative officials and technical experts have come to Japan to receive intensive training. One of them is Mr. Najjar Osama  a young man serving as an official with the Palestinian Energy and Natural Resources Authority. He said:“Gaza has no natural resources whatsoever. The only thing we have is people  a situation the same as Japan’s. What I learned in Japan is the spirit of never  ever giving up.”After being educated in Japan for a month  Najjar Osama brought solar-power technology back to his hometown  to be attached to the facility in greatest need of a stand-alone power system. The equipment that he and his colleagues introduced to the largest hospital in the Gaza Strip has endured the unrest and kept the lights on in the hospital’s emergency room.It is perhaps more than just a coincidence that the Somalia story I wish to tell also relates to lighting. The most important thing for Hamidah Hassan — a girl 10 years of age  living in the camps for internally displaced persons in Mogadishu — was lighting to illuminate the camp’s tents at night. A lit tent acts as a deterrent to sexual violence. Over the past two years  Japan has distributed to internally displaced persons  including young girls such as Hamidah  some 2 500 small lanterns  made by Panasonic  that bank electricity generated from sunlight during the day and convert it to lamplight at night. Hamidah is now working hard  dreaming that one day she will become a doctor.We must continue to clear away anxiety and fear from people’s hearts and cull any shoots of hatred. Japan and the Japanese people will continue to do our best to offer our own willingness and capacity  knowledge and experience  in order to make that a reality. First and foremost  we will continue to assist in enhancing education  which will form the basis of economic growth for those who need it  from primary education to vocational training. Our aim  always  is to internalize the joy of work in people’s nature. We hope for people to keenly realize that the sweat brought about by their labour is an investment in the future.Expanding roads  ports and the increasingly connected power grids  together with effective governance that is fully in step with those improvements  will help to bring about an affluent and peaceful society that values human rights. When that concept receives broad-based support  people become the owners of their society in the truest sense of the word. To expand that kind of society from a point to a line  and from a line to a plane  Japan has always sought foundations of peace. We have always focused our official development assistance philosophy on that approach.The banner of a proactive contribution to peace borne by the Japanese Government is a flag planted atop the natural development of conviction and self-confidence that we have acquired through many years of promoting human security  that is  working as hard as we could for the development of a society that places people front and centre. We will carry on with our work  hoping to create  in time  a fair and just society that places human beings front and centre and a democracy that values human rights.Seventy years ago  the United Nations proclaimed its determination “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” and to “practice tolerance”. The United Nations must not depart from those ideals. It is with exactly that determination that Japan aspires to join the Security Council once again as a non-permanent member next year  marking the seventieth year since the start of the United Nations.Over the 58 long years since Japan became a Member of the United Nations in 1956  as its eightieth Member  Japan has worked tirelessly for the causes of the United Nations. We believe that our efforts have been second to none. It is my wish  with the seventieth anniversary as a turning point  that countries sharing the same aims can all work together to finally resolve the long-standing issue of the reform of the United Nations in a way that reflects the realities of the twenty-first century. In that context  Japan seeks to become a permanent member of the Security Council and to take on an appropriate role that the status requires.It was on the same occasion last year that I spoke of the significance and importance of enhancing the power of women and appealed for us to create a society in which women shine (see A/68/PV.12). Japan has now begun to work towards resolving the numerous issues we face  together with private industries  in order to increase women’s participation in society as soon as possible. We must foster environments in which it is possible to balance child care and nursing care on the one hand and work on the other. In addition  eliminating biases about the roles of women that still exist in society will be basic  more so than anything else.We have just held a large-scale international conference with an aim of promoting the dynamic participation of women. With an eye set on economic development and the resolution of global issues  about 100 leaders from all sectors of society from around the world sent out a message to the world of their commitment to bringing the power of women to fruition. In less than a year  the empowerment of women has become a guiding principle that has driven Japan’s policies both domestically and overseas. Japan has focused on advancing the status of girls and mothers in Africa  a region that receives emphasis within our foreign aid.The twentieth century had a history of profound harm to women’s honour and dignity when conflicts broke out. Around the globe  we still find abhorrent circumstances in which women are denied access to such basic services as medical care and education merely because they were born female  thereby depriving them of opportunities to become self-reliant. Japan seeks to be a country that walks alongside such women throughout the world. We intend to encourage and support  throughout the world  the self-reliance of women whose hearts have suffered grievous harm.We intend to make the twenty-first century a world without human rights violations against women. Japan will stand at the fore and lead the international community in eliminating sexual violence during conflicts. Therein lies the reason for Japan to reinforce its cooperation with Ms. Zainab Bangura’s Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict.Fundamental rights such as education and health must be ensured everywhere throughout the world. It is necessary for the United Nations and  indeed  the world to come together as one to take action so that girls and boys can attend school equally and that expectant mothers can receive medical care with peace of mind. Moreover  in order for women to lead lives full of pride and hope  I consider it essential to develop their ability to be economically self-reliant  above all else. I do not have the slightest doubt that the creation of a society in which women shine holds the key to changing the whole of society.Last year I pledged in my address here  before the General Assembly  that Japan would implement assistance in excess of $3 billion over three years  aimed chiefly at advancing the status of women. The amount already implemented over the past year is $1.8 billion  more than half the amount pledged. I also stated Japan respected the activities of UN-Women  which is responsible for women’s issues within the United Nations  and that we intended to become one of its leading contributors and thus a model country in that area. Over the past year  Japan increased its contributions to UN-Women fivefold  and in the future we will further increase the number of projects we support. We are also very pleased that next year UN-Women will open its Tokyo office. I expect that Japan will further enhance its coordination with the United Nations through that new office.As we draw up the post-2015 development agenda  Japan will continue to be as strongly involved as it has been to date. However  I strongly urge that if we are to truly attain inclusiveness  sustainability and resilience  as put forth in that agenda  then protection and empowerment of the vulnerable  irrespective of race  gender  or age  is important.This year Japan marks the sixtieth anniversary of the start of its official development assistance (ODA). Having learned from the determination of our predecessors  who began working to extend ODA a mere nine years after suffering total devastation in war  the Government of Japan is now in the process of establishing new guiding principles for our ODA. We intend to once more emphasize as priorities objectives such as high-quality economic growth  ensuring rule of law and realizing a peaceful and stable society.The objectives that Japan has continuously targeted through its ODA over those 60 years will not change in the slightest. There will be no change in our deeply rooted approach in which the most important thing in the fight against poverty is to cultivate a sense of ownership among the people concerned and to encourage self-help efforts. Nor will there be any changes in our efforts to fully ensure human security. Moreover  as we pursue enhancing women’s empowerment as the leverage point  I consider the attainment of our goals to be that much nearer.Over the past 20 years Japan has sent about 9 700 people on 13 United Nations peacekeeping operations. In the 10 years since the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission  Japan’s contributions to the Peacebuilding Fund have surpassed $40 million. In the future  we intend to cultivate still further our human resources in terms of both quantity and quality  to contribute to the area of peacebuilding.As the only country ever to have suffered the devastation of atomic bombings during wartime  Japan is prepared to lead discussions in the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to be convened next year — the seventieth anniversary of the atomic bombings.With regard to North Korea  Japan will work in coordination with relevant countries towards the comprehensive resolution of outstanding issues  including abduction and nuclear and missile issues.Japan has been among the biggest beneficiaries of the United Nations. Going forward  we will work harder than ever to bring about realization of the principles set forth by the United Nations. Japan is a nation that implements its pledges without fail. With that  I will end my discussion."
"87",3668,"KAZ",69,2014,"On behalf of the Republic of Kazakhstan  I would first like to congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We offer him our best wishes and full support. We also extend our special gratitude to Mr. John Ashe for his able leadership of the Assembly and his commitment to finding solutions to pressing international problems.The world today is undergoing a major upheaval. The global instability we face is a crisis of the global economy  of international law and  in a broader sense  of a lack of vision for our world’s future. To our deep regret  it seems that not all States yet recognize their full responsibility for the fate of their neighbourhoods and the world as a whole. Instead of well-thought-out  viable solutions  we are witnessing a disturbing escalation of problems  drawing in more countries and making our shared hopes of peace and stability ever more distant.Rivalry among the major Powers over perceived spheres of influence  markets and control over the production and transit of energy resources has increased. Tensions are on the rise  and the dangerous and unacceptable belief in the right of power in world politics has strengthened. As a result  we are witnessing a renewed arms race and the use of military force to impose and extend influence. Unilateral actions and double standards are destabilizing the international situation  exacerbating tensions  inciting ethnic and religious strife and threatening the security of other States. In today’s confusing media space  it is impossible to distinguish lies from truth. This dire state of global affairs  rising tensions and mistrust between States is undermining the efforts of the United Nations and entire international community to bring about a peaceful solution to any crisis by lawful means. It is also deeply worrying to see the established architecture of international law being dangerously eroded.What is even more perilous is that radical movements and extremist forces are skilfully exploiting the resulting uncertainty and instability in the international system. We are particularly concerned about the continuing violence in the Middle East and Africa and the growing threats posed to some Asian countries. We extend our deepest condolences to the citizens and Governments whose civilians have been senselessly killed during the violence.The situation in Ukraine is of special concern to Kazakhstan. The impact of the crisis now extends not just beyond the borders of Ukraine  but beyond the entire region. Kazakhstan supports peaceful initiatives aimed at the speedy de-escalation of the conflict  including the Minsk peace agreements. The ceasefire must be used to implement the peace plans of President Poroshenko and President Putin. These give hope for the eventual stabilization of the situation in Ukraine. We should also be concerned that the crisis in Ukraine has led to mutual sanctions being imposed by countries that together make up 60 per cent of the world’s gross domestic product. That will certainly have a damaging effect on global development and economic growth.Now more than ever  the world needs to come together to find an alternative model to solving problems  based on equal partnership  broad dialogue  mutual respect and tolerance among all stakeholders. We are confident that the Charter of the United Nations and the fundamental principles of international law provide the basis for this model. The role of the United Nations must remain pivotal and primary  while bringing States together and providing global leadership based on the equal participation of all Member States in the process.The dynamics of our world today and the forecasts of what the future might hold must prompt world leaders to look beyond narrow national interests and to exercise the highest degree of judgement and political will. What is at stake is nothing less than saving our civilization from destruction. This is not an exaggeration or overstatement. It is the harsh and threatening reality.We are seeing a fundamental change in the structure of geopolitical  geo-economic and transnational relations. What is emerging is a polycentric system of international transactions. Within that framework  nobody has the right to determine global and regional processes unilaterally. No country has exceptional rights or advantages. To help adjust to this emerging new multipolar world order and promote the widest possible involvement in identifying the way forward  in 2012 the President of Kazakhstan proposed the G-Global initiative. It seeks solutions based on five principles  namely  a strong preference for evolutionary rather than revolutionary policy change; the crucial importance of justice  equality and consensus; the promotion of global tolerance and trust; the need for global transparency; and  finally  the encouragement of constructive multilateralism. Unfortunately  the decisions taken in the wake of the global financial crisis by the Group of Twenty and the Group of Eight have proved to be insufficient because they were not all-inclusive in their elaboration.Kazakhstan therefore encourages Member States to use the G-Global platform for dialogue to help draw up plans — developed by all and acceptable to all — to prevent future global crises. We have already embarked on that process through the Astana Economic Forum  which resulted in a draft anti-crisis plan offered to the United Nations. We believe that the plan should be taken up by the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council and given serious consideration.At the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly in 1992  President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan initiated the convening of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA). Like the G-Global initiative  CICA emerged from the firm belief that international progress could come about only through strong and effective partnerships  built in the spirit of solidarity among all countries  regardless of their political and economic development. CICA has become an effective multinational forum for enhancing cooperation and promoting peace  security and stability in Asia. Kazakhstan supports the initiative of China  the country that chairs CICA currently  for a new security concept for Asia based on the principle of common  comprehensive  cooperative and sustainable regional security. That will enable us to consolidate CICA in the near future and transform it into the Organization for Security and Development in Asia.Two weeks ago  the General Assembly held an informal meeting to mark the International Day against Nuclear Tests. We are pleased that all those present expressed their determination to bring about a world without nuclear-weapon testing and  ultimately  without nuclear weapons. That is an issue close to the hearts of the people of Kazakhstan  who have witnessed and continue to live with the terrible legacy of nuclear testing. That is why we proposed 29 August as the day to raise awareness of this important issue  and why President Nazarbayev has launched the Abolish Testing: Our Mission Project  a global education campaign on the perils of nuclear testing.The closure of the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site and the renunciation of the world’s fourth-largest nuclear arsenal — both inherited from the Soviet Union upon our independence — were defining moments for our nation  and the starting point for the peaceful foreign policy we pursue today. Strengthening the global non-proliferation regime has remained one of the most important priorities of Kazakhstan’s foreign policy. The signing in May of the Protocol to the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia — the Semipalatinsk Treaty — by the five permanent countries on the Security Council marked a major moment for nuclear security in our region. We now urge the “nuclear five” countries to ratify the Protocol as soon as possible. We strongly encourage all stakeholders to uphold the provisions of Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime  and to work towards the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.We share the objectives of the proposed convention on the general and complete prohibition of nuclear weapons. Again  we call on all Member States to adopt the universal declaration on a nuclear-weapon-free world. That would serve as the first step towards the adoption of the convention.Reaffirming our commitment to the principle of the equal right of all countries to access nuclear technology for peaceful purposes  Kazakhstan stands ready to host the international bank of low-enriched uranium under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We also support an early political and diplomatic solution with respect to Iran’s nuclear programme  on the basis of strict compliance with the provisions of the NPT and IAEA regulations. Kazakhstan helped break the deadlock in the negotiations by hosting the first two rounds of resumed talks in Almaty last year. We welcome the latest 5+1 talks and strongly hope an agreement can be reached in November.We  together with the entire international community  are alarmed that terrorist groups are creating quasi-State entities to fight legitimate Governments and sow enmity and hatred. Religious extremism and separatism are fuelling a rise in terrorism  transnational crime and the illegal trafficking of narcotics. Kazakhstan was a sponsor of resolution 2178 (2014)  on foreign terrorist fighters  because we believe that the fight against international terrorism demands a long-term comprehensive approach.We also strongly believe that interreligious and interethnic harmony are essential prerequisites for peace and security. Kazakhstan  a diverse nation of 130 ethnic groups and many different faiths  has worked hard to build a culture of tolerance and respect. We have sought to promote those values internationally through the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions  an event that has taken place every three years since 2003. The Congress and its participants have unanimously renounced violence and pledged their support for continued interreligious dialogue among leaders of Islam  Christianity  Judaism  Buddhism  Hinduism  Taoism and many other faiths. Just last week  a preparatory meeting of religious representatives for the fifth Congress  to be held in Astana in 2015  issued a statement condemning extremism  violence and terrorism conducted in the name of any religion.Kazakhstan initiated the suggestion that the period 2013-2022 be proclaimed as the International Decade for the Rapprochement of Cultures. Greater dialogue and the exchange of ideas between different cultures greatly enhance international security.The situation in Afghanistan in the wake of the recent elections and the ongoing withdrawal of the coalition forces is a matter of importance for the wider security of Central Asia. We congratulate President-elect Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai and the people of Afghanistan on the completion of the electoral process. We look forward to close cooperation with Mr. Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah as they form  and work together in  the National Unity Government.Economic development is key to Afghanistan’s re-emergence as a peaceful and prosperous nation and good neighbour in Central Asia. Kazakhstan fully supports Afghanistan’s integration into the region’s expanding network of trade  energy and transportation links. We have taken practical steps to assist in the rehabilitation of our neighbour. The Government of Kazakhstan has allocated almost $3 million for the construction of social infrastructure and has provided more than $17 million in humanitarian food assistance. We are spending $50 million to train approximately 1 000 Afghan students in Kazakhstan universities. The first civilian students will soon successfully complete their education in Kazakhstan and join the peaceful reconstruction process in their home country.It is clear that we in Central Asia face a number of challenges that endanger stability not only in specific countries but in the entire region. There is regrettably little sign that those problems will disappear in the near future. That is why the United Nations and the international community need to work more purposefully in Central Asia. Accordingly  Kazakhstan’s call for the establishment of the United Nations regional hub in the city of Almaty is highly relevant. The United Nations plays an invaluable role in addressing natural and man-made disasters and assisting countries in their sustainable development through the coordination of the activities of national  regional and international actors. We believe that  with the focus on humanitarian assistance and development  the regional United Nations hub in Almaty would complement the work of the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia in Ashgabat  Turkmenistan. The presence of those two regional United Nations entities would cover a very broad range of challenges faced by countries in our vast region  including Afghanistan. Of course  the Government of Kazakhstan stands ready to offer its full support in establishing and developing the hub.Sustainable development is central to Kazakhstan’s ambitions for the future. We commend the United Nations and the Secretary-General for convening the action-focused Climate Summit a few days ago. Within our borders  we are working hard to achieve our national plan to make the transition to a green economy and have recently adopted voluntary commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. A national system for greenhouse gas emissions trading has already been put into operation. We are also determined to support sustainable development globally.In 2017  Astana will host the international specialized exhibition Expo 2017 on the theme “Future Energy”  which will promote best practices in the field of sustainable energy. We will provide support to representatives of around 60 developing countries to take part in Expo 2017.Kazakhstan  in conjunction with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific  is launching a project on the installation of biogas systems in nine small island developing States of the Pacific  which will help local communities produce electricity. At the same time  Kazakhstan and the United Nations Development Programme are developing a training programme in the sectors of oil and gas  agriculture and medicine for countries in Africa  Oceania and Latin America and the Caribbean.As the largest landlocked country in the world  Kazakhstan attaches great importance to the upcoming second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries  to be held in Vienna in November. The meeting aims to review and build on the Almaty Programme of Action in order to produce a new road map for landlocked developing countries that takes into account the challenges and threats that have emerged since the Almaty plan was first developed  over a decade ago.In 2015  we will finish construction of the Kazakhstan section of the Western Europe-Western China International Transit Corridor  which offers the shortest route from China to Europe and reduces transit times by up to 10 days  making it four to five times shorter than the sea route through the Suez Canal. By 2020  we expect the volume of freight traffic on the corridor between China  Central Asia  Russia and Europe to reach 33 million tons annually.The construction of new rail routes is also bringing our region together as never before. This December  we plan to open the Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan-Iran-Persian Gulf railroad  which will carry up to 10 million tons of cargo a year and allow us to increase our wheat exports five-fold. Another rail route  Uzbekistan-Turkmenistan-Iran-Oman-Qatar  which was first agreed in 2011  will also greatly increase international transit capacity for our region.As the Assembly knows  Kazakhstan is a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2017-2018. Its election would be a major step for our country  which has never before served on that body. Our extensive engagement in international affairs  including chairing key regional organizations  such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation  has given us the experience necessary to discharge that important responsibility. We believe that the priorities and challenges of our region should be represented in the Security Council  and Kazakhstan is ready to play that role.We are a peaceful  stable and fast-developing country  with a reputation for impartiality and for taking an effective  balanced approach  with a strong focus on international cooperation  conflict prevention and mediation. Overall  we are confident that we can fully contribute to the maintenance of international peace  security and development  as well as the improvement of the Council’s working methods.Only by working together  in a partnership in which all States Members of the United Nations are truly equal  regardless of their level of political and economic development or geographic location  can we achieve peace and security for all — a peace that is free from fear and violence and meets the needs of future generations.I would like to end by quoting Nelson Mandela  who said:“People respond in accordance to how you relate to them. If we approach them on the basis of violence  that’s how they’ll react. But if you say we want peace  we want stability  we can then do a lot of things that will contribute towards the progress of our society”."
"88",3714,"KEN",69,2014,"It is a great pleasure to address the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. As the current Chairman of the East African Community  I am particularly pleased to see The Honourable Sam Kutesa preside over the General Assembly. I assure you  Mr. President  of the full support of my Government during your presidency.I would like to begin by lending my voice to all of those who have called for urgent and sustained attention to the devastating Ebola crisis in Liberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea. Beyond the tragedy of the thousands who have lost lives and loved ones and the many more living with that threat  livelihoods and businesses have collapsed and aspirations for shared prosperity continue to shrink day by day. Kenya stands in solidarity with the countries affected by this devastating virus.Earlier this month the Kenyan people gave $1 million to the effort to bring the crisis under control  and we stand ready to do more. Last week  ministers of health from the East Africa region converged in Nairobi and agreed on measures to safeguard our populations and ensure that the virus does not spread in our region. The suspension of international flights into Monrovia and other affected capitals  including by Kenya Airways  followed a stark warning from the World Health Organization (WHO). Those measures  among others  have isolated the affected countries and further hurt the people and economies of the region.With regard to Kenya  our intention was not to do harm  but the warning from the WHO left us  as a regional hub  with few options. We stand ready to resume Kenya Airways flights once appropriate measures are put in place. Kenya believes that nothing in the immediate future requires more attention and determined response from the international community than the effort to stop and contain that devastating virus. I therefore welcome the establishment by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response  which I am sure will guide a collective global response.The Ebola crisis underlines the imperative to build strong States that can withstand crisis and respond to emergencies. State weakness in many African countries comes from a history of development paradigms and practices that weakened the State. We must commit to building strong  resilient and accountable States that can effectively respond to shocks  adversities and emergencies in the future.You  Sir  are presiding over a session of the General Assembly of historic significance to humankind. The sixty-ninth session will oversee the development and adoption of the post-2015 development agenda. This effort will build on the work of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  which developed those goals. Kenya is indeed proud to have been at the forefront of driving the Open Working Group process.The new world development agenda must address itself to the entire cross-section of social  economic and environmental challenges that face the world in the twenty-first century. Issues of sustained economic development  equality among nations  climate change  industrialization  biodiversity loss and environmental protection must now go hand in glove with the traditional challenges of poverty  disease  hunger and inequality within nations. The new agenda must therefore be universal and comprehensive and responsive to all nations equally in order to be transformative in its impact.We in Kenya recognize  however  that a number of obstacles stand in the way of achieving the new development agenda. The most immediate of these are terrorism and violent extremism. In Kenya  we stand at a critical moment. As we deepen our democracy  we find our nation thrust onto the front line of a regional and global war against terror. We have become acutely aware that the interplay between democratization  on the one hand  and effective counter-terrorism  on the other  presents severe challenges to our security and our governance institutions. Increasingly  terrorist actors are exploiting the expanded democratic space  sometimes feeding into and even influencing local politics. Unless we can provide an effective buffer to fight back against that tendency  Kenya and indeed other countries will find it difficult to entrench democracy and the post-2015 development agenda.Besides the immediate threat of terrorism  the state of economic and social well-being is also affected by the lack of sustainable peace and security in many of our countries. From the Central African Republic to Mali  Libya and even as far afield as the Middle East and Europe  we see new conflicts and crises that could derail or delay development. In Kenya  we are particularly concerned by the perennial fragility that has come to characterize the greater Horn of Africa.In Somalia  Kenya continues to sacrifice lives and resources in an effort to bring peace to our neighbour. We do this trusting that the international community will stay the course in Somalia. This involves consolidating peace and investing in stable  responsive national institutions that guarantee public safety  promote democracy and civil liberties  as well as development and peace in the country and region.As we meet here  South Sudan also remains in turmoil. Kenya and other countries of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) have invested considerable effort in ending that tragedy and sparing the people of South Sudan further suffering. Regrettably  however  progress has been slow. We cannot let that young nation and its people down. At this session of the Assembly  I make a special plea for South Sudan  for no nation has  over the years  suffered as much neglect from the international community.Similarly  no country today remains as desperately in need of rapid and transformative economic and social development as South Sudan. We cannot allow a return to political chaos  economic collapse or social desperation. I implore the leaders of that young nation to demonstrate determined and enlightened leadership and to make peace without further delay. Such action will save the people of the nation enormous suffering and offer hope of a better future. I thank the Security Council for its continued cooperation with IGAD in the search for peace in South Sudan. It is this concert of action that will help to bring about lasting peace  which in turn will form the basis for a transformative post-2015 development agenda for South Sudan and all of its neighbours.On the continent of Africa the development model of the past 50 years has run its course. That outmoded model was defined by negative trade relations  paternalistic global governance regimes and overreliance on official development assistance. Moreover  it was driven by external prescriptions for development that were heavy on political instruction  but light on economic and social transformation.We now know better. We know that our social and economic transformation shall come first from within our nations  our region and our continent  and only secondly from the complement of external ideas and resources. Equally important  those external contributions must recognize the primacy of our aspirations and ideas. They must value and safeguard  rather than simply exploit and consume  our domestic resources and the product of our people’s labour. For the post-2015 development agenda to be transformative  therefore  it must first embrace the primacy of developing countries whose people seek sustained development most. Anything less will be a recipe for failure.We cannot speak of development or of transformation when millions of the world’s people are mired in and are broken by unrelenting poverty  disease and hunger. The business of ridding the world of those plagues  touched upon but not fully embraced by the Millennium Development Goals  must be the first of the aspirations of the post-2015 development agenda. Equally important  it must be fully financed and accelerated  if we are to lay the groundwork for a transformative agenda for the next generation. I cannot emphasize that point enough. The scourge and shame of debilitating poverty  preventable diseases and chronic hunger must be erased from our global civilization. In reaching the sustainable development goals we have set ourselves  within a time frame of 15 years  we must not fail.This year  at the United Nations  Kenya is proud to have presided over the Conference of States Parties to the Convention on the Rights for Persons with Disabilities. Kenya also presided over the United Nations Forum on Forests and co-chaired the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. Kenya is currently presiding over the UNICEF Board  as it seeks to provide global leadership for issues of concern to the world’s children and their well-being.Kenya is a member in good standing of the international community and it intends to continue to shoulder its global and regional responsibilities. Kenya is especially proud of the scores of Kenyans who work for the United Nations here in New York  but also further afield in peacemaking  peacekeeping  peacebuilding and in many United Nations organizations in various United Nations stations around the world  including Nairobi. I salute all those Kenyans — every single one of them — for their dedication and commitment. We in Kenya believe that no nation is too poor or too rich  too big or too small to play its rightful role in making the world a better place for all.At the national level  Kenya grounds her transformative agenda on a strategic vision — our Vision 2030. Importantly  in 2010 we adopted a new democratic Constitution  which expanded and guaranteed a wider range of rights for our people and defined new institutions for the advancement of those rights. Drawing on that  we have re-engineered our system of governance  making it more democratic  inclusive  devolved and responsive. We have also significantly expanded participation in political and development decision-making.In four short years  we have begun to witness the fruits of those foundational changes. Aware of the imperative to carry along all our people in development  my Government launched targeted interventions for the most vulnerable in society. Those include a number of financial initiatives and training programmes for women and youth. We have also prioritized the advancement of children’s rights and welfare through initiatives that reduce mortality and morbidity. Chief among them are universal immunization coverage  the promotion of breast-feeding for the first six months of a child’s life  the provision of fortified foods and insecticide-treated mosquito nets  as well as free care for mothers and children in all government hospitals.In that respect  I wish to commend the first Lady of Kenya  Ms. Margaret Kenyatta  for successfully launching the Beyond Zero Campaign that is tapping into private sector financing to bolster the management of chronic preventable diseases  including HIV/AIDS  and to improve maternal and child health throughout the country.Kenya is today on track to achieve universal primary education. Based on that  we have expanded our vision to include universal secondary education. We are seeking to build a more inclusive society  and strive to leave no one behind. It is for that reason that my Government has implemented a social protection cash transfer programme to orphans and vulnerable children  persons with severe disabilities and our elderly citizens. The programme targets 450 000 households throughout Kenya. Impact evaluations indicate that the programme has reduced poverty  improved family health and raised school enrolment.As the Assembly is aware  Kenya is a leading tourist destination. We are also endowed with a number of rare species  some endangered  which we hold in trust for humankind. My Government attaches great value to conservation. We continue to raise awareness of the need to step up the fight against poaching and illicit wildlife trafficking. We have enacted laws to help fight the scourge  and continue to work with other countries and organizations to enhance the protection of our fauna and flora. Similarly  Kenya remains at the heart of international efforts to mitigate and adapt to challenges relating to climate change. We continue to work towards achieving 10-per cent forest cover; we are well above global targets for renewable energy use  and fully support all measures agreed upon at the recent United Nations Environmental Assembly in Nairobi.Recognizing that our prosperity is linked to that of our neighbours  Kenya is engaged in a range of programmes and activities to hasten eastern African integration. We have eased the movement of goods and services across our borders. More importantly  our people can travel  work and settle across east Africa. We have also grown our trade volumes and are looking to closer integration across a range of other sectors.Those are a few highlights of my Government’s transformative agenda. We are committed to safeguarding and expanding those initiatives by creating an enabling and secure environment. In light of that  my Government continues to invest heavily to combat extremists and terrorists. The global effort needs to be reinforced because  as we know  the intent of terrorists is to destroy free  secure and democratic nations and people. As long as international terrorism exploits our open  multicultural and multi-religious society and gravely harms our social fabric  our progress towards achieving the goals of a transformative agenda will no doubt be slowed.Kenya believes in a better  happier and more prosperous future for all. It is my hope that the confluence of forces that have come together to continually make our development efforts unnecessarily difficult will be persuaded with urgency  to reassess their motives and hopefully re-engage within the global community and with our country and region in a more positive  constructive and humane manner; recognizing that  in the end  no one people  nor one country  not even any one continent  can inhabit the world peaceably alone in isolation from the rest of the globe. We are in this world together to succeed together  to win together and to build a better future for all everywhere  together."
"89",3739,"KGZ",69,2014,"First of all  allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session and to wish you every success in carrying out that important task. It is also a great pleasure to express my gratitude to Mr. John Ashe for his successful and fruitful guidance of the previous session of the General Assembly.The current situation in the world vividly demonstrates that the ongoing instability  increasing disputes among the leading world Powers and the absence of a clear and comprehensible vision for the future of the world order have become part of our everyday life. War  conflict  a refusal to listen to one another and unilateral action are pushing the international community ever closer to the precipice. Such developments undermine our efforts to work together effectively to address today’s threats and challenges. It is no surprise that various terrorist and extremist groups are cunningly taking advantage of the prevailing political vacuum and fierce opposition among world and regional Powers in order not only to insinuate and assert their presence  but also to demonstrate their ability to directly influence the situation around the world.Therefore  the role of the United Nations as a platform for comprehensive dialogue is becoming ever more important. Kyrgyzstan has consistently advocated the further strengthening of the central coordinating role of the United Nations in international affairs so as to maintain peace  security and stability; to promote shared sustainable and constructive development; and to encourage broad international cooperation. We believe that the ongoing and emerging sources of global instability require a strengthened role for the United Nations in every possible way. The relevance of political and diplomatic conflict resolution is reconfirmed by the situations in Afghanistan  the Sahel  East and West Africa  Ukraine and Syria. In order to overcome the threats and challenges to peace  prosperity and creative development  we should firmly and resolutely move forward by uniting the efforts of the entire international community. Kyrgyzstan expresses its full readiness to participate in such constructive and effective international cooperation.Against the backdrop of such negative global political developments  the further strengthening of human rights principles and of the rule of law  based on constructive approaches and cooperation  is becoming all the more relevant. For Kyrgyzstan  these principles are an integral part of political development. The upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections in Kyrgyzstan  in 2015 and 2017  will serve as an important step in strengthening the democratic foundations of our country. We hope that the international community will provide effective assistance to Kyrgyzstan in implementing its far-reaching goals. In line with our commitment to democratic principles and the desire to make a further contribution to the dialogue on global democracy  Kyrgyzstan has announced its candidacy for the Human Rights Council for the period of 2016-2018. We count on the support of members of the Assembly in that regard.The world today is at a difficult juncture  marked by increasing regional and international instability. All nations  regardless of their geographical location  face similar security challenges. Our region  in this regard  is no exception. It is obvious that the most serious external challenge to Central Asia remains the situation in Afghanistan  as well as the threats of terrorism  extremism and drug trafficking emanating from that country.As in the past  problems related to illegal drug-trafficking as a direct consequence of the situation in Afghanistan are among the most severe in the entire region. We are especially alarmed by the continuing strong link between terrorism and illegal Afghan drugs  which undermine the achievements in Afghanistan’s security situation and its ability to ensure law and order throughout the country. In this regard  it is necessary to pool efforts with the United Nations to promote security and stability in Afghanistan.In order to effectively curb these threats  we call for a more proactive international contribution  in order to strengthen the capacity of regional law-enforcement agencies and to promote regional cooperation. We attach particular importance to the Istanbul Process as an important dialogue in improving regional cooperation on Afghan issues. We count on the active participation of all parties in achieving practical results. We hope that the establishment of the new Government of Afghanistan by Mr. Ashraf Ghani and Mr. Abdullah Abdullah will be the starting point for the future stabilization in that war-weary country.Another important factor for regional instability is the unresolved border issue in Central Asia. Undoubtedly  a successful solution is in the best interests of all States of the region. The solution would greatly contribute to enhancing the regional transit potential of our countries  developing cross-border infrastructure  improving the economic situation and decreasing social tension. In this regard  I call on all Central Asian States to support the recent initiative of the President of Kyrgyzstan  Mr. Almazbek Atambaev  on the development and subsequent signing of bilateral agreements on border-related confidence-building  as put forward at the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization held in Dushanbe. I am confident that the successful implementation of that initiative would let us take historic steps towards the development of regional economic and trade relations  as well as in jointly maintaining regional stability.Amid the turmoil sweeping through the Middle East  it is especially important to focus our attention on the issue of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process  which we view as the major destabilizing factor for the region and the world. The use of force leads only to further bloodshed  destruction and hatred and does not solve any problem. In order to revive mutual trust  the conflict must be resolved by exclusively political and diplomatic means  on the basis of relevant resolutions of the Security Council.The theme of the present general debate  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  is both timely and relevant. Next year  at the seventieth anniversary session of the United Nations  we will need to formulate and adopt new goals for the following 15 years. The evolving situation today illustrates that many countries  including Kyrgyzstan  are unlikely to achieve all the objectives proposed in the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and the Millennium Development Goals in the next year. We believe that the goals not achieved should be refined in the light of gained experience and they should find proper reflection in the post-2015 goals for sustainable development.We advocate including countries with special development needs on the agenda of the post-2015 agenda. Kyrgyzstan falls into such a category. Ours is a developing  landlocked and mountainous State that is highly vulnerable to climate change. It is well known that extreme poverty in Kyrgyzstan has many causes  foremost among them a disadvantageous geographical location. More than 70 per cent of our territory is mountainous. The country lies 5 000 metres above sea level  with approximately one third of its total area lying 400 metres above sea level. Such States are characterized by remoteness  inaccessibility  informational isolation  severe geoclimatic conditions and a high cost of living.For Kyrgyzstan  the absence of access to the sea is yet another factor having a restrictive effect on our economic development. Remoteness from major international transport networks and high transportation costs hinder the development of multi-vector and diversified international economic relations and the implementation of the country’s large-scale investment projects. We believe that the establishment of an international development fund to provide support and assistance for the economies of developing landlocked countries would contribute to their sustainable economic development. This is especially important in the run-up to the second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries  to be held in Vienna  where a new programme of action for the next decade should be adopted.The year 2015 will be a milestone for the entire world community. In addition to the adoption of the post-2015 agenda  we anticipate the adoption of an international legally binding instrument on climate change. On 23 September  on the margins of the General Assembly  the United Nations Summit on Climate Change was held  at which States outlined their vision for a solution incorporating adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. For Kyrgyzstan  as for all mountainous countries whose ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate change  these issues are of priority importance on the national agenda. Abruptly melting glaciers  rising temperatures  soil degradation  landslides  mudflows and floods cause significant economic damage and serve as vivid reminders of the vulnerability of mountain ecosystems. According to reliable forecasts  Kyrgyzstan’s ice cover could be reduced by 40 per cent by 2025  leading to a one third drop in the water available in the region. In that regard  conscious of the undoubted interconnections between the environment  climate change and sustainable development goals  we believe that it is essential that the interests of vulnerable countries be adequately and fairly reflected in future action at the global level.Speaking of regional problems in Central Asia  I should note that dealing as we are with global challenges such as climate change  the potential threat of an energy crisis and population growth  water resources are a key factor in prosperity  and in that regard  our basic position is that the issues of water resources and energy are indissolubly linked and inseparable from each other. It is crucial to understand that hydropower development is an essential precondition for our sustainable development. That is entirely consistent with the Secretary-General’s initiative in declaring the period between 2014 and 2024 the Decade of Sustainable Energy for All. It is clear that access to modern  affordable and environmentally friendly energy supplies is essential if developing countries are to achieve global development goals  including those in the Millennium Declaration. The issue of affordable energy should unquestionably be appropriately reflected in the new world agenda of the United Nations post-2015.The recovery and secure storage of uranium tailings in Kyrgyzstan remains a serious transboundary problem for Central Asia. Most are concentrated in densely populated areas  and their condition has deteriorated in the last 10 years in the wake of closings of industrial enterprises and major production facilities. Moreover  a large part of these tailings are at risk of exposure to landslides and floods  as they are located in seismically active regions near the banks of Central Asia’s major transboundary rivers. Despite my Government’s efforts at the national level  along with the support of various international programmes and projects  the serious social  economic and environmental problems related to these issues continue. I would therefore like to urge the international community to assist Kyrgyzstan in dealing with this problem of radioactive and toxic waste through full rehabilitation of the contaminated areas  as envisioned in resolution 68/218  on the role of the international community in averting the radiation threat in Central Asia.In conclusion  I would like to emphasize that no State can solve all the challenges it faces and maintain sustainable development in isolation. We cannot achieve our sustainable development goals and establish global order without the consolidated efforts of the international community. In that regard  I would like to assure the Assembly that Kyrgyzstan  in its partnership with the United Nations  stands ready to contribute to the search for new opportunities to solve the complex challenges of our time  as well as to contribute to strengthening stability and peace in the world."
"90",3782,"KHM",69,2014,"At the outset  allow me to warmly congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa of the Republic of Uganda on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I have full confidence that  under his guidance  the sixty-ninth session will proceed to a successful conclusion. I would also like to take the opportunity to extend my great appreciation to Mr. John William Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda for his wise leadership and relentless efforts as President of the sixty-eighth session in guiding us to many outstanding achievements.In many ways  the world in which we are living is at a critical juncture  and the current picture is rather bleak. The international community remains seriously concerned over recent geopolitical security developments in many parts of the world. The self-declared Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and its horrendous crimes are menacing peace  security and stability in those countries  which have already been seriously hit by armed conflicts and acts of violence. In Syria  the continued armed hostilities have not only caused the deaths of thousands of innocent people and children  but have also led to millions of refugees. In Africa  some countries have also suffered armed conflicts and violence  which have placed peace and stability at risk in that part of the world. All those armed conflicts and crimes are threatening peace  stability and human security  not only in those regions  but also in the world at large.To contribute to the peace process in the Middle East and Africa  Cambodia has participated actively in United Nations peacekeeping operations. We have dispatched more than 2 000 peacekeepers to Lebanon  Mali and South Sudan. In November  Cambodia will deploy another detachment of 216 peacekeepers to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic.While extremism is threatening the world’s peace and security  the spread of the Ebola epidemic in Africa has also become one of the worst threats to the world today. It is of critical importance that the international community make concerted efforts to address that global challenge in an effective and timely manner.With regard to the hostilities between Palestine and Israel  despite the fragile ceasefire recently concluded  the situation remains a serious concern. We call on all parties to make efforts to resume meaningful peace talks in order to reach a viable political solution of two States living peacefully side by side. Cambodia believes that that is the only way to definitively put an end to that long-lasting conflict. The situation in the eastern part of Europe  in spite of the delicate ceasefire  remains worrisome and its implications could presage a return to the Cold War. In Asia  the launching of missiles by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has aroused international concern and aggravated the situation in the region. The Six-Party Talks should be resumed in order to explore a possible avenue for peaceful dialogue to bring about a peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.Climate change is currently an obvious global challenge  as well as a human security issue. The rapid pace of climate change is having devastating effects for both developed and developing countries. The developing countries  dependent mostly on agriculture  suffer more from the various negative effects of climate change  such as frequent typhoons  storms  floods and droughts. For instance  in 2013  heavy monsoon rains caused extensive flooding across Cambodia  claimed 168 lives  caused $1 billion in damages and affected 1.8 million people. Even this year  12 out of the 25 provinces and various cities of Cambodia have suffered on account of floods  killing 45 people and afflicting almost 100 000 families.According to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  the global warming caused by the increase in greenhouse gases is generated by humankind’s use of fossil fuels. There is no doubt that the industrialized countries  which consume most of the world’s fossil fuels  emit the largest amount of greenhouse gas  while the developing countries  which produce only small amounts of such gases  are the main victims of climate change. It is therefore imperative that the international community provide further impetus to revitalize and prioritize actions to address climate change based on the United Nations principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. With that concept in mind and while applauding the fruitful outcome of the recent United Nations Climate Summit  held on 23 September in New York  Cambodia hopes that the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Paris in December 2015  will bring about concrete measures to reach a new global agreement with legal force applicable to all parties under the Framework Convention.In line with the United Nations principles for sustainable development and in order to mitigate the threat of climate change  Cambodia has adopted its national strategic plan on green development for 2013-2030  which aims at achieving economic and social development in a sustainable manner  while at the same time protecting the environment  through the efficient use of raw materials and natural resources  clean development and green preservation. Cambodia has also adopted several legal instruments for green growth development  including the memorandum of understanding on green growth cooperation between Cambodia and South Korea’s Global Green Growth Institute and the National Council on Green Growth.South-East Asia  which is highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change  established the Climate Change Initiative of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2009 as a consultative body to further increase the region’s capacity in both mitigation and adaptation efforts. As a member of ASEAN  Cambodia is fully engaged in the implementation of that ASEAN initiative through the ASEAN Working Group on Climate Change and the ASEAN Action Plan on Joint Response to Climate Change  with the goal of enhancing closer and deeper regional and international cooperation on climate change.Next year marks the deadline of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). While some MDG targets have been achieved  we have to acknowledge that much more effort is need to reach the set goals of the MDGs  as progress has been uneven and insufficient. Many developing countries have not attained their MDG targets  primarily owing to unfulfilled commitments  lack of resources  insufficient dedication  and food insecurity. The situation was further aggravated by the financial uncertainty in the developed countries  which has had an impact on their commitment to official development assistance. Therefore  bolder and more focused global efforts are needed as we approach the final year to realize the MDGs.With the aim of realizing the MDGs  Cambodia has adopted its own development targets  known as the Cambodia MDGs  which have been incorporated comprehensively into our National Strategic Development Plan 2014-2018. As a result  substantial progress has been achieved  positioning Cambodia to meet some goals of the MDGs by the end of 2015. Cambodia’s target in reducing the poverty rate to 19.5 per cent by 2015 has already been achieved ahead of schedule  as the nation’s poverty rate had already fallen to 19 per cent in 2013. As a result  Cambodia received a United Nations Award for cutting hunger in half before the deadline.In combating HIV/AIDS  Cambodia has made great strides by progressively reducing HIV prevalence to 0.6 per cent in 2013. In order to achieve that indicator  the Cambodian Government has further adopted a getting-to-zero policy  aiming to realize zero new infections  zero AIDS-related deaths and zero discrimination by 2020.In addition to tracking the Cambodia MDGs achievements  the Royal Government of Cambodia has put forth a Cambodia MDGs acceleration framework with an approach aimed at accelerating progress in achieving the MDGs and other human development goals. The framework could provide the essential input for the implementation of our National Strategic Development Plan 2014-2018 aimed at completing the remaining MDGs  as well as at setting the stage for the preparation of the post-2015 development agenda.Cambodia shares the view expressed in the report of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda  entitled A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through Sustainable Development  to be adopted during the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly  that“a new development agenda should carry forward the spirit of the Millennium Declaration and the best of the MDGs  with a practical focus on things like poverty  hunger  water  sanitation  education and health care”.Cambodia is of the view that the post-2015 development agenda should be realistic and built upon the lessons learned from the difficulties in the realization of the MDGs; in particular  it should ensure that any process towards a broader development objective is truly balanced and comprehensive.Next year  2015  is a crucial year as the United Nations celebrates the seventieth anniversary of its creation and the tenth anniversary of the 2005 World Summit  where world leaders agreed to reform the United Nations to meet the needs of today’s geopolitical and global challenges (resolution 60/1). To that end  the General Assembly should be further empowered so that it can play a leading role in strengthening the wider United Nations system. The Security Council  as a body mandated with the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security  should represent the world’s realities today. In sum  we think that more equitable representation in the United Nations organs would assist the Organization in coping with the urgent global challenges."
"91",3796,"KIR",69,2014,"I bring everyone warm greetings from the people of Kiribati  on whose behalf I am once again privileged to address this body. In my country we begin all formal addresses by conferring blessings of peace and good health on all present  so let me say Kam na bane ni Mauri.I echo the sentiments conveyed by previous speakers in congratulating the President on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I am confident that under his able stewardship  our Organization will continue its work towards improving the security and quality of life for all members of our global community  in particular the most vulnerable. Let me also take this opportunity to acknowledge with appreciation the commendable leadership of his predecessor  Mr. John Ashe  for his guidance and stewardship over the past year.I also wish to commend the unwavering commitment and hard work of our Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  who has served as an able navigator of our family’s ship  steering the United Nations through the diverse and complex realities and the myriad of challenges facing our peoples and nations around the world. In particular  I wish to commend his sterling leadership and demonstrated personal commitment to the need to focus global attention on those who are most vulnerable and who are on the front line of the many major challenges facing us today as a global community.We meet at a very critical time in the history of multilateralism. The global community is in the process of shaping a post-2015 development framework. We are hearing stronger calls for United Nations reforms  for reassessing the way we do things in our family of nations. The membership is calling for a move away from business as usual and for transformational changes. We welcome the theme of the sixty-ninth session — “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda” — as it aptly captures the call for changes by the membership.Earlier this week  on Tuesday  we concluded one of the most successful conferences ever convened by the Secretary-General on climate change. We applaud the leadership and the Secretary-General’s very positive initiative. Those of us on the front line of the impacts of climate change welcome the renewed focus and the rallying by the United Nations membership behind the Secretary-General’s call for ambitious announcements and commitments. The real challenge  however  is in being able to translate those commitments and announcements into action.Three weeks ago  Samoa hosted the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States. The United Nations and those who attended declared it a resounding success. We thank our gracious hosts — the Government and the people of Samoa. Those very successful conferences signify recognition by the United Nations and the membership of the need to highlight the special case of those on the front line of sustainable development  to refocus global attention to the prevailing socioeconomic and environmental challenges that continue to constrain efforts by small island developing States (SIDS) to achieve sustainable development. That is particularly pertinent now  as the international community is in the process of shaping the post-2015 development agenda.The Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action provides a clear blueprint of how the SIDS want to move forward in their efforts to achieve sustainable development. The real test of the success of the Samoa Conference  however  is in the adoption of outcomes into genuine and durable partnerships that can translate into activities on the ground that will deliver tangible benefits to our people.While SIDS heard the plight of some of the most vulnerable  other United Nations processes are talking about the graduation of those countries from the least developed countries category. We believe that there is a contradiction here. If we as a family of nations do not act and do not work in partnership with those on the front line of major challenges  whatever they may be  then we will have failed in our efforts. I would like to reiterate our deepest appreciation to the Secretary-General for his demonstrated commitment and leadership in focusing the United Nations and global attention on the plight of the most needy  in alleviating poverty  addressing the Ebola epidemic  raising the voices of youth and women and their participation in development  ending gender-based violence  promoting peace and security  and acting against climate change now.As I have highlighted on numerous occasions in the past  including earlier this week  the issue of climate change remains the most single pressing challenge for us in Kiribati. Climate change is an existential challenge for low-lying island countries like mine  Tuvalu  the Marshall Islands  the Maldives and Tokelau  and I again call for urgent global action to help those countries adapt and for international legally binding commitments to cut greenhouse emissions. The global community cannot afford to not listen to our stories and to the plight of our peoples. Our plight is the plight of the global community  further down the line. Everyone’s future is on the line.I have just returned from an Arctic expedition  to the North Pole — hence  my loss of voice. I am still overwhelmed today by what I witnessed with my own eyes. The melting of the massive sheets of ice in the Arctic region due to climate change will not only have severe impacts on the lives of people in that region but will also result in the demise of future generations in other parts of the globe  in particular our most vulnerable atoll island nations. It has been an eye-opener for me to spend time in the past week in polar conditions. It gave me a wider perspective of the immensity of what is at stake beyond our own immediate concerns. That visit to the Arctic region highlighted the stark reality of the very direct connection between the destruction of that polar region to what is happening to us in the equatorial region  and the very unlikely possibility of ever reversing that process once it has gone so far.On Tuesday we heard the voice of a very talented young woman  Ms. Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner  a poet from our part of the world  from the Marshall Islands. Her voice represents the apprehension  the concern and the voice of mothers from low-lying countries like ours who lament what the future holds for their children and their children’s children. Surely  we as leaders and the mothers like Kathy and millions of others around the world share  or should share  the same ultimate goal — to leave to our children and grandchildren a future that is better than what we inherited from our forefathers. We from Kiribati salute Kathy for reaching out and for touching the hearts of leaders who heard her speak. May she touch many hearts and move many more hearts.The very sad reality is that we are just not on course to achieve that. It is glaringly obvious that we need to do things differently. We owe it to those whom we represent — our people. For us  climate change is not an event in the future. It is an event that we are dealing with today. We simply cannot talk of sustainable development without talking about climate change. Earlier this week  I appealed to fellow leaders  and will do so again today  for all of us to work together against climate change and to move towards binding international agreements  towards a clean energy future  a healthier greener future for our children and a healthier  greener home for our one planet  Earth.What are we doing? Let us accept full responsibility for our own development to improve the well-being of our people into the future. We are determined to achieve that by finding national solutions to overcome the enormous development challenges that constrain our efforts. My Government has mainstreamed sustainable development principles into our national development plan  policies and strategies. Climate change and adaptation measures are integrated into our national budgeting process and development programmes to strengthen disaster risk management. We have adopted an inclusive  whole-of-government and whole-of-nation approach aimed at addressing climate change impacts and strengthening our resilience.Our strategy for migration with dignity is an investment in the education of our people and upping the skills of our young population to equip them with the educational qualifications and employable skills that will enable them to migrate with dignity to other countries as a matter of choice and  in the worst-case scenario  when our islands can no longer sustain human life.Last July  along with other frontline low-lying atoll island States — Tuvalu  the Marshall Islands  Maldives and Tokelau — Kiribati initiated the establishment of the Coalition of Low-lying Atoll Nations on Climate Change (CANCC). The Coalition held its inaugural meeting in Tarawa in July and produced an outcome document that embraces the Coalition’s goals and vision for building the resilience of our people in the face of the challenges of climate change. The initiative is prompted by the concerns we share regarding the increasing severity of those challenges and the slow pace of global action to address them. Our Coalition of nations continues to support the ongoing negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  but we also emphasize that urgent action must be taken now to assist our countries and all vulnerable communities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.The Coalition initiative demonstrates our political commitment and determination to find innovative solutions to the threats we face from climate change. We are looking at building up our low islands and climate-proofing our infrastructure  and at our development efforts to prepare and build the resilience of our people in the face of the challenge.We cannot do this alone  and we acknowledge the support of our development partners and regional and international organizations that have assisted us and continue to support our efforts to address the challenge of climate change. However  much more remains to be done  including making climate-financing facilities more accessible and flexible  as the solutions and options for facing this challenge vary from nation to nation.The ocean plays a pivotal role in the sustainable development of my country. Our vision for achieving sustainable development hinges on the blue economy — on the conservation and sustainable management of our marine and ocean resources. While we in Kiribati have been labelled a small island developing State  we are in fact a “large ocean” State that spans an ocean area of 3.5 million square kilometres. The ocean has been an integral part of our life since time immemorial. While it now poses a serious threat to our survival from sea-level rise  it also provides immense opportunities  not only as a source of daily sustenance  but also as a means through which we can realize sustainable development and achieve livelihoods for our people.Our exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is one of the largest in the world and is home to abundant tuna resources that provide rich fishing grounds for our distant fishing partners. We estimate that the total annual landed value of the fisheries industry in our EEZ is approximately $4 billion. Yet only 5 to 8 per cent of that comes to us as resource owners  through licensing fees. We have to ask  where is the equity and fairness in that?There is a need to review and restructure the nature of public and private partnerships in the fishing industry. A more equitable partnership based on mutual respect  goodwill  fairness and accountability will go a long way in providing an enabling environment for sustainable development.My Government is working to maximize the returns from our large fisheries resource through value-adding fisheries development  including on-shore processing. Our limited capacity in terms of capital  technical know-how  a lack of infrastructure  distance from commercial and trade centres and air and sea transport challenges stands in the way of our progress towards that development aspiration. Direct foreign investment and genuine partnership are therefore a way forward in that regard. I am confident that such partnership  forged around an equitable distribution of gains  will be the development model going forward  with mutual gains to be made.Human activities have been responsible for the accelerated degradation of our global environment  in the pursuit of short-term economic gains without due regard to the health of our oceans and our environment. Never in human history has the health of our oceans and planet Earth been so challenged. We all have a shared responsibility and obligation with regard to the protection of the ocean from further degradation and the sustainable management of its rich biodiversity.My country recognizes that shared responsibility and  in 2008  established the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA) in partnership with Conservation International and the New England Aquarium. UNESCO has inscribed PIPA on its list of World Heritage Sites. In January 2015  we will completely close off the Phoenix Islands Protected Area to all commercial fishing activity across an area of more than 410 000 square kilometres  representing 11 per cent of our total EEZ — about the size of the state of California.PIPA is a rich fishing ground  so its total closure on 31 December this year will entail loss of much-needed revenue for Kiribati from fishing licence fees. For us  it is a major but necessary short-term sacrifice for the long-term health of our ocean and for sustaining fish stocks for global food security. It demonstrates our political commitment to the importance of marine conservation and the sustainable management of marine resources. It is our contribution to humankind and the common good of all.But the announcement of complete closure of this vast marine protected area will amount to nothing without monitoring and enforcement. We have therefore established a PIPA trust fund to support our national efforts in managing PIPA and monitoring that vast marine protected area. We thank those who share our vision and have contributed to the fund. We encourage our partners who have not yet done so to join with us in that massive undertaking.The challenges we face in the twenty-first century have taken on a new dimension. It is no longer a fight to save a species here and a collapsed stock there; the fight has become larger. It is now about how to ensure the survival of whole peoples — communities  villages  cities and nations. Entire ecosystems hang in the balance  the ecosystems that provide us with the air we breathe  the water we drink and much of the food we eat. It is time to view our global development in a whole new way. It is time to change business as usual. Indeed  a paradigm shift and transformational development approaches are necessary  starting from within our own nations and moving out to regional and international multilateral processes  institutions and partnerships.It is high time we recognize that the new challenges require that we draw on all the resources available to the global community. Development and global challenges do not belong to Governments alone. Let us bring in our youth  our women  civil society  the private sector and our traditional institutions. Let us be inclusive. Let all those who have a contribution to make make it.We welcome the inclusion of Taiwan in the international processes of the World Health Assembly. We hope that a similar inclusive approach will prevail in respect of our other international institutions and the United Nations processes  where Taiwan and all those that can participate and contribute meaningfully for the good of humankind can be brought in to do so.We join in the broad international condemnation of criminal extremism and express the hope that such destabilizing tensions in Europe  the Asia-Pacific region and elsewhere can be settled through peaceful means. As distant as we think we are from the epicentres of such events  they nonetheless impact on us in a very real way in our part of the world.In my country  even before the advent of climate change  the atoll environment was indeed harsh. Life on the low-lying atoll islands has always been difficult. We have always worked on the principle of working together as part of a community on the premise that there will be some challenges that are larger than us and need collaboration. The age-old test of our resilience and our strength as a community is defined by the well-being of the weakest member of our community. For us  sustainable development must be inclusive. It requires sincerity  goodwill  respect and the willingness to move a little more slowly so as to assist and bring everyone on board in order to move forward together.I would like to bring those principles to the United Nations. The pursuit of sustainable development and lasting peace and security calls for and requires sacrifice. It requires inclusiveness. It requires collective and decisive action. It also requires political commitment and political leadership from all of us here  for the time to act is now.On that note  I leave members with the traditional blessing: may health  peace and prosperity be with us all."
"92",3827,"KNA",69,2014,"It is indeed an honour for me to address this body for the first time since assuming the portfolio of Minister for Foreign Affairs a little over one year ago. I take pleasure in sharing the perspectives of the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis on matters before the General Assembly during its sixty-ninth session.Allow me to start by congratulating Mr. Kutesa on his election to the office of President of the General Assembly  to steer the course of the Assembly during this session. Indeed  his sterling contribution in his native Uganda  where he serves as Minister for Foreign Affairs  and his efforts at strengthening the African Union have prepared him for the challenging task of finalizing the development of the post-2015 development agenda.My delegation wishes to commend his predecessor  Mr. John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda  for his leadership in presiding over the Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. His focus on the development of the sustainable development goals and other issues of importance to small island developing States (SIDS) and developing countries in particular is worthy of high commendation.The theme of the sixty-ninth session  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  is quite timely as we enter a new dispensation that reflects global priorities that were not contemplated at the time the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were conceptualized leading up to the year 2000. As we work on implementing the post-2015 development agenda  we must ensure that the 17 sustainable development goals recently formulated are effective in building on the foundation laid by the Millennium Development Goals. It is my delegation’s hope that the agenda as developed will be transformative in nature  with a high degree of success in its overarching objectives — the eradication of poverty and hunger  and the promotion of sustained and inclusive economic growth.We are mindful that MDG 8  which calls for the strengthening of global partnerships  remains part of the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals established at the Millennium Summit in 2000. It is therefore highly important that we take great care in ensuring that the first 16 sustainable development goals are buttressed by a robust suite of implementation tools that will effectively serve as the catalyst for achieving success in the post-2015 development agenda.My delegation can never overemphasize the importance of rendering effective and operational Goal 17  which calls for the strengthening of the means of implementation and the revitalization of the global partnership for sustainable development. We are therefore heartened by the President’s expressed plan to convene three high-level thematic debates and one high-level event geared towards  inter alia  strengthening the means of implementation in order to achieve sustainable development in its three dimensions.We pay keen attention to the first event  the debate on the means of implementation. We are of the view that achieving sustainable development will require mobilization and the effective use of financial resources and technology development and transfer  in addition to capacity-building at all levels. It will also entail increased investment in the social sectors  infrastructure  community development  climate financing and the protection of global common goods.The key question before us in relation to the means of implementation is how we mobilize the significant resources that will be needed to turn the aspirations of the post-2015 development agenda into tangible outcomes. I wish to pledge my Government’s support in advancing the basic thrust of the President’s tenure. A strengthened global partnership should foster close collaboration between and among Governments  provide for an increased role of the private sector  ensure a fair international trading regime  and foster national and foreign direct investments.My Government wishes to reiterate its firm commitment to doing its part to ensure that we achieve the goals developed to sustain economic and social development in a manner that will preserve the environment and ensure stable  safe and peaceful societies. Since our last address to this body  Saint Kitts and Nevis has solidified its position as a leader in the Caribbean in attracting foreign direct investment  specifically in its tourism infrastructure  and building its industrial base in the light manufacturing sector — electronics and electrical components. We have also successfully forged public-private partnerships in renewable-energy ventures providing sustained growth for our economy.One of the peculiar vulnerabilities of small island developing States such as Saint Kitts and Nevis is our susceptibility to economic and external shocks  which results in a state of high indebtedness. It is no secret that high public debt affects the ability of Governments to achieve sustainable development in all its dimensions. In the area of economic sustainability  we developed in 2011 and successfully implemented a comprehensive approach to the management of our national debt. Our plan included debt restructuring with international financial institutions  an exchange offer for government bonds  the curtailment of public borrowing to sustainable levels and a creative land-for-debt swap initiative.I am pleased to report that by the end of June  we had successfully reduced the ratio of our debt to gross domestic product (GDP) by 50 percentage points  from over 145 per cent pre-restructuring to 95 per cent now. I am even more pleased to report that our debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline further  to 85 per cent by the end of 2014. In spite of our fiscal discipline  however  it is important for us to be mindful of the fact that one severe climate event can erase the gains achieved  effectively sending us into a vicious cycle that makes it difficult if not impossible to achieve sustainable development on the economic front.At this juncture  I would be remiss if I failed to echo the call for a new paradigm for the assessment used in the policy of graduation  which currently uses the narrow policy of per capita gross national income to confer middle-income and high-income status on developing countries. Saint Kitts and Nevis is of the view that that measure is grossly inadequate and needs to take into account the peculiar vulnerabilities of SIDS. We commend the Commonwealth secretariat for the innovative work it has been spearheading to encourage leading international financial institutions to accept a broader matrix  including the vulnerability index  to correctly assess the true economic situation of SIDS such as Saint Kitts and Nevis.I must emphasize that graduation to a higher income category makes it difficult to access resources to sustain our economic  social and environmental policy objectives. Borrowing funds at a high rate on the international market serves only to perpetuate the vicious cycle of debt and threatens our sustainable development. That runs contrary to the goals and objectives of the post-2015 development agenda. In that connection  I call on the international community  including the leading international financial institutions  to broaden the scope of the assessment of SIDS in order to avoid creating scenarios where debt sustainability measures undertaken at the national level are undermined by the policies of international institutions. Saint Kitts and Nevis stands ready to work with the international community by contributing its ideas to the debate in order to ensure a most favourable outcome.My delegation is convinced that a nation’s wealth lies in the health of its people — its productive sector. We continue to wrestle with the high incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in our country and region. We wish to reiterate our call for a strong global response to combating the high incidence of non-communicable diseases  in particular in developing countries. In our last statement to this very body (see A/68/PV.15)  our Prime Minister stressed the need for this international body to keep on the front burner a practical strategy to address the high incidence of NCDs within our region and throughout the world. In that connection  I wish to commend the outgoing President of the General Assembly  Ambassador John Ashe  for convening a number of events focusing on that matter of great importance to my delegation.It is our hope that the final report on the informal interactive hearings with non-governmental organizations  civil-society organizations  the private sector and academia on the prevention and control of NCDs  which was held in June 2014  will serve to build on the outcome of the initiatives resulting from the High-level Meeting on Non-communicable Diseases  held in September 2011 during the Assembly’s sixty-sixth session  and the work conducted during the following session.My delegation is indeed pleased to see the inclusion of non-communicable diseases in the goals and targets for sustainable development as part of the post-2015 development agenda. We support the goal to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. We also support the target to reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment  and to promote mental health and well-being by 2030. We look to the various specialized bodies of this international Organization for guidance and support as we seek to meet the targets and indicators under that and all goals developed as part of the post-2015 development agenda. We reiterate the call for the strengthening of the means of implementation of the goals and targets and for the revitalization of the global partnership for sustainable development.Climate change remains more than an environmental concern for small island developing States such as Saint Kitts and Nevis. We regard it more as a threat to our existence. The adverse effects of climate change are well known: persistent adverse weather conditions  floods  extended droughts and rising sea levels. My delegation is convinced of the need to preserve our planet Earth for ourselves and generations yet unborn. We have an obligation to combat climate change through mitigation and adaptation measures.Climate change financing and technology transfer will be pivotal to the success of that objective. We urge widespread acceptance by the international community of creative initiatives such as debt swap for climate adaptation and mitigation. My Government is convinced that such proposals  developed with assistance from the Commonwealth Secretariat  provide SIDS with a greater degree of flexibility as we try to achieve sustainable development. We welcome the commitment of the President of the General Assembly to provide appropriate impetus and momentum to the ongoing process under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to reach a global agreement on climate change by 2015.Maintaining peace and security remains one of the main priorities of the United Nations. That ideal is captured in the post-2015 development agenda as sustainable development goal 16  to achieve peaceful and inclusive societies and the rule of law and to build effective and capable institutions. I am pleased to report that at the national level we have implemented strategies that have brought a reduction in violent crime and strengthened institutions that sustain peaceful and inclusive societies. We are grateful to our development partners — the Governments of the United States of America  the United Kingdom  Mexico and Canada  the European Union  and the Republic of China on Taiwan — for their invaluable assistance in that regard.Thirty-one years ago  our new nation forged a strategic and mutually beneficial relationship with the Republic of China on Taiwan. That relationship has grown by leaps and bounds  and it touches all three dimensions of sustainable development. As the dialogue continues on the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda  Saint Kitts and Nevis regards itself suitably qualified to speak on the valuable contribution which the Republic of China on Taiwan can make to the international community.At the recent SIDS Conference in Samoa  our Prime Minister had the privilege to speak of the value of the partnership established with the Government and private sector of Taiwan in implementing a number of projects in renewable energy  specifically the establishment of a solar panel manufacturing plant and the outfitting of Government buildings and street lights with solar panels. The latter project will assist us in Saint Kitts and Nevis to achieve the goal of ensuring access to affordable  reliable and modern energy services for all.For many years  our Government has called for the international community to allow the Republic of China on Taiwan to participate in the work of the organs of the United Nations system. That call is by no means arbitrary in nature. It has resulted from our partnership in numerous development initiatives across the sustainable development spectrum. Saint Kitts and Nevis is therefore pleased to note that Taiwan was recently invited to attend the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization for the first time since 1971. We are equally pleased to note the participation of Taiwan in the World Health Assembly and to offer our commendation to the Government and people of Taiwan for sharing their expertise in the fields of medicine and civil aviation safety.At this juncture  we are convinced that the time is right for that spirit of understanding and inclusion to extend to the area of the ongoing negotiations in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the United Nations Environment Assembly. My Government is equally convinced that the experiences gained by Taiwan in its strategy for building environmental and economic resilience can be shared with the international community through the UNFCCC.While the international community is focused on maintaining peace and security  we are pleased to underscore the active role played by the Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan in promoting peace and security across the Taiwan Strait and for proposing the East China Sea Peace Initiative  thus demonstrating its commitment to international peace and security.The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis remains concerned by the decades-old unilateral trade embargo imposed on Cuba. That relic of the Cold War runs counter to the principles of international law  principles which undergird the United Nations system. We stand by our sister nations in the Caribbean Community and the Group of 77 and China and reiterate our call for creative ways to resolve that perennial issue  which adversely affects the tenor of hemispheric relations.My delegation recognizes the challenging weeks and months ahead as we prepare in earnest to implement the post-2015 development agenda. We offer our fullest support in that regard. Such support is critical to the successful implementation of the development agenda. May we  as an international community  redouble our efforts in a manner that will redound to the benefit of developed and developing countries alike."
"93",3853,"KOR",69,2014,"Let me start by congratulating you  Mr. Kutesa  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I am confident that the Assembly will make meaningful progress during this session under your able leadership. I would also like to express my appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts to tackle the numerous crises breaking out around the globe.Next year marks the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. I am prompted by the state of our world today to reflect once again upon the noble dreams and ideals that inspired the founders of the United Nations 70 years ago. The founders aspired to build a new world that places people at the centre  as the opening words of the Charter of the United Nations  “We the peoples”  remind us. Throughout the ensuing decades of the Cold War and the post-Cold-War era  the United Nations tackled countless crises  striving  as it did so  to fulfil its purpose of maintaining international peace  promoting development and upholding human rights.Yet our world continues to be beset by widespread disputes and conflicts  both large and small  despite the efforts of the United Nations. The civil conflicts raging on in Syria  Libya and South Sudan are causing the deaths of untold numbers of innocent women and children. In Iraq and surrounding areas  the activities of foreign terrorist fighters are posing new threats to peace internationally  not to mention in the Middle East. The fragile ceasefires in Gaza and Ukraine call for more fundamental and lasting solutions. The recent Ebola outbreak in Africa  widespread poverty and natural disasters underscore the scope of the threat from multiple challenges.In order to push back against those challenges to peace and development  we need to return to the founding spirit of the United Nations by putting people first and promotinge cooperation among the Members of the family of nations. To meet the aspirations of the international community for justice and common prosperity  the United Nations needs to continue to play a central role in arranging more rapid and efficient responses.The Republic of Korea was founded in 1948 with the blessing of the United Nations. It was able to safeguard freedom and democracy during the Korean war that broke out two years later  again with the help of the United Nations. Once a country that barely managed to survive with United Nations assistance  the Republic of Korea is today a nation that has achieved both an advanced market economy and democracy. In the course of that journey  the Republic of Korea came to espouse the values upheld by the United Nations — peace  development and human rights — as its own vision.Given its history  the Republic of Korea is no stranger to the agonies of the civil wars  aggression  poverty and humanitarian disasters that are unfolding around the world. That is why the Republic of Korea is actively working to serve international peace and promote human rights and sustainable development as a member of the three major Councils of the United Nations: the Security Council  the Human Rights Council and the Economic and Social Council.The developments unfolding in the Middle East  Eurasia  and North-East Asia are a far cry from the peaceful and just world that was envisioned by the United Nations founders. Overcoming the instability and chaos we see today must start with our adherence to the fundamental order and norms of the international community  namely  respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity; refraining from the threat or use of force in violation of the Charter; and respect for human rights and humanitarian values.We need to prevent the development and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction such as nuclear weapons  which pose a fundamental threat to international peace and security. In that regard  we welcome the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons through the joint efforts of the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the progress being made in addressing the Iranian nuclear issue.By the same token  I would underline the urgency of resolving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea nuclear issue  which presents the single greatest threat to peace on the Korean peninsula and in North-East Asia. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is the only country to have conducted a nuclear test in the twenty-first century. Its nuclear programme not only is a serious threat to international peace  but also amounts to a total rejection of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  which is the backbone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea must make the decision to give up its nuclear weapons. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea should follow in the footsteps of other countries that have abandoned their nuclear weapons in favour of reform and opening-up  and it must choose a different path that supports its economic development and improves the lives of its people. Should it do this  the Republic of Korea  together with the international community  will provide our strong support for developing the economy of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.In addition to that serious challenge on the Korean Peninsula  North-East Asia is undergoing a difficult transition. There are growing tensions in the region surrounding issues of history  territory and maritime security. Yet  unlike other regions  North-East Asia lacks a mechanism for dealing with those problems through multilateral consultations. It is against that backdrop that I am seeking to advance a North-East Asia peace and cooperation initiative that is aimed at building an order of trust and cooperation in the region. In my view  building up habits of cooperation in practical areas  such as climate action  disaster relief  nuclear safety and tackling transnational crime  can materialize into a multilateral process of cooperation along the lines of what we see in Europe.In that context  I have also proposed creating a North-East Asia nuclear safety consultative body to discuss nuclear safety issues  a topic of shared interest for the countries in the region. At the same time  we are reaching beyond North-East Asia and seeking to build transportation and energy networks across an economically interdependent Eurasia  which would help strengthen political trust and security across the continent.This year marks 20 years since the Rwandan genocide  the world’s greatest humanitarian tragedy of the late twentieth century. The international community had pledged “never again” in the aftermath of the genocides in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the 1990s. Yet  we are witnessing today a different type of humanitarian disaster unfolding in Syria and Iraq. The Republic of Korea is actively participating in the efforts of the United Nations to prevent such humanitarian tragedies. The Republic of Korea strongly supports United Nations policies to protect human rights  such as the Rights Up Front initiative and the Secretary-General’s “open gate” policy. Even as we speak  Korean troops are taking part in United Nations peacekeeping missions in South Sudan and Lebanon  helping with peacebuilding  reconstruction and the protection of civilians and human rights.The Republic of Korea also attaches great importance to preventing human suffering  particularly of women and children  who are most vulnerable  in conflict situations. In that context  during its presidency of the Security Council in February 2013  Korea presided over an open debate (see S/PV.6917) on the protection of civilians in armed conflict and helped raise global awareness. Korea is also participating in and championing the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative. Sexual violence against women during armed conflicts is a clear violation of human rights and humanitarian norms  regardless of how long ago or where it occurred.The human rights situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is also the subject of profound interest and concern for the international community. In March  the Human Rights Council adopted recommendations proposed by the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the international community should take the necessary measures to implement those recommendations. In that regard  the United Nations office that will soon be set up in the Republic of Korea to investigate human rights abuses in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is expected to reinforce such efforts. The international community should also pay greater attention to the human rights situation of North Korean defectors. The relevant United Nations agencies and countries should provide the necessary support so that defectors can freely choose their resettlement destination.The challenges facing humankind today  such as absolute poverty and climate change  can be addressed only through a concerted international response  given their complexity and intertwined character. Less than 500 days remain until the target date of the Millennium Development Goals  which was launched with the aim of eradicating absolute poverty and increasing social and economic opportunities. The Republic of Korea is ready  by harnessing our unique historical experience  to play a bridging role between developed and developing countries as the post-2015 development goals are set. In that regard  the decision was made as a result of the Busan Partnership agreement  adopted at the Ministerial Meeting in April in Mexico  to turn the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation into an international development cooperative mechanism.The Republic of Korea will seek to enhance the quality of its overseas assistance. We will continue to share our development experience  by globally promoting the Saemaul movement model  which was conducive to eradicating rural poverty in Korea through the spirit of diligence  self-reliance and cooperation. Having seen the power of education in propelling its own development  the Republic of Korea strongly supports and is championing the Secretary-General’s Global Education First Initiative. Korea will share its lessons learned and provide substantive support to the United Nations initiatives on education  which is one of the main themes of the post-2015 development goals. To that end  Korea will host the World Education Forum in 2015 and make efforts to reach an agreement on the new education objectives for the next 15 years.Climate change is no less an existential threat to humanity than the question of war and peace. At the Climate Summit 2014 held at United Nations Headquarters yesterday  23 September  leaders proclaimed their collective resolve to reach a consensus on the post-2020 new climate regime. Going forward  an agreement must be reached on a new climate regime by the 2015 Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris. As the host country of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Green Growth Global Institute (GGGI)  Korea is committed to supporting international efforts to strengthen developing countries’ mitigation and adaptation capacities. Above all  we will continue to work for the full and early operationalization of the GCF and for the expansion of GGGI assistance to developing countries. Korea views the climate challenge not as a burden but as an opportunity to unleash new value  markets and jobs through technological innovation. We are nurturing new energy industries. And we hope to share the fruits of our efforts with other developing countries.The Korean people gained independence 69 years ago  but the subsequent division of the Korean peninsula precluded its membership in the United Nations as a single sovereign State. The two Koreas were admitted separately as Member States to the United Nations in 1991. Having two separate seats despite a single language  culture and history is clearly not normal. This year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall  but the Korean peninsula remains stifled by a wall of division. Countless separated families have been spending decades in agony  longing to see their loved ones. Every year  many leave for a place where they will never be able to meet their loved ones in person. I call on the international community to stand with us in tearing down the world’s last remaining wall of division.Not long ago  I proposed to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea that we build corridors that can connect our environment  our livelihoods and our culture. In my view  a genuine community that can heal the wounds of division and move both sides forward together will come about only when people from the South and the North are able to live in natural harmony within a single ecosystem  when separated families are able to come together and ease their agony  and when culture is shared.Today  the Korean peninsula is divided by a 4-kilometre wide  250-kilometre long demilitarized zone (DMZ). The DMZ  built around the military demarcation line to prevent renewed conflict  has in reality ended up preventing the back-and-forth movement of people for some 60 years. But from the stretches of the DMZ would emerge  in those decades  a treasure trove of nature’s wildlife. The DMZ ecosystem is a testament to the fact that the South and North are part of a single whole  one which both sides should work together to restore. And so I hope to build inside the very symbol of our division a world ecopeace park that would begin to reconnect the Peninsula’s divided nature and divided people. If we can sweep away the barbed-wire fences from small areas inside the DMZ and thereby allow people from both sides to live in natural harmony  such a park could emerge as a corridor of life and peace.I call on the United Nations to spearhead these efforts. Building a park that embodies respect for international standards and values  and doing so under United Nations auspices  with all the parties to the war on board — the two Koreas  the United States and China — would serve to ease tensions and promote the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas. A unified Korea would be a starting point for a world without nuclear weapons  offer a fundamental solution to the North Korean human rights issue and help unlock a stable and cooperative North-East Asia. Just as the unification of Germany laid the ground for a new Europe by integrating that continent  a unified Korea could set in motion a new North-East Asia. I am confident that a peacefully reunified Korean peninsula will contribute to realizing the founding purposes and values espoused by the United Nations.The founders of the United Nations were not deterred by the heat of war from looking to the future and planning for a peaceful post-war world. The Republic of Korea is committed to a vision of diplomacy that seeks lasting peace and unification on the peninsula and peace and development in North-East Asia and contributes to building a happier world. The Republic of Korea will do its part in that noble undertaking to ensure that the United Nations continues to safeguard our common values and cements its place at the centre of global governance."
"94",3899,"KWT",69,2014,"At the outset  it pleases me to extend  on behalf of the Government and people of the State of Kuwait  our sincere congratulations to the President of the General Assembly and to his friendly country  Uganda  on his election as President of the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We are certain that his vast experience in international affairs will enable him to conduct the deliberations of the Assembly at this session wisely and ably  and we wish him success in that endeavour. We also note with praise the successful manner in which his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. John Ashe  conducted the deliberations during his presidency of the previous session.In that regard  I would also like to pay tribute to the tremendous efforts exerted by His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in leading the Organization  in accordance with the visions and ideas derived from the principles and purposes of the Charter  to maintain international peace and security and achieve its goals in a sustainable manner by confronting the kinds of risks and challenges engulfing the world  whether they be chronic or recent.In its nearly 70 years of existence and service  the United Nations has witnessed increasing challenges  as represented by numerous incidents and crises  and has overcome exceptional political and economic milestones. That has made it a haven and a destination for all the peoples and nations of the world  bestowed upon the Organization a wider scope of action to contain crises and given it a more significant role in reaching solutions and achieving further accomplishments.However  the deep-rooted and wide-ranging international transformations of the past few years have made the continuation of the Organization  based on its current executive mechanisms and administrative structures  an obstacle to achieving its historic mission. When we speak of change for the better  it is crucial to seek comprehensive reform by proposing scenarios and solutions aimed at reviving the Organization  its organs and its specialized agencies in order to ensure the enhancement and development of their capacity to become more proactive  in line with modern times  and to deepen their understanding of the basic requirements of Member States.Reform should start with the Security Council  as the organ entrusted with the maintaining international peace and security and the closest to reality; it is also the most effective and is already predisposed to measure its accomplishments according to its mandates. The State of Kuwait  which currently presides over the Arab Summit and coordinates the Arab Group  would like to stress the importance of thoroughly and carefully addressing the structural flaws in the composition of the Council  in particular the issue of expanding the category of permanent membership by ensuring permanent Arab representation in the Council  based on the demographic dimension of the Arab Members  whose population exceeds 350 million and whose number increased from five States in 1945 to 22 at present. That represents nearly 12 per cent of the total number of States Members of the United Nations  in addition to the fact that the issues relating to the Arab States and their region top the agenda of the Council.Several countries of the Middle East are facing tremendous security  political and humanitarian challenges and an exceptional situation  due to the inability of the Security Council to carry out its functions  which has led to the aggravation and deterioration of the situation in many States of the region. The recent Israeli military aggression against the Gaza Strip lasted for 50 consecutive days  during which the non-stop killing and machine of destruction continuously targeted everything human  mowing down thousands of unarmed civilians  the majority of them elderly  women and children. That action appears to have been emblematic of the series of Israeli violations of the most basic rules of international law and international humanitarian law  and constitutes yet another addition to its bloody history of rejecting all regional and international initiatives to lay the foundations of a just and lasting peace.In that regard  the State of Kuwait welcomes the ceasefire agreement signed on 26 August  as well as the international and regional initiatives undertaken to end to that crisis and aggression  primarily those promoted by our sister Arab Republic of Egypt. In that context  we renew our call on the Security Council to assume its responsibility to provide international protection to the Palestinian people and territory  pursuant to the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949  and to compel Israel  the occupying Power  to halt its unilateral practices aimed at imposing a policy of faits accomplis  such as illegal settlements and the unlawful siege of the Gaza Strip  in addition to attempts to change the demographic nature of Jerusalem by means of Judaization. Israel must be compelled to return to the negotiating table with a view to ending its occupation of all Palestinian and Arab lands  as well to achieve the establishment of a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital  in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions  the principle of land for peace  the road map and the Arab Peace Initiative.As the crisis in Syria  now entering its fourth year  escalates into a bloodier phase  our concern about the potential regional and international repercussions of the failure of that State has given way to anxiety about the exacerbation of the cycle of violence  which has already claimed the lives of more than 190 000 people  created 3 million refugees and displaced another 6 million people. In that regard  the State of Kuwait welcomes Security Council resolution 2165 (2014) on opening new border crossings to deliver aid to the affected Syrian people. We hope that all concerned will pool their efforts to ensure the swiftest possible delivery of humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people in the besieged areas and throughout Syrian territory and beyond.In response to the ripple effects of that intensifying humanitarian crisis  the State of Kuwait hosted two international donor conferences  in January 2013 and January 2014  to support the humanitarian situation in Syria. Pledges made at those two conferences totaled $3.8 billion  of which the State of Kuwait contributed $800 million. That sum was delivered in its entirety to specialized United Nations agencies  as well as to other governmental and non-governmental organizations concerned with humanitarian affairs. In that regard  we reiterate the importance of continued regional and international efforts to reach a political solution that satisfies the aspirations of the Syrian people for a free and decent life  according to the Geneva communiqué  and that preserve Syria’s unity  security and stability.With respect to the sisterly Republic of Yemen  the State of Kuwait  as the current chair of the Gulf Cooperation Council  has sought within its mandate to establish peace and stability in Yemen  and to fulfil the aspirations of its people for development and prosperity  in accordance with the Gulf States initiative and its executive mechanism. However  tensions due to the continued rivalry between some factions  along with the resulting deterioration in the security and political situations  are a source of concern  because of their potential negative impact on the future of the political process in Yemen. They also pose a threat to the country’s unity and territorial integrity. We reiterate our full support for enforcing the outcome of the national dialogue and for addressing the acts of violence and terrorism that some separatist groups continue to provoke.With respect to the situation in Libya  the State of Kuwait renews its support to the legitimately elected Libyan Government  as an integral complement to the process of democratic transformation that will ensure the security  unity and territorial integrity of Libya. The State of Kuwait also emphasizes the need for the international community and the Security Council to honour their commitments by fully adhering to resolution 2174 (2014)  in order to guarantee a better future for Libya and its people.Within the same region  concerning Iran’s nuclear programme  the State of Kuwait supports the ongoing efforts to resolve that issue by peaceful means and in a manner that will guarantee the Islamic Republic of Iran and all the countries of the region the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes  under the supervision and monitoring of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We also emphasize the importance of reaching international agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme  based on full Iranian commitment to cooperating with the IAEA  implementing all relevant Security Council resolutions and enforcing the highest standards of safety and security in its nuclear facilities.The State of Kuwait reiterates its principled and firm rejection of all forms of terrorism and extremism  whatever their reasons  motives or sources. It also believes that promoting the culture of tolerance and coexistence among peoples and nations should be a priority in its internal and external policies  which are derived from the tolerant teachings of Islamic Sharia. The State of Kuwait emphasizes its full support for all international efforts to combat and put an end to the terrorist threats facing the world  which aim to undermine the elements of international peace and security. Kuwait welcomes resolution 2178 (2014) adopted yesterday by the Security Council  reinforcing international efforts to combat terrorism and foreign fighters.In that regard  we denounce the actions of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)  as well as its terroristic practices and acts of aggression in parts of Iraqi and Syrian territory. We equally condemn ISIL’s grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. We reiterate our commitment to support the efforts and endeavours of the Iraqi Government to overcome the destructive scourge of terrorism that currently threatens its security  stability and territorial integrity and that is adversely and clearly affecting the political process in that country.The giant leap represented by new communications technologies  thanks to which the United Nations has been able to expand the reach of its lofty message  has also increased the complexity of monitoring and assessing the fast-paced global environment  as well as handling its output and consequences. The aggregate expertise and experience represented in our Organization at the professional  technical and political levels is embodied in the United Nations Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). The Declaration’s clearly identified priorities and simple terms have played a major and significant role in improving the lives of millions of people in many regions of the world. The Declaration has also set an example by demonstrating the importance of partnership in international work  through cooperation and coordination among Governments  and the promotion of the role of civil society organizations and the private sector.By drawing on modern technology and scientific advances  the Millennium Development Goals have provided the peoples and nations of the world with renewed hope for creating a better world  and have created an incentive to achieve them. The Organization has encouraged Member States to devise a comprehensive and ambitious post-2015 development plan with sustainable development in all three dimensions — economic  social and environmental — at its core. That plan will address new dangers and challenges and anticipate future conditions  which will be different from those we face today.In that regard  the State of Kuwait welcomes the Climate Summit that the Secretary-General convened two days ago  and reiterates that climate change has negative repercussions on development throughout the world and in the Arab region in particular. There is a clear need for international action and solidarity within the framework of the sustainable development goals  according to the principle of shared but differentiated responsibility  in order to guarantee that all States benefit equally from the new agenda. In that regard  special attention and treatment should be provided to the developing countries  which are the States most adversely affected by climate change.Since winning its independence and joining the global Organization  the State of Kuwait has never been far removed from the crises and challenges facing the world. Our founding fathers defined a purely humanitarian approach to helping the needy and restoring hope to those who have lost it  bypassing the traditional bases for giving  which were largely rooted in geographic location  ethnic origin or political affiliation. Their sons have followed that approach  giving greater priority to contemporary trends through the pillars that define our foreign policy. That commitment rests on devising and developing methods for providing assistance and aid to the majority of the world’s countries by promoting activities that would support the message of the United Nations in creating a world in which security and stability prevail  and people live in peace and prosperity.The establishment in 1961 of the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development was an expression of the sincere desire of the State of Kuwait to support the development efforts of Arab States and friendly countries by providing soft loans and technical assistance. In pursuing that approach  and in order to show its keen interest in supporting the humanitarian role of the United Nations  the State of Kuwait has doubled the amount of its fixed annual voluntary contributions to a number of international agencies and organizations  including its recent donation to the World Health Organization to combat the spread of the Ebola virus in West Africa  giving wider horizons and broader reach to the humanitarian work of the State of Kuwait.Our wide-ranging diplomatic efforts at the regional and international levels  led by His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah  Amir of the State of Kuwait  were recognized by the international community with an exceptional and unprecedented international honour when the Secretary-General presented His Highness with a certificate of appreciation in recognition of the outstanding role in humanitarian leadership played by His Highness  the Government and the people of the State of Kuwait in saving the lives of millions of people.To conclude  I would like to emphasize that the State of Kuwait adheres to the multilateral international system  as well as to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. Kuwait believes in the critical importance of furthering all efforts to ensure the continuity of our venerable Organization by ensuring that all States fulfil their responsibilities and commitments under international conventions and conferences in order to help find just and lasting solutions to global threats and challenges  and to reach the loftier goal of maintaining international peace and security."
"95",3945,"LAO",69,2014,"On behalf of the Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic  I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I assure you of our full support and cooperation in the discharge of your duties. I would also like to sincerely commend His Excellency Mr. John Ashe for the successful completion of his work as President of the Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.We have just over 450 days remaining for the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). While many countries have made considerable achievements and will achieve the MDGs  others  like the least developed countries  have seen slow progress and face various challenges in achieving all Goals within the time frame. Moreover  complex regional and international situations  such as armed conflicts  political unrest  pandemics and environmental degradation  among others  have inevitably brought about more obstacles to those countries’ efforts to realize the MDGs.Against that backdrop  based on past experience  it is evident that socioeconomic development in any country can succeed only in an enabling  lasting and secure environment. Only under such conditions could we employ all efforts and draw on all potential and resources available in the country for development in the most effective and sustainable manner.Over the 39 years of its existence  since the war ended  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has deployed all its efforts in national development  starting from the period of healing the wounds of war to the era of formulating and implementing the seventh five-year national socioeconomic development plan  based on the renovation policy set by the Lao People’s Revolutionary Party. The achievements made in each period are the results of lessons learned through actual development activities carried out and from adapting to specific conditions within the country and to the external environment.Lessons learned from friendly countries  both near and far  are valuable assets. We therefore would like to express our sincere appreciation to all friendly countries for sharing their knowledge and experience  including both successes and failures  with the small and young Lao People’s Democratic Republic in each period.The mid-term review of the implementation of the seventh five-year national socioeconomic development plan has shown that the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has made remarkable achievements in many areas  especially in maintaining a steady pace of economic growth  political stability and social order  thus ensuring that the Lao people of all ethnic groups can enjoy their legitimate rights and freedom and can actively participate in national development. That has laid a solid foundation for the country to move towards realizing its ultimate goal of graduating from the least developed country status by 2020. The achievements so far were made possible not only due to national efforts  but also through the support and cooperation extended by friendly countries and development partners  including international organizations  especially the United Nations system.Nevertheless  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has also been affected by the global financial and economic crisis in recent years. That has given rise to major obstacles to national economic development as well as to the implementation of various development goals. In that regard  the Lao Government has taken timely measures to stabilize its macroeconomy  aimed at promoting sustained growth in the coming years.In addition  as a landlocked and least developed country  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic remains vulnerable. It still faces numerous challenges  especially in achieving some of the MDG targets  including reducing child malnutrition  ensuring gender equality in education and reducing child and maternal mortality.Minimizing the impact of unexploded ordnance (UXO) dropped during the war also remains a challenge. Taking into account the importance of dealing with that matter  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has adopted a localized millennium development goal on addressing the impact of UXO  as its national MDG 9.Reducing the impact of UXO remains a huge burden and task for the country  as it hampers national development and the eradication of poverty. In that connection  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic is one of the countries that initiated the process to formulate the Oslo Convention on Cluster Munitions. The full and effective implementation of the Oslo Convention is of great importance  because it will lead to a total prohibition of the use  production or transfer of cluster munitions.In that connection  I take this opportunity to convey our congratulations to Saint Kitts and Nevis  Belize and the Republic of the Congo on their ratification of the Oslo Convention  which increased the total number of States having done so to 86. We hope that other countries will also consider becoming parties to the Convention.The Lao People’s Democratic Republic shares the common concern over the escalating armed conflicts in different parts of the world  which are posing increasingly major threats to the international community. We urge all parties concerned to exercise the utmost restraint and refrain from taking any action that could cause loss of people’s lives or property. Only through addressing those conflicts by peaceful means can we ensure mutual trust. Resentment and hostility against one another lead to escalating violence and use of force  resulting in loss of life and property and pain and suffering for innocent people.In addition  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic shares the strong concern about the escalating conflict in Palestine  which has led to loss of Palestinian lives. We therefore urge a peaceful resolution of the issue of Palestine.In this era of interdependence  cooperation and engagement are key factors for peaceful and mutually beneficial coexistence. The enforcement of isolation and of sanction measures imposed on any country may not benefit the international community. On the contrary  it may cause losses to all and lead to increasing hostility. Likewise  the unilateral embargo on the Republic of Cuba — a sovereign State — for many decades has had a major impact on the lives of the peace-loving Cuban people. Therefore  it is now time to lift the embargo.In this complex and challenging global environment  the United Nations  the only universal organization  under the leadership of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  has made tireless efforts to seek ways and means to address these international issues  promote cooperation for sustainable development and poverty eradication and maintain peace  stability and security in the world. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Secretary-General for his various initiatives in addressing issues of common concern  including the organization of the Climate Summit  which has just been successfully concluded.Nevertheless  amid complex and unpredictable circumstances  the United Nations needs to strengthen itself through the reform of various organs so that it can more effectively carry out its mandate and fulfil its obligations. The international community is hoping to see further tangible progress next year on the reform of the United Nations  on the occasion marking the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the Organization.The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a regional organization that has enjoyed rapid growth  and all ASEAN-initiated mechanisms are bearing fruitful results. We are therefore convinced that ASEAN community-building in 2015 will be successful  turning ASEAN into a single market and production base with increased competitiveness  thus promoting trade and investment in the region and between ASEAN and its external partners. ASEAN is now earnestly mapping out the ASEAN Community Post-2015 Vision  aimed at strengthening and ensuring ASEAN unity while promoting peace and security in the region and the world at large. On that note  we hope that the international community will continue to support the implementation of the ASEAN Community Post-2015 Vision  as well as the Lao People’s Democratic Republic’s ASEAN chairmanship in 2016  after ASEAN becomes a Community.Landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) compose one of the groups of countries in special situations that are recognized by the international community. After 10 years of implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action on addressing the specific problems and special needs of LLDCs  it has been noted that many objectives have not been realized  thus those countries continue to face daunting challenges and marginalization in many areas.More than half of the LLDCs are also least developed countries. In that context  the second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries  to be held in November in Vienna  is of great significance to LLDCs  as it will conduct the 10-year review of the implementation of Almaty Programme of Action and adopt a new programme of action for the next decade. On that note  we would like to call upon all stakeholders  including transit countries and development partners  to participate actively in the Conference with a view to ensuring its successful outcome. Also  we call on the international community to support the implementation of the new programme of action in order to help those countries overcome their special problems and challenges and achieve sustainable development.The year 2015 will mark the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. We hope that the international community will spare no effort in building a peaceful  secure and prosperous world."
"96",3988,"LBN",69,2014,"Allow me first to congratulate the President on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I would also like to thank Mr. John Ashe for his work during his presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. Our appreciation also goes to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his annual report on the work of the Organization (A/69/1).We meet today on the eve of the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  to which my country had the honour to contribute. That milestone reminds us of the need to draw lessons and explore the best ways to put an end to war and violence and to mobilize international efforts to combat terrorism and terrorists.I wish to convey the concerns of my country  Lebanon  which is at the crossroads of a turbulent region. Today Lebanon is the target of a fierce terrorist onslaught being perpetrated by obscurantist and criminal groups. They have attacked many parts of Lebanon and caused the loss of military and civilian lives  as well as considerable material damage. Last month  terrorists kidnapped a number of soldiers and security officers. They took them hostage in order to bring pressure to bear on and to blackmail the Lebanese authorities. They brutally executed three of the detainees. Such crimes have impeded the ongoing indirect negotiations that my Government was conducting with the assistance of friendly countries to secure the release of the soldiers. I would like to underscore that compromise on our firm beliefs is not an option. We remain focused on the release of our soldiers  while preserving the sovereignty  territorial integrity and security of our country.In combating terrorism  the Lebanese people stand united with its armed forces  which represent the main pillar on which we depend to safeguard our national sovereignty  security and peace. Our Government continues to rally the necessary support for its forces to be able to fulfil their duty. In that regard  Lebanon values the generous donation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to support our armed forces. We also pay tribute to the initiative of the Secretary-General  who launched the International Support Group for Lebanon last September here in New York city. We express our satisfaction and reassurance over the outcomes of the meetings held by the Support Group this year in Paris and Rome.The current international mobilization against terror reflects the international community’s awareness of the alarming situation in our region and the need to extinguish the flames of violence and prevent the spread of such attacks. Lebanon underscores the need for regional and international cooperation to fight terrorism. We welcome the Security Council resolutions on the subject  in particular resolutions 2170 (2014) and 2178 (2014). Lebanon calls on its brothers and friends around the world to safeguard and protect it from regional power struggles.Our fight against terrorism is not new. For years  Lebanon has suffered under the threat posed by political crimes  which have targeted many of its leaders  in particular former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri  and prominent media figures and intellectuals. We continue to follow the work of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. We look forward to the establishment of the truth in order to put an end to impunity  enable justice to be served and deter criminals.The events unfolding in vast areas of Syria and Iraq constitute human crimes that cannot be understood or accepted by any intellect or faith. Perpetrated in the name of Islam  such crimes have cost the lives of tens of thousands of Muslim civilians and have caused unprecedented waves of displaced people. In addition  those crimes have destabilized national entities  divided societies and destroyed human and material resources. That terrorist onslaught targets religious groups that since time immemorial have been an essential component of the social fabric of the region and a fundamental part of the social and cultural diversity that has long characterized the eastern Mediterranean. In the past few months  the entire world has witnessed attacks against Christians and Yazidis in Iraq  their forced expulsion and the destruction of their property and holy sites. Lebanon considers attacks against religions  their followers and sacred places to be an offence against human dignity and a violation of the freedom of religious belief and practice enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the International Bill of Human Rights  respect for which is guaranteed by our Lebanese Constitution.Lebanon is proud to be the only country in the Arab and Islamic worlds where the President of the Republic is a Christian citizen. That confirms that our country  despite its political crises  has been a paragon of diversity in the Middle East  an exceptional example of coexistence and interaction among followers of different religions and sects and a model totally opposed to the notion of a racist State. I take this opportunity to reiterate before the General Assembly the Lebanese Government’s call for the election of a new Christian President of the Republic as soon as possible.The painful and worrisome war in Syria  which has continued for more than four years  has driven nearly 1.5 million displaced Syrians to Lebanon — a number that is equivalent to one-third of the Lebanese population. In order to fully understand the dimensions of that situation  one would have to imagine 100 million people flooding into the United States of America and spreading out randomly through its cities  towns  schools and parks  with their related urgent needs and requirements  posing an unbearable burden at the economic  humanitarian  social  educational  health and security levels.That huge number of displaced people weighs heavily on the Lebanese infrastructure  which already has structural problems. It puts pressure on the national economy  where growth has dropped to almost 0 per cent owing to the regional situation  which represents a loss of $7.5 billion for Lebanon  according to World Bank estimates. This reality constitutes a national disaster for us. The problem of the displaced Syrians  with all its serious economic  social and security implications  is not — and should not be — a purely Lebanese problem. It is a major regional crisis that we put before the international community  which must share that enormous burden with Lebanon. Such a burden cannot be borne by any country alone  no matter how large.Lebanon reiterates its concern for the unity  sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Syria. In our Government policy statement  we have reaffirmed our commitment to the policy of keeping our distance in order to protect ourselves from the repercussions of the crisis in the neighbouring country.On the eighth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  Lebanon asserts its commitment to implementing all of the resolution’s provisions. We believe that it will strengthen stability and security in southern Lebanon and contribute to extending the State’s authority over its entire territory. We renew our appeal to the international community to compel Israel to fulfil all its obligations in that regard  to stop violating Lebanese sovereignty from the land  the sea and the air and to fully cooperate with the United Nations peacekeeping forces of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in order to demarcate what is left of the Blue Line and immediately withdraw from the area north of Ghajar  the Sheba’a Farms and the Kfar Shouba Hills.We also wish to reaffirm Lebanon’s full rights to its territorial waters and the natural oil and gas resources within its exclusive economic zone. Lebanon cannot fail to acknowledge the role of UNIFIL and the ongoing cooperation and coordination between UNIFIL and the Lebanese army. Lebanon would like to thank all nations that contribute to the Force  the Force leaders and the members of the Force for their dedication in the service of the stability and security of civilians in southern Lebanon.Last month  the Gaza Strip was subjected to a new Israeli aggression  which killed hundreds of civilians  displaced more than a quarter of the population and destroyed homes  hospitals and infrastructure. Lebanon  which has paid dearly as a result of the repeated Israeli attacks  calls for legal accountability for the war crimes committed by Israel and for that country to be held accountable for its actions in order to prevent impunity.Lebanon believes that Israel is responsible for frustrating all efforts to reach a peaceful settlement based on the two-State solution. It stresses the need for a just  comprehensive and lasting solution to the conflict in the Middle East  based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  the Madrid terms of reference for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative  adopted at the Beirut summit in 2002.Today  the Levant seems to be the stage for dark and arbitrary tragedies  where the most recent manifestations of human savagery are being played out. Today  the Levant seems to be hostage to ignorance  extremism and obscurantism  plunged into a hatred arising from a distant past and guided by a fanaticism and instincts that yield only bloodshed. However  that troubled area was  is and will be home to many people who  like all other human beings  have land  homes  tales  dreams and a history. They are individuals who are eager to live as free and equal citizens in free and stable countries. They have sons and daughters who seek better opportunities for engagement in the world and a better place to live.Humankind owes a debt to our Levant. We gave humankind enlightenment when darkness  extremism and ignorance were crippling the other side of the world. We still have much to offer and to add to the tremendous development of human progress and creativity. The world must stop counting our dead. It must meet its obligation and seek to establish peace in that tormented part of the world — a peace that is based on law  justice  respect for the sovereignty of nations and the protection of their security and territorial integrity  the safeguarding of the fundamental rights of individuals and groups  including their right to enjoy their wealth  and the protection of religious and ethnic diversity.We  the Lebanese people  both at home and in every corner of the world  look to the United Nations for assistance. At the same time  we are determined to overcome the current crisis  as we have done so many times before. We are confident that  together  we will not allow any person  any circumstance or any party to extinguish the beacons of freedom  democracy  diversity  pluralism  knowledge and human rights in Lebanon."
"97",4034,"LBR",69,2014,"I bring the Assembly greetings from Her Excellency Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf  President of the Republic of Liberia  who should have been here today to address the Assembly but chose to remain on the front lines in Liberia to lead our fight against the deadly Ebola virus disease.Liberia congratulates the President of the Assembly on his assumption of his high office and acknowledges the astute statesmanship and wisdom that he brings to that important assignment  which inspire confidence for a successful sixty-ninth session of the Assembly. We assure him of Liberia’s full cooperation and support. We pay a special tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his able and visionary stewardship of the affairs of this global institution.With just one year until the expiration date of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  the theme of this sixty-ninth general debate  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  could not have been more appropriate. Liberia was put on the pedestal of global honour when President Johnson-Sirleaf was selected as one of three co-chairs of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda  formed by the Secretary-General in 2012 to advise him on the contours of an ambitious but realistic post-2015 global development agenda and to define the critical steps required to reinvigorate and sustain global partnership. The Panel’s report  A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through Sustainable Development  contained a clarion call to leave no one behind  which has been embraced as a motivating theme by many.At the continental level  our President chairs a 10-member high-level committee of African Heads of State  under whose leadership a African Common Position has been developed and endorsed by the membership of the African Union (AU). That Position is based on six pillars that represent Africa’s vision of the prerequisites for eradicating poverty on the continent and for ensuring its future and development. We are encouraged that the concepts and strategies defined under each of the pillars have been significantly incorporated into the proposed 17 sustainable development goals. That makes us optimistic that the substance of our pillars will form an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda. As we await the Secretary-General’s synthesizing report  I can assure the Assembly of Liberia’s continued active participation in the negotiations that lie ahead.As we survey the regional and international political landscape  we are increasingly concerned about the spread of extremist ideologies and terrorist activities around the world  especially in Africa. Whether we are speaking of Al-Shabaab in Somalia and Kenya  Al-Qaida in the Maghreb or Boko Haram in Nigeria  the African continent has not been spared the deadly and destructive consequences of extremism. Additionally  over the past year  while peace processes were being consolidated in many African countries  we have been sad witnesses to the eruption or exacerbation of conflicts on the continent  notably in South Sudan and the Central African Republic. We laud the efforts of the AU and the United Nations to resolve those conflicts  and join in the call for sustained international action to bring about a more secure and peaceful world.Liberia commends the Secretary-General for his convening  last week  of the high-level Climate Summit  which elicited concrete commitments from the global community on reducing greenhouse emissions and other measures aimed at achieving sustainable development. As a small country and one that is still endowed with 43 per cent of the remaining Guinea forests  we are proud that we too have concluded partnership agreements and made concrete commitments aimed at supporting the goals of sustainable  climate-sensitive development. Small countries like Liberia contribute less to greenhouse emissions but suffer disproportionately from the adverse impact of climate change. To right that anomaly and in the united spirit of saving our one world  all countries  big and small  should make proportionate commitments to saving our planet and take concrete action to make such commitments a reality.A year ago  when President Johnson-Sirleaf addressed the Assembly (see A/68/PV.6)  it was with a more positive message from a President reporting significant achievements and lofty aspirations for the future. President Johnson-Sirleaf  full of gratitude  informed the world that Liberia had just celebrated 10 years of peace in August 2013  and that  despite some challenges  was still registering remarkable progress on the path of socioeconomic development. The country had transitioned from an emphasis on stabilization to a focus on transformation within the framework of a long-term development agenda  Vision 2030. The President also informed the Assembly that the countries of the Mano River Basin Union — Liberia  Guinea  Côte d’Ivoire and Sierra Leone — were at peace and were pursuing regional integration through initiatives that would facilitate connectivity within their power and transport systems  thereby enhancing the cross-border trade in which our market women are mostly engaged. She even reported on how a small contingent of Liberian peacekeepers  who are still in Mali today  had contributed to the laudable United Nations peacekeeping efforts there  creating an environment conducive to stability and democratic transition in that country.One year later  as I address the Assembly  I am the purveyor of a different kind of story  and a sad one. Over the past six months  a dark cloud has been hanging over the Liberian landscape  such that instead of reporting economic growth  we are constrained to report economic decline. The implementation of virtually all the pillars of our Agenda for Transformation has been placed on hold  and gains are perhaps already being reversed. Instead of devoting attention to regional integration through the facilitation of power and transport projects  we are talking about regional cooperation in dealing with a deadly enemy. The market women who traded goods and services across borders a year ago are now constrained to remain within those borders and suffer the consequences of economic inactivity.The deadly enemy that has visited so much harm and misery on my country and our neighbours is the Ebola virus disease  which began wreaking havoc in Liberia in March. Since the outbreak  the Government of Liberia has taken a host of measures. We have declared a state of emergency and suspended schools  and  with the constructive involvement of all stakeholders  including pastors  imams  chiefs  elders  young people  Government officials and opposition politicians  we have stepped up awareness and prevention campaigns to address the rigid denial and deeply rooted traditional and cultural practices that create fertile ground for the spread of the disease. We have also committed and will continue to commit significant portions of our own paltry resources to the fight.In spite of such efforts  which have been buttressed by those of our partners  Ebola has confounded all of us and has sprinted faster than our collective efforts  snuffing out the life candle of more than 1 800 of our compatriots  with a total of nearly 3 500 infected. Cumulatively  women  as the majority among our health workforce and the main caregivers in our deeply traditional society  have been disproportionately affected. Sadly  as Ebola widens its deadly circumference  it is creating a trail of traumatized orphans across the country  which includes a 10-year-old child from Barkedu  Lofa county  who is the last person standing from a family of 12. Our already limited pool of health workers has been further reduced  because 89 of them have fallen victim to the virus  out of a total of 182 infected.The resulting panic that has arisen in health workers who see their colleagues die from Ebola has precipitated the closure of many health facilities across the country. As we and our many international partners struggle to douse the wildfire caused by Ebola  we are left with inadequate resources  time and personnel to attend to routine illnesses such as malaria  typhoid fever and measles  thereby causing many more  tangential deaths. An increasing number of pregnant women are dying in the process of bringing forth life. In short  our public health system  which totally collapsed during our years of conflict and was being gradually rebuilt  has collapsed again under the weight of the deadly virus.Ebola is not just a health crisis; it is a total crisis. It is an economic crisis  a social crisis and a potential political and security crisis. Indeed  its deleterious impact has been very wide and very deep. On the economic front  it has occasioned a 3.4 per cent downward slide in economic growth in Liberia  and some experts have predicted that  if not contained quickly  it could cause a 12 per cent decline in our economy in 2015. As a result of the slowdown in economic activities  our revenue generation capacity has been seriously undermined  thereby constricting our ability to provide basic social services and to continue to fund key development projects. The suspension of flights as well as the travel and other restrictions and sanctions imposed on Liberia and other affected countries despite expert advice to the contrary from the World Health Organization and others  have not only undermined the humanitarian efforts aimed at quickly containing the disease  but have also aggravated the adverse economic effects of the Ebola crisis.As destructive as the Liberian civil conflict was  at least our people knew the warring factions and the front lines. With Ebola  the enemy is more insidious  and there are no clear-cut front lines  because someone’s child  someone’s husband or someone’s workmate could actually be the enemy and in the front line at the same time. That difficult feature of the disease  coupled with a host of other challenges  has occasioned its rapid spread. We are heartened that  as a result of separate and joint appeals of the heads of State of Liberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea to the Secretary-General and leaders of friendly countries and institutions  the international community is showing a better appreciation of the unprecedented scope and magnitude of the Ebola outbreak in our countries. There is a chorus of leaders advocating and committing to support more robust  scaled up and urgent assistance to the affected countries.Thanks to the Secretary-General and other world leaders  the past few weeks have witnessed a host of positive developments that constitute a major heightening of focus and scaling up of the international response. Those developments include the following.First  we welcome the announcement by President Barak Obama of the United States of his Government’s decision to scale up assistance to the region  including the deployment of 3 000 military and medical personnel to help us with the fight.Secondly  the Security Council meeting held on 18 September 2014 (see S/PV.7268)  under the leadership and Council presidency of the United States  adopted resolution 2177 (2014)  which recognizes the Ebola crisis as a threat to international peace and security  necessitating a strong and concerted international response through firm commitments of support. The resolution also called on Member States to lift travel and other restrictions imposed on affected countries.Thirdly  the Secretary-General announced on 18 September his intention to establish the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response  which was formally endorsed by Assembly resolution 69/1  submitted by the President and adopted on 19 September.Fourthly  we have seen the start of the deployment by the African Union of contingents of medical and relevant personnel drawn from across Africa to Liberia and other worst-affected countries.Fifthly  the high-level meeting on response to the Ebola virus disease outbreak  convened at Headquarters by the Secretary-General on 25 September  witnessed announcements of substantial commitments of assistance by many countries.Those concrete demonstrations of solidarity have taken many forms  and we are deeply grateful for all of them. They should  however  not lead us towards complacency  because we definitely have not yet achieved the 20-fold increase in response recommended by the experts to contain the disease. Additionally  while we struggle with the first war  which involves actually disrupting the transmission of Ebola  we must begin to prepare for the second war of tackling the long-term socioeconomic impacts of the Ebola crisis  including building and creating the capacity for a new health system that can robustly deal with any future health challenge  and raising the resources needed to address a legion of socioeconomic  political  security and other challenges made more acute by the presence of Ebola.We are also cognizant of the positive contributions of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL)  which has helped us enjoy 10 years of peace. The presence of UNMIL in Liberia  especially at a time when we were experiencing isolation  has helped to reassure our people and create a security climate conducive to tackling some of the multifaceted challenges of the Ebola crisis. Therefore  the continued engagement of UNMIL in Liberia will be critical to enabling Liberia’s transition from the Ebola crisis to resume the implementation of strategies for the achievement of our long-term development agenda.Ebola is a difficult enemy that has frustrated and bypassed our collective efforts in the past  causing some experts to project that  in a worst case scenario  about 1.4 million precious lives could be lost in our countries by January 2015. In spite of the gloom of today — and as Liberians ponder the question: “Will I  my wife  my husband  my child  my friend or my workmate be one of those to populate the 1.4 million doomsday statistics?”— we should not sink into defeatism. Instead  President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf and the resilient Liberian people feel that Ebola has presented us with a one-option  multiple-choice test  and that option is to fight back. And we are fighting back.As President Johnson-Sirleaf aptly put it in her 17 September update to the people of Liberia on the Ebola crisis:“I believe in the Liberian people. I believe that we are stronger than the greatest threat with which we are currently faced. And 1 believe we will prevail. The war did not defeat us  a completely destroyed economy — the greatest collapse since World War II — did not defeat us. Ebola will not defeat us”.We know that the road ahead may be long  curvy and hilly. But with bigger  bolder  timely and sustained efforts on our part  buttressed by the international community  we are sure that dawn will soon break on this long  dark night occasioned by the Ebola virus."
"98",4079,"LBY",69,2014,"At the outset  I would like to express my sincerest congratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I am confident that he will steer the work of this session towards the best results. Allow me also to commend the efforts of Mr. Ban Ki-moon  Secretary-General of the United Nations  for achieving the objectives of the Organization and for promoting international peace and security. I would like to thank him in particular for standing with the Libyan people during the revolution against the dictatorship and for providing support for our nascent democracy after the revolution.I am honoured to stand before members today as the representative of the Libyan people to describe their ambitions  pains and hopes  to participate in the quest for the best ways to maintain peace and security on our planet and to achieve the common aspirations of our peoples. There is no doubt that those who witnessed the revolution of the Libyan people against dictatorship in 2011 were impressed by the courage  unity  awareness and creative capabilities of our people. But today there is no doubt that many are astonished by events in Libya — the fighting  the bloodshed among brothers  the unjustified destruction of infrastructure and public and private property. Many may wonder  where are the people they saw three years ago? Where are the unarmed revolutionaries who flocked into the streets  facing bullets with their bare chests to defend their rights? Where are the intellectuals who flooded the media with realistic assessments and convinced the world of the justice of their people’s cause?I would say  yes  that was the true Libyan people. They did not think in terms of material gains or leadership positions. Their only aspiration was to put an end to dictatorship and pave the road for democracy to ensure a prosperous future for all Libyans. Unfortunately  Libya today is in a completely different situation. Most of the activists have left the political arena  either because of the forcibly imposed political isolation law or because of the campaigns of intimidation  arrests and assassinations perpetrated by various armed groups against anyone who opposes their views or calls for their disarmament and demobilization.Some armed groups are no longer subject to the Government’s direction as they try to impose their will on the Libyan people by force  violate human rights and blackmail the Government to gain access to funds  while they refuse to arm the police and to reinstitute  reconstruct and arm the army. The existing conflict in and around Tripoli among armed groups that opposed the legitimate authorities has forced the Government to evacuate all of its premises  which were seized by a coalition of armed groups. Those included a terrorist group that professes Al-Qaida ideology and is known for its stand against the building of State institutions — a group placed on the list of terrorist organizations by the United States and the European Union. Moreover  the residences of many ministers and citizens were looted and burned down. That group is still waging war on the region west of the city of Tripoli  inhabited by the Warshafana tribe. The indiscriminate shelling with heavy weaponry led to the exodus of most of its population  which then led the House of Representatives to declare it a disaster area. That could not have happened if the international community had taken the situation in Libya seriously  assisted the Government in establishing a strong army  exerted pressure to ensure the disarmament of armed groups and supported the arming of the police.The armed groups that captured the capital have clearly declared their opposition to the legitimate institutions of the State and their quest to overthrow the elected House of Representatives and the elected Government  in an apparent effort to derail the process of democratic transition and topple the legitimate authorities by forming a parallel Government. Furthermore  that has not sufficed for the group that controls Tripoli. It has also persecuted political activists  human rights defenders and journalists  shut down media channels and forcibly prevented opponents from demonstrating in the city of Tripoli and other cities. It has recruited media personnel and some radical clerics to incite the killing of those with different opinions and those who support the elected House of Representatives and the Government.The group has allied itself with Ansar Al-Sharia  which professes the ideology of Al-Qaida. It has practised terrorism in some Libyan cities  especially Benghazi and Derna. It has provided a safe haven and training camps for terrorists from all over the world  including Tunisia  Algeria  Egypt and Mali  with unrivalled financial and media support from outside the country  in order to undermine the legitimate Libyan authorities and enable it to implement its conspiracy.I wish the Assembly to know that turning a blind eye to terrorism in Libya is no longer acceptable. Our people can no longer tolerate assassinations  humiliation  intimidation  suppression of freedoms or human rights violations based on an individual’s background and belief. The international community can either stand with the elected legitimate authorities and implement Security Council resolution 2174 (2014) by imposing sanctions on those who impede the political process  undermine security and seize State institutions  or affirm loudly and clearly that the Libyans have to take on terrorism single-handedly. Surely  the international community must take action to withstand the effects of the expansion of terrorism in North Africa and the Sahel region.We are in need of substantial assistance from Libya’s friends — help in rebuilding the army and providing it with all it needs to stop the fighting among brothers and battle terrorism and extremism  which now form a broad front stretching from Iraq to Algeria. That front cannot be eliminated without an alliance of the States concerned to ensure the elimination of terrorism and guarantee the dissemination of the principles of tolerance and democracy. The failure to provide arms and training to the Libyan army in its war against terrorism serves the interests of extremism  adds to instability in Libya  disrupts calm in the region and threatens global peace.We welcome all efforts and goodwill by friendly countries  the United Nations  the League of Arab States and the African Union to help the legitimate Libyan authorities regain control  either by taking a bold stand with the House of Representatives  the Government and the constitution-drafting body and by persuading armed groups to give up their arms  withdraw from State institutions and obey the Government’s directions  or by exerting pressure on the political movements and armed groups so that they renounce violence and agree to a dialogue on the priorities and future of Libya.Every illegitimate contact  unauthorized by the Government  of any foreign country with individuals  groups and organizations that do not recognize the Government’s authority or that of the elected House of Representatives and that use violence as a means to impose their views on the Libyan people will be considered by the Government an unfriendly act against the unity and stability of Libya. Hence  all necessary measures will be taken to confront it.The Libyan people  under the leadership of the legitimate authority  will not submit to blackmail and intimidation and will resist any attempt to impose a totalitarian dictatorship  whatever its slogan. We wish that the Government did not need the assistance of brotherly and friendly countries to extend State authority over its territory and eliminate the terrorism and criminality that threaten Libya’s security and unity  causing the displacement of hundreds of thousands from their homes in various parts of Libya and destroying the economy.The House of Representatives and the Government are determined to pursue the path of dialogue and tolerance within the framework of legitimacy  solve all the problems and differences between Libyans  agree on priorities  respect the democratic process and re-establish the rule of law and the holding of elections. They are also determined to demobilize all armed groups and to stop their funding by the end of the current year. We hope that the international community will help us to carry out the following measures.First  we must ensure the establishment by the State of defence and security organs and make the Government the sole  legitimate authority capable of using force in disarming the armed groups and exercising its authority over all Libya’s territory.Secondly  we must ensure Government control over the capital  Tripoli  and the withdrawal of armed groups from State institutions so that officials can work without being threatened and provide services to the citizens.Thirdly  we must realize that the establishment of illegal institutions set up in parallel with the existing bodies is impeding the political process and is subject to sanctions under Security Council resolution 2174 (2014).Fourthly  we must establish genuine  active cooperation in combating terrorism through a strategic alliance between Libya and its neighbouring countries north and south of the Mediterranean.Lastly  we must strengthen the culture of dialogue  without exclusion or marginalization  and  with the help of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya  the neighbouring countries  the League of Arab States and the African Union  initiate a comprehensive dialogue for all Libyan people.As the General Assembly begins its deliberations at its sixty-ninth session  whose main theme is the post-2015 development agenda  I would like to point out that when the Millennium Development Goals were set  Libya started to review its economic policies and restructure its economy to achieve them. However  the deteriorating security situation has disrupted the economy. I would like to note the close interlinkages among security  stability and development. Without security  there will be no development  and vice versa. Therefore  restoring security and stability in Libya is key to advancing development  bringing the disrupted economy back on track  achieving the remaining Millennium Development Goals and preparing to achieve the post-2015 development goals  once they are adopted.Libya looks forward to the support of the United Nations and friendly countries in restoring security and the capacity-building of military and security institutions in order to ensure the launch of programmes for reconstruction and development. We also look forward to the assistance of all countries in tracing looted funds abroad and repatriating them to enable Libya to increase funding for development and infrastructure programmes. That will help eliminate unemployment and absorb a large numbers of foreign workers  estimated at several millions  from neighbouring countries. Both Libya and the neighbouring countries would benefit  and illegal immigration to Europe of people in search of work and decent living conditions would be reduced.Despite the circumstances in Libya  we cannot forget the tragedy of the Palestinian people and their suffering. They have taken refuge in various countries around the world because of the Israeli occupation. We reaffirm our condemnation of the Israeli occupation and its practices in the Palestinian and Arab occupied territories. We call for the Security Council to provide protection for the Palestinian people  set a timetable to end the Israeli occupation and establish an independent and sovereign Palestinian State on all the Palestinian territories  with East Jerusalem as its capital. The Palestinian State should be a full member of all international organizations. Palestinian refugees should be entitled to return to their lands  from which they were expelled.The continued blockade and repeated Israeli aggression against the Gaza Strip and the destruction of infrastructure have brought shame on civilized human beings. The international community should be committed to the reconstruction of Gaza  preventing the recurrence of destruction and killing by the Israeli army  ensuring the prosecution of all those responsible for war crimes committed in the Gaza Strip and supporting the efforts of the Government of national reconciliation  led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas."
"99",4112,"LCA",69,2014,"Exactly one year ago  on 30 September 2013  I had the unsurpassed glory of delivering my maiden address to the General Assembly (see A/68/PV.21)  and I used that occasion to pay homage to the great architects of world peace who fostered the birth and initial dynamics of our United Nations. In so doing  I used the principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations as a ready compass to set my course as I navigated the issues that occupied the forefront of our attention at that time  under the captaincy of former President John Ashe  who successfully piloted our Organization of peace through the turbulent seas of global uncertainty.The issues that commanded the attention of the international community then included global terrorism and the tensions in the Middle East and the Korean peninsula. Those were compounded by concerns around geopolitical conflicts and unresolved trade issues  as well as trade and macroeconomic approaches that favoured industrialized countries to the detriment of developing nations.Given that in nature’s irreversible onward march  unresolved problems are brought forward and compounded by succeeding problems  this year the General Assembly has convened at a time of increased turmoil. Since our discussions last September  it is undoubtedly the case that dissension and conflict have increased in the Middle East — the arena that inevitably sets the price for petroleum and its associated products  which are utilized by the peoples of the global community  rich or poor. On the other hand  the benefits expected from the end of the Cold War  with the potential for normalizing relations on the European continent and in lands and regions far distant from Europe  now seem to be doubtful of fulfilment  as signs  tensions and pressures once associated with the Cold War are evolving  bringing about renewed concerns for the international community as a whole.When such tremors emerge  it is much harder for small States like ours to get the attention of the major Powers with regard to the evaluation and discussion of our own issues and objectives. Those can be successfully resolved only if the dominant members of the international community can relate to them  without the positions and tensions that emphasize allegiance on the part of small Powers to this or that side. That is why we  from our small corner of the globe  venture to express the view  in this most significant of international forums  that the tensions and the tendencies towards war now emerging should be subordinated to the search for solutions in which the principles and objectives of the Organization  particularly its preference for the negotiated resolution of conflicts  are pursued as far as practicable. The escalating conflicts have negative effects on the access of small States to the attention of larger Powers  and therefore they retard the positive contribution of the international community to our own concerns.In that connection  we have observed  with a certain disquiet  tendencies in Europe that indicate a possible resumption of the Cold War on that continent. We believe that that can only be disadvantageous to small countries like ours  because in forums such as this we tend to find a return to demands for automatic commitment to one side or the other. As a small country  we have called for negotiations to prevail in the pursuit of the rearrangement of continental European relations  following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. Despite being a small country far away from the situation in Europe  we have long had  and continue to have  an integral relationship with that continent. It is particularly on that basis that we call for diplomacy to prevail  and we have been gratified to see recent signs indicating that that is likely to be the path pursued on the European continent.We are relieved to see that the contentions in the Middle East  specifically in respect of the Palestine issue  have returned to the negotiating table. That is in concert with earlier developments relating to contentions between the NATO Powers and Iran  as the various parties were able to adopt postures of mutual discussion and engagement. That has led recently to what seems to be jointly negotiated stances to the extremely complex situation in Syria and to the emergence of the so-called Islamic State  which has been spreading disorder and contention in the wider Middle East.From our perspective  we can only express the wish that negotiations and cooperation among the larger Powers and between themselves and other Middle East countries continue  even as some members of the international community felt it necessary to resort to the use of force in the area. We reaffirm  even in the midst of great global complexity  our country’s commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes.While many developments in our world hold the seeds of our region’s continued marginalization  we also want to accentuate the more positive trends emerging in the international community that are leading to the creation of space in our global arena. Consequently  Saint Lucia is encouraged by the possibility of enhanced flexibility in decision-making being permitted to members of the international community via the emergence of large  developing States in such a manner that they are now characterized as increasingly significant actors in decision-making relating to the resolution of global issues.When I addressed the Assembly last year  I referred to the emergence of institutions such as the Union of South American Nations  which includes some members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  and to the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America — Peoples’ Trade Agreement (ALBA). They have opened up opportunities for assisting our countries to meet the Millennium Development Goals  to which we are all committed.Saint Lucia reiterates its appreciation for the work of ALBA  an institution committed to assisting countries without requiring ideological commitment to this or that position but recognizing the priority of economic and social development and preferring the peaceful resolution of disputes above all other concerns. In consonance with that posture  we commend the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for its contribution to the Ebola eradication budget  and Cuba for its dispatch of 156 doctors to West Africa to assist in the fight against the deadly Ebola virus.Saint Lucia welcomes the initiative by Brazil  India  China and South Africa  along with Russia  to extend and deepen the assistance available to other developing countries  thereby widening the scope for their advancement towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Specifically  we would mention the establishment of the New Development Bank  which further facilitates the efforts of developing countries for economic reconstruction. The establishment of the World Trade Organization and the single-minded immediacy with which it has pursued international trade liberalization have threatened the very foundations of our economies  particularly in agriculture  which has suffered sudden and certain destruction. From our perspective  therefore  another dimension has been added to the efforts of small States such as Saint Lucia to navigate the consequences of sudden international economic liberalization and globalization.In that context of the emergence of new balances of economic and political power and new flexibilities in the use of diplomacy  including within our hemisphere  Saint Lucia once again reiterates its plea for the removal of the blockade imposed against the Republic of Cuba. More specifically  my Government calls for the removal of Cuba from the so-called terrorist watch-list. That is a residual effect of the Cold War  which is over.Given the scourge of the traffic in narcotics in particular  we call for further cooperation among all countries in the hemisphere and a setting aside of the old Cold War postures as necessary conditions for balanced development and peace. A specific example of where that applies relates to our efforts in pursuing collective arrangements and unimpeded cooperation against the menace of the movement of narcotics through the Caribbean Sea and their decimating march across the moral  social and economic fabric of our region. The drug barons make no ideological distinctions among countries as they continue to exploit weaknesses deriving from outmoded political stances that impede effective regional cooperation. As we all know  those pursuing the sale of narcotics make special efforts to attract the youth of our countries  compromising the essential resource base for our future economic development and social stability.Once again  I draw the attention of this body to Saint Lucia’s firm and consistent belief that the historical anomalies of the Cold War still in our international system should not be allowed to inhibit the contribution of countries desirous of participating in  and enhancing  the advancement of developing countries simply because there are issues surrounding their particular status.In that connection I would refer  as I did on behalf of the Government of Saint Lucia last year  to the participation of Taiwan in international organizations  particularly those that focus on technical arrangements or the resolution of important issues that are of value to the international system as a whole or to its member States. My country again makes a plea for fuller participation by Taiwan  particularly in the World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization. Taiwan has the experience of engaging in a technological revolution that has enhanced its economic development and the welfare of its people  and in many respects that State has become a viable economic development model for small States. Hence we believe that the Government and people of Taiwan have much to offer developing countries  and so we would support any institutional initiative that would allow that country to make a contribution through those mechanisms of the United Nations that are devoted to solutions to issues of technological  economic and social development.I shall now turn to the theme of this year’s General Assembly  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  to navigate two issues of paramount importance to Saint Lucia as a small island developing State. At this juncture  I must congratulate the President of the Assembly and his country  Uganda  on this theme  which is charged with invaluable significance for my region and for Africa  as we are challenged in building an impregnable substratum of economic and technological self-determination to successfully deal with the development challenges of our times.First  speaking of Africa and the Caribbean region in that context  I come to a matter of great historical and contemporary concern to the people of Saint Lucia and the Caribbean Community as a whole  which I adumbrated in my address to this body last year. It is the issue of the need for the metropolitan Powers to come to terms with the manner in which the Caribbean States were historically created and organized and the consequences of that for their standing and situation in today’s world. Specifically  at their meeting in July 2014  the Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community decided that a case for reparations should be elaborated beyond the relationship between ourselves and the relevant European Governments and that Caribbean States should  in seeking support for that objective  “advance the reparations case during the sitting of the United Nations General Assembly in 2014”.I carry out that mandate now on behalf of the Government and the people of Saint Lucia  who  in concordance with the peoples of other CARICOM member States  seek the award of reparations as a specific way in which those who in centuries past held the reins of power without accountability can now in recompense make a specific contribution to the nation-building programmes of our Governments beyond existing commitments. In that regard  we make a case for reparations as a matter of principle.Secondly  Saint Lucia has welcomed the deliberations of the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  held in Samoa earlier this month  and the efforts made in that regard by the United Nations. The recent Samoa Pathway conclusions have re-emphasized the persistent and peculiar problems inhibiting the development of small island developing States (SIDS). In the words of the recent SIDS declaration  there is an insistence that “small island developing States remain a special case for sustainable development”  without which “success will remain difficult”. As the Commonwealth Secretariat recently pointed out  research has shown that countries most exposed to preference loss are mainly SIDS  such as Saint Lucia  Saint Kitts and Nevis  Dominica  Jamaica  and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. From our regional point of view  the Caribbean Community’s continental States of Belize and Guyana are included in that list.The Commonwealth Secretariat has also shown that  while the compound annual growth rate of per capita income of SIDS between 1970 and 2000 was 0.73 per cent  that of the world economy was almost three times higher  at 2.07 per cent; and that  in the period between 2002 and 2012  SIDS had one of the lowest compound annual growth rates  at 1.23 per cent  as compared to 4.96 per cent for developing countries  4 per cent for least developed countries and 3.23 per cent for sub-Saharan Africa.The Saint Lucia Government wants the recommendations of the Samoa Conference to be given the international attention that they deserve. That is critical  considering the fact that along with the specific problems that have been identified as continuing to inhibit sustainable development  the instability of the present international economic system only serves to aggravate the precarious position of small States. In that connection  we stress  as we did when addressing the Assembly last year  the importance of assistance arrangements  including further development of the Adaptation Fund so that our countries can cope with the negative effects of sea level rise.In view of Saint Lucia’s urgent requirements  we also emphasize assistance for the construction of facilities that can protect our countries against untimely natural disasters due to climate change. Losses from disasters in SIDS continue unabated and continue to outstrip our capacity to cope. Over the past decade  many SIDS have lost considerable momentum in their development progress by having to contend with post-disaster rehabilitation and reconstruction costs  which invariably have brought increased debt. The Caribbean has been a particular victim of those events since I spoke here last year  and we hope that following the recent Samoa Conference  a certain urgency will be attached to the matter.Saint Lucia would like to reiterate a few points.First  we emphasize the persistent use of diplomacy as a prime instrument for the pursuit of normalized relations among all States.Second  the rapidly changing nature of international relations mandates the need to subject the United Nations system to new levels of critical examination  with the central objective of strengthening the internal machinery of our Organization and reforming it to truly reflect today’s geopolitical reality.Third  we must as an international community do all within our power to ensure that the Cold War does not resume even though the post-Cold War dividends have not yet materialized for much of humankind. Now is an excellent time to divest ourselves of any residual effects of the Cold War  such as the blockade imposed on our sister island of Cuba and to remove Cuba from the so-called terrorist watch list.Fourth  we make a plea for reparations as a matter of principle.Fifth  we must take advantage of new  meaningful opportunities for cooperation and partnership  not only with traditional partners but also  setting aside long-standing geopolitical contentions  with a range of non-traditional partners  such as Taiwan.Sixth  developed countries should not pursue trade and macroeconomic approaches that are detrimental to the well-being of small island developing States.Seventh  we must determine a clear and effective strategy by which SIDS can translate the outcomes of the Samoa Conference into concrete results — results that build on existing international commitments and include the means of implementation to support the national and regional development efforts of SIDS. Without that  the Samoa Conference could be construed  in the words of the late Martin Luther King  Jr.  “as a meaningless drama on the stage of history ... shrouded with the ugly garments of shame”.Eighth  Saint Lucia stands for freedom  democracy  non-discrimination  sustainable development  poverty eradication and special and differential treatment for SIDS  all of which are important ingredients of our most precious pursuits and aspirations: peace and prosperity for our people  the recovery and resilience of our Caribbean region and stability and security in our world.Finally  it is fitting and opportune that as we ponder the possibilities of “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  we deliberate carefully on the opportunities and alternatives to the current world order. We must look to our past to understand our present  and we must plan our future by analysing our present and applying the lessons of our past. It is in that connection that I feel compelled to conclude by inviting careful consideration of the words of the late United States President Woodrow Wilson  who asserted America’s historical leadership and commitment to international democracy and freedom in these words: “We shall fight ... for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations”."
"100",4139,"LIE",69,2014,"This has been an enormously difficult year for the United Nations. As the Secretary-General has pointed out  we are living in an era of an unprecedented level of crises. I echo his call for leaders to unite. At a time when the world seems to be breaking apart  it will serve us well to remember what unites us. We need to look no further than the Charter of the United Nations. The preamble to the Charter offers a vision that seems so difficult for us to fulfil: we are determined “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”.The Organization was created  above all  to prevent war. Indeed  it offers a system of collective security that is far more effective than anything that existed before. Yet the events over the past year have shaken its very foundations. At times  it seems that we revert to the habits of past centuries. We are disturbed by the acts of aggression perpetrated against Ukraine and by the illegal annexation of parts of its territory. Those acts are massive violations of the principles on which the Organization was built. They are a major setback for collective security. As a small country situated in the heart of Europe and a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  we hope that we can quickly re-establish a consensus on security issues in Europe.The events in Ukraine also underline the need to ensure the enforcement of international law — if necessary in a court of law. We now  for the first time since the Nuremberg Tribunal  have a historic opportunity to criminalize the most serious forms of the illegal use of force in an international court. Jurisdiction for the crime of aggression before the International Criminal Court (ICC) will be possible as early as 2017. The ratification process of the Kampala amendments is well on track. I welcome the ratifications by Latvia  Poland and Spain just a few days ago. We look forward to achieving that goal  together with the largest possible number of partners.For truly collective work to maintain peace and security  we need a collective sense of purpose. That is difficult to reconcile with the notion that a single Security Council member is able to block the action required if the United Nations is to fulfil its purposes and principles — with no questions asked  no matter how large the majority in favour of such action. We of course accept the veto as a reality of the Charter of the United Nations  as we did when we joined the Organization. However  we do not accept that the veto should be used in a manner that contradicts the very purposes of the United Nations. We have witnessed too many such instances in recent times. Change is urgently needed. We therefore look for a commitment from States serving on the Council not to vote against any action necessary to prevent or to end crimes of atrocity. We look to the permanent members in particular to give a clear commitment to that end.We are determined to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person. The United Nations  created as a family of nations  has the rights and dignity of the individual at the centre of its efforts. This is a human rights organization. The General Assembly  which we have entrusted to your leadership  Mr. President  during this session  is also a human rights organ. The world is changing at an ever-increasing speed. That requires our continued commitment to human rights.The right to privacy  for example  is at risk of being lost. The digital era makes large-scale data collection both easy to undertake and difficult to detect. Discrimination on the basis of gender  sexual orientation  nationality  ethnicity  religion  disability or any other status remains rampant in many parts of the world.The rise of religious intolerance is especially alarming. Conflicts around the world are characterized by the persecution of religious minorities  be they Shiites  Yazidis  Christians or others. We are witnessing a disturbing rise in anti-Semitism. The Assembly should respond by uniting in a call against the persecution of any religious minority anywhere in the world. I am also particularly alarmed about the rising violence against human rights defenders  such as the recent murder of Samira Saleh Al-Nuaimi  an Iraqi activist and the mother of three children. There is nothing Islamic about that barbaric act  committed by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).In times of conflict  international humanitarian law represents our hope for at least the bare minimum of human dignity. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 are among not only the greatest achievements in the history of international law but also the most successful treaties with their near-universal acceptance. Nevertheless  their core principles — proportionality in the use of force and a distinction between civilians and combatants — are violated on a daily basis. The recent conflict in Gaza was carried out at the expense of civilians by both parties to the conflict. The civilian population of Syria has been experiencing enormous suffering for more than three years now. Atrocities have been committed against men  women and children by the regime and  increasingly  by other actors. Humanitarian access has been blocked systematically as a method of warfare. Civilians in both Syria and Iraq are left at the mercy of the sickening brutality of ISIL. There has rarely been a time when civilians were at greater risk of being victimized by atrocity crimes. We are not living up to our promise  made some 10 years ago  to collectively ensure protection against such crimes.We are determined to reaffirm faith in the equal rights of men and women. Equality between men and women was one of the first things on the minds of the drafters of the Charter of the United Nations just after the end of the Second World War. Is that not striking? We have certainly achieved much since then. The 1995 Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women in particular was a watershed moment in that regard. The commemoration of its twentieth anniversary is the best opportunity for us to show that we remain fully committed to its outcome.Next year we will also reflect on our progress on the women  peace and security agenda 15 years after it was established under Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). Clearly  we will have to find new strategies to protect women in conflict from violence  in particular sexual violence. We are still far from using the full potential of women as agents of peace. Men have always been in charge of making war and of making peace: their record is not impressive. Women must obtain their seat at the negotiating table  where they belong and where they are needed. I am grateful to the Secretary-General for taking the lead on that issue and for increasingly appointing women to high positions in the areas of mediation and conflict resolution.We are determined to establish conditions in which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained. Justice and the rule of law are areas where we have made important progress. International courts and other judicial mechanisms are gaining greater acceptance. Calls for accountability are becoming louder. We can look to an impressive body of international jurisprudence.That is particularly true for the International Criminal Court (ICC). Victims of the gravest crimes around the world place their hopes for justice in the Rome Statute system. That is a great responsibility for the Court  an institution which frequently works in a politically charged context. Those who support the Court must make that support felt. For that reason  I have initiated an informal network of ministers who support the ICC personally as politicians. Our network has grown to 26 members. We stand ready to defend the Court and the integrity of the Rome Statute  because we know that political attacks against the ICC are easy to launch but difficult to respond to.The fact that the Court is an entirely independent institution that follows the law  not politics  does not make the headlines. The fact that the ICC has jurisdiction in some places but not in others is easily misrepresented as selectivity. Our goal therefore remains for the Rome Statute to become a universal treaty. Victims of crimes in Syria  Iraq  Palestine and North Korea — to cite just a few examples — deserve their day in court as much as those in other parts of the world.We are determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. There could not be a greater challenge for the Assembly than setting the global agenda for sustainable development for the next generation. And there could not be a greater opportunity to show its relevance.The Millennium Development Goals were a success. They set the agenda for more than a decade  galvanized tremendous efforts for development and led to very significant advances. However  they were also a learning process. We must be honest about where we have failed and do better where we can. Three areas stand out in that respect.First  accountable institutions  access to justice and an effective fight against corruption are key ingredients of development that are truly transformative and sustainable. That is amply illustrated by national experiences around the world and is well documented by research. Placing the rule of law at the heart of the sustainable development goal agenda will therefore be one key of success.Secondly  there is no sustainable development without the full empowerment of women. Nothing short of full equality between men and women will be required for development to be sustainable. We must therefore fully recognize the empowerment of women as a key ingredient of sustainable development.Thirdly  the implementation of international commitments cannot be left to chance. We need accountability. We must establish a system to monitor progress in the implementation of the post-2015 agenda  carried out by us as States but involving all stakeholders. The High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development is the best anchor for such a system.Our work to date in developing the post-2015 agenda gives us cause to be optimistic. Let us make the best use of the upcoming months to produce an agenda of which we can be truly proud as a platform for collective action and an inspiration for future generations."
"101",4186,"LKA",69,2014,"I congratulate you  Sir  on being elected as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We wish you success and assure you of our fullest cooperation.The theme for this session “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  is timely. The world has undergone many changes since the United Nations was created  and since the year 2000 much progress has been made towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. However  there are multiple challenges that still remain to be addressed. The moral and practical importance of creating an equitable world and a sustainable planet for this purpose cannot be ignored.The Commonwealth  of which Sri Lanka is the current Chair-in-Office  accounts for more than one-quarter of the United Nations membership. In November 2013 the Commonwealth Heads of Government agreed in Colombo to contribute to the process of evolving the new post-2015 global development agenda. They have endorsed the central focus on the eradication of extreme poverty and reaffirmed commitments to sustainable development. The perspective on the post-2015 development agenda is based on shared values and principles contained in the Commonwealth Charter and individual experiences. The Commonwealth leaders encourage others to approach the forthcoming intergovernmental negotiations in a collaborative spirit to achieve a balanced post-2015 development agenda.Reducing inequality within and among countries is one of the most transformative goals that have been proposed by the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. We hope that this goal will serve to enhance the voice and representation of developing countries in decision-making. The post-2015 agenda must focus on implementation. Achieving the sustainable development goals would be impossible without the political will and dedication of all countries. It must be ensured that the failure of the developed countries to fulfil Millennium Goal 8 that called for a global partnership for development is not repeated. In determining goals  countries must not be deprived of policy space to set their own domestic priorities. Instead of asking countries to reprioritize domestic spending  the focus should be on a strengthened partnership between developed and developing countries  backed by sincere commitment. That is essential for countries in the South to access financial resources and technology that are essential for capacity building. It is vital that we also address structural obstacles and political barriers that prevented the realization of the Millennium Development Goals  such as unfair trade and investment rules. Creating a supportive international economic environment  enhanced investment flows  including from multilateral development banks  and an open multilateral trading regime  are important.The role of the United Nations in advancing international peace  security and prosperity is crucial in the contemporary world. However  in order to gain the confidence and good will of the international community as a whole  one of the essential requirements is consistency of standards across the board without any perception of selectivity or discrimination. It is in this context that the current functioning of the system needs examination in order to enhance its credibility. Human rights are used as a tool to implement motivated agendas with no understanding or appreciation of the complexity of issues in the countries concerned. Human rights should be recognized by all as a moral and ethical concept rather than as a political tool. External intervention without adequate consideration of the structures in a society and cultural traditions of countries where such intervention takes place  inevitably results in destabilization  which is very much in evidence today in most parts of the world.Post-conflict Sri Lanka has also become an unfortunate victim of ill-conceived agendas of some in the Human Rights Council who pay scant regard to the substantial progress achieved by Sri Lanka in reconstruction  rehabilitation and reconciliation within a short span of five years. There is an obvious lack of balance and proportion in the manner in which my country is being targeted today  disregarding these significant achievements. That is in sharp contrast to the approach to deeply disturbing situations involving humanitarian emergencies elsewhere.If multilateralism is to remain relevant and effective  reform of the institutions concerned is essential. To be successful this process must involve de-politicization of the United Nations systems and mechanisms and they must stop being a hostage to different forms of funding. United Nations bodies must find ways to work with governments through dialogue  greater understanding of situations  and cooperation  including assistance to strengthen national institutions. This approach  instead of strong-arm tactics  must form the heart of multilateral diplomacy in the search for sustainable solutions to global challenges.The seventieth year of the United Nations in 2015 also marks the tenth anniversary of the 2005 World Summit where global leaders agreed to support early reform of the Security Council. Concrete results in this regard should be achieved next year at least.Climate change is one of the defining challenges of our times. A robust global response needs to be arrived at in 2015 on the basis of equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.The increase in violence in the Middle East is deeply distressing. I reiterate Sri Lanka’s support for the early realization of a sovereign  independent  viable and united State of Palestine  existing within secure and recognized borders  side by side and at peace with Israel. We look forward to welcoming Palestine as a full Member of the United Nations at the earliest. The international community must assist Palestine to rebuild the country.Sri Lanka firmly believes in the need for solidarity between Asia and Africa. Admiring the efforts of the people of Africa to achieve socioeconomic development  Sri Lanka has begun a process of reaching out to countries in Africa for an exchange of knowledge and expertise in areas of importance. The international community must strongly support the early eradication of deadly diseases in Africa.Sri Lanka remains committed to supporting all multilateral efforts to counter terrorism deriving from extreme ideologies impacting on people across national frontiers. Terrorism continues to be a grave threat to the security and stability of nations throughout the globe. Having suffered at the hands of terrorism  Sri Lanka knows well its drastic impact on societies  communities and institutions founded on democratic traditions and ideals. The international community must strengthen multilateral action on terrorism  including the early finalization and adoption of the United Nations Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism.Sri Lanka is also committed to supporting all multilateral efforts to counter terrorism financing  piracy and all forms of international organized crime. We wish to recall our appeal to the international community not to support terrorist groups in any way  either directly or indirectly. Sri Lanka expresses its concern regarding bombings that kill innocent civilians and even unborn children in many situations across the world.Sri Lanka expresses deep concern regarding unilateral economic measures against developing countries and is a consistent supporter of the call of the General Assembly for an end to the unjust economic  commercial and financial embargo against Cuba. Unilateral sanctions of this nature  which impact on a country’s innocent population  are unethical.Despite being affected by terrorism  Sri Lanka has achieved most Millennium Development Goals. Sri Lanka has succeeded in being ranked ahead of all South Asian countries in the 2013 Human Development Index. Through the adoption of the National Development Strategy — the Mahinda Chinthana  or Vision for the Future — the Government of Sri Lanka embarked on an inclusive and rural-centric development programme. That involved bold policy decisions connected with macroeconomic management  revitalization of agriculture  infrastructure development  including roads and expressways  ports and airports  irrigation and water distribution  a strong telecommunication network and well-distributed urban and township development resulting in 7.8 per cent gross domestic product growth this year and per capita income of $3 280 in 2013. It is also a matter of deep satisfaction to recognize that the economic and political empowerment of the people of the North  supported by massive investment in infrastructure and livelihoods  have also contributed to this growth.Sri Lanka’s information technology literacy grew steadily from a mere 3 per cent in 2005 to almost 50 per cent in 2014. Sri Lanka’s Nenasala Programme was awarded the prestigious Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Award as the best rural information technologyaccess programme in the world.With the end of terrorism in May 2009  in keeping with my responsibilities to my people  large-scale post-conflict reconstruction  rehabilitation and resettlement initiatives were implemented in the north in a relatively short period of four years. Most importantly  democratic structures in the North have been re-established. Elections to the Northern Provincial Council were held in September 2013 after a lapse of 28 years  upholding the democratic tradition in Sri Lanka which has been consistently protected since 1931  the year we attained universal franchise.I recall in this context the visit to Sri Lanka of the Secretary-General just a week after the conclusion of the conflict  when a new era of peace had dawned. That was a manifestation of the close cooperation between my country and the United Nations and our commitment to working together in the future.We continue on a deeply satisfying and transformative journey in the interests of all the people of Sri Lanka. In carrying out this task we work in accordance with our traditional foreign policy of friendship towards all and enmity towards none. We hope that the international community will reciprocate and assist Sri Lanka in its domestic process of reconciliation and economic development without exerting undue pressure on us.We have gained inspiration from the words of Gautama the Buddha who said that the purpose of all human endeavour must be to construct order out of chaos and harmony out of strife. True to these words of wisdom  the Government of Sri Lanka remains committed to its objective of pursuing the processes of reconciliation and nation building  undeterred by ill-motivated criticism."
"102",4228,"LSO",69,2014,"I would first like to congratulate President Kutesa on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. His distinguished career as a diplomat and leader assures us of a successful session. I would also like to commend his predecessor  Ambassador John Ashe  for his remarkable leadership during the previous session.Over the 69 years of its existence  the United Nations has witnessed several changes in the configuration of international relations. Some were traumatic  others benign. The survival of the Organization through all those tribulations testifies to its resilience and the enduring validity of its mission. Today it is still confronted by serious challenges. The continuous eruption of armed conflicts throughout the world  terrorism  climate change  disease and the lingering effects of the economic and financial crises are only some of the challenges that have remained in the foreground of international relations and preoccupied the international community.From the Horn of Africa and across the Sahel region  to the Republic of Kenya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  the continent of Africa is facing a rise in terrorism. The Nigeria-based Boko Haram  Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and Al-Shabaab in Somalia continue to pose serious threats to the peace and security of the continent. The emergence in the Middle East and elsewhere of new extremist groups and terrorist entities  such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria  has not only further compounded the problem but is a stark reminder that we must act collectively to discharge the moral responsibility resting on us to ensure that people everywhere enjoy the right to peace  development and the sanctity of life.The use of military force alone as a strategy for combating terrorism is no longer a panacea for that menace. Terrorism requires a holistic approach that addresses the root causes of the scourge. The resolution of international disputes based on dialogue  justice and the equality of all States must be at the heart of that strategy if it is to succeed.The recurring bloody conflict between Israel and Palestine continues to weigh heavily on the conscience of all humankind. Recent developments in that region have cast a shadow on the future that had seemed to hold out the promise of a negotiated settlement. Unprecedented impunity and the disproportionate use of force by the parties involved call into question our very claim to be a civilization. Turning United Nations shelters into combat zones and killing the innocent children  men and women who take refuge in them is a shameful act that must be condemned in the strongest terms possible. Lesotho endorses the recent Human Rights Council resolution S-21/1  demanding that the massacres of innocent Palestinian civilians be investigated by an independent commission and that those responsible be held accountable.Let us not forget that in 2005 we unanimously adopted the principle of the responsibility to protect (see resolution 60/1  paragraphs 138-140) in order to safeguard innocent civilians from war crimes  genocide  mass atrocities and ethnic cleansing. Indeed  the Security Council has reaffirmed that principle in several conflicts around the world and in some instances has authorized military intervention.Unfortunately  in the case of the slaughter of thousands of Palestinian civilians  the Council has shied away from invoking the principle of responsibility to protect. Instead  it took comfort in issuing a presidential statement that glaringly fails to reiterate accountability for the war crimes committed. Civilians in Gaza deserve the protection that Israelis in Tel Aviv are afforded under international law. We call on Israel — as we have always done in the past — to fully comply with its obligations under the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. That is the only plausible route to lasting peace.The world has long come to terms with the dangers to humanity posed by the possession of weapons of mass destruction. That is why Lesotho continues to advocate for total abolition and destruction of all nuclear weapons. Those weapons have no place in modern-day civilized society  hence the call for a convention to ban them all. While working towards that goal  we must emphasize that full compliance with the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is critical. By the same token  we call for the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons  in accordance with the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.It is unacceptable that the United Nations of today still reflects the 1945 architecture of the world as seen by the victors of the Second World War. The reform of the United Nations  including the Security Council  can no longer be delayed. A reformed  transparent and more democratic United Nations is necessary for preserving international peace and security and for confronting the challenges of development. All Member States need to garner the necessary political will to advance the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform. Let us make the sixth-ninth session one for decisive action.The representatives who gathered in San Francisco to finalize the Charter of the United Nations dreamed of a world of peace and shared prosperity. They renounced a vision of a world in which some unilaterally imposed economic sanctions and financial blockades against others  or one in which peoples were denied their right to self-determination or were subjected to occupation  as is the case in Cuba  Palestine and Western Sahara. We have to remove those dark spots on the history of our time by allowing the letter and spirit of the Charter to guide our actions.The theme chosen for our general debate  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  could not be more relevant at the current international juncture. The road towards the achievement of all the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been rough  with some countries reporting relative success in reducing poverty and hunger  markedly increasing school enrolment  reducing child mortality  improving maternal health and combating HIV/AIDS. However  the challenges remain most daunting in the least developed countries  landlocked developing countries  some small island developing States and countries in  or emerging from  conflict.For our part  in Lesotho we have made some progress towards achieving at least two of the eight MDGs  namely  universal primary education  and promoting gender equality and empowering women. We still face a long and uphill journey to reach a life of dignity for all. HIV and AIDS still pose a serious threat to us. The untold miseries brought about by that scourge are known to all of us. Africa is more vulnerable to that threat because of the worsening poverty and unemployment. Sadly  new  incurable pandemics such as Ebola have emerged  wreaking havoc in sister African countries and overwhelming their health systems. The world must mobilize resources and energy to help the affected countries of West Africa fight the pandemic and to abolish it in the long term.Our quest to pursue a sustainable future for all must never wane as we step into the new era and embark on the road map of the post-2015 development agenda. We need to formulate a new set of universal sustainable development goals that are concise and strong with regard to the means of implementation. It is important to emphasize national ownership and respect for national conditions in each Member State and to take advantage of global diversity so that we can attain our development aspirations.As we continue with intergovernmental discussions leading up to the Third International Conference on Financing for Development  which will be held in Addis Ababa in July 2015  we must be guided by the spirit of frankness and mutual understanding  without the acrimony that often characterizes our intergovernmental deliberations. It is equally important to emphasize that advancing the rule of law at the national and international levels is essential for realizing sustainable development  eradicating poverty and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms. Lesotho is by no means an exception in that regard.A few days ago  the Climate Summit provided us with an opportunity once again to reaffirm our collective resolve to implement measures that can significantly address climate change. We disagreed for far too long  until we were confronted by the glaring and compelling scientific evidence that the link between global warming and human activity is indisputable. Sadly  catastrophes have begun to hit  mostly affecting the poorest and most vulnerable countries.My country is one of the worst affected by climate change. In recent years  Lesotho has faced unsettling development challenges due to the effects of climate change. The effects of increasing extreme weather patterns such as early frost  droughts  desertification and degradation of arable land compound the challenges that we are already facing. Livelihoods of societies are stifled  and economies and ways of life are negatively affected.While we appreciate that there are resources aimed at helping developing countries to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change  we are concerned that such funds are difficult to access. The global climate-finance architecture is complex  with variable structures of governance and modalities. Some finance is channelled through multilateral agencies  sometimes even outside the funding mechanisms of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  and some flows through bilateral development- assistance institutions  thereby making coordination very difficult. Lesotho calls on the international community and our development partners to simplify the accessibility of funds earmarked for climate change initiatives if we are to make an impact on the ground.In conclusion  let me point out that the regime of the Charter of the United Nations has so far done its part in preventing a third world war  thereby fulfilling one of the dreams of the architects of our beloved Organization. The continued success and the relevance of the United Nations in the new millennium will depend  in large measure  on its capacity for self-renewal in readiness to meet modern-day challenges.We  the United Nations  should continue to be the voice of the voiceless and the best hope for all humankind. Now is the time for leaders everywhere to join the race for transformative action that can drive peace  democracy  respect for human rights and the rule of law  human dignity  economic competitiveness and sustainable prosperity for all. Lesotho will and must continue to be a persistent and resilient part of that initiative."
"103",4254,"LTU",69,2014,"Today  numerous outbreaks of armed conflict and instability in the world make us look back at the main cause and purpose of the United Nations — to keep peace throughout the world. As States Members of the United Nations  we are all committed to that core principle. With the danger of terrorism and war spreading throughout the world  now is the right time to stop to reconsider our actions and to do everything possible to bring an end to fighting  be it in our own homelands  neighbouring countries or in our regions.The nature of global security has changed dramatically. We are seeing non-State actors  religious fundamentalists and rebellious criminal gangs terrorizing the globe and threatening the safety of peaceful people. Sadly  some States are standing behind the terrorists and have become hubs and shelters for growing violence. But nowadays  the means of terror and war go far beyond the traditional concept of a lethal fight. Whatever the means of terror used  its goal is the same — to frighten people  countries and  in some cases  the entire world.Peaceful and sustainable coexistence among countries and within societies is not a self-evident fact. It requires collective efforts and determination and national commitment to a sustainable future that belongs to all of us. Our common task as a group of nations is to maintain undivided security — we must use all our efforts to stop the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and Al-Qaida in order to maintain peace and security in Middle East  but the same efforts need also to be deployed to manage the geopolitical challenges in Eastern Europe.It is our duty to support the peace  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The threat arising in Ukraine must be urgently tackled. The United Nations  together with NATO  the European Union and other regional organizations and their member States  should fulfil their duty and do everything possible to stop armed conflicts  prevent the redrawing of the borders of sovereign States and stop the creation of one frozen conflict after another.We have to act together as a group of neighbours  a group of States concerned about the future of the international community  the future of the world in which we live. It is very important to stop a conflict at its inception and to suppress the breeding grounds of terrorism  wherever they may be found. But most important  we should never abandon the values that hold us together  namely  respect for human rights and the fundamental principles of State sovereignty and  naturally  territorial unity.When it comes to the protection of those fundamental common principles  the international community should be united and react responsively to any breach thereof. The fact that we continue to protect core values was well illustrated by the voting results on resolution 68/262  on the armed conflict in Ukraine. One hundred States supported Ukraine and condemned the occupation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. An overwhelming majority of the Assembly will never recognize such illegal acts of aggression.If we fail and if violence  aggression and terror win  we are at risk of waking up on the threshold of a situation where everyone fights everyone else and chaos prevails. Everything we have worked for  everything we have created — the world we live in — will be destroyed. Silent consent to such brutal forms of aggression should not be the international community’s answer.To avoid an even grimmer future  I invite the Assembly to keep deception  lies  manipulation and ignorance from entering our territories and violating our values. We have to go back to the core principle of the United Nations  that is  to keep peace throughout the world. Our undivided attention to maintain undivided security should be our main focus."
"104",4298,"LUX",69,2014,"It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly for the first time  and I must say that I do so with great emotion. Commitment  solidarity and responsibility are the three key words that have guided and will continue to guide my country’s action at the United Nations. As a founding Member of the United Nations  Luxembourg has based its foreign policy on active participation in multilateral cooperation. That multilateralism is founded on respect for international law and cooperation among sovereign and equal States in order to work collectively for peace  development and respect for human rights.For us  the United Nations is at the heart of multilateralism. We are committed to making the United Nations as effective as possible so that we can solve together  in solidarity  issues that far exceed our capacities as States. We have the responsibility to overcome such issues for the sake of future generations. Commitment  solidarity and responsibility also define the approach that should guide our response to the challenges facing us on the eve of 2015.With the President’s choice of the theme for this sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly  he calls upon us to develop and deliver on a transformative post-2015 development agenda and to ensure its effective implementation. That post-2015 development agenda must be bold and ambitious if we are to live up to our collective responsibility to eradicate poverty and to promote sustainable development. It must build on the Millennium Development Goals and must go further. The agenda must be holistic  action-oriented and universally applicable. It must benefit both developing and developed countries. It must be based on human rights. It must give the social sectors  health care and education all the importance that they deserve. The issues of governance  justice  peace and security  as well as the protection of the environment  sustainable consumption and production patterns and sustained economic growth  must be part of that agenda.Luxembourg supports and welcomes the important work accomplished by the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. Its report (A/67/941  annex) and the set of goals that it proposes are a useful basis for the negotiations that will culminate in a year’s time in the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda and a new model for sustainable development that reconciles “the ambitions of humanity and the needs of the planet”  as Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said.Aware of its international responsibilities  my country has a long-standing commitment to development  motivated by a desire for solidarity with the poorest people. Since 2000  Luxembourg has been one of the five industrialized countries to allocate at least 0.7 per cent of its gross national income to development cooperation. In 2009  our development assistance reached the level of 1 per cent of gross national income. The Government is committed to maintaining that high level despite a difficult budgetary position  which is no easier in our country than in others. Such aid can offer upcoming generations prospects and opportunities for the future and  we should realize  can therefore  I hope  prevent certain conflicts.The fight against climate change is an integral part of any global partnership for development. In that context  allow me to welcome the holding of the climate summit on Tuesday. That summit clearly achieved the dual objective set by the Secretary-General: to demonstrate the essential political will to reach a global agreement in 2015 and to act as a catalyst for concrete action on the ground so as to reduce emissions and to increase resilience. In the second half of 2015  my country will assume the presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU). We will spare no effort to ensure that we reach an international climate agreement at the 2015 Paris climate summit that is applicable to all countries  with the objective of keeping global warming below 2°C.With its European Union partners  Luxembourg has made binding commitments to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and to mitigate the effects of climate change. Before the upcoming meetings  in accordance with the timetable that we agreed in Warsaw  the European Union will present additional contributions to rise to the challenge.We are also making commitments at the national level. I would mention  for example  our support for the statement on carbon pricing  presented at the Climate Summit  as well as the new contribution of €5 million to the Green Climate Fund  which we announced at the summit  without any reduction in our official development assistance.There will be no development without security and no security without development. And both development and security also depend on respect for human rights and the rule of law. We all know Kofi Annan’s saying. Luxembourg has made it the guiding principle of its action in the Security Council since 1 January 2013 by devoting its undivided attention to the root causes of conflict  their humanitarian and economic impact and human rights  in particular the rights of children affected by conflict.To illustrate that approach  I will talk about the conflict in Syria. That conflict  which has been raging for three and a half years  now shocks the human conscience. There are more than 191 000 people dead. There are 10.8 million Syrians in need of urgent humanitarian assistance  over half of whom are children. More than 4.5 million Syrians are trapped by the fighting in areas that are difficult for humanitarian actors to access. More than 3 million Syrians have been forced to leave their country  over 1 million of whom are refugees in Lebanon. Those figures rarely make the headlines now. However  behind those figures  there is so much suffering and so many shattered lives.That cannot continue. We must put an end to the indiscriminate attacks against civilians  schools and hospitals  the bombardment with barrel bombs  the denial of humanitarian assistance and the use of famine as a weapon of war. At the initiative of Australia  Jordan and Luxembourg  the Security Council unanimously adopted two resolutions on access for humanitarian aid to Syria (Security Council resolutions 2139 (2014) and 2165 (2014)). I strongly hope that those resolutions will have a real and decisive impact on the ground.However  humanitarian action cannot be a substitute for political action. The lasting settlement of the Syrian conflict requires a political solution — a political transition that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people  in accordance with the Geneva communiqué of June 2012 (S/2012/522  annex).Today  we cannot procrastinate in the face of the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by terrorist groups  in particular the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. That group is neither a State nor Islamic. It defiles Islam and seeks only to spread its terror regime and to destabilize Syria  Iraq and the entire region.My country fully supports the measures adopted against individuals and entities associated with Al-Qaida to cut off their channels of financing  to prevent radicalization and to stem the flow of foreign terrorist fighters. We do so pursuant to Security Council resolution 2178 (2014)  which we adopted the day before yesterday at the Security Council summit presided over by the United States President  Barack Obama  in which I had the honour to particiapte.Beyond the fight against terrorism  we must tackle the root causes of the grave crisis in Iraq. In that context  we welcome the formation of the new Iraqi Government of national unity  under the leadership of Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi. We encourage him to follow an inclusive approach that respects all ethnic and religious segments of Iraqi society and that is responsive to the needs and aspirations of all. The Iraqi people must regain trust in their country’s democratic institutions.For the third time in six years  this summer we witnessed bloody fighting in the Gaza Strip. The cycle of violence must stop. The actions that fuel hatred and discord must cease. Israelis and Palestinians must finally be able to live in peace  security and dignity. The two-State solution  the peaceful coexistence of two democratic States — Israel and Palestine — within secure and recognized borders  remains the only possible way forward in that regard. A political solution must be sought as soon as possible to avoid extremists from all sides from prevailing and to avoid measures being taken that would make the two-State solution impossible. With its partners in the European Union  Luxembourg is ready to contribute to a global and sustainable solution.The time allotted to me does not suffice to do justice to the manifold crises that we face today. I would  however  like to say that they all bring one duty to light  namely  to protect civilians. That duty is at the heart of the mandates entrusted to the stabilization and peacekeeping missions of the United Nations and regional organizations like the African Union in Mali  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Somalia  South Sudan and now in the Central African Republic. On the African continent  our credibility and our responsibility to protect are at stake. Twenty years after the Rwandan genocide  indifference is no longer an option.I should now like to say a word about my own continent  Europe. The crisis in Ukraine has step-by-step turned into a conflict — one that  unfortunately  shows that the times when we thought peace on the European continent had become self-evident are over. The conflict has already cost the lives of more than 3 000 people. It must end and it must end now. Dialogue and diplomacy are of the essence.From Syria to the Central African Republic  from Iraq to South Sudan  the list of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed on a daily basis becomes longer each day. The perpetrators of those crimes  of grave violations and abuses of human rights  of violations of international law and international humanitarian law must be held accountable before justice for their acts. The fight against impunity must cease to be an abstract objective and become a tangible reality. The International Criminal Court has an important role to play in that regard.With regard to grave violations of international law and war crimes  I would like to draw attention to the violations and atrocities committed against children. Children are often the first victims of armed conflicts: they are killed and maimed  they are abducted and recruited  and they are sexually abused. They are deprived of their right to education and health care. They are cruelly denied access to humanitarian assistance.As Chair of the Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict  Luxembourg is working in a determined way to strengthen and to implement fully the children and armed conflict agenda. We will continue to do so beyond our tenure on the Security Council. Children embody the hope and future of every society. All together  we must do everything we can to safeguard that hope and future from the horrors of war. We cannot acquiesce to sacrificing future generations.The fight against sexual violence calls for the same commitment. Sexual violence in conflict spares no one. It affects adults and children  women and men. We must resolutely tackle this scourge.The prevention of conflict is a core purpose of the Organization. Spotting early-warning signs of a conflict is of crucial importance if we want to take the most effective measures at the right time  and if we want to prevent a situation from escalating into open conflict. We know that most conflicts are preceded by a significant deterioration in the human rights situation. It is on that basis that the Secretary-General launched the Rights Up Front initiative — rights before anything else. Its aim is to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to act as a smoke detector before it is too late to prevent the fire from spreading or  to continue that metaphor  to alert the fire brigade before the fire gets out of control. Luxembourg welcomes that initiative. It is a forceful reminder of our collective obligation to protect and promote human rights. It rightly places the protection of human rights at the centre of the efforts undertaken by the United Nations to prevent conflicts.Tackling the root causes of conflict  poverty  discrimination  the absence of the rule of law  to name just those few  is part of the same preventive approach.However  I also have to recall that in certain countries  being different is not always accepted. The rights of minorities must be respected. It is unacceptable that to this day  a religion or a sexual orientation  for example  prevents a person from living freely in certain societies. Diversity is the richness of our society  it is not a crime.As I address the Assembly  there are numerous threats to peace and security we must face that require a holistic response. I have already addressed terrorism and our common struggle to eradicate that scourge. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction constitutes another clear threat. The joint plan of action agreed in Geneva on 24 November 2013 was an important milestone towards solving the Iranian nuclear issue. I would like to reiterate Luxembourg’s full support for the efforts of the EU 3+3 to arrive at a comprehensive settlement that restores trust in the exclusively peaceful purpose of the Iranian nuclear programme. I urge Iran to engage fully and in good faith in order to allow those discussions to lead to the expected results as soon as possible.In Africa as well as in Latin America  small arms are the real weapons of mass destruction. The devastating consequences of the unregulated arms trade are well documented. I am therefore particularly pleased that the Arms Trade Treaty  which was adopted last year by a very broad majority of the Assembly  will enter into force on 25 December. Luxembourg was honoured to be among the first States to sign and ratify it. It is our fervent hope that we will be able to achieve our shared goal of making it a universal treaty.Also along the lines of threats to international peace and security  allow me to touch upon the serious crisis caused by the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. This is not a simple humanitarian emergency  far from it. It is a multidimensional crisis that threatens the institutions  societies and economies of the three countries affected by the outbreak — and the region as a whole. It calls for mobilization at every level: national  regional and global. The Secretary-General fully appreciates the magnitude of the challenge  and we wholeheartedly support the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response. There is no time to lose. Beyond the contributions we have already made to the World Health Organization  the World Food Programme  Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross  we stand ready to do more  in close consultation with the countries of West Africa  many of which are Luxembourg’s partners  as well as with the United Nations and civil society organizations on the ground.In conclusion  allow me to return to the three keywords that guide our efforts: commitment  solidarity  responsibility. It was our eagerness to work for strong and effective multilateralism and our resolve to serve the United Nations that motivated Luxembourg to aspire to become a non-permanent member of the Security Council  for the first time in its history  for the 2013-2014 term. During the past 20 months  Luxembourg has worked hard every day to show that it is up to that responsibility. It has worked hard to show that it is worthy of the honour bestowed upon it by the General Assembly when it was elected to the Security Council. We carry out our mandate in the name of all States Members of the United Nations  and we are quite aware of that. Today  I would like to take this opportunity to heartily thank the Assembly  in my personal capacity and in the name of the Government of Luxembourg  for the trust placed in us. The Aseembly can rest assured that we will continue to serve the United Nations to uphold our common values  the values of humankind."
"105",4324,"LVA",69,2014,"As we enter a crucial session of the General Assembly  we will define our post-2015 direction. Our way ahead must be based on the triangle of security  development and human rights. If one of those elements is not present  the other two will fail.This year  we commemorated the grim anniversaries of the First and Second World Wars. Both wars began in Europe  but quickly spread throughout the world  destroying the lives of countless millions. The League of Nations and the United Nations were built on the ashes of those wars.Today again  global security and peace are challenged by forces willing to rewrite the history and rules of the international order. The aggression of Russia against Ukraine has defied the basic principles of the United Nations  uprooting the very foundation of the international system. It has grabbed part of a sovereign European country  using previously unseen tactics of warfare and immense propaganda against its neighbour. It enabled the tragic shooting down of a civilian airplane. It has shown that agreements and commitments do not matter  and it wantonly ignores and manipulates international opinion. Those actions cannot be qualified otherwise than as a threat to global peace and security. The world  including the General Assembly  has supported Ukraine’s territorial integrity. The illegal annexation of Crimea and Sebastopol by Russia has been condemned and will not be recognized by the international community.Russia has a vital role to play in security and stability in Europe and should be part of the solution — not part of the problem. Latvia hopes that the ceasefire agreed to on 5 September will be implemented in a sustainable manner. Latvia therefore calls on Russia to immediately withdraw its armed forces from Ukrainian territory and stop sending weapons and mercenaries to the terrorist groups. We call upon Russia to return to respecting its international commitments and upholding international law.Seventy-five years ago  the decay of the international system proved fatal to the Baltic States. Two totalitarian regimes — one under Hitler and the other under Stalin — divided Europe  and we lost our freedom for 50 long years. Twenty-five years ago  more than 2 million people joined hands and formed a human chain across Estonia  Latvia and Lithuania. The Baltic way clearly illustrated the people’s demand for freedom and restoration of their statehood. The Baltic people made their choice. The Ukrainian people have the same right to choose their own democratic path  human rights and fundamental freedoms.Latvia supports the complementarity of efforts among international organizations at both the global and regional levels to use all instruments at their disposal to prevent the emergence of a frozen conflict in the eastern region of Ukraine; to help and support Ukraine; to uphold agreements and commitments and demand their fulfilment by all parties  including Russia; to maintain unity and reject attempts to divide Ukraine by reviving spheres of influence and establishing hidden support to terrorists as part of the new norms of Europe.There is no alternative to an international order based on the rule of law  democracy and respect for human rights and providing the foundation for long-term peace and security. The resolution of the protracted conflicts in Transnistria  Abkhazia  South Ossetia and Nagorno Karabakh should remain high on the international agenda.In addition  the security situation in the wider Middle East is very fragile. A solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is paramount in order to establish lasting stability in the region. Following the escalation of violence in recent months  the international community  including Latvia  has helped to address the emergency humanitarian needs of the people of Gaza. We hope that the current ceasefire will be fully respected by both sides. However  only an agreement on a two-State solution  achieved through direct negotiations  will accomplish those goals.We welcome the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons and related materials. While easing the continuing human suffering of Syrians is the immediate goal  the international community must continue political efforts to find a solution to that horrific conflict. Those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria must be held accountable by the International Criminal Court.The limited ability of the Security Council to address the urgent situations in Syria and Ukraine in a timely manner underlines the need to move forward with reform of the Council. Latvia supports the expansion of the Security Council in both categories of membership. At the same time  the French initiative  aimed at restricting the use of the veto  merits our joint attention.The completion of the International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan this year will be an important step towards assumption by the people of full responsibility for peace and stability in the country. Despite all the challenges  the legacy of the mission is clear. Peace and security have been strengthened  including greater respect for human rights and greater opportunities for the Afghan people than ever before.The recent presidential elections clearly showed the will of the Afghan people to live in a peaceful and democratic society. The people of Afghanistan will not be abandoned after 2014. International support to Afghanistan  including security protection  will be continued. I am convinced that cooperation and confidence-building between Afghanistan and its neighbours  including in Central Asia  will be key to long-term security solutions in the region.The growing negative impact of violent extremist ideologies in Syria  Iraq and other countries is alarming. Militant fighters of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) have exploited instability in those countries and now pose a threat to ethnic and religious communities. In that context  Latvia joined the United States in coordinated efforts by the international community to counter ISIS. We strongly welcome the adoption of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) on foreign fighters. Latvia has already begun to prepare measures to prevent the recruitment of and support to foreign fighters.Latvia is concerned about the safety of journalists during political unrest and conflict. All imprisoned journalists must be released. Freedom of the media and free access to information  including online  are essential components of any democracy.Armed conflicts in Africa have an impact upon stability and the sustainable development of the people. Latvia takes part in peace and security operations in Mali and the Central African Republic in order to contribute to conflict settlement and to improve the security situation in those regions. Latvia is ready to commit itself to strengthening United Nations global peacekeeping.Latvia welcomes the ongoing dialogue between the E3+3 countries and Iran  which aims to negotiate a comprehensive agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme. The parties involved  in particular Iran  must make every effort to use the extended time frame to find a solution. We must work towards revitalizing the global disarmament and non-proliferation agenda. The success of the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons depends on re-establishing trust and a common purpose among the States parties. Latvia was one of the first States to sign and to ratify the Arms Trade Treaty. We urge all United Nations Members to do the same.Peace and security are both enablers of sustainable development and objectives in their own right. Without peaceful societies  we cannot achieve sustainable development. Each country has its own responsibility for achieving that goal. Our societies need honest and accountable Governments that protect them from violence and crime and ensure fundamental freedoms and sustainable economic growth.Fourteen years ago  we  the States Members of the United Nations  made a historic commitment to eradicating extreme poverty and to improving the health and welfare of the world’s people within 15 years. The new development agenda should go further. We must address global challenges  such as conflicts  terrorism  inequalities  the absence of the rule of law  climate change and natural disasters. The social  economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability should be addressed in a balanced way.I thank the Secretary-General for his personal engagement in bringing together representatives of Governments  business  industry  finance and civil society to discuss climate change this week. Latvia supports the initiatives of the Secretary-General. The post-2015 agenda must be consistent with all human rights and be underpinned by the rule of law. It should address inequalities and discrimination  including by means of the advancement of information and communications technology. Those are key enablers for all spheres of development. Gender equality is essential to shaping respectful and equal relationships in society. Those values are important for Latvia. As an aspiring member of the Human Rights Council for the term 2015-2017  we will continue to promote such values globally. Last but not least  the post-2015 agenda should be built on strong accountability mechanisms and a strengthened global partnership. That requires the active engagement of Governments  civil society  the private sector and the United Nation system.In the first half of 2015  Latvia will assume the presidency of the Council of the European Union. Europe needs the world as much as the world needs Europe. That is why the Latvian presidency will focus on strengthening the European Union’s involvement globally. We will actively work to promote Europe’s cooperation with its neighbours and with the countries of Central Asia. I affirm my country’s commitment to actively engaging in efforts to shape our common future."
"106",4371,"MAR",69,2014,"His Majesty King Mohammed VI  Sovereign of the Kingdom of Morocco  asked me to convey to the Assembly his greetings. He also asked me to deliver the following statement  prepared for the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly:“It gives me great pleasure to take part in the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly  for which President Kutesa has suggested ‘Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda’ as the central theme. That is a very relevant choice  which is fully in line with our Organization’s priorities  especially as it encompasses economic  social  environmental  security and political considerations. I have therefore decided to devote my address to that important topic  knowing that the Kingdom of Morocco’s standpoint regarding other items on the session’s agenda will be presented during the General Assembly committee meetings or at the ministerial meetings  which will be held on the sidelines of the General Assembly.“Achieving sustainable development is one of the pressing challenges facing humankind. It is particularly important  in that respect  to strike a balance between the requirements for economic and social progress and the protection of the environment  on the one hand  and the safeguard of the rights of future generations  on the other. Aware of those critical challenges  we have sought to set up a distinctive development model rooted in the culture and in the specific national values of the Moroccan people — a model which also takes into account the need for positive interaction with international principles and objectives in that area.“Morocco has therefore managed to develop a pioneering national initiative for human development  together with ambitious programmes in the field of renewable energy — especially solar and wind power generation — which are a key component of sustainable development. However  I am not here today to discuss my country’s experience or our achievements. I am here to make an appeal for developing countries to be treated fairly  especially in Africa  and for the development issue to be addressed objectively.“As the Assembly knows  sustainable development is not something that can be achieved through decisions and ready-made prescriptions  nor is there a single model in that area. Indeed  every country follows a path of its own  taking into consideration its historical development  cultural heritage  human and natural resources  specific political circumstances  as well as its economic choices and the obstacles and challenges facing it. What applies to the West should not be used as the sole criterion for determining the efficiency of other development models; nor should one make comparisons between countries  however similar their circumstances may be  even when those countries belong to the same geographical area.“As a result  the first call I should like to make from the rostrum regards the need to respect the characteristic values and principles of every country as it builds its own development model. That is particularly true for the developing countries that are still suffering from the consequences of colonialism. Colonialism caused severe damage to colonized countries. For many years  it hindered their development process  exploited their resources  as well as the energies of their sons and daughters  brought about profound change in the customs and cultures of the peoples concerned and sowed the seeds not only of division between members of the same community  but also of conflict and discord between neighbouring countries. Although many years have passed  the colonizers bear a historical responsibility for the tough — and at times tragic — circumstances experienced by some countries of the South  particularly in Africa. Today  given the adverse consequences suffered  former colonial Powers have no right to ask the countries of the South to introduce radical change rapidly  on the basis of a frame of reference with which they are unfamiliar  be it in terms of their cultures  their principles or their values. It is as if no development were possible other than through a single model: that of the West.“I now turn to the second appeal I would like to make to the international community. We need more realism and wisdom when dealing with those countries. There should also be greater consideration for their circumstances and the paths they choose to achieve democracy and development. Some Western countries — which asked for no one’s authorization to colonize countries of the South — instead of currently providing the necessary assistance to the people of those countries  continue to impose on them harsh conditions  thereby hampering their ability to make progress. Furthermore  all Western countries and their affiliated institutions do is give lessons  and  at best  a few pieces of advice. As for support  it is very limited and is always conditional. What is more  they ask the countries of the South to achieve stability and development within a very short time frame and according to imposed conditions  without taking into account those countries’ development processes or their specific national circumstances.“There can be no stability without development. By the same token  development cannot be achieved without stability. Both hinge on respect for the sovereignty of States  their territorial integrity  culture and customs  as well as on a dignified life for all their citizens. Moreover  the rating and classification of those countries  according to current standards  raises a number of questions. The rating process has not only shown its limitations  but also how far removed it is from the reality of the countries of the South and how incapable it is of giving an objective account of the level of human development achieved by those countries. As inadequate as it unfortunately is  the aid granted is often based on those ratings and their quasi-impossible conditions. We therefore appeal for intangible capital to be one of the primary criteria for measuring wealth and rating nations. As clearly shown by World Bank studies  intangible capital takes into consideration a series of factors related to the living conditions of the population  such as security  stability  human resources  institutional development and the quality of life and of the environment  all of which are elements that have a major impact on crafting public policies. The evolution of those countries should not be governed by any rating or classification; instead  it should be viewed as a historical process based on the positive experiences of each country. Similarly  every country’s characteristics should be respected.“The reference to the negative impact of colonialism does not mean we wish to put any party in the dock of a law court. It is simply an earnest appeal for justice for the countries of the South and a reconsideration of the way they are dealt with and supported in their gradual march towards progress. In my address in Abidjan  in February  I insisted on the fact that Africa did not need humanitarian aid as much as it needed mutually beneficial partnerships. I also stressed that Africa needed to turn the page on its past and overcome its political  economic and social problems — that it needed to rely on its own resources to achieve its development. That is exactly what Morocco has sought to accomplish through a series of important agreements signed with a number of African sister nations. In that respect  I wish to mention in particular the strategic agreement signed with Gabon for the production of fertilizers for African markets in order to contribute to development and food security on the African continent  which is home to a staggering 60 per cent of the world’s unexploited land. That is an outstanding model of South-South cooperation that reflects our capacity as African countries to develop the continent by relying on ourselves and investing in the natural resources of our countries.“As the Assembly knows  achieving development does not hinge merely on a set of projects and on funding; nor is underdevelopment synonymous with the countries of the South. Indeed  the problem has nothing to do with Africans’ attributes and skills. Africans have proved their ability to produce and create whenever the right conditions are met  and whenever they are able to rid themselves of the oppressive legacy of colonialism. Similarly  development in Africa has little to do with the nature of the land or the weather  as harsh as they may be in some parts of the continent. It is more closely related to a deep-rooted economic dependence  a lack of support and funding and the absence of a sustainable development model. As a result  providing aid to those countries is not an option or an act of generosity so much as it is a necessity and a duty. What States really need  though  is fruitful cooperation  grounded in mutual respect  so that they can create the right conditions  in theory and in practice  to move on to the next stage of the process of promoting both democracy and development  without any interference by others in their internal affairs. In return  they must commit to good governance.“The world stands at a crossroads today. Either the international community supports developing countries in their quest to achieve progress and ensure security and stability  or we shall all face the consequences of more conflicts and greater fanaticism  violence and terrorism — all of which feed on feelings of injustice and exclusion — and no part of the world will be safe. As people grow more acutely aware of the cross-border threats posed by the lack of sustainable and human development  and as we realize that ours is ultimately a common destiny  I am sure that eventually there will be a global awakening regarding the need to work for a more secure  equitable and humane world.”"
"107",4395,"MCO",69,2014,"The lofty aspirations of the Millennium Development Goals guided our first steps into the era of the second millennium and enabled us to realize  in part  the priorities that we hold so dear. With this shared experience  which is extraordinary in terms of what it has made concrete  and aware of the new challenges that have been imposed on us over the past 15 years  we now have clear lessons on which to build the future we want. We now know that peace and development are inseparable.The future to which we all aspire can be understood on three levels  based on the three pillars of sustainable development that command our attention equally. The work we have started on defining the post-2015 era  by its very nature and given the challenges it poses  merits committed efforts by the entire international community  which have already been undertaken. Indeed  it requires a contribution by all States and all parts of society  including the private sector  academia  philanthropy and  obviously  non-governmental organizations. It also must be  as a matter of ethics but also to ensure its viability  inclusive  participatory and based on good governance.Those are therefore the bases for defining the post-2015 era  despite the glaring paradoxes and the many obstacles we unfortunately face. At a time when the world is highly interdependent  its communications technology performing as never before and its riches abundant  inequalities continue to grow  and too many of us remain marginalized and live in unacceptable conditions.Inevitable climate change  which is recognized as the greatest challenge of our time  will decide the fate of our planet and darkens our future prospects by already threatening our present. Conflicts persist  while others are born  and terrorist acts lead to a range of problems that challenge traditional defence strategies. This past year  existing and new conflicts have escalated towards an unacceptable level. The Monegasque authorities can only reiterate their commitment to the values of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and join the efforts of those who seek a peaceful and political settlement of the crisis in Ukraine.The use of chemical weapons in Syria and the assault on civilian targets in Syria  Iraq  the Gaza Strip  South Sudan  Mali  the Central African Republic and Nigeria have spread horror and are barbarous practices. They are intolerable. That is why the Government of Monaco condemned acts of abject violence by supporting the adoption of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) last week  which establishes a new legislative and policy framework to coordinate international efforts to fight against the phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters.The Principality shares the grief of the French  British and American peoples following the heinous killings of their nationals who were held hostage. In memory of those victims  His Serene Highness Prince Albert II asked that flags at administrative buildings and Monegasque public institutions be flown at half-mast. Those who commit such heinous crimes in the name of a religion they blaspheme annihilate the foundation of our society by violating the rule of law and respect for the standards that we have developed together. They use communications networks and social networks  which we might think would be used to spread harmony and unity  to spread hatred and chaos. We have reason to wonder about their motivations and the reasons that make their appeal so convincing.The response is obviously rooted in exclusion and the marginalization of people who have not yet benefited from what we call progress. It often involves young people without prospects for the future. Therefore  it is our responsibility to design inclusive social integration policies  promoting education and youth employment. Young people have never formed such a large proportion of the world population — particularly in developing countries. They must be an integral part of the decision-making process in order to allow them to realize their human potential.We welcome  in that respect  the “Rights Up Front” initiative of the Secretary-General  launched in November 2013  whose primary objective is to make sure that human rights violations do not become mass crimes and to enable the Organization to act more quickly by placing people at the heart of its strategies and operational activities.On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the 2005 Summit  and especially as memories of sinister genocides come to mind  we must do a better job of promoting the responsibility to protect. That is the primary responsibility of every State  as we know  but we also need to be able to help States for which capacity-building is difficult. Prevention remains a fundamental aspect of our Organization’s work. In that regard  the involvement of regional and subregional organizations is essential to the effective implementation of the protection of populations from genocide  war crimes and crimes against humanity. The promotion and protection of human rights must be at the heart of our policies. Prince Al-Hussein has our full confidence. With his experience and his unwavering commitment to peace and the rule of law  he can be the right United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for our times.Another aspect also deserves emphasis — the delivery of humanitarian assistance in conflict zones. It must not depend on the political context. The politicization of humanitarian assistance should be a priority item for discussion at the global summit in 2016.In the light of the increasing number and persistence of crisis areas  caused both by conflicts and by natural disasters  whose frequency we now associate with the rate of climate change  we must take into consideration the needs of over 50 million people. The magnitude of those needs justifies the new partnerships that have been formed around organizations  local partners and the private sector and individuals.The unprecedented threat of the Ebola virus in West Africa is testing our ability to respond in an effective and coordinated manner. We support the establishment by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response to counter the large-scale threat Ebola poses to international peace and security. In that regard  I wish to acknowledge the commitment of the Principality of Monaco  which is effectively contributing to that unprecedented struggle  together with the World Health Organization and the International Committee of the Red Cross. We share in the grief of the victims and that of their families. We are aware that the families’ tragedies are compounded and their pain is made unbearable by the fact that they are unable to take care of their loved ones or provide proper funerals for those who die.In these difficult times  we need to establish a new post-2015 sustainable development paradigm. Universal  inclusive  ambitious and concrete  it must accommodate the pressures of a growing global population and the urbanization that comes with it. It requires us to adapt our methods of production  consumption and transport and to opt for clean technologies. We need to define the nature of the world we want to live in  with and for our children. As I mentioned earlier  it is vital that the needs of the most vulnerable be duly taken into consideration and that economic independence for women and young people be ensured. It is time for women to realize the transformation that the Secretary-General announced by breaking through the glass ceiling that for too long has kept them from achieving their potential. Without the full contribution of those who constitute 50 per cent of humankind  sustainable development will not be achieved.The year 2015 will also mark the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)  on women  peace and security. We reiterate our call to end impunity for crimes related to sexual and gender-based violence against women  as well as all the abuse women suffer.The undeniable success of the Climate Summit should be measured not only by the commitments announced  but also by the broad participation of the private sector  foundations and civil society and by the sense of ownership expressed by all the stakeholders concerned. The Summit therefore succeeded in catalysing society as a whole  thus ensuring that the political momentum will be maintained in Lima and Paris. As the issue of climate change cannot be separated from the question of the oceans  the Prince’s Government will continue to defend an objective of sustainable development dedicated to healthy and productive oceans for all. The Assembly may rest assured that Monaco will engage in discussions  which will begin in January  and we will continue  in both national and international policies  to act as a responsible and unifying partner."
"108",4420,"MDA",69,2014,"It is with great honour and a special sense of responsibility that I address the General Assembly today. My country has chosen a European future  and that will make Moldova stronger and more prosperous. This year we have signed  ratified and are already provisionally applying the new Association Agreement with the European Union (EU). The Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area  an integral part of the Agreement  opens new perspectives for Moldova’s access to European and world markets. That will make our economy more competitive  stimulate economic growth and integrate Moldova into the mainstream of global trade  with all its benefits. The implementation of the Agreement is our short-term priority. Our next goal is to apply for full-fledged European Union membership.Now that we have defined our path and established the framework for our further development  we must focus on systemic improvements. Strengthening democracy and the rule of law  improving our investment climate  developing rural areas and enhancing our energy security — those are the objectives to be accomplished in the near term.We are grateful to all our development partners for supporting Moldova’s modernization agenda. They have helped us to strengthen good governance  promote justice and domestic reforms  support the modernization of the agricultural sector and implement energy interconnection projects. Just recently  a new pipeline was completed that connects Moldova via Romania to the European Union’s gas network. That and other strategic projects connecting Moldova to Europe  including power grids  roads and bridges  will be implemented in coming years.Our ambitions  however  will not be fulfilled if the benefits of closer association with Europe are not fully shared by our citizens living in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova. Just like the rest of Moldova  people and businesses in that region want the development opportunities that association with the European Union clearly brings. The Free Trade Area with the European Union will increase production and exports. Jobs  salaries  pensions and benefits will therefore rise significantly.Visa-free travel by all Moldovan citizens to the European Union as of April this year  along with new trade and investment opportunities  are just a few real examples that demonstrate that Moldova is on the right track. However  alongside the conflict-settlement process  we will continue focusing on building confidence among citizens  the private sector and all other stakeholders of the entire country.Against that background  the resolution of the Transnistrian conflict and the reintegration of Moldova is another top priority for my Government. In our effort to resolve the conflict  our goal remains the same: to achieve a political settlement based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova  with a special political status for its Transnistrian region. All of our international partners involved in the settlement process agree on those basic principles. And today more than ever before  we need their united and proactive support to help solve that protracted conflict.Discussions on the political and security aspects of the conflict should be resumed without delay within the 5+2 format for negotiations. There are other outstanding issues that create additional obstacles to the settlement process. The continuing presence of Russia’s military forces and ammunition in the Transnistrian region  contrary to international commitments and the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova  is one of those issues. We expect the Russian Federation to finalize the withdrawal process without any further delay. We also believe that bringing the peacekeeping arrangement in line with international standards by transforming the current operation into a civilian multinational mission would provide a positive impulse to the settlement process.Moldova seeks to develop fruitful relations with all its partners in the East and West. In the past five years  my Government has promoted a coherent and predictable foreign-policy agenda  which is based on our European integration choice. Regrettably  Moldova currently faces unjustified trade restrictions on the export of its agricultural products to the Russian Federation. Trade relations in the whole Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region have been affected  but we nevertheless hope that a continuing dialogue with our Russian partners  based on the World Trade Organization and CIS rules  will contribute to the resumption of normal trade relations with Russia. We are grateful for the assistance of our trading partners  particularly the European Union  for supporting the Government in its efforts to lessen the immediate impact of the restrictions on Moldovan farmers and producers. Full liberalization of the European Union market for Moldovan wines and agriculture products  as well as a new free-trade-area agreement with Turkey  will contribute to market diversification in the future. We will continue to explore new trade partnerships in the world.We have followed with great concern the developments in Ukraine. A year ago  no one could have imagined that Ukraine would be plunged into such a painful and profound crisis. At the very same time  Ukraine  like Moldova  has also established a path for European integration  and that offers a real chance for improving people’s well-being while facilitating reconciliation  reconstruction and security. We believe that the sovereign choices of all members of the international community should be respected.We recall the need for all members of the international community to respect the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. Like many other countries  we will never recognize the annexation of Crimea. We also encourage any involvement by the international community  in particular by the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  in actions to stabilize the situation on the ground. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of our neighbour Ukraine must be respected.Today we face new and increasingly complex security challenges. Moldova is doing its part to address those challenges by making its own contribution to the promotion of peace  security and stability in Europe and in the international arena. We have taken concrete measures to support United Nations  EU and NATO efforts in that regard. This year  Moldova deployed 41 soldiers to the NATO-led International Security Force in Kosovo operation  under the authority of the Security Council  and contributed to the EU Training Mission in Mali. That represents a new level of commitment by Moldova to promoting international peace  security and stability.Moldova is committed to protecting human rights at the national and international levels. We have made steady progress in the implementation of the relevant United Nations special procedures and recommendations. Moldova has volunteered to present a mid-term evaluation report on the Universal Periodic Review recommendations in the area of human rights by October.At the same time  a national strategic programme for demographic security until 2025 is currently being implemented in the Republic of Moldova. We want to become a regional centre of excellence for the best policies in reproductive health and to contribute to the objectives of the United Nations Population Fund.Moldova also shares its best practices on migration and development with other countries in the eastern and southern neighbourhoods of the European Union. We are actively engaged in the work of the Global Forum on Migration and Development.Moldova also supports the advancement of a free and independent society  including freedom of expression on the Internet and in other media. For the past three years  my country has had one of the best and most affordable Internet connections in the world. More than 65 per cent of Moldovans access the Internet at least once a day. That is why I am proud that Moldova was accepted this year as a member of the Freedom Online Coalition. Moldova’s membership of the Open Government Partnership is another important contribution to the commitments made with regard to the Millennium Development Goals. We are currently implementing a comprehensive e-governance agenda. Today  Moldova is one of the first countries of the region  and among the first 16 countries in the world  to have an open data portal. Just recently  in August  the Government of Moldova approved the new Open Data Policy in line with the Open Data Charter of the Group of Eight.We have taken one step forward in agreeing on a new post-2015 development agenda and a new set of sustainable development goals. My country will continue to contribute to that effort by hosting  in February 2015  an event at which we will consolidate and endorse the conclusions of the high-level dialogue on capacity-building and sustainable development.Let me reiterate Moldova’s commitment to promoting the core principles of the Organization and to assisting the international community in delivering on the greatest promise of the United Nations — peace  justice  security and development for the people of the world."
"109",4463,"MDG",69,2014,"Like my predecessors  I would like first of all  on behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Madagascar and on my own behalf  to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. He is a credit to his country  the Republic of Uganda  and the pride of the entire African continent.Allow me next to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his commitment to peace and development in the world and for his actions at the head of the Organization. I also take this opportunity to solemnly reiterate to him and his team the gratitude of the Malagasy people for the special attention and resources that the United Nations system has mobilized in order to contribute to the culmination of the process that brought the crisis in Madagascar to an end. We are also grateful for the important role that the United Nations continues to play in working together with Madagascar and its people. I naturally extend that gratitude to the entire international community  whose support has been decisive in the peaceful resolution of the Malagasy crisis.By choosing to return to constitutional order through the ballot box  the Malagasy people confirmed its commitment to stability and security. In so doing  it is participating in building peace and security in the region and thus throughout the world. Strengthened by those values   we have made national reconciliation  which is the foundation of social cohesion  the cornerstone of our development policy. We are convinced that without social peace  there can be no development and vice versa. We have already taken important steps in that process and we intend to move forward. But our resources are not yet commensurate with the scale of the tasks that remain. That is why Madagascar wishes to gain access to the Peacebuilding Fund  which is being made available through the Organization.Five per cent of the world’s biodiversity is found in Madagascar. It behoves us  therefore  to take responsibility for preserving that resource and ensure better management for future generations. Upon taking office in January 2014  I declared war on traffickers in rosewood and all those who engage in the illegal trade in protected species. The establishment of good forest governance was the first act in a whole series of concrete measures to that end. An interdepartmental committee for restructuring the sector was established. The authorities are working hard to achieve the policy of zero tolerance against trafficking of all kinds related to natural resources and protected species. However  despite our efforts  we must note that traffickers still manage to evade surveillance measures  due to the lack of resources at our disposal to deal with traffickers  who have ample resources.Madagascar’s strategic location in the Indian Ocean  at the crossroads of various maritime routes that are vital to global trade  means that we must work to preserve our fishing areas and our marine reserves. The risk of piracy  terrorism and trafficking of all kinds is high. Measures must be taken in that regard  within the framework of an active international cooperation to protect the area.The Malagasy Government has also increased the extent of protected areas to cover more than 10 per cent of the country  or at least 6 million hectares  with the cooperation of its partners. A large-scale reforestation project aimed at sustaining the long-term production of timber and firewood is included in the Government’s agenda in terms of commitments. We are also strengthening our legal arsenal by ratifying several multilateral environmental agreements  including the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Minamata Convention on Mercury.After over five years of political crisis  including sanctions and suspension measures of all kinds  it is clear that the majority of the Millennium Development Goals will not be met in Madagascar by 2015. However  the country is committed to focusing its development efforts on its population and has initiated major projects in some key sectors such as education  health  employment  security  access to new information and communication technologies and infrastructure. Thus  school enrolment for girls has far exceeded that for boys. Similarly  nearly 500 000 children and youth have been enrolled in educational and socio-professional institutions for the year 2014-2015. Over 100 basic health centres have been opened in recent months across the country. In the framework of our fight against malaria  Madagascar’s efforts have been recognized at the continental level  including our achievement of 95 per cent of households owning at least one mosquito net impregnated with long-lasting insecticide and our intra-residential spraying campaign  which are the most important tools for the prevention of malaria. Moreover  Madagascar has demonstrated its solidarity with the world’s fight against Ebola.In terms of security  tangible results have been achieved in recent months with Operation First Strike  which is aimed at eradicating the massive theft of zebus in the south and west of the country. Finally  Madagascar’s renewed adherence to the African Growth and Opportunity Act should give new impetus to the country’s economic and social fabric with the massive job creation.When it comes to climate change  the stakes are high for Madagascar  since our economy is based on developing sectors that are sensitive to climate change. The numbers are telling in that regard — 75 per cent of Madagascar’s population lives in rural areas  of which 4 million are in vulnerable areas  and 28 per cent of the rural population are food-insecure. Although we do not have the means to adequately mitigate the negative effects of climate change on the country’s socio-economic activities  we have nevertheless taken action. Measures range from the development of legal frameworks such as the national policy for the fight against climate change  the national strategy for a clean development mechanism and the establishment of an energy transition policy that is based on the use of renewable energy. We are also implementing a national action plan for adaptation and have created various structures to coordinate activities related to climate change.We fully support the theme of this session  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”. Our country is committed to creating the conditions to establish a prosperous and modern nation. That is the whole purpose of the actions we have undertaken on the basis of the principles of transparency  good governance  respect for the rights of others  democracy and human rights. With this vision of a modern and prosperous nation  our main objective is to allow the people to emerge from their precarious situation. To do so  we have decided on a policy of improving production to increase productivity and developing a reliable agricultural sector. That will help the country to achieve food self-sufficiency and allow Madagascar to become the backbone of food security in the Indian Ocean.We have also decided to undertake major public infrastructure works  including structural work  the construction of highways and roads  works of art  building construction and embellishment  dams  water purification and improvements to the energy sector. In that regard  we are developing an innovative partnership for finance structuring and partnerships. In addition to conventional financing from traditional donors  we have used a public-private partnership system. It is aimed at establishing a mutually beneficial partnership for Malagasy and investors alike. Particular attention is being paid to promoting youth employment  and companies that fulfil the required conditions will benefit from strong incentives and tax benefits.Another priority area is tourism. Tourist facilities are still limited in number and need to be developed. Madagascar today is the ideal destination for such investment  in particular in growth sectors. We must meet the challenges of growth and ensure that Government actions have a positive and tangible impact on the lives of the 22 million Malagasy through inclusive and sustainable development. Madagascar has adopted a transformative agenda for its future. The drafting of the national development plan reflects the determination of the State to establish the principles of good governance and economic recovery. The Plan is to be a central frame of reference for private-sector engagement with civil society  decentralized local authorities and technical and financial partners. The implementation of the national development plan will promote and ensure the security of domestic and foreign investment and the updating of regulatory frameworks relating thereto.Before concluding  I reiterate my country’s determination to renew and strengthen its commitments to the various activities of the United Nations  in addition to our effective participation in the regular work of the committees and in various conferences held under the auspices of the Organization. We point out the deployment every year of contingents from our national gendarmerie  national police and the Malagasy penitentiary administration within various United Nations peacekeeping operations in Africa. Most recently  the Government of Madagascar has responded positively to the United Nations request for 140 officers in formed police units to serve in the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic.Madagascar also continues to advocate for equitable representation in the Security Council so that countries directly involved in crises and conflicts can fully take part in the process of the adoption of resolutions.Madagascar aspires to move rapidly from its current status to that of a growing country with an expanding  vibrant middle class and that will see its income quickly rise to match those of emerging countries. I know that this is possible and achievable. I have made a moral contract with the people of Madagascar to optimize our use of our natural and human resources to enable our country to achieve a solid place within the globalization network  to rebuild itself and to contribute in a positive way to the resolution of the major problems of this world."
"110",4503,"MDV",69,2014,"Allow me to extend warm greetings to the President of the General Assembly upon the assumption of his duties at the sixty-ninth session. I also recognize the exemplary stewardship of Mr. John Ashe  the outgoing President  and record our appreciation of the Secretary-General’s stewardship of the Organization during these difficult times.What defines the great communities of our times is their ability to overcome the unexpected and to persevere and adapt to changing realities — from the daunting effects of climate change and the ever-pressing challenges of poverty and want to the uncontrollable spread of disease. Communities everywhere are striving to overcome such obstacles. When communities are subject to challenges that are impossible to bear  they think beyond the realm of possibilities and begin seeking different answers to the same questions. That is when they nurture their ability to bounce back from adversity  shock and threats. The ultimate goal of fostering resilience is to overcome the unexpected. Sustainability is about managing  but resilience is about thriving.For the past eight decades  the Maldives has been on a journey to consolidate democracy. Last year  our democracy faced unprecedented challenges. Yet we were able to overcome those hurdles entirely by peaceful means. Even though it sometimes felt as if we were quite alone in this fight  we are proud of what we have achieved. We take pride in the fact that our democracy is home-grown. Our systems are organic. Our young institutions  as in the older democracies of the world  are gradually settling into patterns and traditions that are unique to our string of islands and in harmony with our Islamic heritage and our traditions.Our experience clearly shows that holding elections or introducing a multiparty political system does not instil democratic values in a society. Democracy cannot be traced in the pages of laws. The only way for a new home-grown democracy to achieve resilience is to shift the way its people think. A transformation in their normative framework is necessary. Democratic values need to find a place in the hearts and minds of the people. The Government of President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom and the people of the Maldives are determined to achieve a modern and authentic Maldivian democratic State.Promoting and protecting human rights is central to Maldivian democracy. Our Constitution is very clear on what those rights entail. Yet with every right come responsibilities. It has been a daunting challenge to make human rights a way of life. That is why the Maldives advocates cultivating a culture of respect for human rights. Policies need to be rights-based. People need to be rights-minded.People must lie at the heart of every decision we make and every policy we adopt. The ultimate goal of every action must be to improve the lives of our people. The Government of President Yameen has embarked on an ambitious programme aimed at realizing the full potential of our young people. The goal of the Government is to create opportunities that would help to unleash their creativity. Young people are the future of any country  and  without the full realization of their productive capabilities  countries cannot prosper.A few days ago  the United Nations marked an important milestone: the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development. Today  we celebrate the achievement of many of the goals of that Programme — most notably  low maternal and infant mortality rates  gender parity in school enrolment and equal pay for equal work.Next year  we will celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of another important document  the Beijing Platform for Action. It is a fact  not mere speculation  that for building resilience and building sustainable societies  women’s contributions are a necessity. Women have achieved remarkable progress since the Beijing Platform. Maldivian women are among the most emancipated in South Asia  with no structural barriers to education  employment or mobility. Still  much remains to be achieved. Just as an example  I ask the Assembly to think back over the past week of general debate. How many women spoke at this rostrum? How many countries can claim to have achieved parity between men and women at decision-making levels? In the Maldives  we are committed to empowering women and have adopted a zero-tolerance policy towards violence against women.The resilience of our people in overcoming adversity in their lives is rooted in their ability to rise up from the fear of want and the fear of need. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were framed to do just that. The MDGs committed to a new partnership to reduce extreme poverty  halt the spread of HIV/AIDS and provide primary education for all. The MDGs set benchmarks and gave targets to Governments. Those targets enabled them to plan effectively. The MDGs  though remarkable for their time  were limited and are now reaching their expiry date. We ardently believe that the post-2015 development agenda must be inclusive  transparent and people-centred. The new development agenda should succeed where the MDGs failed.At times  the violence  bloodshed  conflict and upheaval that we witness on a daily basis seem unbearable. In July 2014  we watched with grief the horrendous attack on the Gaza Strip — another in a countless cycle of aggression and brutality. Our hearts bleed for the countless children who lost their lives  the mothers who lost their children  the nation and the State of Palestine  which lost countless citizens. After the global outcry and the outpouring of condemnation  the guns have stopped firing and the bombs have stopped dropping. The world seems to have moved on to the next crisis. The news cycles have found their next headline.Yet  we recall here again  the siege is not over. The blockade has not ended. Gaza has been destroyed and its development set back several years. Palestinians are still being denied their right to a sovereign nation of their own  to their own lands and to the fruits of their labour. Palestinian children are being denied a right to determine their own destiny. Are we willing to let that continue? We must do more to help realize the dream of peace in the Middle East and a two-State solution. We must resume peace talks with a clear goal and an endpoint in mind.The biggest challenge to our development and our way of life is ignorance  violence  subjugation and perpetual poverty. Misinformed yet talented young people can easily be lured into fanaticism  radicalism and extremism. Islam’s identity as a religion that supports innovation  knowledge and scholarship is slowly eroding away. The golden era of our religion is almost forgotten.Today  the world has a choice to make. Should we allow extremists to shape our future? Or should we take decisive actions to defeat the extremist ideologies? Our answer to those questions will define the way in which we deal with the so-called Islamic State and other terrorist groups. Not only are those groups un-Islamic  they are anti-Islamic. They are terrorist organizations  not religious groups. Islam  our great religion of peace  compassion and tolerance  is being hijacked by radical and extremist elements to perpetuate hatred and violence. We  the Government and the people of Maldives  condemn in the strongest terms those groups  their ideologies and their activities. We join our fellow Muslims around the world in saying “not in my name”.The unique challenges faced by small island developing States are well known. Climate change exacerbates those challenges. We remain hopeful that a legally binding treaty will be agreed to next year in Paris. The Maldives stands ready to do all it can to make this hope a reality  for the sake of our children and our nation.Earlier this month  we agreed to a new highway for development  the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway. We commend Samoa for its leadership in setting the vision for a new gateway for small States. To make the partnership enduring  we need the small island developing States to make their voices heard and to be united in the quest. The Maldives has therefore been inspired to take the lead in forming the Alliance of Small Island States for the purpose of facing the challenges of post-2015 and beyond. We call on others to join us in that journey.Nine days ago  on 21 September  we celebrated 49 years of membership in the United Nations. The Maldives joined the United Nations a mere 58 days after independence — we were the smallest Member State at the time. As we look forward to celebrating 50 years of membership in 2015  the Maldives is happy to note that the United Nations has served us well. We joined the United Nations in 1965  amid questions over the viability of small States. In the past 49 years  the Maldives has taken the lead in showing the world that small States are not only viable  but in fact valuable in finding common solutions to common problems. Today  at the United Nations  we continue to prove that small States can also lead and that it is not size but smart ideas that make a nation’s destiny."
"111",4550,"MEX",69,2014,"As President of Mexico  it is a high honour for me to participate for the first time in the General Assembly  the greatest symbol of unity among nations. Mexico reiterates its historic commitment to this universal forum of dialogue  understanding and cooperation.Today’s world could not be imagined without the United Nations. Its positive influence is present in all realms of our lives. The United Nations leads international efforts to combat hunger  pandemics and climate change. It protects our children  preserves the heritage of humanity and furthers the empowerment and advancement of women around the world. The Organization promotes trade and global communications as well as human rights and peace. Thanks to the United Nations  our world today enjoys greater freedom and is more democratic and more developed.While United Nations contributions to the well-being of millions of people are indeed evident  one cannot deny the multiple challenges that every country of this planet is currently facing. From the global economy that has yet to recover its dynamism  to regional conflicts that have caused deaths and forced migration flows  to climate change triggering natural disasters  it is clear that the world requires multilateral responses that are more effective.In a world with so many phenomena that transcend borders  international cooperation is more necessary than ever  and the sum of global efforts can emerge only here  at the United Nations. Today  our planet needs to be able to depend on a more effective  efficient  transparent and representative United Nations  where all societies of the world have greater participation. The United Nations must dare to change in order to improve.In Mexico  we firmly believe that the United Nations has all the attributes to be more daring and self-renewing. With respect to institutional change  we need a Security Council that evolves and that truly represents the new world equilibrium. It is important to reform the Council in order to strengthen its transparency  accountability and capacity to respond. We believe that the Security Council should be enlarged by increasing the number of non-permanent members  creating long-term seats with the possibility of immediate re-election as part of a more equitable geographic representation. The world needs a United Nations where the permanent members of the Council refrain from using the veto in cases of grave violations of international humanitarian law.With respect to international peace and security  the United Nations must prevent arms trafficking and the serious damage that phenomenon inflicts on our societies. The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) provides the tools to tackle that growing challenge. However  it is vital that all nations sign the Treaty  but  more importantly  that they all ratify it. The First Conference of States Parties to the ATT will be held in Mexico next year. It will be a great opportunity for all nations to work together to prevent arms from hurting children or vulnerable populations around the world.Similarly  we must also strengthen the United Nations so that it can effectively combat terrorism  which is lacerating societies around the world.In addition  we need the United Nations to renew its efforts for nuclear disarmament. We must prevent more countries or non-State actors from having that destructive capacity within reach  and we must also demand that those already possessing it reduce and eliminate those weapons. If we want a safer world  no one should use or threaten to use nuclear power to endanger the very survival of humankind itself.I turn next to the development agenda. Now that the date is approaching to define the sustainable development goals  we need a United Nations with a broader vision of the well-being of individuals. The post-2015 development agenda must recognize that poverty is not determined solely by insufficient income  but also by other scarcities that impede personal and collective development. Furthermore  we believe that economic and social inclusion should be one of the principal points of the agenda.The United Nations also needs to update its commitment to the rights of girls  boys and adolescents  addressing new challenges that threaten their integrity. We should initiate at the global level a joint initiative to combat harassment at school  or psychological harassment like bullying  and at the same time reinforce basic values among our children and youths. If we want for tomorrow a world in which adults have a spirit of empathy  understanding  friendship among peoples  peace and universal brotherhood  we need to act now with more determination so that our children and our youth can live free from any type of abuse.In short  to address the challenges of the twenty-first century  we need a United Nations with a new institutional design  with a renewed commitment to peace and security and  above all  with a comprehensive and inclusive development agenda. Change is never easy  especially when it demands a fundamental transformation and when it depends on the cooperation of multiple actors  each with its own priorities and interests. In the specific case of the United Nations  multiple voices acknowledge the need for a change  but at the same time  they believe it is an impossible task because no one is willing to yield.In Mexico  we experienced a similar situation. There were those who agreed on the urgency of promoting structural changes domestically  but they also warned that it would not be possible to carry them out. Those voices affirmed that political groups and the Government of the republic would not be able to reach agreement in order to transform our nation. Nonetheless  Mexico demonstrated that it is possible to build with a plurality  that diversity is a strength when there is a readiness for a constructive dialogue. The foundation for achieving that was the Pact for Mexico  an agreement under which all essential commitments were formed in order to advance a broad agenda for reforms in a various spheres of the national life.Building upon that innovative political instrument  Mexicans dared to improve the quality of education  to make the job market more flexible and to combat monopolies and anti-competitive practices. We dared to modernize the telecommunications sector  to increase the opportunities for credit and reduce its cost  to strengthen public finances and to initiate a new model for energy development for the country. We Mexicans held dialogues and agreed on the renewal of our political and electoral institutions and of our justice system and accountability system. We decided to transform ourselves. Those profound changes were decades overdue  because no political party has held a majority in Congress in past years. Nevertheless  through dialogue and consensus it was possible to achieve those changes in just 20 months.What was the principal difference from the past? It was the will of an entire nation that dared to change. Mexico acted decisively and wisely. It dared to transform itself and to set itself in motion. On the basis of that experience  I am convinced that the United Nations can also change.Almost 70 years after its creation  the United Nations must evolve  as the world has evolved. I know it will not be easy to build consensus to succeed  because inertia must be broken and paradigms must be changed. But I also know that the talent  the vision and the audicity needed to achieve that do exist. It is time to build a new United Nations for a new century. That will require that all States have the will to listen  discuss and tolerate and the capacity to yield. At the end of that process  the world will have more a efficient Organization  a United Nations that is able to work successfully in favour of the peace and development of the planet. My country is ready to play an active role in the transformation. It is determined to evolve with the United Nations.Mexico supports and values peacekeeping operations  a United Nations instrument that assists countries to overcome conflicts and create conditions for sustainable peace by providing the means for reconstruction  humanitarian aid and security. That is why Mexico has decided to participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations  providing humanitarian work to benefit civilian populations. Our participation will be in keeping with a clear mandate from the Security Council and with the foreign-policy norms established in our Constitution. With such determination  Mexico  as a responsible stakeholder  will take a historic step in its commitment to the United Nations.Next year  the Organization will reach its seventieth anniversary. That will offer us a great opportunity to make our plurality both an asset and a strength for change. With the participation of all  with the drive and the boldness of the Member States  the United Nations can transform itself to benefit the whole of humanity."
"112",4575,"MHL",69,2014,"When the United Nations was founded nearly 70 years ago  it was created to fulfil the aspiration that peace and diplomacy could overcome self-interest and to ensure that  through effective cooperation  the world could avoid grave security threats. But the decades since the signing of the Charter of the United Nations have been marked by nearly as many failures as successes  and many of those failures could have been prevented by early action and stronger political will.I am particularly concerned today about the recent events in Ukraine and the rapid spread of violent terrorism in Syria and Iraq  even though the Pacific Islands sit halfway around the world  a fragile region far away from the global super-Powers. The leaders of nations have in our hands the means either to respond with alert action or to turn our backs on a growing danger.Climate change poses no less of a security threat to our Pacific shores  and  indeed  to the world. As a low-lying country  the Marshall Islands has no higher ground — nowhere to go — and we will not cede an inch to rising waters. Earlier this week  over 120 world leaders met in this Hall to signal our political will and our commitment. No one should take that lightly. Leaders simply cannot afford to play consensus games or to squabble.Yet words and intentions alone do not meet the full challenge before us. There will be serious emissions gaps between what the world will do and what needs to be done to save my nation. Earlier this week  young poet and mother Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner from the Marshall Islands stepped onto this very same stage to urge world leaders to take action. Today  on behalf of the most vulnerable nations — those at the front line — I ask of the leaders of the largest nations  the major emitters  in Kathy’s very same words  to“take us all along on your ride. We will not slow you down. We will help you win the most important race of all  the race to save humanity”.Like no other global challenge  climate change requires direct political ownership and eye-to-eye engagement with leaders. This issue  more than any other  will define the Secretary-General’s legacy as leader of these united nations. I urge him not only to continue to show his commendable personal leadership  but also to use his good offices to help find creative political solutions.Everyone — large and small  rich and poor — must and will take strong action on emissions. In that regard  the Republic of the Marshall Islands strongly supports the Federated States of Micronesia  the United States of America  and many other nations in urging a rapid global phase-down of hydrofluorocarbon gases under the Montreal Protocol. I will personally attend the Paris climate conference next December  so that my voice and that of my people can be heard.Unlike many other fights  the huge global fight to address climate change is also a personal one for me. It starts in my own backyard  with my own seawall  built with my own hands  to push back rising waters  save my own future and the future of my children and grandchildren. But that is not enough. We face a challenge that is nearly beyond belief. As with so many other moments in the history of the United Nations  we have to ask whether leaders will respond to the climate threat with courage. Or will some nations  including some close friends of the Pacific Islands  slide back in their efforts  bury their heads in the sand and ignore an obvious climate reality? I hope and expect that at the coming Group of Twenty meeting later this year  the world’s largest economies will address climate change and the economic consequences of inaction. The Pacific island countries demand no less.Last month  nations around the world gathered in Apia for the third international conference on small island developing States. As hosts of the conference  the Government and people of Samoa showed the world true Pacific hospitality. As we have for decades  Pacific leaders have spoken firmly — in last year’s Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership  in this year’s Palau Declaration on “The Ocean: Life and Future”  and again in the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA Pathway).Our development needs are beyond urgent and must not to be put off for yet another year. While the SAMOA Pathway charts a course forward for international partnership with small islands  there is too often a mismatch between our national structures and complicated sources of assistance. It is my hope and expectation that the major announcements and partnerships from the Samoa Summit will not lose momentum because of poor connections in the delivery channels. Our needs are often modest  but the trickle-down of international assistance and global development somehow fails to reach our local communities and to meet our unique challenges.In the follow-up to the Samoa meeting  starting this year I urge the Secretary-General  the international system and United Nations agencies to start thinking seriously about how to work more effectively with our unique challenges as island nations. As Member States design a post-2015 development agenda  it is important that we focus on a strong outcome that has the flexibility to accommodate the unique character of each nation. We cannot measure progress without specific benchmarks  but as a small nation we fear that having so many ambitions can be equivalent to having none at all. The answer is not to be isolated within a separate  unconnected island strategy  but rather to build the flexibility needed for so many nations to act as one.I stand firm with my fellow Pacific leaders and nations around the world who have urged that there be a United Nations sustainable development goal on oceans. I am puzzled as to why some nations close their eyes to two thirds of the world’s surface  pretending that the world’s vast blue waters somehow do not exist. The Pacific Ocean and its rich fisheries are our lifeline. We are the custodians of our own vast resources on behalf of future generations.We could introduce a step change in the world’s sustainable fisheries and play our own role to address global food security. Distant-water fishing nations must engage us as true development partners and work with us to change the focus beyond their immediate national industry and towards a global responsibility. Recent progress on sustainable fisheries has become the defining story of the Pacific — it is our empowerment and our future. The oceans are an equally valuable resource for alternate sustainable energy  including ocean thermal energy conversion.Everyone should participate on the international stage. The Republic of the Marshall Islands supports Taiwan’s meaningful participation in United Nations specialized agencies and mechanisms  including the World Health Organization  the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  as well as in key regional economic integration mechanisms. Furthermore  I call for Taiwan’s involvement in the post-2015 development agenda and urge recognition of the important assistance provided to my country in health  education and energy. The Marshall Islands welcomes Taiwan’s efforts to reduce cross-Strait tensions and urges States Members of the United Nations to recognize and encourage such progress.As a former United Nations Trust Territory  the Republic of the Marshall Islands has a unique legacy  shared by only a very few in this Hall. It was the United Nations that helped set us on a path to independence  but it was also the United Nations that explicitly authorized the 67 nuclear tests conducted in our nation between 1946 and 1958. Our own history bears the burden and the contemporary impacts of those tests. Our suffering could have been prevented by the United Nations — if only its Members had listened. Like many other nations  the Republic of the Marshall Islands believes that awareness of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons must underpin all approaches and efforts towards nuclear disarmament.Those facts speak for themselves and were recognized two years ago by the United Nations Special Rapporteur. We look forward to addressing those issues further during our participation in the Human Rights Council universal periodic review next year. For the survival of humanity it is essential that nuclear weapons are never used again  under any circumstances. The universal way to accomplish that is through the total elimination of such weapons. It should be our collective goal as the United Nations to not only stop the spread of nuclear weapons  but also to pursue the peace and security of a world without them.This year  I look forward to a United Nations that better recognizes the true global challenges of today and moves beyond old political cobwebs into our dynamic century."
"113",4599,"MKD",69,2014,"I am greatly honoured to address this forum and to share with the General Assembly the views of the Republic of Macedonia on issues of global concern. In the current dynamic  hyper-connected and changing world  one thing remains constant — the need for greater predictability  a quality on which peace  security and stability depend  as well as global welfare and progress.Humankind today faces many challenges  of which two demand our full attention. The first one relates to the natural world  and the second relates to the international order. The root of the first challenge is the human neglect of natural laws. The second challenge arises from the violation of international law.Guided by the idea that man is the measure of all things  humankind has made a wrong calculation. We are competing in a race for progress and new discoveries that goes hand in hand with a race for the unequal exploitation of resources — a race whose only rule is that there are no rules. Everything is possible and everything is allowed  including the pollution of the air we breathe  the water we drink and the soil that produces our food.As humankind  we were selfishly focused on immediate needs and desires. We forget that natural resources have been given to us in trust to preserve for our children. In opposing nature  we are undermining the foundations of our future. Our citizens  States and economies have already begun to pay the price. We will face a period of extreme weather conditions  when it will become ever more likely that cities will be flooded  rivers will dry up  crops will fail and the price of food will increase.Natural disasters at the global level serve as loud alarms telling us that climate change is a new reality that is changing our lives and the lives of future generations. Recently our region  South-Eastern Europe  was hit by such a disaster and reminded of that reality.The Republic of Macedonia is the first country in our region to have completed its third national report under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We have already defined the next steps in all key sectors of the economy and society at the national and local levels for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation by promoting strategies and efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase energy efficiency.We welcome the initiative of the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session  His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa  to take decisive and concrete measures to remedy two of the world’s great miseries: increased global poverty and diminished access to basic resources  including clean water  education  health care and a clean environment.Here at the United Nations  we are all one family; as a family  we should help each other to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. But we must focus on two things  that is  reducing global poverty and ensuring sustainable development.Next year will be one of great expectations worldwide  including the expectation that a genuine synergy involving all the major challenges will finally be achieved  inter alia  climate change adaptation  disaster risk reduction and sustainable development. We expect the post-2015 development agenda to include global  holistic  scientifically grounded  feasible and legally binding goals aimed at ensuring a safer world for our descendants. However  we should be aware that the natural balance is disturbed and that many things will therefore not be as before. We will need to learn to live in a changed world.Just as the challenge posed by nature is a result of the human neglect of natural laws  the challenge to the international order arises from the violation of international law by some countries. I said before that we are all one United Nations family. And in every family there are rules of conduct and mutual respect. Families without such rules are known as dysfunctional families.The Republic of Macedonia is strongly committed to respecting the Charter of the United Nations  which is one of the primary foundations of the purposes and principles of international law. The rule of law is incomplete and impossible without respect for human rights. As a member of the Human Rights Council  the Republic of Macedonia is committed  in spirit and with determination  to protecting and promoting human rights and the right to human dignity throughout the world. The Republic of Macedonia has achieved the highest standards of respect for human rights and the rights of communities worldwide. That is possible thanks to the Macedonian model of coexistence as a model of integration without assimilation  which is not based on tolerance alone  but rather on respect for diversity.In fact  the human rights and human dignity of Macedonian citizens are being continually denied by one Member of the United Nations family and a member of NATO and the European Union. Identity and language are inseparable parts of our personality  of freedom of expression  of human rights. Those are universally accepted principles that should never be compromised. Respect for human rights  including the rights to self-identification and human dignity  represent the highest values of the United Nations and are among the political criteria for the Republic of Macedonia’s accession to the European Union.The country that is blocking my country is demanding the impossible  namely  that we give up the Macedonian identity  thereby violating the fundamental principles of the European Union in order to meet conditions for membership in it. That would force my country to violate a rule and betray the global family.In 2008 at the NATO Summit in Bucharest  basing its position on international law  my country refused to change the identity of the Macedonian people as a precondition for its already well-deserved membership in NATO. On 17 November 2008  we launched proceedings against our southern neighbour under the auspices of the International Court of Justice  again acting on the basis of international law. On 5 December 2011  on the basis of international law  the International Court of Justice ruled that the obstruction of the Republic of Macedonia’s integration in NATO was illegal and that international commitments had been violated. For years my country has tolerated unprincipled and illegal blockades  and we have done so because of international law — because we believe that only international law can provide predictability and certainty on behalf of world order.By our example we have demonstrated in principle how other countries should respect international law. Even the International Court of Justice  in an almost unanimous decision  concluded that we had acted correctly. Despite that  the Republic of Macedonia is ready for a mutually acceptable solution under the framework provided by United Nations resolutions  the Interim Accord and the judgment of the International Court of Justice. The issue of identity has never been part of that framework  because identity can neither be discussed nor negotiated. I therefore urge the United Nations and the competent authorities to become engaged and to devote maximum attention to finding mutually acceptable solutions within the framework of international law.Two years ago  I was at the General Assembly (see A/67/PV.12) and remember well that the session was preceded by the High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the National and International Levels (see A/67/PV.3). The General Assembly debated the Secretary-General’s report (A/66/749) entitled “Delivering justice: programme of action to strengthen the rule of law at the national and international levels”. Two years have passed  and we are still debating. We are still waiting for rulings of the International Court of Justice to be respected.Our southern neighbour continues daily to violate international law. It continues to violate the various 1993 United Nations resolutions on the subject  as well as the 1995 Interim Accord. It also still ignores the ruling of the highest legal authority in the world. But that ruling does not apply only to the State that blocks us  the ruling applies  erga omnes  to all member States of the international organizations that still block our membership. Every blockade in our European and Euro-Atlantic integration process undermines the international legal order. By tolerating the blockades  a dangerous precedent is created  one of mutual blocking and blackmailing that is motivated by narrow national interests at the expense of the collective interests of the European Union and NATO. Hence  dysfunctional families are created that do not respect the rules of conduct. Disrespect for the highest legal authorities implies an erosion of the culture of respect for international law in the world. Such an erosion suspends the rule of law and leaves room for anarchy.For years  we have pertinently pointed out that  if someone pollutes the spring  then its flow and the entire watershed will also be contaminated. If someone questions basic human rights — the right to human dignity and the right to self-identification — then the rest of international law will also be challenged. We have warned of the violation of international law in the case of the Republic of Macedonia  but others have rarely listened. Today  the price we pay is higher. Everyone calls upon international law when others are expected to respect it  but they ignore it when they themselves must respect it. We do not want to follow the example of those who break the law  because we are aware of the consequences.If we remove one link  one factor or one participant from an ecosystem  that can cause instability and unpredictability in its functioning. We live in a world and an age of global interdependence  a global ecosystem. When a State fails to comply with international commitments  it encourages others to do the same. Today we are witnessing the consequences of such behaviour. Under the conditions of an impaired international legal system  the world has been rapidly sinking into the dark areas of anarchic international relations.The world order is in a latent crisis. The processes of global interdependence and subnational fragmentation have transformed our previous perceptions of the world. In less than a decade  we have experienced two major changes. The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 shook the global political and security order  and the collapse of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008 struck the global economic order. The only remaining order of the world we used to know is the international legal order. However  the legal system has been challenged as well.The Republic of Macedonia sees its future in NATO and the European Union. With its expansion policy  the European Union has long served as a beacon lighting the path for the States of East and South-East Europe towards the more advanced European family. We were recently informed that this beacon will go out of service in the next five years. If it does  there will be the danger of shipwreck. The region of South-Eastern Europe remains vulnerable. I want to send a message to partners in the European Union that by postponing its enlargement  the EU has been creating a vacuum in what has been historically the most porous geopolitical space. Sooner or later  that vacuum will be filled. That is why we need as soon as possible to integrate all the Balkan countries within the European Union. While the membership card is not that important for us  the necessary membership criteria and standards are important. In our case  the European Union’s beacon has grown dim because of its toleration of a devaluation of international law  human rights and the right to human dignity  which provide the essential fuel that powers the beacon. In losing its light  the European Union is losing what has been most valuable — its power to motivate States to strive for even higher values  standards and criteria.I also want to send a clear message to my region that in these circumstances  now is the time for Balkan countries to demonstrate maximum solidarity and unity in achieving shared goals — cooperation on such issues as integration  our economies  infrastructure  energy  environmental protection  terrorism and the suppression of organized crime. We must resist and jointly address those shared challenges. In a world that is rapidly changing  the need for greater predictability in international relations remains. Only international law can offer the reliability and predictability on which world peace and the progress of our countries depend. International law is the only barrier that protects us from a disaster within the international order  and international law has been constantly breached.We are in this Hall today as the highest representatives of our countries in the world family. I am confident that most members of the General Assembly agree with those conclusions. But the question is  how many of us are willing to take action to change things. I wish that we were not in a situation where we could simply debate and draw conclusions over and over again. It is high time that we start with actions. This is the last call. We should ask ourselves whether the natural order has an alternative and what that might be. Our failure to comply with natural laws has led to accelerated climate change — to more floods  earthquakes and fires. The failure to comply with international law has contributed to increased anarchy in international relations and interventions against those who have flooded  burned and destroyed the natural order today.Not long ago  in August  the sixth United Nations Alliance of Civilizations Forum  held in Bali  focused on unity in diversity. While the world has been talking about unity in diversity  radical extremists have become united in their intentions to destroy those who differ. As we speak  millions of faithful believers around the world feel the pain caused by narrow-minded individuals and groups imbued with religious fundamentalism. As we speak  the systematic destruction of individuals and communities is occurring. As we speak  hundreds of thousands are being persecuted. Their homes have been devastated  their temples destroyed and their past erased  and their future is in question.Recognizing that terrorism cannot and should not be identified with any religion  nation or civilization  we strongly condemn mass atrocities committed by anyone anywhere. We commend yesterday’s debate in the Security Council (see S/PV.7272). What we need are urgent measures. The Republic of Macedonia has already taken the first steps. Recently  we adopted amendments to the criminal code regarding foreign fighters  who are a real threat to the entire region. Everything that is happening in the crisis hotspots reflects on Europe  which has its own crisis hotspot now in Ukraine.It is sad that in the twenty-first century we have witnessed tragedies in the Middle East and North Africa. It is sad that this is happening in Europe  in a year that has been declared an international year of peace. It is obvious that  on the centenary of the First World War  the lessons of the past have not yet been learned.The majority of victims of the Ukraine crisis are innocent civilians. There have also been material losses. The Republic of Macedonia supports all efforts aimed at restoring peace and stability in that country. I am convinced that political dialogue and diplomacy will enable Ukraine to address the challenges and regain its path towards a prosperous future for its citizens.The world is facing serious challenges  including natural disasters and political issues — both of which mask double standards. Double standards generate issues that introduce equations with many unknowns  leading to a world where the only thing we are certain of is that the future of our children is uncertain. Only respect for international law will ensure greater certainty  thereby helping to avoid storms in our dynamic world.The Republic of Macedonia supports the reform of the Security Council as a significant part of the overall reform of the United Nations. It is a complex and sensitive process. We agree with the proposal to negotiate the actual text. At the same time  we stress that the text must receive maximum support from the membership and ensure respect for international law and international commitments and rules. Such reform must provide greater predictability in the world. As Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the opening of the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly  “We shall have neither peace nor development without respect for human rights and the rule of law” (A/67/PV.6  p. 3). Only international law provides the opportunity to solve the equation and thus to plan the future  based on security  stability and peace.Young people continue to be the main victims of double standards and violations of the norms of national and international law by prior and current generations  as well as of natural disasters. They breathe the polluted air  drink the polluted water and eat food grown in contaminated soil. They will become the victims of systems of injustice unless we do something to change that.In 2003  we initiated the first Forum of the Dialogue among Civilizations  which was held in Ohrid under the leadership of former President Trajkovski. The Dialogue among Civilizations  both chronologically and in essence  predated the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations  which was formed in 2005 at the initiative of the Governments of Spain and Turkey. Indeed  only through dialogue will we join together in an alliance of civilizations. The Brdo-Brijuni Process Meeting was recently held with the participation of the German Chancellor  Her Excellency Mrs. Merkel. An entire chapter of the joint declaration is devoted to youth. As President of the Republic of Macedonia  it will be my honour to organize  together with the Director-General of UNESCO  Ms. Irina Bokova  the upcoming Dialogue among Civilizations in 2015  which will be entirely dedicated to youth.In the year when we are marking the centenary of the First World War  we recall the positive experiences of Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer in establishing the Franco-German Youth Office in 1963. That experience of cooperation among young people should be applied in establishing an office for young Europeans from all the countries of South-Eastern Europe  transforming our region into a Europeanized Balkans. We call on the leaders to devote greater time and attention and invest in youth. We cannot change our past  but we can  by changing the present  change the past of the generations to come. That is why it is necessary to educate young people about the importance of dialogue  which involves respect and the acceptance of diversity."
"114",4643,"MLI",69,2014,"It is my great pleasure  Mr. President  to convey to you warm congratulations from the delegation of Mali on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. The unanimous vote that you received on 11 June is an honour for your country  Uganda  and is a source of legitimate pride for all of Africa. I assure you of our fullest support for success in your new position. At the same time  I wish to congratulate your predecessor  Ambassador John William Ashe  who so ably led the Assembly during his tenure as President at the sixty-eighth session. I should also like to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless commitment to resolving the crisis in Mali and for the laudable efforts he continues to make to promote peace  security and development throughout the world.Mr. President  you have established a useful agenda and opted for continuity in selecting the central theme of the sixty-ninth session  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”. I commend your choice. Indeed  since the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012  our Organization has been engaged in various intergovernmental processes to implement the slogan “The future we want.”In Rio de Janeiro  States Members of the United Nations took up the challenge to provide a better world for current and future generations. To deliver on that undertaking  we will require noble  ambitious  legitimate and strong leadership  strong political will  constant determination and insight so as to ensure a balanced integration of the three essential pillars of sustainable development  namely  social  economic and environmental. What we have heard over the past few days leads us to believe that it is feasible.However  as we prepare to embark on the design phase of the transformative post-2015 programme  we must first complete a vital task. My delegation wishes to emphasize the need to ensure the full implementation of the substantial prior commitments we undertook. Accordingly  we want to make a heartfelt plea in favour of expediting the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In sum  I would reiterate that Mali subscribes to the core theme of this session  which is relevant  thanks to its inclusive  universal  ambitious and transformative aspects. The theme not only includes all the essential components of the outstanding MDGs  but it also focuses on the sustainable development goals (SDGs)  which will be based on a transparent intergovernmental process.Like other delegations  African and non-African alike  that have spoken before me  I remain convinced that the eradication of poverty by 2030 should be a priority target of commitments relating to the post-2015 development agenda that we are to adopt. Fortunately  the contribution of Africa to the current process is already formalized in the Common African Position on Post-2015 Development  adopted at the African Union Summit in Malabo in June. That joint position makes social  economic and environmental sustainability the keystone of our continent’s development policy.But the policy is also built on essential pillars  such as the transformation of economic structures  inclusive growth  science  technology  innovation  human-centred development  environmental sustainability  and natural resource and natural disaster risk management  as well as peace and security. Naturally  we strongly support the African position  the relevance and rightness of which goes without saying. I also urge the international community to diligently review the Common African Position. The concerns of the continent listed in that position statement were identified through a process conducted with care and precision.As we approach the 2015 deadline  Africa is again faced with a terrible epidemic of the Ebola virus  which has run rampant  this time in Guinea  Sierra Leone  Liberia and other countries of West Africa. The rapid onset and the scale of that new challenge have sorely tested all the public-health systems already in place. The individual capacities of our States  which are fragile and in the process of being strengthened  will not be sufficient to cope with the crisis. We must pool our resources and redouble our efforts. We must attack the new epicentres. Today more than ever  it is important to adopt a common strategy to deal with this epidemic  which brings grief to numerous homes every day.I want to express our appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts  and  in these times of hardship  to assure our brother countries of our support and active solidarity. I also wish to commend and thank various nations  including France  the United States of America  China and Cuba  which immediately responded with short-  medium- and long-term assistance  provided swiftly and in a balanced manner. The pledges made have laid a foundation that will be instrumental  if not in completely overcoming the challenge immediately  at least in mitigating the panic that has begun to spread in the affected countries.A year ago from this rostrum (see A/68/PV.15)  I announced that my country  Mali  had rejoined the community of free and democratic nations  with the firm determination to write a new page in its history. I also announced the commencement of the dialogue process for peace and national reconciliation  which we initiated in accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions and the Ouagadougou Preliminary Agreement  signed on 18 June 2013  between the Government and armed groups in northern Mali.Since that date  there have been significant developments of a political and security nature relating to the restoration of the authority of the State  the protection of human rights  the development of humanitarian action  the execution of the mandate of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA)  and the coordination of development activities and partnership with the international community. In that context  the Government of Mali has undertaken a wide range of actions  covering decentralization — that is to say  an even more radical devolution of powers previously held by the central Government — the promotion of national reconciliation and peaceful coexistence  development effectiveness in northern Mali  good governance and combating corruption and impunity.The momentum was strengthened by the Government’s organization of a series of meetings and opportunities for dialogue  including the Open Forum on Decentralization and the National Conference on Northern Mali. Those meetings enabled all the national stakeholders to come together  in an inclusive and participatory manner  and to identify structural weaknesses in our political and institutional systems  as well as to lay the foundations for new democratic governance. That will take into account the profound realities of our society  such as its ethnic and cultural diversity and the strengths that have enabled the people of Mali to ensure and maintain  throughout the centuries and despite all the vagaries of nature and recurring political uncertainties  their social cohesion  customary resilience and basic aspiration to a continuous improvement of their economic and social conditions.Today  in Algiers  with the support of the international community  Algeria is facilitating a process that weaves the threads of an inclusive inter-Malian dialogue into a comprehensive and permanent peace. We thank Algeria for all its efforts to help Mali. We hope that peace will be sustainable and lasting and thus respond to the deepest aspirations of our people. A first round of talks  held in Algiers from 16 to 24 July  has led to the joint signing of a road map on the basis of consensus and a declaration of cessation of hostilities in the northern regions of Mali. The Government and the armed groups in northern Mali have since then continued their discussions on what is called the second phase. Those discussions should lead to deeper negotiations on a common vision for the future  to gradually provide lasting solutions to all the points of disagreement and start the final phase  before ending with a peace agreement that will finally be reached by the Malians themselves.I would like to once again thank the African Union  the Economic Community of West African States  the United Nations  the European Union  the Organization of Islamic Cooperation  Algeria  Burkina Faso  Mauritania  the Niger  Nigeria  France  Switzerland and others  which I will not name but which deserve to be thanked for their tireless efforts for peace in Mali.There are also other challenges to which we  as the international community  must collectively respond  especially in the Sahel region  which includes Mali. The terrorist attacks carried out in Libya  Nigeria  Kenya  Uganda  Tunisia and the Middle East  although geographically spread out  in fact represent the same serious threat to international peace and security. Here I would like to pay a special tribute to the memory of the French hostage  Hervé Gourdel  who was recently murdered in such a cowardly and brutal manner in Algeria. The very same day  that same barbarity was illustrated in Mali  with the discovery of a decapitated head hung up in a village marketplace. It belonged to a former Malian soldier whose only crime was loyalty to Mali and its Government.We condemn terrorism  particularly when it is carried out under the banner of religion. Islam has been present in Mali since the eleventh century  and it has been a tolerant and moderate Islam that is based on humanism  the acceptance of others and the right to differences. That has nothing to do with the Islam we are seeing today.We reiterate our profound gratitude to all those who have worked for a return to peace and stability in our country. On behalf of the grateful nation of Mali  we honour the memory of all the brave soldiers and civilians  from Mali and other friendly countries  who have sacrificed their lives fighting against obscurantism  terrorism and violent extremism.The 2012 political and security crises in Mali highlighted the complex and multiple challenges facing all countries of the Sahel in terms of security  governance  the protection of human rights and development. Those challenges require concerted and diligent efforts by the international community. They should be met with a comprehensive approach and targeted mechanisms. In that regard  I welcome the adoption of the United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel  which offers a comprehensive and coherent approach to finding lasting solutions to the threats and challenges that beset the Sahel.The first ministerial meeting to establish a platform for coordinating the United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel  held in Bamako on 5 November 2013  is part of that approach. After the meeting  the Ministers for Foreign Affairs charged with coordinating the Sahel countries agreed to hold meetings every six months with a rotating chairmanship  which has been entrusted  for the first two years  to my country  Mali. The second meeting  also held in Bamako  on 16 May 2014  resulted in the adoption of the Malian chair’s road map  which focused in particular on coordinating the efforts of partners and the national and regional ownership of the various initiatives and strategies for the Sahel.As a final note on this subject  I thank the bilateral and multilateral partners and the financial institutions committed to supporting the implementation of the targeted projects and programmes within the United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel. We also thank the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Sahel  Ms. Hiroute Guebre Selassie  and Mr. Romano Prodi for his efforts to reconcile the various points of view and to support Mali at the international level.Mali remains firmly committed to the ideals of peace and stability  both within and outside its borders. I therefore welcome the progress achieved in terms of reconstruction and national reconciliation in the brotherly country of Guinea-Bissau. The successful holding of presidential and parliamentary elections bolsters the restoration of constitutional order in that brotherly country.Regarding the Central African Republic  Mali is deeply concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian situation there  and expresses its support for the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic. We hope its rapid deployment will put an end to the escalating violence and thus protect civilian populations in that brotherly country.With respect to the Middle East  we are following with great concern the developments in Syria  Lebanon and Iraq  where the offensives of the terrorist group called the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant threaten the sovereignty of that country and the stability of the entire region. To the Palestinian people  we express our solidarity in action and continue to work for the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions.Mali remains firmly committed to the fight against the proliferation of small arms and light weapons and the eradication of the illicit trade in such weapons. To be effective  that fight must be make use of the relevant synergies. The consultation and cooperation framework at the regional and international levels offers such an opportunity. Similarly  the Government of Mali deplores the erosion of multilateralism in the area of disarmament  in particular the prolonged paralysis in the United Nations Disarmament Commission. However  we welcome the adoption by the General Assembly  on 2 April 2013  of the Arms Trade Treaty (resolution 67/234)  as it represents true progress in that area.We note that the intergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the Security Council have been ongoing for two decades already. The main issues seem to be the categories of membership  the question of the veto  regional representation  enlargement of the membership  the Council’s working methods and its relations with the General Assembly. It seems to us that all Member States are now convinced of the need for a reform of the institutional framework of the United Nations in order to strengthen its legitimacy and ensure its effectiveness.However  no significant progress has been made in the specific case of the Security Council  despite repeated calls from this same rostrum and multiple meetings on the issue. Africa  despite the fact that it represents 53 of the 193 States Members of the United Nations today  remains the only continent that does not have a permanent seat on the Security Council.This situation is at odds with the values of equality and justice that are the ideals espoused by our Organization.Africa came up with and submitted a Common Position that was agreed on at Ezulwini  reaffirmed in Sirte and subsequently confirmed during several other summits. This proposal  a fair and realistic solution  calls for granting the African continent two permanent seats with the right of veto and five other non-permanent seats. It seems to us that the Council  thus reformed  would better reflect the geopolitical realities of today’s world  and the historic injustice done to Africa would be repaired.In conclusion  I would like recall that we are all gathered here at the United Nations for the sake of an ideal and because of a universal desire for peace  justice and freedom. Millions of people around the globe expect the United Nations to deliver peace  security  development and international solidarity. We have no right to disappoint them. As a community of nations  we have the duty and the means to succeed through collective awareness and the preservation of our common values. That is the price of guaranteeing future generations a sustainable development that would protect them from the scourge of war and deprivation."
"115",4686,"MLT",69,2014,"I would like first to congratulate Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I also wish to express my appreciation for the able manner in which the outgoing President presided over the Assembly.Allow me also to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless commitment in the service of peace. I also thank the men and women serving the United Nations in the field. They do so often at great personal risk  and their courage and determination is a source of inspiration for the Organization.It was 50 years ago that Malta became an independent State. That was the year when Nelson Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment in South Africa  and when Martin Luther King received the Nobel Peace Prize. For a small  nascent State such as Malta  it was a year of promise and new beginnings as it took its place among the Members of the United Nations. It is with a deep sense of pride that I stand before members here today to note the role our country has played over the past 50 years to uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.Time and again  this family of nations has found a trusted and reliable partner in my country  willing to contribute  in ways large and small  to the cause of international peace and security. I shall mention just two. The first is Malta’s association with the Law of the Sea — a widely acknowledged role  as we were instrumental in the launching of the international process that would eventually lead to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The second example  which came shortly after that  in 1988  is our being among the first Member States to highlight the risks of climate change to the global community within the forum of the United Nations. An almost alien concept at the time  today climate change is one of the main items on the global agenda. I pay tribute to Arvid Pardo and former President .ensu Tabone  who piloted those events. Evidently  our size did not determine our ambitions then. Neither will it determine them now.We live in an increasingly uncertain world — a world where the power balances that we have known in recent decades have started to shift. What made sense in the past may not make sense in the future — not too distant a future  but the future that we can already see forming before our own eyes. If the Assembly will allow me  I wish to share some thoughts by presenting five challenges — five of the many that I feel we  the United Nations  need to face up to now.Undoubtedly  the first challenge is the conflict in the Middle East. We need a return to meaningful negotiations  and I stress the word meaningful. The ongoing tit-for-tat  the culture of hatred and intolerance  the self-righteous proclamations and the recriminations are leaving nothing but death and destruction. If we build walls around people  it is no wonder that they will dig tunnels to escape. The current frame of mind will lead nowhere. Too many innocent civilians have died  too many children have been buried. We need statesmanship from the politicians on both sides to resolve the conflict. Risk-takers and courageous negotiators must be willing to make the right choices — not the most convenient choices  and not the most popular  perhaps  but the most enduring ones — that will bring about change leading to peace.Our second challenge must be putting an end to the ghastly war in Syria  which is fast becoming a forgotten conflict of major proportions. Like many other countries here  last year my country called for a stop to the atrocities (see A/68/PV.12). Are we simply going to repeat that call this year as well? Let us stop this humanitarian disaster  which  as we know  is now morphing into the new threats we have heard so much about. The adoption of Security Council resolution 2165 (2014) demonstrated that we can act together  so let us act. We call on the Security Council to assume its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations and to act urgently and decisively to bring about an end to the bloodshed.That brings me to the third challenge. As if we have not yet learned the lessons from Syria  or realized what sectarian divisions can lead to  we are allowing the problems in Libya to continue almost unabated. We are fast witnessing a descent into another forgotten conflict. We need to help the Libyan people take their country forward. There is a bright future for Liby  but Libyans themselves need to find the hope necessary to realize it. They can begin to do so only with the help of the international community. The United Nations can and must provide capacity-building and security to bring about stability and prosperity.Of course  we are heartened to see the constructive role already being played by the United Nations Support Mission in Libya. Yet immense challenges remain  in particular in restoring the country’s security and law and order. The divisions are rooted in many causes  but they can be overcome. This situation cannot be allowed to continue further. Its repercussions are severe not just for the Libyans themselves or for the country’s immediate neighbours  such as ourselves  but further afield. The international community cannot risk a takeover by extremists of that crucial country.Together with our international partners  especially our colleagues in the European Union  Malta continues to actively support the efforts of the Libyan people to move forward. We are providing all the assistance within our means to aid the wounded. We will stand for dialogue and reconciliation in Libya. We will stand for peace and resolution. We will continue to draw attention to this festering wound. Our Libyan friends deserve that. Disarmament and national reconciliation are the prerequisites for Libya to move forward. The United Nations must be ready to answer the calls for action from the Libyan people themselves.If the Assembly will allow  I will directly address our friends in Libya in their own language  which is so similar to my own.(spoke in Arabic)The families and the children of Libya deserve a true future. Freedom and justice for all Libyans can be achieved only if differences are resolved through dialogue and compromise.(spoke in English)Please allow me now to move to the fourth challenge facing the world today  namely  the spread of extremism and intolerance.We are living through a period of transnational allegiances in which we are seeing the globalization of hatred — one during which extremists are increasingly interconnected through networks and inventions whose main purpose should be progress and education. This is a time when disenchanted youths are radicalized into movements that know no limits. We need to look beyond the borders of our nation States and work together  if we are to face up to the threats posed by extremists.Nobody is immune from what is undoubtedly the biggest threat to world stability and peace. Just as the horrendous carnage of two world wars led to a shift in our thinking  the reality we are living in now needs to force another shift. We have to spread a culture of mutual understanding and humanity — not because it serves us  but because it serves our peoples and will serve our future as a global community.Clearly  the area of the world from the Mediterranean to the Middle East  and beyond  demands our utmost attention. People are being pushed to the brink. They are resorting to increasingly desperate measures. Men  women and children are risking their lives to cross conflict-ridden zones and hostile deserts. They are taking to the seas without realizing the dangers that await them. As I also did last year  I reiterate that more attention must be focused on the plight of illegal immigrants in the Mediterranean  which I believe is the fifth challenge we face.With all our limitations  Malta is doing its utmost to daily save lives — as our neighbour and friend Italy is also doing. Again I call on the Assembly and the international community to help to stop the great human tragedies that come with risky crossings across the Mediterranean. The States receiving the waves of migrants cannot stand up to the challenge alone: no country in the world can solve the problem of illegal immigration alone. Just last week we witnessed in our own seas yet another tragedy  which the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees described as mass murder.Closer cooperation among the countries of origin  transit and destination is needed. The United Nations and its agencies are already helping  but they must continue to help in addressing the causes. Better governance  better resources and better development policies are needed. We need better enforcement mechanisms and stronger penalties to stop and punish the criminals — the human traffickers. We need better implementation of internationally agreed commitments. We need all of that and more  and we need to remember to keep in mind the well-being of the human beings  the families and children who are the victims of all that tragedy.As a Mediterranean country  Malta cannot but call for the world’s attention to those challenges  which are threatening not only the security of the region but also its development and growth. Such threats are preventing the Mediterranean Sea Basin from reaching its full potential  which is just waiting to be unleashed if only weapons were traded for books and hatred for education. I reiterate my strong conviction that the Mediterranean Basin needs to be given our immediate attention in order to once again become the home of great civilizations that it is and a cross-cultural haven where women and men of different beliefs and traditions work  trade and mingle in tolerance and tranquillity.It has always been our belief that there cannot be peace in Europe without peace in the Mediterranean. Today’s unprecedented levels of interconnectivity lead us to believe that peace in the Mediterranean is a prerequisite for global stability. Malta will continue to serve as a voice of reason  while striving to unite the Mediterranean. Our only weapon is our historical and natural vocation for peace. Our resolve grows only stronger in such testing times.The challenges that we face cannot stop us in our tracks. We can address them if we truly believe in acting as the United Nations. A year from now  we will analyse the Millennium Development Goals and will  hopefully  agree on sustainable development goals for the twenty-first century. With an effective development agenda  we can address the causes of conflict in a sustainable manner and can overcome the poverty that contributes to illegal migration. But we need to be ambitious.Over the past 50 years  my country has shown that it has been and can be ambitious in favour of peace  progress and prosperity. It has promoted and will continue to promote the broadest possible dialogue among the countries of our region. I take pride in noting that only a few months ago  Malta  together with Algeria  France  Italy  Jordan  Morocco  the Netherlands  Nigeria  Tunisia  Turkey  the United Kingdom and the United States  jointly launched the International Institute for Justice and Rule of Law  hosted by my country. The Institute will collaborate with the United Nations and other international and non-governmental organizations to provide training to lawmakers  police  prosecutors  judges and prison officials to deal with terrorism and transnational crime  with a general emphasis on the rule of law. We hope that such work will eventually serve as a best practice for the benefit of the wider global community.We are also fully engaged within the Commonwealth  which brings together a third of the world population  in order to help achieve convergence on some of the challenges that lie ahead  including the sustainable development goals and climate change. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting that will take place in Malta next year will serve as an ideal platform for the discussion of such issues  especially ahead of the Paris summit on climate change. Those are some of the ways in which a small country in Europe at the centre of the Mediterranean  such as Malta  will continue to contribute to the fostering of peace and security in our region and in the world.Fifty years may seem like a long time  but I can affirm that 50 years from now my country will remain steadfast in its ambitions and in our determination in favour of peace and prosperity. Malta will remain a proud Member of the United Nations and a beacon of stability in the Mediterranean."
"116",4732,"MMR",69,2014,"We are gathered here at a time when the world is facing pressing global challenges and security threats that must be addressed collectively and with urgency. Our planet is heating up owing to the clear and imminent danger of climate change. Terrorism is rearing its ugly head once again. The global village is gripped with fear of the spreading Ebola epidemic. Tension and mistrust are building up among the major Powers  reminiscent of the rivalry of the Cold War. The number and scale of regional and local conflicts is growing in some parts of the world. One billion people are still trapped in poverty. The world we want is still a distant dream.Climate change is no longer merely an issue for scientific argument; it is one of survival that requires our urgent action. Many developing countries economically dependent on agriculture  as well as small island States  will bear the brunt of its impact. It is of the utmost importance that we agree a new global commitment on climate protection and emissions-reduction objectives. My delegation is therefore thankful to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for organizing the Climate Summit 2014  whose message that urgent and united action is needed was loud and clear. Myanmar will continue to work together with the international community towards a meaningful  implementable and universal climate agreement in Paris in 2015.In support of the vision of the President of the General Assembly for a transformative post-2015 development agenda  we must intensify our efforts at this session to set the world on the path to sustainable development in its economic  social and environmental dimensions. In that process  we must also work together to find effective means for implementation  including the mobilization of financial and technological support  in order to ensure the success of the new agenda and the sustainable development goals.The Ebola outbreak in West Africa  with its unprecedented nature and scope  is alarming. We must not see that outbreak as unique to one particular people or place. It is a common challenge to all of humankind. Myanmar welcomes the swift and timely response by the Secretary-General in proactively establishing the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response.Terrorism cannot be condoned for any reason or under any circumstances. Ruthless killings and atrocities in the name of religion must not be tolerated. Myanmar has always opposed terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We are not oblivious to the fate of those who have fallen victims to terrorism. The international community must be united to eliminate those horrible crimes. In that regard  my delegation fully supports the statement issued by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Foreign Ministers a few days ago here in New York.Myanmar firmly believes in the continued relevance and legitimacy of the United Nations in world affairs. We will continue to actively cooperate with it  in line with the principles of our foreign policy. Thanks to the positive changes in Myanmar  the cooperation between Myanmar and the United Nations is now better than ever. The United Nations and its agencies are showing greater interest in Myanmar  extending a helping hand to the people of Myanmar in all aspects of their lives. The Government  for its part  is facilitating the effective implementation of the United Nations missions.The maintenance of international peace and security is one of the main purposes of the United Nations. Myanmar  as a peace-loving nation  abhors weapons of mass destruction and is fully cognizant of the danger of nuclear weapons. To that end  Myanmar has annually submitted  since 1995  a draft resolution on nuclear disarmament. We will do so once again at the present session of the General Assembly. We encourage all Member States to positively support our draft resolution. If we follow the road map in the resolution with a strong political will  a world free of nuclear weapons will be within our grasp soon.I would like to inform the Assembly that Myanmar is making domestic preparations with a view to ratifying major international disarmament instruments. Considerable achievements have been made in that process. I am pleased to announce that the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw  our Union Parliament  has just approved Myanmar’s accession to the Biological Weapons Convention.The winds of change have blown across Myanmar over the past three years. The scope and pace of positive changes in Myanmar have earned remarkable recognition and encouragement from the international community. Those changes have contributed to raising Myanmar’s profile in the regional and international arena. On the regional stage  Myanmar held the Chair of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation until March this year. After successfully carrying out that responsibility  we are now shouldering the prestigious responsibility of chairing ASEAN. Under our chairmanship  ASEAN is exerting its efforts to speed up the ASEAN community-building process with the theme of “Moving forward in unity to a peaceful and prosperous community”.Myanmar is advancing well on the path of peaceful democratic transition  which began over three years ago by setting in motion various waves of political and economic reforms. The first wave was the peaceful transformation from a military Government to a multiparty democratic system  where all political forces are working together to overcome differences through dialogue in our two houses of Parliament. An all-inclusive political system has been established  bringing in all stakeholders in the process through national reconciliation. The first wave of reform brought about national reconciliation  the granting of a series of amnesties  the creation of greater political space  freedom of the media  freedom of expression  and freedom of association and peaceful assembly. It was followed by the second wave of reform  unleashing an array of political  economic  administrative and private sector development reforms. Now  the third wave of reform has been launched  which aims at laying down a firm foundation for a new democratic State and delivering benefits to the people by fulfilling their socioeconomic needs. We are determined to keep the reforms on track through ensuring peace  stability and national reconciliation.Since our democracy is still in its infancy  we are facing a multitude of daunting challenges  like other countries in transition. The Government has a long to-do list despite its limited capacity. We are determined to overcome the challenges and we are convinced that we will achieve our objectives. We need the international community’s understanding and continued support in our efforts for economic development and capacity-building to lay a solid foundation for a democratic society.One of the issues that attracts domestic and international attention is the process of amending Myanmar’s present Constitution. In that regard  the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw set up the Constitutional Amendment Review Joint Committee in July last year. Further  after soliciting suggestions and recommendations from the general public and political parties  the Constitutional Amendment Implementation Committee was formed to address the issues of constitutional amendment based on the suggestions received.Putting democratic values into practice  the Government is placing much more emphasis and consideration on the aspirations of our people as a whole. Accordingly  we are laying foundations to successfully conduct an independent  free and fair election within a legal framework that does not compromise national sovereignty. In that context  Myanmar recently received the visit of a needs assessment mission from the United Nations. All existing political parties are expected to take part in the elections. The final decision will be made by the people on election day.Peace and stability are prerequisites for political stability and for the socioeconomic development of the country. Strengthening national reconciliation is an integral part of our reform process. We are working together with all ethnic armed groups in good faith to reach a nationwide ceasefire agreement. So far we have already reached such an agreement with 14 out of the 16 groups. We are now working on a draft framework for political dialogue that will pave the way for bringing an end to the six-decade long conflict.The Government is serious in its commitment to the success of the peace process. It is open to discussing all issues  except those that could undermine the unity and sovereignty of the State. The political dialogue will also become a historic forum for discussion of all issues of national concern. We are confident that we are now getting closer to achieving a comprehensive and lasting peace.There has been steady progress in the promotion and protection of human rights in my country. A series of presidential amnesties have been granted  which creates an enabling environment for everyone to participate in the parliament  political parties  civil society organizations and labour organizations. The Myanmar National Human Rights Commission  which was first established in 2011  was reconstituted very recently with a view to functioning as an independent entity. Many complaint mechanisms  including the Commission  have been made available to citizens so that they can file complaints in the event of violation of their rights.In this new era  press and media freedom is one of the most visible outcomes of the reforms. In contributing to the all-inclusive reform process  the media is getting more space now. The abolishment of decades-old press censorship  the publishing of a multitude of private newspapers and journals and the enactment of a new media law are among the significant achievements in our media landscape.With firm resolve  Myanmar is now combating human trafficking  preventing gender violence and protecting children. Sexual violence is a crime strongly abhorred in our traditional values and national culture. It is strictly forbidden by law. At the global summit in London in June this year  Myanmar joined the Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict. Its signing of the Declaration reflects the country’s State policy of zero tolerance for use of rape or sexual violence as a weapon of war. The Armed Forces of Myanmar are making important progress in its implementation of the action plan to end the recruitment of child soldiers in Myanmar. Due to our strong commitment  there is no new underage recruitment  unwittingly or otherwise.All major human rights concerns have been addressed to a larger extent in the new Myanmar than before. We have now reached the middle tier of the human rights ladder. That progress is contributing to the better enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the people of Myanmar. Therefore  we are now fully convinced that Myanmar should no longer remain on the agendas of the Human Rights Council and the Third Committee of the General Assembly.We are also paying great attention to and making efforts to address the issue of the communal violence that had occurred between the two communities in Rakhine state. The history  diversity and complexity of the issue must be fully understood before jumping to conclusions. The situation should not be looked at in a superficial manner. The international community should contribute pragmatically and objectively to finding a durable solution. In addressing the root cause  we are working for peace  stability  harmony and development for all the people in Rakhine state. An action plan is being finalized and will soon be launched. Once in place  it will be implemented in a systematic and timely manner.I take this opportunity to thank all international partners for contributing to our efforts to address the current needs of the affected people. As development is one of the main challenges in Rakhine state  I would also like to invite the international community  particularly the United Nations  to provide much-needed development assistance there.The Government of Myanmar has been focusing on poverty reduction and rural development with a view to lifting the living standards of rural and urban people alike. We are striving to realize the structural changes from an agriculture-based economy to an industrial one. As those efforts become increasingly crystallized  we have been enjoying steady economic growth. We have achieved a growth rate in our gross domestic product of 5.6 per cent  7.3 per cent and 8.7 per cent in the past three years  respectively.That encouraging trend in economic growth and overall progress in our reform process has made us take an important decision. Taking this opportunity  I would like to announce that Myanmar is fully determined and has initiated the internal process to graduate from its least developed country (LDC) status. In that regard  President U Thein Sein has communicated to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  our intention and determination to graduate from LDC status. A high-level national committee and subcommittees are actively coordinating domestic measures  including a transition strategy  for our graduation. We are now working closely with the relevant United Nations agencies for technical and necessary assistance.Myanmar has made tremendous progress over the past three and a half years  since it began wide-ranging reforms in transition to democracy. Myanmar’s success in peaceful transformation was even lauded as a model in the world today. Despite all those achievements  there remain many challenges and hurdles on our path to democracy and development. We are fully aware of those daunting challenges. We will not be complacent. We are resolute and determined to continue our unrelenting efforts aimed at reform and the building of a democratic State.Myanmar is changing  and changing in the right direction. We are laying a solid foundation for a democratic State in which we can live in harmony  peace and prosperity. Developments in Myanmar should also be viewed in a more balanced and objective manner. It is the primary responsibility of the people of Myanmar to realize their long-held aspirations for democracy  peace and prosperity. The continued support and understanding of the international community would contribute positively to Myanmar’s reform process. Rome was not built in a day."
"117",4743,"MNE",69,2014,"I would first like to express my great appreciation for the efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to promote and achieve peace  security and prosperity in the world. I would also like to duly acknowledge the work of Mr. John William Ashe  President of the General Assembly at its previous session  to offer my best wishes to President Kutesa for his stewardship of the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session  and to confirm Montenegro’s willingness to cooperate fully with him in his accomplishment of his important duties. I emphasize the relevance of the theme of the current session  since it is highly pertinent to our efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals with the imminent arrival of 2015.As ever  Montenegro remains committed to an effective multilateral system  resting on a strong United Nations. As a responsible Member of the United Nations  Montenegro is therefore committed to continuing to contribute to strengthening the Organization and building a functional  integrated system that promotes respect for human rights  democracy and the rule of law  while devising and implementing global responses to global challenges. In that regard  we will continue to support the process of general reform and of system-wide coherence  as well as the integrated Delivering as One programme of action  based on successful implementation at the national level. I am proud to point out here that in March  in the most beautiful part of Montenegro’s capital city  Podgorica  we opened the United Nations Eco building  host to all the specialized United Nations agencies  and offering the best possible conditions for their work and their implementation of the Delivering as One concept. I see this project as a strong tool of reliable partnership for Montenegro in achieving fundamental United Nations goals.As a member of the Human Rights Council  Montenegro will continue to fully support the integration of human rights dimensions into all aspects of the work of the United Nations and to further strengthen the role of the Council in response to violations of human rights  while preserving the universality of international human rights law and the independence of the United Nations human rights system. In our approach  the key priority is to promote the rights of vulnerable groups — children  youth  the elderly  persons with disabilities  and lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender persons — and to promote gender equality and the fight against discrimination.Peace and stability  as preconditions for prosperous development  can be ensured through positive activism in global international organizations  primarily in the United Nations  and the constructive approach of every country in the sphere of regional policy  as well as a commitment to good-neighbourly cooperation. Therefore  Montenegro strongly promotes this approach in bilateral relations and regional initiatives in South-East Europe. We are certain that the success of Montenegro in the process of integration into the European Union and NATO represents a major contribution to the stability and opening up of prospects for development of the wider Balkans region.Montenegro strongly supports global efforts towards disarmament and non-proliferation. This year  we ratified the Arms Trade Treaty  becoming the forty-fourth country to do so. Our ratification represents our contribution towards the entry into force of that historic Treaty  as well as an illustration of our firm commitment to a responsible global arms trade.Open and frozen conflicts  from Ukraine across the Middle East to Africa  pose a threat to durable global stability. Of particular concern is the fact that the escalation of violence typically causes humanitarian disasters and massive human rights violations. We fully advocate an urgent end to violence and a political dialogue that would lead to solutions in accordance with international law  the Charter of the United Nations and relevant United Nations resolutions. In that context  we believe that the United Nations and international community’s activities should place stronger emphasis on better utilizing preventive measures under Chapter VI of the Charter  with a special focus on mediation as a highly cost-effective tool for conflict prevention and the peaceful resolution of conflicts.I would like to reaffirm Montenegro’s strong commitment to the responsibility to protect as a matter of national priority. Montenegro welcomes the French initiative to seek a code of conduct on the use of the veto in situations of genocide  war crimes  crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing  and remains keen on putting that proposal into operation.The rule of law and the protection of civilians in peacekeeping missions are of particular importance  and we stand for the consistent implementation of the mandates of United Nations peacekeeping missions  to which we are ready to contribute. Unfortunately  terrorism still poses an enormous threat to international peace and security  as evidenced by current events in the Middle East. I consider it necessary to step up efforts at all levels in preventing terrorism  in accordance with international instruments and the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.Montenegro strongly promotes a sustainable development policy and  in line with our active participation in the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  we are committed to further contribute towards the elaboration of a transformative and ambitious post-2015 development framework. I think that the post-2015 development agenda must be based on an approach of respect for and the promotion of human rights  where human development will truly ensure that no one is neglected. Poverty eradication and sustainable prosperity for the benefit of all people and the planet must be the overarching objective and guide the design of a transformative development agenda.We strongly support the important United Nations mission implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) relating to human development  which essentially affirms fundamental human values. We are proud that two weeks ago  UNDP chose Montenegro to host the presentation of this year’s Human Development Report for the South-East Europe and Central Asia regions. We see this as a recognition of Montenegro’s progress  affirmation of human development  and proof of a reliable partnership between Montenegro and the United Nations.Finally  I wish to emphasize the fact that the United Nations has a responsible partner in Montenegro  which will continue to promote and pursue the goals and values fostered by the Charter."
"118",4789,"MNG",69,2014,"At the outset  Sir  may I join others in extending our heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his unanimous election as President General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. Mr. Kutesa can count on my delegation’s full support in the discharge of his enormous responsibilities in steering our work in the months ahead.The world is faced with multiple crises — violent conflicts in various parts of the world  terrorist activities by extremist groups  unprecedented epidemics and natural calamities. At this time of turmoil  we  as a family of nations  must rally around this world Organization as a centre of multilateralism  upholding the Charter of the United Nations and the universal principles of international law.We need peace and development. We need to do our utmost to implement the right of peoples to peace as emphasized by the Declaration on the Right of Peoples to Peace  adopted 30 years ago at the initiative of Mongolia. We have consistently supported the joint efforts of the international community against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Mongolia is a party to the majority of international counter-terrorism instruments. The seemingly unthinkable atrocities committed by the terrorist group called the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant pose alarming threats to regional peace and security. The international community must take resolute action to defeat these threats comprehensively and in compliance with the Charter of the United Nations.Mongolia commends the Secretary-General’s leadership in rallying international support and establishing the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response to ensure a rapid  effective and coherent response to the Ebola crisis. We support the Security Council and General Assembly resolutions to that effect.The situation in Ukraine should be resolved only through political dialogue  without the use of force. The current ceasefire needs to be made more sustainable; all efforts towards finding a solution  including the Putin plan outlined in Ulaanbaatar earlier this month  as well as the Minsk protocol of 5 September and its follow-up memorandum  should be taken into account.Just 25 years ago  Mongolia chose its development path  deciding to embrace the rule of law  democratic governance  a market economy and an open society. Although we are among the countries known as the third wave of democratization  the transition to democracy was in many respects unique in Mongolia. We made a simultaneous transition to democracy and a market economy. We made that transition peacefully. In 1990  democratic parliamentary elections were not only the first of their kind in the region  but they were fully free and fair. To ensure inclusive growth and citizens’ participation  a national policy on decentralization through direct democracy was introduced. As a result  citizens are now able to directly participate in identifying development priorities and allocations and monitoring local budgets.To identify a long-term development pathway and regain the confidence of investors  a number of multi-stakeholder events have been held in Mongolia — the Economic Forum  the Business Summit and Discover Mongolia. In addition  new laws  particularly on investment  investment funding and petroleum  and budget transparency  have been adopted.At the international level  Mongolia served as the Chair of the Fifth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies and the Community of Democracies. We currently chair the Freedom Online Coalition. It is the first time that an Asian country leads the Coalition. We support the Human Rights Council’s decision that Internet freedom is a basic human right. As a staunch advocate of democracy and freedom  Mongolia will use its opportunity as chair of the Coalition to promote  both nationally and internationally  an Internet that is free and secure for all.To support emerging democracies  Mongolia has set up an international cooperation fund. We have nothing to preach  but we have experience and lessons learned. We therefore shared with Kyrgyzstan our experience in parliamentary democracy and legal reform  and we held training sessions for Afghan diplomats and Myanmar journalists.Mongolia highly commends the Secretary-General’s leadership in galvanizing and catalysing global action on climate change. Climate change is not a challenge for the future; it is a matter of urgent Permanent Representativeiority today. Yesterday’s United Nations Climate Change Summit 2014 offered world leaders a unique opportunity to voice their commitments to cut the emission gap and to pledge their commitment to the two-degree scenario in the lead-up to the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate  to be held in Paris next year.But that pledge will remain a mere ambition if it is not backed up by bold action and strong political will. We are running out of time  but we cannot run out of planet Earth. The time to act is now. Moreover  the Green Climate Fund needs to be made fully operational. If resources are actually transferred as an incentive to countries that reduce their emission of greenhouse gases  that will have a multiplier effect. No one country is immune to climate change. Even my own country  Mongolia  which has a centuries-old tradition of living in harmony with nature  is experiencing its disproportionate effect. Conscious of that reality  Mongolia has recently adopted a green development policy. We expressed our support for the statement on carbon pricing  and for the New York Declaration on Forests to combat deforestation.This session of the General Assembly has the important task of articulating the post-2015 development agenda based on the legacy of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In that regard  we look forward to a synthesis report by the Secretary-General Permanent Representativeior to the intergovernmental negotiations for the sustainable development goals (SDGs) during this General Assembly session. We also welcome the outcome of the Open Working Group on SDGs and commend its hard work over the past 18 months. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development underscored the special challenges facing the most vulnerable countries  including landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). However  we believe that the outcome document of the Open Working Group could have better reflected the special needs of landlocked developing countries. We hope that the upcoming intergovernmental negotiations will redress that situation.In the run-up to the 10-year review of the Almaty Programme of Action  in June 2014 we hosted a high- level international workshop  “The World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade Facilitation: Implications for LLDCs.” We also joined the Intergovernmental Agreement on Dry Ports in order to become involved in regional connectivity. Facilitation of transit transportation  infrastructure development and reduction of trade barriers were among the issues discussed during the recent visits to Mongolia by President Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin. We agreed to expand our cooperation in those areas. Those agreements were reiterated at the first ever trilateral summit that brought together Mongolia  China and Russia on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Summit in Dushanbe earlier this month. The expansion of our cooperation with those two neighbours augurs well for regional trade and investment and paves the way for enhanced economic collaboration with our other neighbours.Mongolia is redoubling its efforts to join the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  to become a dialogue partner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and to constructively engage in the East Asia Summit. Last July we also signed an economic partnership agreement with Japan. Strengthening peace and stability in North-East Asia is one of our national security Permanent Representativeiorities. We firmly believe that dialogue and open discussions enhance confidence among nations. Following up on the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security  we have successfully hosted a series of fruitful platforms  including a meeting of women parliamentarians  an international research conference and a meeting of mayors from cities in North-East Asian countries.Stability on the Korean peninsula is crucial for maintaining regional peace and security. We support an early resumption of the Six-Party talks. As a country with a declared nuclear-weapon-free status  Mongolia firmly believes that the Korean Peninsula must be nuclear-weapon-free.In a time of major geopolitical change  the United Nations system must reflect new economic and political realities. We need to accelerate the reform process  including the long-overdue expansion of Security Council membership in both the permanent and the non-permanent categories. The issue of the Council’s working method is also important for all small States  which make up a majority in the United Nations.Out of 193 States Members  105 belong to the Forum of Small States. Of the 70 States that have never been elected as members of the Security Council  50 are small States  including my own country  Mongolia. As a responsible member of the international community  Mongolia has put forward its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council in the elections to be held in 2022  and is seeking the valuable support of its fellow members.In conclusion  I would like to express my confidence that this session of the General Assembly will be able to deliver a common development strategy beyond 2015  a strategy that will inspire and guide us to work collectively towards a safer  more equitable and prosperous future in the years to come."
"119",4830,"MOZ",69,2014,"It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Armando Emilio Guebuza  President of the Republic of Mozambique  who could not attend this gathering owing to national commitments. However  he wishes the General Assembly successful deliberations at this session.I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa  a distinguished son of our sisterly country  Uganda  on his unanimous election to preside over this session of the General Assembly. We firmly believe that his vision  wisdom and leadership will guide us to a comprehensive and results-oriented transformative development agenda. I assure him of the full support and collaboration of the delegation of Mozambique in the fulfilment of his noble mission.I also wish to pay tribute to Ambassador John William Ashe for his devotion and for the pragmatic manner in which he presided over the sixty-eighth session of this body  and for his relentless efforts constructively to guide the ongoing debate on the architecture of the next development agenda.The year 2015 will be a historic one  since the United Nations will reach the landmark celebration of its seventieth anniversary. That celebration will be enriched by the goal set in the year 2000 to halve poverty rates in the world by the year 2015  the conclusion of the next development agenda  and the adoption of a new framework for climate change. In that regard  we welcome the theme for this session  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  as it will enhance the ongoing deliberations under the United Nations umbrella on the next development agenda  galvanized by regional and subregional visions on that important topic.In our deliberations  the results and challenges experienced in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will undoubtedly be referenced in shaping the next development agenda. We recognize that much has been done in the framework of the MDGs. However  apart from accelerating the achievement of all goals  it is important to guarantee the sustainability of those that were achieved and accelerate the implementation of those that are still lagging behind. It is our strong belief that the principle of inclusiveness must also be taken into consideration in order to build a common vision and to ensure global commitments and shared responsibilities in the implementation of the next development agenda.To that end  Mozambique undertook a national consultation process on the post-2015 development agenda  a process that echoes our vision that sustainable development can be achieved only with a shared responsibility between Governments  civil society and the private sector. Mozambique’s national consultation process resulted in a robust call for the next development agenda to list the eradication of poverty as its overarching objective. To achieve that  it should ensure the promotion of equitable  sustainable and inclusive economic growth  focusing on women and youth.The consultation also emphasized the need for the eradication of poverty and hunger  translated into the improvement of living standards through access to better social services such as education  health  social welfare  safe drinking water  sanitation and energy; the preservation of peace and political stability  the promotion of democracy and the protection of human rights; economic diversification and transformation to speed up technological modernization in sectors such as agriculture  industry  tourism and infrastructures; the protection of marine and land biodiversity  including the sustainable use of natural resources; effective partnership for development  particularly for access to science  technology and innovation; further enhancement of North-South cooperation  in the framework of global partnership in order to commit the developed countries to meeting their internationally agreed development goals obligations; the strengthening of South-South cooperation; and  finally  agreement on a common methodology to monitor and evaluate national progress.In addition  the experiences and challenges we faced in the implementation of the MDGs — particularly in the accomplishment of Goal 8  “A global partnership for development” — underline the need for a greater commitment on the part of our development partners to increase their official development assistance  and for funding climate resilience and disaster-prevention efforts in developing countries. A transformative post-2015 development agenda should include the need to strengthen its financing mechanisms  concomitant with the need to raise the contribution for domestic financing. Those expectations coincide with the emerging common vision at the subregional  regional and global levels. Therefore  we have a premonition that the agenda will be adequately inclusive and bring the much-needed transformation to deliver a world that is truly fit for all.At this critical juncture  the successful conclusion of the Doha Development Round is a matter of urgency. Its contribution to the materialization of the development agenda as a whole cannot be overemphasized. In that regard  we are encouraged by the attempts of the World Trade Organization to restore the Doha negotiations and by the adoption of the Bali package  which are fundamental steps in the architecture of the Doha Round.We are also encouraged by the positive trends in the development of Africa. As the Secretary-General states in his report on the work of the Organization (A/69/1)  Africa continues to make steady development gains. Economic growth reached 4 per cent in 2013 and is projected to reach 5.3 per cent in 2014. Foreign direct investment increased  and substantial progress has been made towards the attainment of the MDGs.If those positive developments are to be sustained  a transformative development agenda should reflect Africa’s priorities and special needs  as expressed in its Common Position on the post-2015 development agenda. In addition  that encouraging environment can be possible only in the context of peace  political stability  democracy and respect for human rights. Therefore  we regret that conflict prevention  peacekeeping and the rebuilding of war-torn States remain among the most complex challenges facing the United Nations and the international community at large.Indeed  this session takes place in the context of grave instability and conflicts in the world  with enormous economic costs and severe humanitarian consequences that are unacceptable. Additionally  the complexity of some conflicts poses a challenge to the authority of the United Nations and consequently undermines the founding principles of the Organization as well as the role of multilateralism in addressing global concerns.We have been challenged by the dramatic evolution in the strands of terrorism threats  which spare no part of the world. Therefore  Mozambique welcomes the adoption  at the 7272nd meeting of the Security Council  held on 24 September  of resolution 2178 (2014)  which calls for an urgent boost in international cooperation to prevent the support and flow of terrorist fighters to and from conflict zones.As we craft our collective strategy to deal with all forms and manifestation of that human scourge  we should not lose sight of the following elements. First is the need to strengthen multilateral approaches in full compliance with the Charter of the United Nations. Secondly  the root causes of terrorism must be addressed  as that scourge cannot and should not be associated with any religion  nationality or civilization. Thirdly  it is necessary to address the underlying conditions  such as poverty  injustice  social exclusion and marginalization  that serve as fertile ground for extremist ideologies to breed and thrive.In an interdependent and globalized world  multilateralism refers to the collective and cooperative actions needed to address global challenges in a transparent  inclusive and effective manner  thereby contributing to order  stability and predictability. In that context  the United Nations must be strengthened in order to continue effectively to play its role as the epicentre of multilateralism. Today more than ever before  we must take concrete actions to reinforce the strategic role of the United Nations in the architecture of the global world.Notwithstanding the prevailing challenges to the maintenance of international peace and security  we are encouraged by the efforts in place for the restoration of peace and stability in Mali  Somalia  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  the Central African Republic  the Sudan and South Sudan. We are also encouraged by the latest developments in Guinea-Bissau as a result of the general elections that prompted the promising first steps towards much-needed political stability — a precondition for that sisterly country to progress towards socioeconomic development. These achievements call our attention to the importance of cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and the African Union and with the subregional bodies in effectively addressing the range of conflict-management problems through preventive diplomacy and mediation initiatives that allow for rapid responses to regional and subregional crises.The principle of the right to self-determination continues to be central to the full enjoyment of human rights. In that context  the United Nations ought to continue to be engaged in the fulfilment of those rights by the peoples of Palestine and Western Sahara. Mozambique reiterates its full support for a just and lasting solution to the problem of Palestine through peaceful means  in accordance with international law and all the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.With regard to Western Sahara  we are encouraged to note the initiative taken by the Chairperson of the African Union in appointing His Excellency Mr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano  former President of the Republic of Mozambique  as a special envoy to the five permanent members of the Security Council plus Spain  in an effort to step up the search for a solution that will ensure the fulfilment of the right of the Saharan people to self-determination  for which Mozambique reaffirms its unconditional support.As I mentioned at the beginning of my statement  the advent of 2015 represents a historic opportunity for the United Nations to reshape global commitments in many ways. As we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the Organization  we must use the momentum to take concrete steps to accelerate  in a sustained manner  the ongoing process of reforms in the Organization  in particular the reform of the Security Council.The inability of the United Nations to solve conflict situations and political instability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe poses a challenge to its authority as the universal entity and multilateral political forum for fostering dialogue in a multilateral framework. The situation is worsened by the lack of substantive progress in the reform of the Security Council  almost 15 years after the international community recommitted itself to that important endeavour. It is our hope that at its sixty-ninth session the General Assembly will deliver the much-awaited reform to democratize its representation and working methods and to strengthen its role in conflict prevention and the promotion of international peace and security.Freedom of choice with regard to political systems and to trade is an inalienable right of all States  irrespective of their size. In that connection  the need to bring to an end the economic  commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba continues to be a matter of concern  for it is politically motivated and hinders the socioeconomic development of Cuba. For those reasons  Mozambique joins all those countries that demand the immediate termination of that unfair unilateral measure.Mozambique is fully committed to the global agenda for peace and security  democracy and sustainable development. At the national level that commitment is translated into our political will to strengthen democracy in the country and to adopt a poverty-reduction strategy that is people-centred and promotes sustainable development. The regularity with which elections at different levels are held shows our unquestionable determination to consolidate the democratic system and defend its underlying values. As a result  on 15 October Mozambique will hold its fifth multiparty general elections to elect the President and the Parliament  and its second elections for provincial parliaments.In the economic sphere  Mozambique has enjoyed steady economic growth for more than a decade. Coupled with the support of our development partners  including the United Nations  that has allowed for an improvement in social services delivery and enabled us to be on track to attain the majority the MDGs. In addition  recently discovered natural resources represent a challenge and an opportunity to further advance national socioeconomic progress. The development of new sources of clean and renewable energy such as bio-fuels is a priority for the Government  and due attention is being paid to prevent competition with food-production initiatives.Therefore  we are emphasizing the following areas: the improvement of agriculture production and productivity in a sector that will continue to play a key role in our development efforts; human capital development to address the new emerging economic challenges; and the promotion of a strong private sector to take advantage of the opportunities brought about by the discovery and exploitation of natural resources. It is our firm conviction that  with peace and stability  we will continue successfully to address the development challenges facing Mozambique  which have poverty eradication and sustainable development at their epicentre.Finally  as part of our commitment to peace and stability  in June Mozambique hosted the third Review Conference of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction  also known as the Ottawa Convention. I should like to take this opportunity to thank all participants as well as all partners that contributed to making that event a success  because it was. We are engaged in continuing our efforts to declare the country free of landmines and thus to contribute to the fulfilment of one of the most important steps in our obligations under the Convention.To conclude  I wish to reiterate Mozambique’s commitment to continue to be engaged in international efforts to address current global problems."
"120",4876,"MRT",69,2014,"On behalf of the African Union and of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania  I am pleased to express to you  Sir  my warmest congratulations and my best wishes on the occasion of your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I trust that your good judgement and your competence  as well as your extensive experience in the diplomatic leadership of your brotherly country  Uganda  constitute the best guarantee for the good conduct and success of the work of our current session.I am also pleased to point out the remarkable work of your predecessor  Mr. John Ashe  during his leadership of the proceedings of the previous session. I would also like to express my warmest thanks to His Excellency the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his tireless efforts for international peace and security and for his approach in support of dialogue as the best way to address the current international issues.The General Assembly has always been a forum for the exchange of opinions and the discussion of important international issues that affect the lives of nations and people. That explains the privileged status that it has gained within the different institutions of the United Nations system. This annual meeting  which brings leaders together  is a valuable opportunity to seek a common understanding for a global vision  ensuring proposals for efficient solutions to the current international problems that respond to the expectations of people around the world.In that regard  I am pleased to address this audience and to present to the world  through this forum  what we Africans have done in terms of achievements and development  the challenges facing our young continent  our expectations of the international community and our aspirations in terms of an effective contribution to addressing the current situation  humanity and the building of its future.Several countries of the African continent have experienced high levels of growth despite the severe economic crisis that still prevails in the world. The average growth rate in the continent has reached 5 per cent and is nearing 6 per cent. That economic recovery is the result  among other factors  of the wise economic policies adopted by African Governments. The promotion of local and foreign investment  the building of new infrastructure and greater attention to the most vulnerable members of society have therefore been encouraged. Similarly  projects and income-generating activities have been supported  thereby contributing efficiently to the reduction of unemployment  in particular among young people and women. Africa is working tirelessly to change from a consumption space to a production zone in order to ensure employment opportunities for millions of its people.The achievement of food self-sufficiency  the development of agricultural industries and poverty reduction in rural areas are core objectives of the African Union. In that regard  the agriculture and animal resources sector has received great interest during successive African summits. The year 2014 has therefore been declared the Year of Agriculture and Food Security in Africa. The agriculture sector employs some 60 per cent of the workforce and represents one third of the gross domestic product of the continent.In that context  the African summit recommended that 10 per cent of the budget of African States be allocated to the development of the agriculture sector. African Governments have recognized the importance of food security and adopted efficient policies for the development of that vital sector. Such policies have achieved their objectives and have enabled some African countries to be self-sufficient in various agricultural products  while other countries are making steady progress on that path. They  too  are therefore becoming self-sufficient.In Africa  we seek fruitful cooperation with our partners  thereby opening international markets to our agricultural products and  in that way  developing our capacities for agricultural research and providing access to developed technologies and techniques for the preservation of the environment.When the Millennium Development Goals were adopted in 2000  Africa did not have a common vision for the major development issues. Its voice was therefore not adequately heard. Despite that  we have worked seriously and energetically to achieve those Goals. Today  Africa speaks with one voice and seeks to promote development in order to become a healthy region free of scourges  wars and conflicts  where justice  good governance and respect for human rights prevail.In that regard  African leaders have taken important decisions on core issues for the continent  including the vision of the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the post-2015 development agenda  which focuses on the development of human resources and the eradication of poverty  epidemics and deadly diseases. It must be pointed out that the fight against AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis has been strengthened through the many programmes that have helped to promote actions to reduce the effects of such scourges.Despite such efforts  the indicators in the health sector lead us to exert every effort to strengthen our health-care system  to improve access to its services and to develop its human resources and infrastructure. In that context  African Heads of State recently launched a strong initiative to fight AIDS. The sudden outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa constitutes a major challenge owing to the rapid spread of the disease and the tragic fate of its victims. The steps taken to contain the spread of that scourge remain inadequate and are not sufficiently effective. Every day that passes until an appropriate treatment for the disease is discovered increases the number of victims and causes it to spread to new areas. Despite the measures adopted and the efforts made  to date  Africa has not managed to successfully deal with the epidemic.I therefore appeal to the international community from this rostrum to work efficiently to provide necessary vaccines for people affected by the Ebola virus  to support measures to control its prevention and spread  and to increase investments in the field of scientific research in virology and endemic diseases  as well as to provide assistance to countries affected by that scourge. In this context  we welcome the actions and initiatives taken by some States and international organizations on behalf of the countries affected by the spread of this disease.The phenomenon of illegal immigration and the tragedies it engenders daily prompt us to take strong action to find efficient and rapid solutions. We cannot simply count the bodies that wash up onto the beaches or undertake rescue operations at sea for thousands of migrants crammed in unsafe boats. Illegal immigration is a complex phenomenon. It is the cumulative result of economic factors and practices linked to organized crime. Consequently  no matter how closely we patrol our borders and no matter how rigorous our laws  we will not be able to prevent waves of migrants from moving from south to north. Appropriate solutions must be found that take into account the real causes of the phenomenon and that guarantee African youth increased employment opportunities and a dignified life.Good governance is a necessary precondition for successful development efforts. The African political elite is fully aware of that fact and is committed to promoting collective freedom and consolidating democracy as the best means for managing public affairs. The African Union has taken preventive measures against attempts at usurping power by non-democratic means  including by encouraging democratic practices  establishing pluralism and organizing many transparent elections.In its very essence  democracy implies the participation of all sectors of civil society. The nature of African societies has therefore required positive discrimination on behalf of women  allowing them access to elective office and leadership positions in order to ensure gener equality. In the same context  youth enjoys priority in development plans and in the political  social and economic policies of African countries. It is estimated that the population of the continent will reach 3 billion at the threshold of 2050; two thirds of that total will be youth. That demographic  specific to the continent  calls for a new focus on investments in infrastructure and social services  and for prioritizing such sectors as housing  employment  human resources  diversification of energy sources and health. Focus must also be placed on aligning teaching and vocational training with market needs  which will contribute to controlling unemployment and allowing youth to showcase their talents. In fact  unemployment in our societies stems less from inadequate employment opportunities than from the gap between the numbers of those trained and the actual needs of the job market.With respect to security  we are currently facing many dangers  including the multiplication of hot spots  terrorism  organized crime and trafficking in drugs  arms and people — not only in Africa  but throughout the world. All those dangers have a cross-border nature. Some African regions have been particularly vulnerable due to the weakness of their democratic practice  the spread of ethnic conflicts  economic crises with their attendant social tensions  and the precarious situation of their educational systems  which exercerbates youth unemployment and deviation.In order to address such challenges  the African Union has established efficient mechanisms that rely on the African peace and security architecture  including the Peace and Security Council and the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises. Despite those efforts and achievements  the fight against terrorism remains an international responsibility that calls for close cooperation among all members of the international community. It is clear that no country alone can eradicate the phenomenon of terrorism.The fruitful cooperation between the United Nations Security Council and the African Council for Peace and Security has proved effective in resolving many of the armed conflicts on our continent. Despite such efforts  however  the resolution of the situation in Somalia remains complex. Similarly  the situations in Libya  northern Nigeria and Central Africa are cause for genuine concern. In Libya  unfortunately  the situation continues to deteriorate  foreshadowing a civil war that could split the country apart  driving its people into exile and threatening to spill over into neighbouring countries. The international community must intercede to help the Libyans reach a peaceful and consensual solution that guarantees that country’s unity and stability. In northern Nigeria  the Boko Haram movement continues to murder innocent people  kidnap women and destroy entire villages. Africa and the rest of the international community must join forces and take decisive action to eliminate that terrorist group  which threatens the whole region.In the Central African Republic  the efforts of the African peacekeeping force  with the support of friendly forces  helped stop the massacres and prevented the conflict from evolving into a full-fledged civil war. However  persistent tension between the factions requires us to encourage Central African stakeholders to use this stage of the transition build trust and to overcome the remaining obstacles to that country’s peace and stability.Such situations should not lead us to overlook the peacebuilding progress that has been achieved in many conflict regions. In that regard  we commend and welcome the advances registered in the region of the Great Lakes  in northern Mali and in the Republic of South Sudan.The Sahel was one of the first African regions to experience the phenomenon of terrorism. But thanks to the close security cooperation among the countries of the region and to international solidarity  the terrorists were repelled and the activities of illegal trafficking networks were paralysed. In North Mali  too  Africans have robustly addressed a difficult situation. Thus  several countries of the continent  along with international friendly forces  deterred terrorist groups. The risk of terrorism was eliminated from key areas from which criminal terrorist operations had been launched. The French intervention was decisive and timely. Likewise  history will remember the great sacrifices that continue to be made by the brave soldiers of Chad.However  the region is still exposed to security risks  which for the moment are relatively contained. The eradication of terrorism in the Sahel region constitutes a major challenge additional to those impeding development and poverty reduction. There is a close correlation between development and security  because it is impossible to conceive of sustainable development without security  or security without integrated development.In that regard  the countries of the region are aware of the need  on the one hand  to create a regional framework to coordinate development efforts and  on the other  to combat the dangers of terrorism and cross-border crime. Therefore  the Group of Five countries of the Sahel was created at the summit meeting of member States held in Nouakchott in February. The international community is invited to join Africans in their hopes and legitimate aspirations for peace  security and sustainable development.The conflict in the Middle East  which escalates from time to time  with no hope of achieving a clear and definite solution despite multiple Arab and international initiatives  constitutes an ongoing danger to world peace. The parties in conflict must agree to make sacrifices  even painful ones. The international community must also ramp up pressure and act swiftly to find a fair solution to the conflict on the basis of relevant international resolutions  including those that guarantee the Palestinian people the establishment of an independent State  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.Furthermore  the dangerous situations in Syria and Iraq that have been created by the expansion of terrorism are causes of grave concern for the international community. We welcome the recent measures taken to combat terrorist groups in Iraq  and we invite the parties to the Syrian conflict to renounce violence and engage in negotiations to avoid further destruction to their country. The crisis in Ukraine must likewise be resolved peacefully and quickly in order to preserve global peace and to prevent the situation from generating tensions between the major Powers.The African continent seeks to strengthen its presence in international forums and institutions  commensurate with its size and role  in order to make them more representative of its peoples and nations. Although the General Assembly is an international institution in which all countries are represented equally  the status of permanent member of the Security Council remains the monopoly of a restricted number of countries. That privilege  which dates back to the Second World War of the last century  no longer reflects international geopolitical reality and does not take into account the profound transformations that have taken place throughout the world. Today  Africa occupies an important position in the world and plays a distinctive role within the international community  making it a candidate for permanent representation on the Security Council. It is therefore critical to engage as soon as possible in negotiations on the rules for expanding both permanent and non-permanent representation on the Security Council.The establishment of justice at the international level also entails reform of the world economic system to make it more equitable through greater promotion of the role of the United Nations in efforts to increase transparency  improve regulation of the financial system and promote the investment necessary to sustainable development.Finally  I offer my sincere thanks for the efforts made to ensure the success of this session. Attaining the lofty aims for which the United Nations was established remains dependent on the freedom of the world’s people to exercise their right to development  advancement and progress so that all humankind may live in dignity  freedom  justice and equality."
"121",4922,"MUS",69,2014,"The year 2015 will be a crucial one for the United Nations and the international community. In the coming year  we will reach the deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals and adopt a post-2015 development agenda  which will include our sustainable development goals. In 2015  we should adopt a new  legally binding global climate agreement. And the international community will also commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.At this juncture  we have to ask ourselves to what extent we have achieved the ideals set out in the Charter of the United Nations  and what is still to be done. We must also ask to what extent the institutional framework laid down almost 70 years ago is still valid today. Inequality  both among and within nations  is still a matter for great concern. In spite of the constant references to the rule of law at national and international levels  we still do not always have the possibility of recourse to machinery adequate to resolving legal disputes between States. Within the United Nations itself  the principle of equality is not always honoured  whether in its constitutional framework or in practice. The twin pillars of peace and security  on the one hand  and development  on the other  as established by the Charter  have been undermined by the ascendancy of political issues at the expense of those of development  which are still often seen largely in terms of safeguarding dominant interests rather than from a perspective of global cooperation. Inequality and vulnerability are increasing in rich and poor countries alike. Unemployment  precarious employment  lack of social protection  access to human development services and financial services are still matters of universal concern.The post-2015 development agenda cannot be only about human rights — civil  political  economic — at the national level; it must also ensure that the right to development is upheld at the international level. As we work on a new  comprehensive development agenda  we must ensure that no right is ignored and no one is left behind. The United Nations System Task Team on the Post-2015 United Nations Development Agenda has proposed that the transformative efforts to achieve inclusive  people-centred sustainable development be guided by three fundamental principles — human rights  equality and sustainability — and have four core dimensions: inclusive social development  environmental sustainability  inclusive economic development and peace and security. Mauritius is in broad agreement with those core principles and dimensions  as outlined in the Team’s report Realizing the Future We Want for All  for guiding this transformation at both the national and international levels. The war against Ebola demands robust action from all of us and requires exceptional international cooperation. We welcome the initiatives announced last week  and we commit ourselves to giving our full support to addressing this global challenge.The water we drink  the food we eat and the energy we require are vital to meaningful development. It is estimated that by 2025  1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity  and two thirds of the world’s population could be living under water-stress conditions. One in eight people in the world today — 842 million — are undernourished. Approximately 2 billion suffer from micronutrient deficiencies. In 2030  it is estimated that food demand will have increased by more than 50 per cent. In that regard  Mauritius supports the Secretary-General’s call for a Zero Hunger Challenge. Promoting sustainable agriculture must therefore be an essential component of the new development framework. It is also estimated that by 2035  global energy demand will have increased by at least 33 per cent. Currently  1.2 billion people have no access to electricity. Those growing demands will make water  food and energy crucial issues not only on the development agenda but also in the wider context of international peace and security. The international community should support developing countries  particularly vulnerable countries such as small island developing States (SIDS)  in their efforts to promote water governance and integrated water resources management  increase the share of renewables in the energy mix and improve energy conservation and efficiency.In order to support global development  it is crucial that we have an international regime based on structured global cooperation designed to promote technology facilitation  and a technology facilitation mechanism established under the auspices of the United Nations could play a central role in that regard. It is also important that the international community recognize the vital role of women and young people and their enhanced participation and leadership in all areas of sustainable development. Promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment should be a core issue on the post-2015 development agenda. All sections of the population should be at the heart of a people-centred vision of sustainable development.The contributions of all the initiatives launched at the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)  including the Open Working Group for Sustainable Development Goals  the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing  and options for a technology facilitation mechanism  should feed into the preparations for a 2015 development summit. They should also be included in the Secretary-General’s synthesis report. The deliberations of the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  mandated by the Rio+20 outcome document (resolution 66/288  annex)  should be reflected in the synthesis report and the post-2015 development agenda.Since accountability is essential to assessing progress  the post-2015 development agenda should also include an accountability framework that would be universal but flexible enough to take into account different capacities and responsibilities. And we need more accountable and equitable global economic governance that ensures wider  more inclusive participation in decision-making. The United Nations  given its universal membership  should assume leadership and a proactive role in promoting sound and equitable governance in a more resilient global economic architecture.Beyond those immediate concerns  there are a number of longer-term threats that may dramatically affect all of us  particularly SIDS. One of them is climate change. Climate risks are real and must be addressed. From melting glaciers to more frequent wildfires and intense cyclones  flash floods  extreme heatwaves and ocean acidification  the challenges are not a future threat; they already exist. The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  Climate Change 2014: Impacts  Adaptation  and Vulnerability  made it clear that an increase in the world’s temperature of 2°C would be dangerous  while one of 4°C would be catastrophic. Climate risks are global challenges that require global solutions. Climate change poses risks to global economic prosperity  development and security as well as to the environment. We must build on the momentum of the Climate Summit and use the opportunity of the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Lima  to raise the level of ambition in the lead-up to a new universal climate agreement in Paris next year.The strong connections between climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction should be recognized. No country is immune to natural disasters  but it is the most vulnerable countries and people who are hit the hardest. Mauritius looks forward to a renewed and ambitious international framework for disaster risk management that establishes disaster risk reduction as a key element of the post-2015 development agenda. We also believe that the exogenous risks of climate change and natural disasters should be integrated into mainstream economic thinking and assessment of macroeconomic risks.We welcome the decision of the most recent Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting to establish a Commonwealth climate finance skills hub  to be hosted by Mauritius. It will address critical gaps in building the capacity of SIDS and least-developed countries to identify  access and manage climate finance. The special circumstances  vulnerabilities and low resilience of SIDS should be taken into account with regard to financing and trade issues. SIDS need special and differential treatment to access concessionary sources of financing for sustainable development and to effectively participate in multilateral trade. Mauritius strongly supports SIDS-SIDS partnerships. SIDS can build on their commonality of interests to share experiences  pool resources and act collectively in commissioning technology or formulating legal and regulatory frameworks  for instance.The oceans are the new frontier for economic development. For SIDS in particular  they are the best scope for expanding economic space. Following a national dialogue on the ocean economy  the Government of Mauritius has published the Road Map for the Mauritian Ocean Economy. The Road Map sets out the vision  goals and strategies for the development and expansion of a new pillar of our economy. In order to provide the best possible conditions for investors to operate and create wealth  Mauritius is putting in place an enabling environment that will support our ocean economy through an integrated and holistic approach to ensure coherence and balance among economic growth  social development and environmental protection.Promoting the ocean economy will unleash the potential for SIDS with respect to all ocean-related economic activities  both onshore and offshore. It will also enable them to enhance their nations’ food security  harness the winds and waves for their energy needs  develop new ocean-related industries and services that will create opportunities for entrepreneurs and youth employment.It is essential that we strike a balance between the various uses of the oceans and the need to protect our oceans. At the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  held in Samoa  the international community agreed to build upon existing partnerships and promote new ones in order to expand the economic space of large ocean States. We wish to reiterate our call for the United Nations to adopt a global oceans strategy that will be the operational counterpart to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). While it will be for individual States to decide on their own ocean economy policies  the global ocean strategy will provide an overall vision and framework for the sustainable development of ocean-related economic activities for policymakers  investors and all stakeholders.The situation in the Middle East and in certain parts of Africa could not only have dramatic consequences for the people of these regions  but also impact on global development and peace. We urge the international community to spare no effort in resolving the plight of the people of Palestine. Mauritius supports the two-State solution to the conflict. The people of the State of Palestine have suffered for too long from the grave injustice done to them  and must be allowed to live in dignity and peace within recognized borders.If it is to remain credible and play the constructive role it can and must play in the new world order  the United Nations must respond to the call of its membership for reform. We have a duty to engage in meaningful discussions on the reform of the Security Council  the revitalization of the General Assembly and the working methods of our Organization. Mauritius reaffirms its commitment to the African Common Position that reform of the Security Council should include expansion in the permanent and non-permanent categories alike. The historical injustice done to Africa should be redressed  and Africa should be accorded permanent representation on the Council. Latin America also deserves permanent representation  and the SIDS should be entitled to a seat on the Council. Mauritius further reiterates its support for India’s rightful aspiration to a permanent seat in a reformed Security Council.In the mid-1960s  when a wave of decolonization was sweeping across the world  the United Kingdom purported to create a new colony  the so-called British Indian Ocean Territory  by carving out part of the territory of Mauritius. Thus  part of Mauritian territory remains under colonial rule. As long as part of Mauritian territory remains under colonial rule  the decolonization of Africa will still remain incomplete. The dismemberment by the United Kingdom of part of the territory of Mauritius prior to independence was and continues to be a blatant breach of international law and total disregard of United Nations resolutions.Speaking before the Assembly last week  President Obama said that there was“one vision of the world in which might makes right” [but that] “America stands for something different. We believe that right makes might  that bigger nations should not be able to bully smaller ones” (A/69/PV.6  p. 10).This is why  last year in this very forum (see A/68/PV.18)  Mauritius urged the United States to be on the right side of history  and not condone illegal acts by maintaining its presence on Diego Garcia under an unlawful arrangement with the United Kingdom that has no valid title to the island  but and instead to ensure that  in the future  the United States presence is on the right side of the law.Both the United States and the United Kingdom should recognize the sovereignty of Mauritius over the Chagos archipelago  and engage in meaningful discussions with Mauritius in good faith over arrangements to be made in that regard. Following the statements we have heard over the past year with regard to sovereignty and territorial integrity  there should not be one set of standards for one part of the world and a different one for another part of the world. Those who show no respect for fundamental principles across the board lose all moral authority to preach to the rest of the world. Following bilateral discussions on Tromelin  which forms an integral part of the territory of Mauritius  Mauritius and France agreed on interim measures without prejudice to the sovereignty of Mauritius. An agreement reached in a spirit of cooperation and dialogue is a step in the right direction.As we embark on a new session that could herald a new chapter in the history of the United Nations  we should renew our commitment to multilateral cooperation for peace  development and prosperity for all nations in the new agenda to be adopted next year."
"122",4959,"MWI",69,2014,"Allow me to begin by congratulating Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I have no doubt that his election at this juncture will bring to the notice of the world some of the problems and opportunities that exist in Africa. Malawi and Uganda have enjoyed cordial relations for a long time and my Government and my delegation will do all we can to support him in that very important position.Let me also take the opportunity to congratulate his predecessor  Ambassador John William Ashe  for guiding the work of the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly with skill and pragmatism. I would also like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the steady manner in which he continues to guide our global Organization.On 20 May  my country held its first ever tripartite elections  which enabled Malawians to choose their political leadership through a democratic and peaceful process. The elections ushered me into office as the fifth President of the Republic of Malawi. I would therefore like to inform the Assembly that  despite a few challenges  the elections were free  fair  transparent and credible. In that vein  let me seize the opportunity to thank all the electoral stakeholders  both local and international  for their dedication to ensuring successful elections in my country. Malawi has come out of the election much stronger than before.On 6 July  Malawi commemorated the golden jubilee of its independence. As we commemorate the 50 years of peace  law and order  we have tasked ourselves with taking stock of the development that the country has registered since 1964  as well as the challenges that the country faces today. Much of the country has made some progress in diverse sectors of our national development  but there is still more to be done in order to uplift the living standards of the many Malawians who continue to remain below the poverty line. They too dream of a better future  which is possible only if we work with unity of purpose. In a quest to take development to the micro level  my Government has embarked on a journey to transform Malawi so as to ensure the delivery of satisfactory services to Malawians  especially the poor and the marginalized.As the Assembly is aware  Malawi was the chair of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) from August 2013 until August 2014. During our term of office  we strove as a region to achieve long-lasting peace and stability in our countries. In that vein  let me commend my country  Malawi  and the countries of Madagascar and South Africa for holding peaceful and credible elections.The SADC group has been undertaking a number of efforts aimed at ending the cycle of conflicts and violence in the region. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo  SADC deployed the Force Intervention Brigade  comprising troops from Malawi  South Africa and Tanzania  under the auspices of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  as authorized under Security Council resolution 2098 (2013). The SADC group  as well as the international community  is pleased with the success achieved in getting the Mouvement du 23 mars and other negative forces to leave the country and surrender. In Madagascar  SADC played a crucial role in bringing back constitutional normalcy in the country.In terms of international peace and security  I would like to inform this gathering that Malawi has always supported the disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. To that end  we have supported resolutions in the General Assembly aimed at nuclear disarmament. Over and above that  a couple of months ago  my country held an in-country workshop to come up with mechanisms to implement Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) at the national level to prevent the proliferation of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery.On the same subject  in the Middle East  Malawi has always been disheartened and disappointed by the continuing violence and loss of life and property resulting from the conflict between Israel and Palestine. That cannot go on forever. We trust that the two-State solution to the conflict  with Israel and Palestine living side by side  in peace and harmony  is the only viable way to achieve lasting peace in the region. We encourage both sides to the dispute to renounce violence  exercise utmost restraint and employ dialogue as the sure tool to reach a political settlement.As for the post-2015 development agenda  the choice of “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda” as the theme for the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly could not be more appropriate. The fight against poverty  hunger and inequality constitutes the greatest challenge of our time. The theme further augurs well for the future in relation to the plans and aspirations of the people of Malawi.Malawi appreciates the consultative nature of the process followed in designing the post-2015 development agenda. Let me therefore commend the Secretary-General’s initiatives to ensure an inclusive process that will lead to the post-2015 development agenda. With financial and technical support from the United Nations  more than 50 countries have conducted national consultations  in which people provided input and direction on the post-2015 development framework. I am pleased that Malawi was one of the countries selected for those national consultations. The post-2015 development agenda should reflect the needs and priorities of the developing world.It is important that the next global development agenda draw lessons from the successes and challenges of the current blueprint being used  namely  the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Rather than seeing 2015 as an end point  we must think of it as the beginning of a new era  an era in which we eradicate extreme poverty  protect the environment and promote economic opportunity for all. The MDGs have played an important role in concentrating our efforts around the common purpose of eradicating poverty. They have raised public awareness about the unacceptable levels of poverty and have helped mobilize action towards a fairer world. The MDGs provided a common framework for monitoring progress  highlighting areas of achievement as well as challenges.Malawi is on track for achieving four of the eight MDGs  namely  reducing child mortality; combating HIV/AIDS  malaria and other diseases; ensuring environmental sustainability; and developing a global partnership for development. However  we are unlikely to meet the other four goals  namely  eradicating extreme poverty and hunger; achieving universal access to education; ensuring gender equality and the empowerment of women; and improving maternal health. Malawi will therefore be proceeding to the post-2015 development agenda with unfinished business from the MDGs.One reason why developing countries like Malawi have failed to achieve all of the Millennium Development Goals is inadequate resources. Commitments made by development partners have been unpredictable and have often gone unfulfilled. To achieve delivery of the post-2015 development agenda  the global community should not repeat that mistake. More importantly  accountability and transparency  as well as monitoring and evaluation mechanisms  should be promoted. It is therefore imperative that  as we move closer to welcoming the new global development agenda  we should all be mindful of the importance of global partnership for effective development cooperation. That would ensure the agenda’s successful implementation in developing countries.The post-2015 development agenda should not be seen as a one-size-fits-all global development framework. Malawi is looking forward to a framework that is shared  but differentiated enough  where developing countries  depending on their special needs and unique characteristics  will have flexibility in implementing programmes. My delegation is pleased with the tremendous progress made thus far in defining the post-2015 development agenda. It is in that context that I would like to reiterate and confirm Malawi’s commitment to achieving sustainable development in three interconnected dimensions  namely  economic development  including the end of extreme poverty; social inclusion; and environmental sustainability.I am convinced that Member States gathered here today will own the outcome document of the post-2015 development agenda and will be committed to its full implementation. It is also encouraging to note that the sustainable development goals that emanated from the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals have incorporated the development concerns of both the developed and developing world.With respect to Security Council reform  the year 2015 will mark  as the General Assembly is aware  the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. As such  it will be an occasion for all of us to bring new energy into the Organization and carry out the important reforms that we have been calling for since its inception. For instance  the limited representation in the Security Council is a source of great concern  particularly in the light of the challenges of the twenty-first century. Only by expanding the number of permanent and non-permanent members of the Council and by including developing countries in both categories will we be able to solve some of the legitimacy deficits under which the Council is currently labouring.In conclusion  I would submit that the centre of the post-2015 development agenda should be to address the plight of hitherto disadvantaged groups  such as women  girls and persons with disabilities. It is a well-known fact that the ugly face of poverty manifests itself through women  girls and persons with disabilities. It is sad that Africa  the continent to which Malawi belongs  shares the following worrisome statistics in terms of human development. First  its share of global poverty is as high as 30 per cent. Secondly  40 per cent of the continent’s children under 5 are stunted in their growth. Thirdly  Africa’s share of global child mortality amounts to 50 per cent. Finally  50 per cent of Africa’s children are not in school.I urge that the post-2015 development agenda give priority to those challenges for redress. Africa has already spoken clearly about its priorities through the Common African Position on the post-2015 development agenda and through the African Union’s Agenda 2063  which aspires to achieve a prosperous  peaceful and integrated Africa.In that vein  I wish to call on all stakeholders to join the global partnership for effective development cooperation principles by implementing and delivering on a transformative post-2015 development agenda. Malawi will use its position as Chair of the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation to help realize that cause."
"123",5005,"MYS",69,2014,"I would like to begin by congratulating the President on his election. His wisdom and experience will stand him in good stead as he guides the General Assembly.I would like to pay tribute to the health workers who are fighting Ebola in West Africa. Malaysia was able to contribute more than 20 million rubber gloves to help the doctors and nurses who are working to stop the outbreak. Our prayers are with them.I also wish to thank all those who came to Malaysia’s aid in this difficult year. Flights MH-370 and MH-17 were tragedies that will stay with us forever. As we mourn the loss of life  we take heart from the compassion shown by our friends. Their support will not be forgotten. We thank our friends and allies who are giving their time and their resources to help find Flight MH-370. Men and women continue to risk their lives searching the deepest oceans. We owe them our gratitude and our commitment. We will not give up the search. We are also grateful to our international partners that are working together to investigate the loss of Flight MH-17. Malaysia will continue to seek justice for those who died. We urge all parties to continue to cooperate with the investigation. We also hope that those two tragedies will change the global aviation system for the better and that nations will unite behind new standards for aircraft tracking and overflying conflict zones.Four years ago  I stood before the General Assembly and called for a global movement of moderates to counter extremism (see A/65/PV.19). Last year  I spoke of the conflict between Sunni and Shia that is tearing the Muslim world apart (see A/68/PV.18). Now those two forces — violent extremism and religious intolerance — have joined hands beneath a black flag. Two countries fractured by war face a new threat — a self-declared Islamic State. Its victims are Sunni and Shia  Yazidi and Kurd — anyone who will not bow before the sword.That so-called State  torn from existing nations with violence  rules by violence. Its authority is maintained by forced conversions and public executions. Its militants have destroyed lives and communities. They have destabilized fragile nations and threatened regional security. Yet their dark ambition stretches further still. They challenge the very notion of the State. They call to our youth with the siren song of illegitimate jihad. They demand that all Muslims swear allegiance to their so-called caliph. That demand will never be met. We reject the so-called Islamic State. We reject such a State defined by extremism. We condemn the violence being committed in the name of Islam.Around the world  Muslims have watched in despair as our religion — a religion of peace — has been used to justify atrocities. We have turned away in horror at the crucifixions and the beheadings. We have mourned the sons who have been stolen and the daughters who have been sold. We know that the threat to world peace and security is not Islam but extremism — intolerant  violent and militant extremism. The actions of those militants are beyond conscience and belief. They violate the teachings of Islam  the example set by the Prophet Muhammad and the principles of Islamic law.As we speak  some Syrians and Iraqis are being forced to abandon their faith. Yet the Koran states: “There shall be no compulsion in religion” (The Holy Koran II:256). They are being forced from their homes and forced to convert to Islam. Yet the Koran says: “To you be your religion  and to me my religion” (ibid.  CIX:6). If they do not comply  they face death. Yet the protection of life is a fundamental precept of Islamic law  and the killing of civilians  even in war  is prohibited in Islam.The question is: How should we respond? In the past  when the world mobilized to fight extremists  we launched wars without planning for peace. We attacked one evil only to see a greater evil emerge. This time must be different. This time  we must defeat not only the extremists but also their ideas. We must confront the heresy of a State conceived by ungodly men and enforced through violence. In its place  we must advance the true Islam — the Islam founded on the principles of peace  tolerance and respect  as set out in the Koran  the Sunna and the Hadith. There are key things we must do.First  security and statehood must be returned to the people of Syria and Iraq. Malaysia co-sponsored Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) on foreign terrorist fighters to strengthen our commitment to galvanizing international action to combat terrorism. We call on the international community to stop the flow of money and recruits to extremist groups. We continue to offer humanitarian assistance under the ambit of the United Nations or internationally recognized bodies to those who are displaced by the fighting. Attacks on militant targets should  at all cost  avoid collateral damage.Secondly  we must pursue a different kind of politics. The emergence of such militants is a symptom of political failure  of poor governance in fragile States and the conflict that still rages between Sunni and Shia. We must break the cycle where one group gains power only to wield it against the other  and where marginalization leads to radicalization  as people lose confidence in the State’s ability to provide both security and coexistence. Individuals and ethnic and religious groups need to feel that they have a stake in a nation’s success  not its failure. We should therefore commit to more inclusive politics. That is a difficult task. It demands pragmatism and compromise and must come from within.Malaysia stands ready to share its experience in marginalizing extremism  in maintaining a multireligious country  where different faiths coexist and prosper  and in showing that Islam can not only succeed but also drive progress and development in a pluralistic society. Like all nations  we have had our growing pains. Stability is never permanent. It must be actively maintained. But in Malaysia  there are streets in which mosques  temples and churches stand side by side. Ours is a society in which religions may differ  but they do so in peace  in the knowledge that we are all citizens of one nation.We believe that such a moderate approach can make a valuable contribution to fragile States and international affairs alike. It is a philosophy that we have applied when acting as an honest broker in peace processes in the southern Philippines and elsewhere. It is a principle that we will pursue as we chair the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) next year  when it forms the 600-million strong ASEAN Community  with greater political security and economic and sociocultural integration.In the coming weeks  Malaysia will work with all interested partners to move the moderation agenda forward at the United Nations. That work informs our bid for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the coming term. The moderation agenda involves us all. The fight against extremism is not about Christians versus Muslims or Muslims versus Jews but moderates versus extremists of all religions. We need to rally a coalition of moderates — those willing to reclaim their religion and pursue the path to peace.I therefore reiterate my call on the leading figures in all the great religious traditions. Let us join together to ensure that religion is the source of healing and blessing rather than conflict and destruction. In that respect  I welcome Pope Francis’s visit to Palestine and his efforts to bring moderate Palestinians and Israelis together to pray for peace. By demonstrating moderation in the political process  we can ensure that no one is left outside society. By practising moderation in religion  we can marginalize the extremists. By committing to moderation here at the United Nations  we can show that the world is willing to fight extremism not just with short-term military operations but with long-term plans.The security response of the international community and a commitment to more inclusive politics on the part of affected countries will remove two of the conditions that allow extremism to take hold. However  in order to defeat the extremists  we must undermine their authority and erode their appeal. We must confront their propaganda. We must defeat the message that seduces young people into acts of violence. And we must address any legitimate grievances that drive people to extremism  be they political or economic. In short  we must win the hearts and minds of those who would serve the so-called caliph.That is the work of a generation. To begin  we should focus on the real-world conditions that allow disillusion to grow. That means building sustainable economies that bring opportunities for our young people and addressing legitimate concerns that drive radicalization.Malaysia  like so many countries around the world  was appalled by the brutal violence against Palestinian civilians in Gaza. We strongly condemn Israel’s disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks on Gaza and its continuing violations of international and human rights law. The use of heavy weapons in civilian areas and the obliteration of houses  mosques and schools were an affront to common decency. We condemn such acts not just for the innocent lives taken but for the message that they send  namely  that religions cannot coexist and that the international community cannot enforce international law and protect the rights of Palestinians. Their plight is one of the most effective rallying calls for those who claim that the international system is broken. Let us therefore unite to find a peaceful  just and lasting outcome that brings dignity and security to the people of Palestine. That should be predicated on a two-State solution based on the 1967 borders  with East Jerusalem as its capital. That will bring dignity and security for the people of Palestine  who have suffered so much  and will allow us to redouble our efforts to bring peace to other parts of the world where conflict fuels extremism.We must also understand why those militants succeed in drawing people to their cause. The extremists call upon Muslims to pledge their allegiance to their self-proclaimed caliphates in Syria and Iraq  in Nigeria and Somalia and in Kenya and Libya. They reach out to a people in search of a State. The fact that some answer that call is testament to our failure. We have failed to uphold a vision of moderate and inclusive Islamic development and to tackle isolation in our own communities.The fight against extremists must be won not just in Syria and Iraq but also in Britain  Belgium  the United States and Malaysia. We have managed to prevent extremism from gaining a foothold in our country. Yet even a few Malaysians have been lured by foreign terrorist fighters  who led them to Iraq and Syria.Countries must educate  include and  where necessary  confront those at risk of radicalization. Our religious leaders must continue to show that faith and society are best aligned under a just rule of law. We must continue to make the case that the moderate path is the righteous path — the path that Allah set out for us when he said  “we have made you into a community that is moderate  justly balanced” (ibid.  II:143).We must confront the myth that committing atrocities in the name of an Islamic State is an act of faith and that death in the service of that aim brings martyrdom. The extremists use that distorted narrative as a recruitment tool. To counter that deception  Muslims should work together to promote a greater understanding of what a true Islamic State means. An international conference of scholars of Islamic law  convened by my Government to define the true meaning of an Islamic State  agreed that for a State to be called Islamic  it must deliver economic  political and social justice. It must protect and further the six objectives of Islamic law: the right to life  religion  family  property  dignity and intellect — the same universal rights that are enshrined in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.The so-called Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and the methods used to declare it have violated every single one of those objectives. It is therefore neither Islamic nor a State. Individuals  religious leaders and nations have said that and must continue to do so and to advocate for Islamic principles within a framework of tolerance  understanding and peace.That  after all  is the true nature of Islam; a religion of peace that values coexistence  mutual comprehension and learning  even in times of struggle. When 70 prisoners of war were captured during the Battle of Badr  for example  the Prophet Muhammad was urged to slay them. The Prophet not only protected the lives of innocent civilians  he also spared enemy combatants.It is that spirit of understanding and compassion that we should continue to embrace and espouse. Now is the time to advance a vision of peace and moderation. Let us call for a global community of understanding. Let us prove that we can honour the words of the Prophet and build balanced and just societies  where different faiths live and prosper in peace. Let us show that Muslims  united in faith  can be a powerful force for progress  knowledge and justice  as we were in the greatest periods of our history  as we can be today  and as we will be tomorrow."
"124",5032,"NAM",69,2014,"I am proud to see you  Mr. President  a distinguished son of Africa  presiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session  and I congratulate you warmly on your election. I would also like to pay tribute to the President of the Assembly at its previous session for his sterling leadership.This meeting is taking place at a challenging time on the global stage. Several African countries have been dealing with an unprecedented outbreak of deadly Ebola disease; the 200 girls abducted in Nigeria by Boko Haram are yet to be found or rescued; and the indiscriminate bombardment of Gaza ended only a few weeks ago. At the same time  terrorist groups continue to disrupt peace and stability in various parts of the world.Those challenges are not insurmountable  but overcoming them requires steadfastness and unity. We should therefore resolutely reaffirm our faith and move forward  guided by the enduring values and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and all that it stands for. Those values should guide our discussions during this session  including on our theme “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”. That theme presents an opportunity for us to pause and reflect on the successes we have achieved and the challenges we have encountered in implementing the ambitious targets set by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The creation of a better world through inclusive development  improved freedom from want  and greater security and prosperity  especially in developing countries  are some of the priorities we agreed on 14 years ago.In Namibia  the implementation of the MDGs has had many positive results. We have reduced the percentage of our people living in extreme poverty by more than half. Primary school enrolment has reached 100 per cent. Health care is now delivered to many communities where once there was none. The rates of new cases of HIV infection have stabilized. Our coverage of antiretroviral treatment has reached 85 per cent  while the rate of prevention of mother-to-child transmission now stands at 90 per cent. We are moving closer to eliminating malaria as a public health threat  and our provision of clean drinking water and sanitation has also expanded.Notable successes have been achieved at the global level  too. The living conditions of millions of people have improved  especially in developing countries. We therefore have a strong foundation on which to realize the sustainable development goals that are part of the post-2015 development agenda. In that context  urgent action should be taken to meet the basic needs of all human beings and the protection of the natural environment  on which we all depend for our livelihoods. I believe no effort or resource should be spared in addressing holistically the root causes of social strife  poverty and political conflict in our societies.Developing countries  particularly African and island States  continue to bear the brunt of the adverse effects of climate change. Floods  droughts and soil erosion have become more severe  prolonged and frequent. Namibia therefore calls for implementation of the action programme and the dynamic Windhoek Declaration adopted in 2013 in Namibia at the eleventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.We applaud the Secretary-General for hosting the Climate Summit during this session of the General Assembly. Its outcome should complement the negotiations within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change towards a meaningful and coordinated global agreement in 2015.Going forward  our discussions and interactions should be guided by the principles articulated in the Millennium Declaration; the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  entitled “The future we want”; and the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits on economic  social and environmental matters. It is vital to ensure that the concerns articulated in the African Common Position be fully integrated into the post-2015 development agenda.As we prepare for the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda  we must demonstrate the necessary political will and create strong global partnerships to realize our shared goals. Furthermore  we should join hands to ensure effective mobilization and the efficient utilization of public- and private-sector resources at both the domestic and international levels.The ongoing efforts to reform the United Nations system  particularly the Security Council  must be concluded without further delay in order to reflect the contemporary geopolitical realities.We remain concerned about the political instability and armed conflicts in South Sudan  Somalia  Mali and the Central African Republic. However  the success achieved by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Southern African Development Community  along with the Intervention Brigade  in neutralizing the negative forces in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is encouraging. In order to further consolidate peace  the voluntary programme for the disarmament  demobilization  repatriation  resettlement and reintegration of the negative forces must be implemented fully.Namibia supports the participation of women in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations around the world. In that context  we call for the full implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women  peace and security. Namibia has currently deployed one of the largest female police contingents to the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur.Namibia continues to call for the lifting of the economic embargo against Cuba. The embargo is contrary to international efforts to reduce poverty and achieve the MDG targets in States Members of the United Nations. The listing of Cuba as a State sponsor of international terrorism is not justifiable and should not be accepted.We call for the full implementation of all relevant United Nations resolutions on Western Sahara and Palestine. The international community must fulfil its obligations and assist the people of Western Sahara and Palestine to realize their inalienable right to self-determination.Namibia condemns the abduction of more than 200 girls and other innocent people by Boko Haram in the Federal Republic of Nigeria. We call for their immediate and unconditional release.We support international efforts to combat Ebola disease in the African countries affected. Towards that end  Namibia has contributed ND$11 million to the fight against the deadly epidemic.As prescribed by the Namibian Constitution  I have the honour to inform the Assembly that my term of office as President will come to an end early next year. Therefore  this is the last time that I will address the General Assembly as President of the Republic of Namibia. I would like to thank Heads of State and Government for the excellent cooperation that they have rendered to me and my country during my tenure of office. I trust that they will extend the same cooperation to my successor.Finally  let us reaffirm our collective political commitment to accelerating the achievement of the MDGs as we move towards the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda."
"125",5077,"NER",69,2014,"Allow me to offer my sincere condolences to the French Government for the cowardly murder of one of its citizens yesterday  24 September  in Algeria by the so-called Soldiers of the Caliphate.Sociopolitical crises  religious extremism  armed conflict  terrorism  cross-border crime  identity politics  development issues  the effects of climate change and pandemics such as that currently caused by the Ebola virus are now concerns of the utmost importance that are crying out for action from all players of the international community.In order to meet the challenges of promoting peace  stability  security and development  we have to further strengthen the spirit of sharing and solidarity. “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  which the Assembly has identified as the theme of the general debate of the sixty-ninth session  provides a good link with the theme of last year’s session. That gives us an opportunity once again to further explore the questions that are of concern to all of us. It is nearly post-2015 already  and crafting a programme that goes beyond that date requires that we take stock of the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).Despite the remarkable progress in the implementation of some of those goals  it is now clear that there are still vast gaps in other goals  which will persist when the programme is concluded. With respect to the Niger  for example  the implementation of the 3N Initiative  “Les Nigériens nourrissent les Nigériens”  has already allowed us to achieve target C of MDG 1  which has to do with reducing by half the number of people who are suffering from hunger. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has recognized that  in that area  the Niger has achieved impressive results in record time. Our country has also achieved target A of MDG 6  with an HIV/AIDS prevalence rate of 0.4 per cent in 2012  as compared with a target of 0.7 per cent in 2015.With respect to reducing by half the proportion of people whose income is less than $1 per day  ensuring primary education for all  strengthening gender equality and the empowerment of women  dealing with the mortality of children under five years  reducing maternal mortality and promoting a sustainable environment  major efforts have ben undertaken. Still  those goals will most likely not be achieved  despite the implementation of the programme of recovery currently under way since my election in 2011.In drafting the new post-2015 agenda  we naturally need to maintain all of the unachieved MDGs and provide for measures to avoid a deterioration in areas where the goals have already been achieved. For example  the issue of the demographic dividend should be a priority on the agenda. The demographic dividend  the Assembly will recall  consists of both the demographic transition and inclusive economic growth. More specifically  the demographic dividend means  on the one hand  reducing maternal  infant and juvenile mortality and controlling birth and  on the other hand  providing for sustainable development with its three pillars: economic  social and environmental. The demographic transition is needed to strengthen sustained growth  which in turn should accelerate the demographic transition. I continue to believe that the best contraceptive method  the best condom  is sustainable development.The post-2015 agenda will be dominated by what I would call the three D’s — defence or security  democracy and development. It is fortunate that the international community has now established a close correlation among those three fundamental challenges  which are interconnected. Global peace and security today are  however  threatened by terrorism  by organized crime  by demands based on identity and by the growth of inequality  which have led to the worsening of poverty around the world  from Iraq to Libya  from Syria to Nigeria and from Mali to Somalia.The enemies who embody that terrorist threat are engaged in an unconventional and asymmetrical combat. They are sending out propaganda through their actions and seek to control populations through terror  including rape; kidnapping young girls  as in Chibok  Nigeria; taking hostages in exchange for ransom: and murder. The war pursued against them is no longer a conventional  industrial war of the kind for which our armies have been trained. Warfare among our populations is not a new phenomenon  but in recent years  it has taken on an exceptional dimension. To deal with that situation  we need to change the paradigm and move from a paradigm of classic conventional war to that of the war that takes place among our populations  which  in turn  presupposes that our countries reform their armies. That also presupposes that our countries train special forces that are capable of adapting to the methods of the enemy.In order to eradicate the Islamic State or the Al-Nusra Front in Iraq and Syria  neutralize the jihadist organizations in Libya  overcome Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and Al-Mourabitoun in the Sahel  particularly in Mali  and oust the Al-Shabaab from Somalia and Boko Haram in Nigeria  the international community needs to establish a shared goal and strategy  working with the countries involved. The common political aim is to defend our democratic institutions and protect our peoples. The strategy would then necessarily have to do with cutting off the sources financing terrorism  whether those sources are States or the drug trade or the payment of ransom. The strategy also needs to deal with the terrorist strategy  which generates propaganda through its actions  and unfortunately  its propaganda is heavily covered by the media and social media on the Internet. In addition  a just settlement of the Palestinian issue could certainly contribute to the fight against this scourge.As a neighbour of Libya  Nigeria and Mali  the Niger is deeply concerned by the situation prevailing in those countries. In Libya  the international community  together with neighbouring countries  must establish the conditions that would enable it to neutralize the militias  reconcile all Libyans without exception and form a Government of union that would organize elections under the guidance of the international community. The current United Nations Support Mission in Libya must be replaced by a more robust structure  and in this case  a stabilization and institution-building mission. The international community will then have to undertake a vast diplomatic initiative under the auspices of the Secretary-General to promote national reconciliation  which is needed to bring about the end of violence and chaos as well as to assist in the emergence of the true rule of law.Whatever the case may be  as the leader of a country that is a neighbour of Libya and whose economy and security have been seriously affected by what has been taking place there for three years  my belief is that it is dangerous to leave the current state of affairs in play as it is. We therefore need to have the courage to radically change our perspective and act so as to help Libyans realize their sole aspiration  which is to live in peace.With respect to Nigeria  Boko Haram has been extremely aggressive and has demonstrated a barbarism never seen before  with its recent incursions into Cameroon and the occupation of ever more territory  going so far as to threaten Maiduguri  the capital of the federated state of Borno in Nigeria. It is evident that that terrorist group has aims that are much larger than had been thought. That means that more effort and cooperation are needed at the regional and international levels in order to deal with the problem effectively. It is in that perspective that the heads of State and Government of Cameroon  the Niger  Nigeria and Chad — the members of the Lake Chad Basin Commission — and Benin  will meet in Niamey on 7 October 2014 to pool their efforts in the fight against this serious threat.Regarding Mali  I welcome the inclusive inter-Malian dialogue that is currently taking place under the auspices of Algeria. I express the hope that the dialogue will lead to an agreement that respects the unity and integrity of Mali. In Mali  as in the Central African Republic  the question of unity is essential. The Pandora’s box of Balkanization  which has been opened elsewhere in Africa  must be closed again if we do not want the rest of the continent to catch fire. The future of Africa is in its unity. The best way to do away with the borders inherited from colonization is not to create new borders along ethnic or religious lines  but to go beyond current borders through integration.Global security can be ensured only by States with strong and stable democratic institutions. The post-2015 programme must be a priority. Global security can also not be guaranteed as long as inequalities in trade between nations and income inequality within nations persist. Inequalities are morally unacceptable and economically inefficient. Therefore  the struggle against inequality has always been an essential question and one that we must stop avoiding  if we want a more just  humane and prosperous world. That struggle must be central to the post-2015 programme.Observers are unanimous in saying that Africa  with its high rates of economic growth  is the continent of the twenty-first century. That is true  but only if our continent definitively emerges from the unequal trade situation and from the colonial pact that has always treated Africa as merely a reservoir of raw materials  often sold cheaply  as in the old days when slaves or vast territories were acquired in exchange for mirrors  pins  needles and other junk. The African continent will actually be the continent of the twenty-first century when it  itself  works with its raw materials  that is to say once it takes the place that it deserves in world industrial production. Africa will be the continent of the twenty-first century once its relations with other nations are governed by equitable trade and not by official development assistance. Africa will be the continent of the twenty-first century when there is a huge middle class arising from good political and economic governance  including a better distribution of income to reduce poverty.Currently  according to a study by the African Development Bank  the African middle class  which is defined as the proportion of Africans with an income between $2 and $20 a day  represents about 30 per cent of the population. Our ambition should be to increase that number to 80 per cent. The vision contained in the 2063 agenda of the African Union suggests that we are on the right track. It is in the interest of the international community to include priorities that are on the agenda of our continent in the post-2015 programme.The twenty-first century must be the century when Africa equips itself with roads and rail and energy infrastructure and new information and communication technologies. It will also be the century of an agriculture that feeds our population  which is growing larger  and the century of access to water and sanitation services and to education  including vocational and technical training to enable each young person to have a trade.However  if our children and grandchildren are to have a chance at having a better quality of life  we must meet the challenge of climate change. In that regard  we must congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his initiative to convene the Climate Summit. That conference’s outcome will be the basis for the decisions that the international community is called upon to take at the climate conference to be held in Paris in December 2015.We have the imperative duty to save our planet. The global temperature is increasing owing to greenhouse gases  which have led  to take the example of the Sahel region  to a decrease in rainfall and reduced water flows  with the silting up of waterways  as in the case of the Niger River; the drying up of Lake Chad  which has lost 90 per cent of its area in 50 years  shrinking from 25 000 square kilometres to 2 500; extreme flooding and drought; reduced plant cover  including forest loss; reduced biodiversity; reduced crop yields; and thus the impoverishment of the population  whose young people then become an easy target for recruitment by terrorists and organized crime.However  since the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen  we have seen not a decrease but an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. If nothing is done  the temperature increase may surpass 2 degrees centigrade in 20 to 30 years and reach 4 degrees by the end of the century. We must therefore regroup and focus on promoting clean energy  such as hydro-electricity  nuclear energy and solar energy  provided that  in the latter case  we create competitive conditions for it. We also need to promote what is called smart agriculture and make adjustments in the industrial  transport and construction sectors.I hope that humanity will not squander the opportunity that will be provided in Paris. I hope that we will implement a development model that will enable us to save our planet. I hope that we will be able to build a more just and humane world."
"126",5123,"NGA",69,2014,"Let me begin  Sir  by expressing the best wishes of the Government and the people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on Mr. Kutesa’s assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. His election is a fitting tribute to his invaluable and inspiring contribution to international diplomacy. I would also like to express my warm appreciation to his predecessor  Ambassador John Ashe  for the astute and steadfast manner in which he steered the affairs of the sixty-eighth session of the Assembly. I thank Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon not only for his relentless commitment to the work of the United Nations  but especially for his tireless efforts to address the challenges of world peace and security.We are meeting at a time when the world looks with expectation towards 2015  which marks the end of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the launch of their successors  the sustainable development goals (SDGs). We must ensure  at all levels  that the SDGs reflect the goals and aspirations of all the regions of the world. Indeed  if the SDGs are to drive development and also meet the aspirations of developing countries for poverty elimination and sustainable growth  collective ownership of the emerging process must be our priority. We in Africa expect that the new SDGs will be people-centred. They must promote peace and security  structural economic transformation  inclusive growth  food security for all  environmental sustainability and the shared benefits of science and technology. Indeed  the gains of the MDGs must be incorporated into the emerging mechanism.We applaud the wide-ranging recommendations of the report of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing on domestic resource mobilization  international development assistance  private sector finance and a supportive global enabling environment. My country is honoured to have been accorded the privilege  jointly with Finland  of leading that work as co-Chair of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts  as mandated by the Heads of State and Government at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio. Along with the work of the Open Working Group on sustainable development goals  the report provides a solid basis for intergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda. Nigeria is aware of the need to create an enabling environment for rapid development. We are committed to strengthening institutions and improving governance systems  in order to ensure an efficient use of resources and the process itself.The year 2015 also marks the seventieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations. Even though the Charter of the United Nations underlines the imperative to spare succeeding generations from the scourge of war  the world continues to witness the ravages of war and human suffering. Today’s terrorism  manifested sometimes in insurgency  is vicious and aimless. Its consequences are agonizing  marked by a tendency to annihilate victims and completely destroy infrastructure and properties. The involvement of foreign fighters remains a common feature of terrorist groups  whether Al-Qaida in the Maghreb  Al-Shabaab in Somalia  Boko Haram in Nigeria or the newly emerging Islamic State (IS). The new dimension introduced by IS — namely  the goal of conquering territory and establishing its destructive ideology — is a major challenge that must be collectively halted before it becomes the norm. That challenge focuses renewed attention on the need to review the existing tools for United Nations peacekeeping operations.The violent and criminal activities of Boko Haram have continued to pose a potent challenge to the Government and people of Nigeria. Through a wave of terror  assassinations  bombings and now abductions and kidnappings  predominantly in the north-east of the country  Boko Haram is attempting to truncate development in those areas through murder and mayhem. In April  our innocent daughters were abducted from a secondary school in Chibok  in the north-east. That callous and criminal act has attracted empathy for Nigeria across the globe.I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the countries and organizations that have expressed solidarity with us and have continued to support our determined efforts to free our daughters. Although it has been over three months since they were abducted  we have never relented in our efforts to see them safely free. Together with our partners  we are working assiduously to free our daughters and reunite them with their families. To that end  I wish to thank the Government of France for organizing and hosting the special summit on security in Nigeria that was held in Paris in May. I also wish to express my appreciation to the Governments of Cameroon  Chad  the Niger and Guinea for their committed efforts in support of the fight against Boko Haram. The outcome of the French process and the follow-up in London  Washington  D.C.  and Abuja have helped to galvanize regional action and are already yielding positive results. Let me underline today that we shall not waver until we end this mindless war on the innocent and bring all the perpetrators to justice. We will triumph over terrorism.The failure of the Security Council to agree on unanimous action over pressing challenges to global peace and security in Syria and Iraq and the conflict in Ukraine  as well as with regard to the renewed aggression between Israel and Palestine  has strengthened the case for Security Council reform. Today’s challenges can be resolved only by a Security Council whose working methods engender transparency  inclusivity and common ownership through equitable representation of all regions in the decision-making process. It is imperative that we take advantage of 2015  which also marks the fiftieth anniversary of the 1965 reform  to make concrete progress on reforming the Security Council. We believe that there needs to be a fast-track process in line with the initiative of Mr. John Ashe  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session  for establishing a working group on reform. Indeed  the Security Council requires the collective resolve of all Member States to ensure that 2015 brings decisive progress.Even as Africa  and in particular West Africa  battles conflicts and terrorism  with progressive results  the region is being devastated by the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus. While Nigeria was able to respond effectively to control the spread of the disease  the situation in Liberia and Sierra Leone requires sustainable collective global action if it is to be contained. Through the concerted efforts of our health-care professionals  the World Health Organization and our international partners  we have been able to contain the virus  and we can confidently say that Nigeria today is Ebola-free.However  we have continued to support efforts to contain the spread of the disease in Sierra Leone  Liberia and Guinea. In addition to a direct donation totalling $3.5 million  we have provided training and capacity-building support to the three countries. It is pertinent to stress the need for the international community to properly appreciate the magnitude of the Ebola challenge. Indulging in isolationist and discriminatory tendencies  as some countries are doing  will only worsen an already critical situation. To prevent the disease from becoming a global catastrophe  the United Nations must accord it the maximum priority it deserves.Certainly  there has been much discussion on limiting ozone layer depletion since the commencement of negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1994. However  the extent of progress in key areas  particularly in limiting the contribution of man-made activities to greenhouse gas emission  has yet to be determined.Nigeria appreciates the indispensable role of the United Nations in its search for solutions to all those challenges: terrorism  global peace and security  the environment  and forging sustainable economic development. We have been and will remain a reliable and active partner  especially as we collectively work to resolve the new and emerging threats to global peace and security. The world must come together and win the war against terror.On 29 May 1999  Nigeria ended its military rule after the inauguration of a democratically elected President. Come February 2015  the country will conduct its fifth post-military-rule general election. In keeping with my election as President by the people of Nigeria  we shall conduct elections based on global best practices to further strengthen our democratic institutions."
"127",5168,"NIC",69,2014,"We are proud to have our African brother  Sam Kutesa  Permanent Representative of the Republic of Uganda — a member country of the African Union — presiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We are fully confident that during his tenure he will advocate for and advance the most pressing issues of our peoples. He can count on Nicaragua’s support.We would also like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly at the previous session  a brother from the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  Ambassador John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda  and his entire team for their dedicated leadership and unstinting effort to realize an agenda for the benefit of our peoples.We live in a world of many interconnected and related crises that reveal the unjust and inequitable development policies prevailing among various peoples and nations. The existing unjust economic order  resulting from imperialism and its contemporary model — global capitalism — has failed to respond to the growing and increasingly frequent crises. The numbers of the world’s poor increase daily in both the South and the North  in flagrant violation of the most basic human rights. We must work together to overcome and eradicate poverty  hunger  malnutrition  disease  war and conflict  regime change politics and coups  violence against women and children  the arms race  the negative impacts of climate change  and emerging social and slavery plagues  including drug trafficking  organized crime and human trafficking  among others  as soon as possible.Social justice  solidarity  unity  complementarity among peoples  and brotherhood and respect among nations must prevail. The eradication of poverty remains the greatest challenge facing the world. We will begin negotiations on the post-2015 agenda with the central concern of not having achieved the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in all developing countries. It is urgent to redouble efforts and create an international environment conducive to facilitating developing countries’ implementation of the MDGs  including appropriate financing.The post-2015 agenda will provide a new opportunity to strive for a just world order. It should promote sustained economic growth  inclusive and participatory social development  environmental protection and human dignity  with sufficient flexibility to respond to the needs  priorities and specificities of each country and region  conscious of the fact that no single model or recipe for development exists. The agenda should involve an intergovernmental  open and transparent process  based on the results of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals and the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development.Developing countries suffer the most from the adverse effects of climate change  whose extreme meteorological phenomena are ever more frequent and intense. Despite our economic limitations and prioritized focus on poverty and sustainable development and with no obligation under the Convention  we are assuming the costs of the adaptation and mitigation efforts.We must urgently achieve a binding agreement in 2015  containing strong  ambitious and balanced commitments on all its provisions and based on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its principles and provisions  particularly equity and common but differentiated responsibilities  in order to address the climate crisis and protect the ecosystems that sustain life on our Mother Earth.No country that is part of the international community can claim the right to use or threaten the use of force in its international relations. Such exceptionalist policies not only do not resolve conflicts; rather  they stir things up  as has been seen in recent years. Dialogue and negotiation are the only means to resolve conflict. Based on its Charter  the United Nations must assume its role as the main organ responsible for ensuring world peace and must reject war-mongering policies  war and confrontation. Given the challenges we are dealing with  thorough reform of the United Nations is becoming increasingly imperative  and particularly reform of the Security Council  which should recognize contemporary realities by including the voices and votes of developing countries in the categories of both permanent and non-permanent members.We consider it vital that we have a nuclear-weapon-free world with total and complete disarmament. We welcome the designation last year of 26 September as the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons  initiated by the Non-Aligned Movement at Cuba’s suggestion.In the face of the growing Ebola epidemic  Cuba  our sister in solidarity  has once again made its human and scientific resources available to work alongside our African brothers who are fighting the deadly virus. Meanwhile  that same sister nation of Cuba continues to resist the criminal economic and financial embargo imposed on it by the United States. Nicaragua emphasizes its unconditional solidarity with Cuba and demands an end to a blockade that violates international law and the human rights of the people of Cuba. We demand the immediate and unconditional release of the five anti-terrorist Cuban patriots. And we condemn the role that the United States arrogates to itself in putting countries on its unilateral and arbitrary list of State sponsors of international terrorism  and demand that Cuba be removed from the list. We condemn such anachronistic United States policies  as well as the intensification of the blockade and its extra-territorial nature.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and its Bolivarian revolution continue to suffer from harassment  interference and external aggression. Nicaragua offers its unconditional support to Venezuela’s people and Government  led by our comrade Nicolás Maduro Moros  in their defence of their revolutionary liberation process.We must bring to an immediate end Israel’s illegal occupation of Palestinian territory and prevent Israel from continuing its aggression and brutal attacks on the men  women and children of Palestine. The Security Council should once and for all live up to its obligations and demand that Israel end such practices and policies in order to clear the way for a sovereign and independent State of Palestine  based on its pre-1967 borders  with East Jerusalem as its capital  and with two States  Palestine and Israel  living side by side in peace. Nicaragua reiterates its absolute and unconditional solidarity with the State of Palestine in its fight for freedom and its inalienable rights.We also stress our total solidarity with the Government and the people of Syria in their fight against international terrorism and in defence of their sovereignty and territorial integrity. We emphasize the importance of achieving a negotiated political solution among Syrians and ending foreign intervention  including the financing and supplying of weapons to terrorist groups. When confronted by such conflicts  rather than opting for dialogue and negotiation to settle them  the NATO countries take unilateral decisions  measures and action outside the United Nations framework and in violation of international law  including aerial bombardment in territories of sovereign countries.Nicaragua has frequently expressed its rejection and condemnation of actions aimed at regime change  which rupture constitutional order  lead to widespread violence  encourage the use of force and open the door to coups d’état that can overthrow legitimate Governments elected by the will of the people. That is the kind of policy that we have witnessed in Ukraine; it has led to loss of life and the displacement of populations  and created a humanitarian crisis with unpredictable consequences. Because we want peace and believe in the prevention and resolution of conflicts by peaceful and inclusive means  we reject such policies  as well as the imposition of unilateral measures and economic sanctions that violate international law.Nicaragua recognizes the cooperation of China on Taiwan with developing countries  particularly in the area of food and social inclusion programmes  and we reiterate our support for the legitimate aspirations of China on Taiwan for greater participation in the United Nations specialized agencies  one that accords with the requirements and needs of its population of 23 million.We reiterate our full support for the legitimate rights of the Republic of Argentina in the dispute over the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands  the South Sandwich Islands and the adjacent islands. The United Kingdom should comply immediately with the relevant United Nations resolutions and initiate direct negotiations with Argentina. Similarly  we support and consider ourselves part of Argentina’s fight against vulture funds.Puerto Rico continues to labour under the colonial yoke and now more than ever needs our solidarity and active support in its struggle for independence and self-determination. The United States should free the world’s longest-imprisoned political captive  the Puerto Rican patriot Oscar López Rivera. We also commend and remain in solidarity with the struggle of the people of Western Sahara under the leadership of the Frente Polisario.Nicaragua  a small country whose policies are based on Christian values  socialist principles and the practice of solidarity  works proactively in our complex global environment  through various international and regional forums  to promote policies of peace  unity and understanding among nations  political and negotiated solutions to conflicts and the right of our peoples to achieve sustainable development and well-being.The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America  of which Nicaragua is a member  has been a factor in improving unity  complementarity and economic integration in our region. In turn  it promotes other forums such as Petrocaribe  which groups together 20 countries of our region and has had an immediate and concrete positive impact on the well-being of our peoples as one way of overcoming poverty  hunger and inequality. On 14 December  we will celebrate the tenth anniversary of its founding  resulting from the unifying vision of the Latin American and Caribbean leaders Hugo Chávez Frias and Fidel Castro Ruz.These steps towards regional integration have borne fruit with the creation of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  through which we continue to deepen our process of political  economic  social and cultural integration  respecting diversity and building unity. We have declared our region a zone of peace. Within the framework of the Central American Integration System  we are strengthening integration in all fields and working together to fight the scourges of drug trafficking and organized crime and to turn the Gulf of Fonseca into a zone of peace and development.Our Government of Reconciliation and National Unity  under the visionary leadership of our President  Commander Daniel Ortega Saavedra  continues to work to restore the political  economic  social and cultural rights of all Nicaraguans. Nicaragua has become the leading country in the region in terms of public safety. Our fight against drug trafficking  organized crime and human trafficking has been recognized as the most vigorous and effective in the region. Our economic growth is consistent and rising and is among the highest of our region. We are reducing poverty and extreme poverty  attaining the Millennium Development Goals and empowering women through political and economic participation. Indeed  we rank very highly in the world in terms of female ministers  parliamentarians and mayors.We combat violence against women and girls head on  with strict laws and social programmes targeting both groups  and with police stations for women in all municipalities of the country. Education and health care are prioritized and are provided free for all Nicaraguans  and early childhood care programmes and maternity homes can be found throughout the country.In our Caribbean autonomous regions  in addition to the restitution of the rights of indigenous peoples and people of African descent  the autonomy process is growing in strength every day  with the recent completion of the land ownership process in the indigenous and Afro-descendant communities. All these efforts of our people and Government  together with our policies of inclusion and social justice  won immediate recognition and support from our people  who have taken ownership of them  and they have been held up as examples of good practice by all the agencies  projects and programmes of the United Nations system.In conclusion  we note that the work of the General Assembly at the present session and in the coming years will be crucial for developing countries and the rest of the world. Let us unite from this very moment to achieve the urgent and necessary changes needed to attain a better world and better lives for our peoples."
"128",5215,"NLD",69,2014,"On 17 July  in a summer already marked by alarming reports from Syria  Iraq and Gaza  our country was confronted with a stark international reality. The 298 passengers of Flight MH-17 would be alive today if not for the Crimea conflict and the destabilization of eastern Ukraine. Of those victims  196 were Dutch nationals.That tragedy has had an enormous impact on our country — so many innocent men  women and children  entire families ripped from neighbourhoods  empty desks in offices and schools  teammates gone forever. Everyone in the Netherlands knew someone in that plane  directly or indirectly  and we will feel the pain for years to come. Some of the victims still have not been identified  and that must be done as soon as possible. Nothing is more important to their loved ones  wherever in the world they may be.This summer we were reminded again of how closely interwoven events at home and abroad can be and how important a stable world order is to our national interests. We saw again that when it comes to addressing the major problems facing the global community  there is simply no alternative to working together. That is the firm conviction of the Dutch Government.We are grateful for the wide support for Security Council resolution 2166 (2014). All remains and personal belongings must be repatriated. The cause of the Flight MH-17 disaster must be brought to light  and those responsible must be brought to justice. Unhindered access to the crash site is therefore essential. The Dutch Government is fully committed to achieving those goals  working with all the countries and organizations involved.The Constitution of the Netherlands contains a unique article that says  “The Government shall promote the development of the international legal order”. That self-imposed responsibility comes from a long tradition of freedom  respect for the rule of law and our country’s international orientation. In March  we put that principle into practice once again when we hosted the Nuclear Security Summit  a conference on an important topic that must remain high on the international agenda. The events of this summer have made us even more resolute about promoting the international legal order and about working to that end with everyone here in the General Assembly  in the knowledge that peace  justice and development are closely interconnected.The year 2015 is an important one for the global development agenda. We will be reviewing the Millennium Development Goals and raising the bar once again. In July this year  the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals laid a solid foundation for the future that reflects the Netherlands’ priorities. The most important goal is to eradicate extreme poverty within a generation in a way that does not harm economic growth  social equality or the environment. We must link short-term goals with long-term goals.Despite the progress made  we know that fragile States  where the rule of law barely exists  had no chance of achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In 2013 there were more displaced people in conflict regions than ever before. For those reasons  the Netherlands applauds the Open Working Group’s intention to include peace and the rule of law in the new framework.We also welcome the Secretary-General’s announced intention to establish the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response. The Netherlands will substantially increase its humanitarian aid. Part of that effort is a new contribution of €18 million to the fight against Ebola.In the same vein  the Netherlands will continue to support and participate in United Nations peacekeeping missions. We currently have military personnel and relief workers serving in Mali  South Sudan and elsewhere. The upcoming review of peacekeeping missions is an opportunity to improve the instrument and make it more effective. The Netherlands believes that major progress can be made on that front by further integrating the three Ds: defence  development and diplomacy.Our commitment to fulfilling Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) remains firm too  because women’s leadership is essential to achieving peace and security. The important role that women play as change agents in politics  economic development and society cannot be emphasized enough.As host country to many international legal institutions  including the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court  the Netherlands feels a special responsibility with respect to international law. When innocent people fall victim to impunity  human rights violations and the violence of war  the international community cannot and should not just stand by and just watch. Perpetrators must be brought to justice  however complex and time-consuming the process may be. We owe this not only to the passengers of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17  but also to the victims of violence in Syria and in Iraq. The horrifying images of mass executions and beheadings in the region are burned into our memories. They impress upon us how important it is for the Security Council and international legal institutions to be able to act boldly and decisively.The Kingdom of the Netherlands  a partner for peace  justice and development  is a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council in 2017 and 2018. We want to help modernize and strengthen that important United Nations body. Renewal is needed to ensure its effectiveness and legitimacy. The Security Council must be able to act in a crisis. When mass atrocities are being committed somewhere in the world  veto power should be exercised with greater restraint. We salute the French initiative in that regard. We also believe that the Security Council’s authority and resolve would be enhanced if the United Nations Member States were more broadly represented. That is especially true of the African States which  in our opinion  are underrepresented.In closing  Dag Hammarskjöld once said that“[t]he principles of the Charter are  by far  greater than the Organization in which they are embodied  and the aims which they are to safeguard are holier than the policies of any single nation or people” (S/PV.751  para. 4).The Netherlands shares that conviction and remains steadfast in its commitment to promoting the international legal order  as our Constitution demands."
"129",5260,"NOR",69,2014,"The leaders who gathered at the United Nations Climate Summit have taken important steps to mobilize action and ambition on climate change. Now we need to make sure that the positive results are followed through and expanded as we prepare for an agreement in Paris next year.When we meet at the General Assembly next year  we will adopt the new set of global goals for our common future — the sustainable development goals (SDGs). They must build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). They must be realistic and ambitious. Like the MDGs  the SDGs should be few in number  concrete and measurable. Meanwhile  achieving the eight Millennium Development Goals will create a solid foundation for sustainable development. As co-chair of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s MDG Advocacy Group  I will use every opportunity to help build that foundation over the remaining 462 days until the deadline.We must accelerate our efforts  and to do so we need to enter into broad partnerships that include the private sector  civil society and Governments. We need to make use of the best possible innovative solutions and technologies. Governments and national political leaders must take the lead and ensure local ownership. At the same time  we must support the remarkable work that many people are doing to implement the MDGs in practice.The frightening Ebola epidemic in West Africa reminds us of the fragility of our progress and development. We must build health-care systems that can support courageous and determined individuals like Josephine Finda Sellu. Ms. Sellu  the deputy nurse matron at a Government hospital in Sierra Leone  lost 15 of her nurses to Ebola. Nevertheless  she never stopped working in that death trap. She is a true fighter for the MDGs.Education  particularly for girls  is the superhighway to ending poverty. Poverty  discrimination and the use of force often prevent girls from getting the education they are entitled to. Sexual violence  abductions and deadly attacks are the most despicable ways in which girls’ right to education is being violated. I condemn the abductions of schoolgirls by Boko Haram in the strongest possible terms. In the face of terrorists threatening to deprive children of their right to education  we should be inspired by Malala Yousafzai. Malala brought to light the plight of the millions of children around the world who are denied an education. If one schoolgirl can take on the Taliban  then surely the world community can defeat extremism and terrorism.Terrorists and extremists are trying to stop us from educating children. Peace is vital for achieving universal primary education. The same can be said for the other MDGs  not least the goal on reducing poverty. That is why we must focus on conflict-affected countries. A girl growing up in Syria today cannot look forward to going to school  because there is no school to go to. A pregnant teenage girl in South Sudan will not get the maternal health services she needs because it is too risky for health workers to travel. From the Security Council Chamber to the modest homes in the Swat Valley in Pakistan  we can all help to end poverty by promoting peace  but all those different efforts at the global  regional  national and local levels must work in concert.It has been 70 years since a group of leaders met in Washington  D. C.  to discuss the creation of the United Nations. One of the most fundamental tenets of the new world order created in 1945 was respect for internationally recognized borders. Norway condemns Russia’s violations of international law and its continuing destabilization of eastern Ukraine. Any settlement of the conflict must uphold international law and respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine. The ceasefire agreed on 5 September must be respected and the provisions of the agreement implemented on the ground. Russia bears a particular responsibility in that regard.The Security Council is mandated to maintain peace and security  but has failed to address the situation in Syria and Ukraine effectively. We know why. Some of the big Powers still believe in outdated ideas of zero-sum games and spheres of influence. We are hopeful that the Council will continue to stand united against the threat of the terrorist group known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). We support the United States initiative and sponsored Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) on foreign terrorist fighters. We encourage the countries of the region to take a leading role in fighting ISIL.Armed conflict and civil war have created man-made humanitarian disasters in Syria  Iraq  South Sudan  the Central African Republic and Somalia. Earlier this year  Norway hosted a humanitarian donor conference for South Sudan  and we will shortly co-host a donor conference to address the aftermath of the conflict in Gaza. Donor conferences are important  but we need to look beyond the emergencies. We need to build on and improve the current system  when we meet for the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016. We must make sure that humanitarian aid supports not only short-term recovery  but also long-term development. Besides  long-term development cooperation should help countries prevent  prepare for  withstand and recover from humanitarian crises in the future.International peace  national security  social development and individual prosperity can best be fostered under a system of good democratic governance and human rights. Efforts to promote respect for human rights can help prevent armed conflict and mass atrocities. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi  herself a leading human rights defender  stated in her Nobel lecture that:“[i]f the twenty-first century wishes to free itself from the cycle of violence  acts of terror and war  there is no other way except by understanding and putting into practice every human right for all mankind  irrespective of race  gender  faith  nationality or social status.”I agree with that.Human rights is one of the three pillars of the United Nations  based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  adopted by the Assembly on 10 December 1948. Norway endorses the Secretary-General’s “Human Rights Up Front” initiative  which places the protection of human rights at the heart of United Nations strategies and operational activities. The United Nations needs a strong and assertive human rights pillar. Only if we fund the human rights pillar properly can we achieve the results that we need and want from our world Organization.The promotion and protection of human rights is first and foremost the responsibility of States. We are  however  facing large implementation gaps. Attacks  threats  intimidation and reprisals against human rights defenders are increasingly being reported. New laws restricting freedom of expression and the work of civil society are being adopted. Discrimination is widespread  particularly against minorities  such as indigenous people and lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender persons.The rule of law and civil liberties are also fundamental to the development of the private sector and attracting investment. Moreover  we know that enabling women to fully enjoy their social and economic rights unleashes tremendous economic growth.We must stay focused on accelerating progress towards the MDGs during the remaining 462 days. We must let ourselves be inspired by those who serve at the front line of those efforts  like Ms. Sellu and other doctors and nurses who are risking their lives to treat patients with Ebola.As we set our future development agenda beyond 2015  we must also make some adjustments. Peace and stability must be included. Climate issues must be addressed. Good  democratic governance  with respect for the rule of law and human rights  will be crucial for achieving sustainable development for us all. And all that means  quite simply  is to be doing the right things right."
"130",5306,"NPL",69,2014,"I bring with me warmest greetings from the people of Nepal and their best wishes for the success of the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I congratulate the President of the Assembly on his unanimous election and wish to express our deep appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his commitment and dedication.We commend the Secretary-General for convening the Climate Summit. The momentum generated at the Summit should pave the way next year for a binding agreement on climate change  with long-term and comprehensive global commitments for climate solutions based on the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities  equity and respective capabilities. It is an irony that the world’s most vulnerable countries happen to be the worst victims of climate change through no fault of their own. There should be special provisions for climate financing  separate from regular official development assistance  so that the mitigation and adaptation needs of the least developed countries and small island developing States can be addressed.Terrorism is anathema to humankind. It is a serious threat to peace  security and development. Nepal unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We share the concern about the growing scourges of terrorism  extremism and religious fundamentalism. In that context  we welcome the convening of the Security Council summit meeting earlier this week (see S/PV.7272) and support the adoption of resolution 2178 (2014)  on foreign terrorist fighters. We appeal for an early conclusion of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism and the effective implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Nepal believes that terrorism can best be tackled under the auspices of the United Nations with a coordinated global response.Peacekeeping has emerged as the central activity of the United Nations and an innovative tool for dealing with challenges to peace and security. Nepal is proud to have contributed to the maintenance of international peace and security through United Nations peacekeeping operations in troubled parts of the world. Nepalese Blue Helmets have been commended for their professionalism and commitment in trying circumstances. We are currently the fifth-largest troop contributor to that flagship activity. With ever-greater commitment and dedication  Nepal will continue to participate in peacekeeping operations and to promote gender equality through the increased participation of women in peacekeeping. We urge this world body to give due consideration to the safety and security of peacekeepers. Nepal calls for equitable leadership opportunities  commensurate with Member States’ troop contributions  to be made available both at Headquarters and in the field.Nepal stands for general and complete disarmament  covering all weapons of mass destruction  in a time-bound  verifiable and effective manner. We call upon Member States  especially nuclear-weapon States  to halt militarization in all spheres and step up measures for disarmament in order to free up much-needed dividends for development. We wish to see an enlarged role for the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia  which is based in Kathmandu.As a least developed and landlocked country  Nepal faces structural constraints and pervasive and complex development challenges. My delegation underlines the urgency of addressing the special needs of the least developed countries (LDCs) and supporting them with the provision of enhanced resources for inclusive development.Nepal calls upon the international community  particularly donors  to fulfil all the commitments made in favour of LDCs. We underline the timely  full and effective implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action for LDCs. Nepal aims to graduate from LDC status by 2022. An enhanced level of international support to build our productive capacity  improve supply-side capacity  minimize shocks and vulnerabilities and  above all  bring about structural transformation will be critical to meeting that target.Nepal remains fully committed to the protection and promotion of human rights and has put the required institutional mechanisms in place. We remain constructively engaged with all United Nations human rights mechanisms and the international community in the protection and promotion of human rights. We reject politicization and selectivity in the application of human rights standards.My Government is determined to bring about a dignified closure of the past dating back to the armed conflict. We believe the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission on Disappearances will help put our past behind us and prevent a recurrence of grave violations of human rights. I want to reassure the international community that there will be no blanket amnesty for grave crimes. We underline the need to ensure the rights and well-being of migrant workers.Nepal has always supported the call for a just  lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East and an end to the spiralling conflict in the region. We recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people on the basis of United Nations resolutions and encourage Israel and Palestine to live as neighbours within secure and recognized international boundaries.The situation in Afghanistan  Iraq  Libya and Syria demands a more proactive United Nations engagement. While supporting the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of those countries  we urge the United Nations to play an active role in finding a political settlement and helping those countries move towards national unity  reconciliation and reconstruction.We hold the view that the people of Ukraine should enjoy the right to freely decide their destiny without any outside interference.Our unwavering faith and long struggle for a democratic system of governance has given us the strength to mainstream the armed Maoist rebels into a peaceful democratic process and lead a successful transition from autocratic monarchy to democratic republican order  thereby setting up unique models. The political parties in Nepal  including the Maoists  are now working together to have a democratic Constitution promulgated through the elected Constituent Assembly. My Government remains committed to bringing the parties both within and outside the Assembly on board within the framework of constitutionalism  political pluralism and the rule of law  to put the country on the path of peace  stability  development and a democratic system of governance.We greatly appreciate our neighbours  India and China  the United Nations  our friends and well-wishers in the international community for their support for and solidarity with our peace process and development efforts. We firmly believe that democracy is indispensable for peace  progress  stability and prosperity. Peace  democracy and sustainable development are inextricably linked and mutually reinforcing. Development is not possible in the absence of peace  which  in turn  cannot be attained in the absence of democracy.The post-2015 development agenda becomes truly transformative only when the pressing needs and priorities of the most vulnerable and marginalized countries and societies are faithfully integrated into the broader global agenda and are provided with sufficient resources to achieve them. A holistic development process does not leave an unfinished agenda behind  so the remaining tasks of the Millennium Development Goals should be fully incorporated in the post-2015 agenda.We consider corruption to be the biggest enemy of the people and a threat to peace  stability and development. My Government has underlined the importance of transparency  accountability and zero tolerance for corruption as prerequisites to improving the quality of governance and delivering results to the people.Nepal’s foreign policy is inspired by the purposes and principles of the United Nations. People’s aspirations for peace  stability  progress  decency  dignity and prosperity are firmly embedded in it. We strongly believe that peaceful coexistence  mutual respect for each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  and equality and mutual benefit should constitute the fundamental tenets of inter-State relationships.Reforms of the United Nations  including the Security Council  need to reflect contemporary realities for making it more effective  representative  responsive and capable of handling increasingly complex global problems. We support the expansion of membership in both permanent and non-permanent categories. The seventieth anniversary of the United Nations  next year  should be an occasion to ensure the representation and increase the voices of developing countries in the Security Council. In that context  Nepal reiterates its support for the desire of India  Japan  Germany and Brazil to serve as permanent members in the expanded Security Council. We also believe that the African continent and Member States that have contributed to the maintenance of international peace and security should also be given due consideration in any expansion.In seven decades of the United Nations  it has been found to be most successful when we honour the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and the decisions we make. B.P. Koirala  the first elected Prime Minister of Nepal  while addressing the General Assembly at its fifteenth session  in 1960  said “The real solution of the world’s problems  including the problem of world peace and prosperity  lies in the direction of strengthening and extending the authority of the United Nations. This authority will be strengthened and fortified if the decisions of the United Nations are respected faithfully and loyally by all Powers  great and small.” (A/PV.878  para. 235)In conclusion  my Government reiterates its profound commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations as the embodiment of peace  progress and prosperity."
"131",5323,"NRU",69,2014,"Allow me to congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. Let me assure him of my delegation’s full support and cooperation as he steers our work during this session. I must also commend his predecessor  Ambassador John Ashe  for showing such capable leadership during the previous session. He led the small island developing States (SIDS) through several important milestones during his tenure  including the International Year of Small Island Developing States and the recently concluded International Conference on SIDS in Samoa.It has been said that the stars are aligned with SIDS this year. Ambassador Ashe has been our brightest beacon  and I thank him very much for that. Let me also thank another champion of the SIDS  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Indeed  earlier this year  I sat in the Trusteeship Council Chamber when the Secretary-General helped us celebrate the launch of the International Year of Small Island Developing States. Showing a remarkable understanding of our unique circumstances  he said:“The International Year offers us the opportunity to celebrate the rich cultural heritage of the people of small island developing States and to honour their many contributions to our world. It is also an opportunity to highlight the various needs and challenges of this diverse coalition. Some small island developing States have enjoyed long-lasting stability. Others are in transition. Some are economically more fragile than others... Others are extremely vulnerable to the immediate effects of climate change. But all small island developing States share a common understanding. We need to set our world on a sustainable path.”The challenges of SIDS are many. One need only glance at the headlines to appreciate that they join a long list of concerns that the international community must confront today: naked brutality  pestilence  poverty and the worsening impacts of climate change  to name only a few. I understand the impulse for us to put off hard decisions to another day  prioritize some over others  or even bury our heads in the sand. But the General Assembly is and remains the pre-eminent forum for grappling with global crises  and the United Nations is our best hope for solving them.However  if we are to be successful  we must acknowledge a reality that lies beneath so many of those challenges  namely  that we live in an interconnected world and that the actions of one country or region impact the lives of people half a world away. Conflict  poverty and disease can send refugees across borders and oceans and sometimes all the way to our shores. We can no longer escape each other. As the Secretary-General also remarked  we all share the same island.Also  we must consider my country’s connection to the ocean. As for so many SIDS  the ocean is the foundation of our culture and economy  and we depend on its bounty for food and income. Yet the reckless actions of other nations have severely undermined the marine environment on which we so depend — from excessive greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet and make the seas more and more acidic to irresponsible overfishing  the outright stealing of fish in our waters  and dangerous pollution  the effect of which we have yet to fully comprehend.All the while  some of those same countries responsible for the damage are also charged with assessing the well-being of the marine environment. How can we be confident that our interests will be protected in that effort? We  as a developing country  are constantly facing demands for greater transparency and accountability from the same actors that downplay  and sometimes even cover up  their own transgressions.Finding lasting solutions to problems such as those will require more resources and a level of cooperation that the international community has so far not countenanced. It will also require us to look at the failings in the global order that somehow prevent countries such as mine from accessing the fair economic benefits of our own resources. Nevertheless  we cannot just stand by and do nothing. We cannot and should not wait for others to decide what is best for us. For that reason  the parties to the Nauru Agreement are taking the lead in successfully managing their tuna stocks through such measures as curbing illegal fishing and sustainable harvesting.The President has wisely chosen “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda” as the theme of the general debate of the sixty-ninth session. It goes to the heart of the central task before us — not only fulfilling the long-standing promises with regard to sustainable development but also engendering a paradigm shift in the way that we achieve such development. The current piecemeal approach  where a donor’s political interests determine aid priorities  may treat symptoms for a time  but it fails to address the underlying disease.If we want our efforts to be successful over the long term  we need to build a foundation that develops global citizens and gives them the tools they need to succeed in a global world. In other words  we must move beyond capacity-building to institution-building. What is needed is long-term in-country engagement  backed by real resources  that produces durable domestic institutions run by nationals. We cannot let new and emerging issues distract or diminish work on core priorities that remain inadequately addressed. We may be experiencing our own fatigue when we again raise the issues of overfishing  climate adaptation and water treatment  but those are often the areas most in need of attention.I know that tackling all of those problems will be a tall order and may seem quite daunting  I am absolutely confident that this institution and its agencies are up to the task. We have made some progress in reducing hunger  poverty and disease. And just this week  the world watched as leaders gathered at the Climate Summit to announce the actions that their countries and corporations are planning in order to lower greenhouse gas emissions responsible for the climate crisis. The Summit provided hope that  at least in some corners  serious climate action is imminent. However  it was hard to ignore the fact that most announcements were about the greenhouse gas reductions that would occur under some future Government a decade or more in the future.What is more  SIDS  which contribute only a fraction of global emissions  have undertaken to build sustainable economies while announcing some of the most ambitious pledges to cut emissions. For example  we are working closely with the International Renewable Energy Agency  through their Lighthouses initiative  to achieve our own goal of a 50 per cent reduction in 2020. My own regional group  the Pacific SIDS  led the General Assembly to formally recognize the connection between climate change and international peace and security in 2009 and helped convince the Security Council to do the same in 2011.But  while few countries doubt the correlation between climate change and conflict today and despite graphic examples of such in the past few years alone  there is still disagreement as to the way forward. Therefore  we are still of the opinion that the Secretary-General should appoint a special representative on climate and security to analyse the projected security impacts of the crisis. In addition  the Secretary-General should lead a joint task force of all relevant organs and specialized agencies to assess the capacity of the United Nations system to respond. That is the least we can do as an international body to prepare for one of the biggest challenges of our generation.If the Security Council is to remain relevant  it must be adaptive enough to meet the latest threats  and climate change is a clear and present danger that we ignore at our own peril. The Security Council must also reflect new geopolitical realities by becoming more representative and inclusive. It is for that reason that Nauru supports the reform of the Security Council by enlarging its permanent and non-permanent categories and making its working methods more efficient. New members should be more geographically diverse  but they must also be willing to broaden their vision beyond a narrow focus on domestic interests to include a commitment to the common good of all Member States.Similarly  the United Nations should ensure that all citizens of the world have the opportunity to participate in its activities. It must work for the 10 000 people in Nauru and other small countries  and it must not continue to ignore the 24 million people in Taiwan  who time and again have demonstrated a commitment to peace and regional cooperation. Nauru is pleased to note that  with solid international support and the cross-Strait rapprochement  the Republic of China has increased its meaningful participation in United Nations specialized agencies and mechanisms. We continue to encourage the positive interaction between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in the international arena. Furthermore  I would like to recognize the contributions that Taiwan has made to help my country make progress towards its national sustainable development strategy. I take the opportunity to also express my country’s deep appreciation to our friends and partners who continue to support our sustainable development priorities  including Australia  Russia  New Zealand  the European Union  Cuba  Israel and Turkey  to mention a few.The world is rapidly changing  and the new realities have strained the ability of the United Nations to respond adequately. Long-term solutions will require a new commitment to providing adequate means of implementation. On climate change alone  we are far from the goal of providing $100 billion a year by 2020 to help nations adapt to climate impacts that are now unavoidable and to build sources of clean energy  to say nothing of the 0.7 per cent gross domestic product goal for development aid.I know that we  as an international community  face numerous crises on many fronts and that much is being asked of us. But I strongly believe that it is in times like these that solutions to even the most intractable problems emerge from the human spirit. It is in times like these that light emerges from darkness; hope from despair.The small island developing States have laid out a vision to help us reach our full potential. I invite our partners to invest in our peoples  and we will build a better and more secure world. The United Nations remains our best hope for people everywhere to live in peace and prosperity. My faith in it has never been stronger. God bless the Republic of Nauru and God bless the United Nations."
"132",5370,"NZL",69,2014,"It is an honour to address the General Assembly today on behalf of the Prime Minister and Government of New Zealand. Our general election took place in the past week. Our Prime Minister  the Right Honourable John Key  is engaged in forming a Government  and that is why he is unable to be in New York today.I want to begin by acknowledging the success of the recent third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  held in Samoa. The success of the Conference was the result of the extraordinary work Samoa put into preparing for the Conference and the ownership of the agenda that was demonstrated by the small island developing States (SIDS). While it is undoubtedly true that small island developing States have placed great value on the opportunity to talk  it is also true that there was an undertone of frustration  born of the fact that too often in the past talk has not been followed by action. I strongly identify with that view. The multilateral world is awash with talk of plans and strategies and funds  while out there in the real world of small island developing States  not enough is happening on the ground. My country  New Zealand  is intent on avoiding that shortcoming  especially in our own region  the Pacific.Renewable energy featured strongly in the SIDS Conference agenda  as it had at the Secretary-General’s 2014 Climate Summit in the past week. Pacific nations spend 10 per cent of their gross domestic product and up to 30 per cent of their entire import bills on importing diesel fuel for electricity generation. Sustainable economic development therefore simply cannot happen in our region without renewable energy.Significant progress is being achieved  especially since the Pacific Energy Summit 2013 that we co-hosted with the European Union in Auckland in March 2013  at which $635 million in funding was committed for over 50 projects. The Tokelau Islands have moved from 100 per cent dependence on fossil fuels to 93 per cent renewable. During the SIDS Conference itself  we opened a 2.2-megawatt plant  a solar array in Samoa. A year earlier we opened a 1.2-megawatt plant in Tonga. Next month  we will open a 1-megawatt array in Rarotonga. And in the next 12 months  all of the outer islands of Tuvalu and all but one of the outer Cook Islands will be close to 100 per cent renewable. We are making real progress towards converting our Pacific neighbourhood to renewable energy  bringing significant environmental benefits and greatly enhancing prospects for sustainable economic development. My country has committed over $100 million to that process. We are not waiting for a new multilateral agreement or a new green fund. We are simply getting ahead with robust partnerships and making it happen.Another key topic at the SIDS Conference was sustainable fisheries. For our region  that is critically important. The biggest economic asset in the Pacific is its fisheries. In the past year  over $3.3 billion worth of tuna was harvested from Pacific waters  yet only 14 per cent of that value  about $460 million  made its way back to Pacific nations. New Zealand has committed over $70 million over the next five years to advance a comprehensive approach that includes enhanced surveillance  training of monitors  training in commercial fishing practices  research and science initiatives and improving management practices. Our objective is to see the owners of the Pacific tuna resource receive a significantly greater share of the value of that resource  and to ensure that it is sustainably managed for the future.A key message from the SIDS Conference is the need to share experiences and skills among the SIDS regions. That is starting to happen. Fisheries management is a prime candidate for greater cooperation. We have also commenced a process of interregional cooperation in renewable energy by supporting the development of geothermal energy in the Caribbean and Africa.While small island developing States are showing real leadership in addressing climate change and shifting to renewable energy  those issues require action on a global scale. We therefore commend the Secretary-General for convening the Climate Summit here in New York last week. We are participating actively in those negotiations and hope they will pave the way for a successful conclusion in Paris next year. We have made an initial commitment to the Green Climate Fund to show our support for the global effort  but we will unashamedly continue to prioritize making real progress with real projects in our own region  which will continue to consume the bulk of our resources.The other major event that has recently taken place in the Pacific is the election in Fiji. We congratulate the Prime Minister  his party and the people of Fiji on their successful return to democratic rule. Fiji’s successful elections are hugely important for the region. I am delighted that following the preliminary report of the multinational observers group  both the Pacific Islands Forum and the Commonwealth have commenced the process of lifting Fiji’s suspension. We look forward to rebuilding and strengthening the connections between us. Neither New Zealand nor Fiji can contemplate a future that does not entail close and continuing links with the other. We also welcomed the safe return of the Fiji peacekeepers who were held hostage in the Golan Heights. That incident again underlined the great challenges and the dangers faced by United Nations peacekeepers and the responsibilities we all have to ensure the safety and security of peacekeeping and other United Nations personnel.It is as well that we are able to note some bright spots for our region  because the situation in other parts of the world does look bleak. What happened over the past few months in Gaza was an affront to humanity. No good was done for the cause of Palestine by Hamas firing rockets indiscriminately into Israel. No good was done for peace in the Middle East by Israel pounding Gaza with such intensity and at such cost of civilian lives. We welcome the ceasefire that was agreed after so many false starts and are thankful that so far it endures. We call on all sides not only to keep the guns and rockets silent but to refrain from actions that may destabilize what can only be described as an uneasy peace. In that connection  we express our profound regret at Israel’s appropriation of 400 hectares of privately owned Palestinian land near Bethlehem for settlements. That act itself is profoundly unhelpful.The problems of the Middle East are deep and difficult. They go back to the earliest days of the Organization and beyond. But what happened over the past months in and in relation to Gaza was a modern failure — a failure of leadership  of purpose and of vision. We urge the leaders of Israel and of Palestine  both West Bank and Gaza  to live up to their responsibilities to their peoples and to their positions.In Syria and Iraq  we see the truly frightening consequences when leadership  both internally and in the Security Council  has failed. Syria has been a weeping sore for over three years. Thousands of Syrians have died  millions have become refugees and all Syrian people have suffered terribly from the multiple conflicts engulfing the country. And now the tragedy of Syria has spilled over into Iraq  which was already wrestling with its own deep-seated problems. Many actors  in both the recent past and over a longer time frame  have had a hand in contributing to the situation we now confront  but now it is time for action.We need to find a way to contain the madness that is the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant  to address the humanitarian tragedy and to help the people of Syria and Iraq craft a better future. By any objective standard  that is a situation that cries out for Security Council attention  and that is true of both sides of the border. We need the Council members and the Governments concerned to move past the ideological stalemate that has kept the Council largely impotent for the past three years. The challenge we all face in Syria and Iraq is unlike any the United Nations has faced before. The political circumstances in which it is being played out are about as bad as they get. Yet somehow we must find a way of coming together to defeat that shared problem.Paralysis has also prevailed in the Security Council over Ukraine. The Council has been essentially a bystander as one of its permanent members has undermined the integrity of another Member State. We recognize the difficulties of managing ethnic tensions that straddle borders and the risks of local fires being stoked into wider national and international crises. But with the strong shared histories of cooperation and achievement between Russia and Ukraine  there is no excuse for leaders allowing matters to unravel as they have  to the point where international peace and security may be at risk. Already hundreds of innocent civilians on Flight MH-17 lost their lives through an associated mistake and miscalculation. We welcome the ceasefire agreed earlier this month  which has held  for the most part. We call on all involved to step back  think about what is at stake and start rebuilding the trust essential to finding a lasting solution.Events in the Middle East and Ukraine have dominated the headlines in recent months and have diverted attention from the serious situations that continue to play out in Africa  particularly in Libya  Mali  the Central African Republic  South Sudan  Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The United Nations is directly involved in those crises  and they continue to challenge the capacity of the Organization and of the African Union to respond to the sheer scale of human suffering and to the continuing need for external assistance to restore and keep the peace  keep civilian populations safe and deliver humanitarian assistance. Those issues  no less than those in the Middle East and Eastern Europe  will continue to require constant attention from the Security Council and the coordinated efforts of the broader United Nations family. They show that for all its failings and structural inequalities  the Council still has a vital role to play in maintaining international peace and security.But there is one lesson that we must learn from all those recent crises — the United Nations must fundamentally improve its performance in preventing conflict. Once fighting is in full spate  the options for peace disappear. Prevention is critical  not just in new conflicts  but also in the cases on the agenda where conflict has been frozen or where peacebuilding has not really taken hold.We are deeply troubled by the unprecedented scale of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. We recognize the huge challenges it poses to the economies and the political and security cohesion in the region. We have contributed and will continue to contribute to the humanitarian work under way  and on the formation of a new Government  we will look at further practical steps to support the international effort.In 18 days’ time  the United Nations membership will decide who will be on the Security Council for the next two-year term. New Zealand has been a candidate for that position since 2004. It has been 20 years since we were last on the Council. It has been a long and demanding campaign  and it will continue right up to the elections on 16 October. With tough competitors  such as our good friends Spain and Turkey  that has to be the case. The campaign has been a great opportunity for us to engage with nations around the world. We greatly value the new relationships we have forged and the enhanced character of existing relationships. Whatever the outcome  we are determined to maintain them. In the past  New Zealand has demonstrated that as a member of the Council it acts strongly  effectively and independently. It champions the rights of small States and for the voices of all to be heard. In short  as my Prime Minister said from this rostrum last year  there is no point in joining the Council simply to make up the numbers. Sometimes one has to speak up and shine a light on what is going on  or not going on  even when it is embarassing or inconvenient to others to do so.Above all  I can assure the Assembly that if we are elected  New Zealand will be a credible  positive influence on the Security Council. At our core  New Zealand is an optimistic country and New Zealanders are an optimistic people. We believe that things can be better than they are and are prepared  as a people  to work hard to achieve that. Despite the many challenges on the international agenda  my hope is that the membership of the United Nations will give us an opportunity to prove that by serving on the Security Council from next year."
"133",5414,"OMN",69,2014,"It is our pleasure  Mr. President  to congratulate you and your friendly country  the Republic of Uganda  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We are confident that your vast experience in diplomacy will steer the work of this session to a successful outcome. I would also like to assure you of the cooperation of the delegation of the Sultanate of Oman in working with you towards achieving the cherished goals and objectives of the current session  at the forefront of which is enhancing international peace and security.We would also like to take this opportunity to express our thanks and appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. John William Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda  for the excellent manner in which he conducted the work of the previous session. We would also like to reiterate our confidence in Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts to enhance the role of the United Nations and improve its working methods so that it can respond in the best possible way to the hopes and aspirations of Member States.The Middle East is going through a difficult phase as it grapples with several crises due to a lack of international consensus. We believe that the overall situation in the Middle East requires a unified position to solve the crises  the most immediate of which is the Palestinian question  which no doubt lies at the core of regional conflicts. We note that while the Palestinians have consistently shown willingness to enter into a genuine partnership in peace with Israel  based on the concept of two States living side by side in peace  Israel has not demonstrated responsible cooperation as it continues to resort to military force as a tool to maintain its security.Security and stability cannot be achieved through the use of excessive force and the insistence on inflicting heavy loss of life  injuries and destruction on the largest possible scale. The path to achieving the security and stability that underpins economic and social recovery can be realized only through the peaceful partnership of the Palestinians and Israelis. We now believe that there is a chance to achieve that objective  following the ceasefire agreement reached between the two sides  Palestinian and Israeli  in the Gaza Strip. We stress the importance of the two sides sticking to the agreement in words and in actions and avoiding violations under any justification or pretext. In that respect  we call upon Palestinians and Israelis alike to resume negotiations in order to reach a just and comprehensive settlement that would provide peace and security for Israel and that responds to the hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian people to regain their inalienable rights.The continuation of violence in the brotherly Syrian Arab Republic and its serious implications for regional and international peace and security require us to redouble our efforts to encourage the Syrian Government and the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces to return to the negotiating table  based on the Geneva communiqué. The two parties should approach negotiations in a positive manner by focusing on areas of consensus and avoiding negative aspects and positions with the aim of saving the Syrian people and sparing them further suffering and tragedies.While we applaud the role of humanitarian relief organizations and agencies in helping the Syrian people overcome their prolonged ordeal  we also call for intensified efforts to facilitate access by relief agencies to all areas inside and outside Syria to provide the necessary humanitarian assistance to the affected people. In that respect  we look forward in confidence to the efforts of the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria  Mr. Staffan de Mistura  to encourage Syrian and international stakeholders to reconvene the Geneva conference. We believe that the current situation is more conducive than ever to this effort.My country appreciates the efforts of the President of Yemen  Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi  to achieve security and stability there. We welcome the agreement of peace and partnership signed by President Hadi and the political powers in Yemen  and we call upon all political partners  particularly Ansar Allah  to comply with its provisions. We call on all political entities in Yemen to renounce violence and uphold the outcome of the National Dialogue Conference as the best available road map for resolving the current crisis. We hope that the Yemeni presidency will take the remaining important steps in the Comprehensive National Dialogue  most notably the referendum on a new constitution that would secure the rights and interests of all Yemenis.The Sultanate of Oman is firm in its principled position regarding the condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations  regardless of motives and justifications. In that context  we condemn the terrorist acts perpetrated by the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). We support the recommendations of the Jeddah and Paris conferences  and the steps the international community is taking to extend Iraqi authority over all ISIL-controlled areas. We emphasize the importance for the international community to stand united in freeing the Middle East from all forms of violence  extremism and terrorism. We also welcome Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) on the threats to international peace and security posed by terrorist acts.There are a number of ways to prevent violence and extremism. These include the consolidation of good governance and sustainable development  which would allow all sectors of society — especially young people  who constitute two thirds of the populations of Arab countries — to work  innovate and actively participate in the decisions affecting their daily life. On this basis  the Sultanate of Oman has established a complete and interlinked system encompassing the principles of good governance  including councils and institutions to protect society and young people and ensure their participation in the development process.In that regard  my country has established the Council of Oman  composed of two chambers  the Shura Consultative Council and the State Council. It has also created municipal councils  whose members are popularly elected  to oversee local issues that affect the lives of the people in the economic  social  educational and other fields  based on the principles of good governance and sustainable development.The Sultanate of Oman has also come a long way in its national development. It has established an independent judiciary  which has become a key element of the development and modernization process. It has also established the Public Prosecution Office  which stands at the apex of the independent judicial system in the Sultanate  as well as the State Audit Institution  whose role is to provide a secure and proper administration to ensure better management of public properties.It has also redoubled its efforts to fight corruption and organized crime. In that respect  and in the context of its efforts to protect the country and its citizens  the Sultanate has acceded to the United Nations Convention against Corruption  the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the three protocols thereto. This system of institutions is based on effective public participation in the policies adopted and implemented by the Government in order to enhance good governance in the framework of a modern civic State  based on institutions  in order to achieve security  stability and sustainable development.Regarding regional peace and security  my country supports the call for an international conference to establish a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction  in line with the resolution adopted at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. My country calls upon States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  especially the depository States  to take the necessary measures to achieve this goal in order to spare the region the dangers of tension  and to avoid confrontation.In closing  we would like emphasize that the Sultanate of Oman has come a long way towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals in all fields and within the specific timelines set by the United Nations."
"134",5461,"PAK",69,2014,"I congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I assure him that his priorities — the revitalization of the General Assembly  sustainable development  climate change and the peaceful settlement of disputes — are also our priorities. Our delegation will extend its full support to him in order to achieve those objectives.I also pay tribute to Mr. John Ashe for his effective leadership of the General Assembly during its past session. We commend the Secretary-General’s efforts to find diplomatic solutions to complex challenges to international peace and security. We appreciate his leadership in hosting the climate summit.Extreme weather patterns are disrupting world economies. In Pakistan we have directly experienced such a calamity just recently. The monsoon floods in Pakistan have had a devastating impact. We are mobilizing all our resources and ingenuity to provide relief and to ensure recovery. The international community should intensify its efforts to move from awareness to commitments to actions on climate change  which is wreaking havoc with economies  particularly in developing countries.This is a defining moment for the United Nations as it embarks upon the task of transforming the lives of billions of people by investing in sustainable development in the next 15 years. We are setting ourselves the vital target of eradicating poverty by 2030. To do that  we need to go beyond the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We need a new approach to eliminate conflict and violence and reduce inequality within and among nations. Only then will we be able to ensure healthy lives  empower women and girls  improve the quality of education  create jobs and guarantee the supply of affordable energy.The time is ripe for such ambition and action. The sustainable development goals crafted so far must be woven into an overarching framework. We must prioritize them. First things should come first. Peace  stability and inclusive economic growth — all come first.At the national level  we have launched our Vision 2025  which puts people first. It is inspired by our Founding Father  Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah  whose vision of a welfare State is based on the principles of justice  equity and responsibility.In the coming decade  we will develop human and social capital through investment in education  health and gender parity; stimulate sustained economic growth; prioritize energy  water and food security; modernize the public sector and encourage private-sector-led entrepreneurship. We have determined that regional peace and security  political stability in the country  the rule of law and social justice are absolutely crucial for the realization of those goals. Above all  we will continue to work for the promotion and protection of human rights.Energy is key to economic development. Pakistan co-chairs the Group of Friends of the Secretary-General’s Sustainable Energy for All initiative. The objectives of the initiative are also our national goals.It is my Government’s aspiration and endeavour to build a peaceful neighbourhood by pursuing a policy of constructive engagement. In South Asia  our people have missed opportunities for prosperity because of unresolved conflicts. We have a choice today: continue with the status quo or seize the moment to resolve all outstanding issues and free up our shared energies for cooperation. To take this course of high statesmanship  we need more  not less  dialogue and diplomacy. We need to respect each other’s rights and sensibilities. We must have relationships based on equality  mutual respect and transparency.We were disappointed at the cancellation of the Foreign Secretary-level talks by India. The world community  too  rightly saw it as another missed opportunity. Pakistan is convinced that we must remain engaged in the dialogue process for settling disputes and building economic and trade relations. Let us not ignore the dividends of peace.More than six decades ago  the United Nations adopted resolutions to hold a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir. The people of Jammu and Kashmir are still waiting for the fulfilment of that promise. Many generations of Kashmiris have lived their lives under occupation  accompanied by violence and abuse of their fundamental rights. Kashmiri women in particular have suffered immensely. For decades  attempts have been made  both under United Nations auspices and bilaterally in the spirit of the Lahore Declaration  to resolve the dispute. The core issue of Jammu and Kashmir has to be resolved. It is the responsibility of the international community. We cannot draw a veil on the issue of Kashmir  until it is addressed in accordance with the wishes of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan is ready to work for a resolution of the issue through negotiations. Our support and advocacy for the right to self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir is our historic commitment and a duty as a party to the Kashmir dispute.Afghanistan is going through momentous security  political and economic transitions. As always  Pakistan stands in solidarity with the fraternal Afghan people. I congratulate the people of Afghanistan on the successful completion of the electoral process. We extend our warm felicitations and good wishes to the new Afghan leadership. It is our earnest hope that those landmark processes will culminate in the emergence of a stronger  more stable and unified Afghanistan. We also hope that the process of inclusive Afghan-led and Afghan-owned reconciliation will move forward  thereby contributing to greater harmony  stability and prosperity in Afghanistan.Pakistan remains committed to forging a deeper bilateral relationship with Afghanistan on the basis of equal security and shared prosperity. Our two nations confront common challenges  which call for greater cooperation and understanding. In the past year and a half  we have consciously reached out to Afghanistan to address difficult issues and build on convergences. We have made headway in that effort.Pakistan has launched a massive operation to eliminate terrorism. Complementary counter-terrorism measures on the Afghan side of the border are essential to achieve optimal results.This past summer  the people of Gaza were subjected to mass atrocities by Israel. We condemned the indiscriminate killings of civilians — which amounted to genocide. From this rostrum  I once again convey Pakistan’s condolences and sympathies to the people of Palestine over their continuing plight.We welcome the ceasefire between Gaza and Israel  but the next steps must also be taken. The blockade of Gaza must be lifted  Palestinian prisoners must be freed and illegal settlements must be halted. The United Nations should facilitate a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian issue  based on the relevant United Nations resolutions.We call on all parties in Syria to renounce military and militant means and to hold dialogue to restore peace and stability in their historic land. The emergence of new militant entities in the Middle East once again illustrates that terrorism is a global threat. This primitive force in Iraq and Syria is an aberration  which has the sanction of no religion. It must be countered with unified and resolute will.We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We are fighting the terrorism that has been planted on Pakistan’s soil. Our valiant soldiers are laying down their lives to take out terrorists and tear down their evil networks. The entire nation is behind them.In the past 13 years  as a front-line State  we have made enormous sacrifices in blood and resources. Tens of thousands of civilians have been killed or injured. Our economy has also lost hundreds of billions of dollars in direct costs and denied investment opportunities. Yet in that fight  each time a soldier falls  another takes his place — proudly. It is the resolve of our nation to fight this scourge to the finish.At the same time  we have made a plan of action for the relief and rehabilitation of nearly 1 million internally dislocated persons. That includes a strategy to prevent the return and resurgence of militancy and to create a safe environment for local people.Pakistan’s strong commitment to peacekeeping is rooted in our foreign policy and in our belief that every nation should contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. Inspired by that ideal  Pakistan has maintained high levels of participation in United Nations peacekeeping and has become the largest troop-contributing country. We are contributing more than 1 100 troops to the Central African Republic operation  despite the dire situation there.As a responsible nuclear-weapon State  we will continue to support the objectives of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and pursue a policy of nuclear restraint and credible minimum deterrence. Pakistan is not participating in any arms race in the region. Yet we cannot be oblivious to the emerging security scenarios and buildup of armaments. We  too  have the obligation to maintain a robust and reliable deterrence.I would like to reiterate the need for an interlinked mechanism for pursuing nuclear restraint  conventional equilibrium and conflict resolution. To promote stability  we are prepared to explore new confidence-building measures.Pakistan has maintained the highest standards of nuclear safety and security. At the last summit at The Hague that I attended  Pakistan’s recent nuclear measures  especially the establishment of a centre of excellence  were appreciated.Pakistan is a State with advanced nuclear technology and more than 40 years of experience. Pakistan is a mainstream partner in the international non-proliferation regime. Pakistan also has a stringent national export-control system that is fully harmonized with international export-control regimes. Though a non-member  we are abiding by their guidelines.Pakistan ought to be a part of those export-control regimes  especially the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Pakistan also qualifies for full access to civil nuclear technology to overcome its energy shortages and spur economic growth.The ongoing reform of the United Nations must be comprehensive. We support a reform of the Security Council that reflects the interests of all Member States — small  medium-sized and large — and not the ambitions of a few. There should be no new permanent seats in the Council. That would be contrary to the democratic character of this world body. We want the Council to become more representative  equitable  accountable and transparent.We meet here today on the cusp of a new era for the international community. Never before has the United Nations embraced such lofty goals to banish poverty  stimulate development  protect the environment and foster peace  as it will during this session. The future of our planet hinges on our decisions. Let us deliver them with full responsibility and wisdom. Pakistan will assist the Assembly and the United Nations as a whole to make the world a better place for all humankind."
"135",5504,"PAN",69,2014,"At the outset  I wish to congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uganda  on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.I am from a region that  in my youth  lived through challenging conflicts. That inspired me to go into public life  which in turn has allowed me to address the General Assembly in my capacity as President of the Republic of Panama at a time when the world is enduring conflicts and very serious situations that call for all of us to take action. I am speaking on behalf of a noble  wholesome and peaceful people  whom I greet and warmly embrace from this rostrum. Panama is a peace-loving country that has granted me the opportunity to lead a Government that is steering our country to a foreign policy of unity and consensus  based on our geographic location and the mandate of being a champion of peace and the common good of all the inhabitants of this beautiful planet.Despite the serious conflicts raging throughout the world today  America is at peace. The major challenges we face today are inequality  the fight against organized crime and drug and human trafficking  and the need to regulate migration flowing out of necessity into countries with more developed economies. Those challenges are being addressed by our Governments  but they require further coordination. As leaders  we must understand that in order to achieve and maintain peace throughout the world  we must first lead our nations along the same path. This is why I am committed to social justice  to strengthening the rule of law  and to leading an honest  humane Government that is in touch with the people and whose strength is based on the principle that public office is solely for the service of others  putting our country’s resources at the service of the people of Panama  the region and the world.Fourteen years ago  the Heads of State and of Government of the international community gathered in the General Assembly to approve the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2)  which defined a global development agenda to address various common challenges and improve the standards of living of our peoples. Despite their differences of the time  countries were able to agree and to reach a consensus to respect the priorities of each nation  focusing on the achievement of fundamental goals aimed at guaranteeing the human potential of our citizens.Today  nearly a decade and a half after that historic Declaration  all countries without exception  through different Governments  have made important progress in meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Nonetheless  not only have many of the challenges defined in the MDGs not been met  but new ones have arisen that require us to build a new consensus and to establish goals at the regional  hemispheric and global levels. That is why  on behalf of the people and the Government of Panama  I would like to reiterate our commitment to being a facilitator of dialogue that allows for bringing the international community together anew so that we may redefine the post-2015 global development agenda.For the past five centuries  the isthmus of Panama has been the transit route of civilizations. Today  our country is still committed to that role. This year  as we mark the centennial of the Panama Canal  we reiterate our commitment to being a nation at the service of the international community  with the Canal  our logistic system  ports  airports and our heartfelt embrace of all countries of the world.As they do in this building  the United Nations Headquarters  all the worlds’ flags come together in the Panama Canal  and that is a source of pride and satisfaction for all Panamanians. It makes us a country of convergence  and we therefore have a great responsibility to the Panamanian people and the international community. Furthermore  Panama has assumed the challenge of completing the Canal expansion project  which we will do with firmness  determination and the support of professionals and workers from Panama and various other nations.Panamanians feel a great responsibility to contributing to the search for understanding in order to maintain social peace  promote international security and join efforts towards the solution of common problems that affect us. That is why we reaffirm today our vocation as a country of dialogue  ready to fulfil the responsibility of uniting the Americas and the world within the framework of the United Nations and in every opportunity we have to mediate in disputes that hinder us from reaching agreements towards tackling the new global challenges. In April 2015  our country will host the Summit of the Americas  and we are working on this event that will bring together all the Heads of State and Government of our hemisphere in order to promote integration and social peace with equity and prosperity.The 193 countries of the world have different political systems  beliefs  religions and cultures that must be respected. In spite of those differences  we all face common challenges. That is why  in order to secure the well-being of our citizens  our Governments are called to find unity of criteria for strengthening multilateral systems  which must be engaged with all the strength of States in order to combat shared threats and problems.Within conflicts and difficult situations at the global level  there are strong messages of hope — volunteer medical doctors from all over the world are making progress to fight Ebola in Africa  and several countries are united in the fight against terrorists whose atrocious crimes affect innocent people and threaten international peace and security. Panama is aware of those efforts and supports them. We express our solidarity with all victims and their families.I am convinced that the men and women we elect to public office must serve only the people who elected us and manage public power temporarily granted to us with the purpose of improving the quality of life of our population. Politics is one of the strongest expressions of public service because it is the search for the common good. The greatest legacy  which I will strive to build during the next five years  is to leave the Panamanian people a functional democracy  to strengthen the rule of law  where public servants are accountable only to the nation  with strong institutions  accountability and without impunity  with a view to guaranteeing that public administrations are honest and transparent. All Governments have the obligation to ensure that State resources are used exclusively in the service of our citizens  and that all public works and projects have the people’s interests in mind.Committed to that mission and to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  I became President of my country on 1 July and formed a Government that will continue to foster the economic growth enjoyed by Panama  while giving priority to public investment that has greater impact on the quality of life of all Panamanians. With an average domestic economic growth of 7 per cent  increasing foreign investment  legal security  low inflation and unemployment rates  and a consolidated democratic system  we are making good on the proposals for which I was elected.During our mandate  we have taken strong measures to curb speculation in the cost of food. We are working to ensure that Panamanian families have adequate housing with access to drinking water  basic sanitation  water supply  sewage systems and treatment plants for waste water and solid waste. We have launched major social projects for our youth so that they grow up in safe neighbourhoods with better opportunities  jobs  sports facilities and cultural centres to keep them away from crime.Our public schools will have adequate facilities and teachers trained in the English language  in order to promote a bilingual education. Our social welfare programmes will allow all students to finish high school and senior citizens to live with dignity. Our students will have the opportunity to go to college or study at newly established higher technical institutes that will prepare them for the new jobs that our economy is creating in the areas of logistics and tourism  inter alia.Our public health system will be unified  and the resulting savings will be used to strengthen preventive health programmes  ensuring better medical care  and premium quality treatments and medication. We are building a modern and efficient public transportation system with the new projects to add second and third lines to the Metro of Panama City  thereby improving the quality of life of our people. We will develop tourism and support air connectivity to and from principal cities in the United States  Canada  Latin America  the Caribbean and Europe. We will protect our logistical and financial systems to prevent organized crime and gangs from gaining access to them  and we shall tackle organized crime and gangs with the full force of the State in order to defeat them and keep them away from our youth and our neighbourhoods.Our Government will work tirelessly to prepare our young people to be responsible citizens of the world and care for our natural resources in order to ensure sustainable development. We will work closely with the private sector and civil society in order to fulfil those national goals  the Millennium Development Goals and the new challenges of the global agenda.We live in a diverse world  with different cultures  religions and political systems  but we can always find common ground in the well-being of our citizens. That was the approach that led to the successful adoption of the Millennium Declaration  and it will be the key to defining and fulfilling the post-2015 development agenda.Panama is a country that is respectful of others and willing to serve as a bridge to understanding  on the basis of respect for diversity  tolerance  pluralism and human rights. Above all  the Assembly can be assured that Panama’s Government is a Government of men and women who respect the law and are willing to share experiences  learn from best practices and contribute to global peace  socio-economic development and the well-being of all peoples.I would like to conclude by sharing a statement that has been with me since my youth: “The time has come to put our capacity to use in service of others.” May God give us the strength to continue to build together a better world for our citizens and for future generations."
"136",5551,"PER",69,2014,"My Government warmly welcomes the theme proposed for this debate regarding the post-2015 development agenda  since it directly addresses the most pressing problems facing humanity  namely  inequality  hunger  poverty  injustice and underdevelopment  factors that create situations that our community of the United Nations cannot and should not tolerate. We must address our task decisively  and in doing so we must be guided by the principles set forth in our Charter  but above all  we must have the firm commitment of all members of the international community. Our peoples  who are calling for the implementation of a truly transformational global development agenda  expect nothing else from us.In that regard  I wish to point out that  by virtue of the universal  comprehensive and ambitious nature of our goals  the consensus achieved so far in the effort to define the sustainable development goals of the post-2015 development agenda constitutes an essential point of departure for that purpose. In that regard  I think that the process in question deserves our strong support and must be allocated the requisite resources in a timely manner to ensure full implementation. Consistent with that principle  Peru fully supports this process and is confident that the adoption next year of the post-2015 development agenda will lead to the establishment of a genuine global partnership for sustainable development. The process will have participatory monitoring mechanisms so as to ensure appropriate follow-up and monitoring.I wish to highlight that a clear-cut convergence exists between the guidelines promoted by Peru through its public policies on social inclusion and the goals agreed upon by the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. In both cases  priority is placed on initiatives to reduce poverty and inequality in all its forms  and to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger  once and for all. Similarly  emphasis is placed on the struggle for equality  the empowerment of women  access to quality education and the elimination of all forms of gender-based violence and violence against children. It is also worth highlighting the importance of continuing sustainable economic growth and promoting formal and decent employment. Those issues  among others  are of vital importance to Peru.To that end  we must reflect on what type of State we have today and move forward to meet the challenge. In the case of Peru  we are pleased to highlight that we have implemented a set of State reforms geared towards attaining those objectives. Peru has been working hard to consolidate and build upon the foundations for sustainable development. Our nation is a clear example of how it is possible to achieve substantial progress in just a few years  without straying from the fundamental principles of the Charter  such as peace and security  human rights and development. In fact  Peru is one of the countries that has made the most sustained progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals  some of which will have been attained even before the 2015 deadline. Thus  thanks to economic growth and a coordinated and comprehensive social policy  we have achieved significant progress in fighting poverty  given that we had set ourselves the goal for 2016 — the end of my term in office — to reduce that figure to under one fifth of the population.In just one generation  Peruvians have implemented a deep transformation based on the pacification of the country  the consolidation of democracy  stability  the opening of its economy  as well as the creation and development of a social inclusion policy. That is precisely why our aspirations  objectives and goals are increasingly ambitious.With that perspective  we see ourselves as an emerging country with strong institutions that is proud of its cultural diversity and of the skills of its people. We have made significant progress in the reduction of poverty and child malnutrition. Our country is built on an inclusive social platform that promotes equal opportunities  gender equality  justice and security.My Administration is undertaking extraordinary efforts in that direction and has prioritized its action to focus on the fields of health care  education  security and social welfare. On previous occasions  I have talked about the body of first- and second-generation social programmes that we have been implementing  among which Qali Warma  which provides free meals in public schools  Juntos  a conditional cash-transfer programme  Pension 65  a non-contributory pension plan  and the Beca 18 scholarship programme are worth highlighting. All of those programmes are coordinated under a multisectoral strategy that prioritizes the human being and the family throughout their life cycle. That strategy  which we call “include to grow”  is intended not only to alleviate the immediate needs of the poor and extremely poor people but also to build the capacities of individuals and to create opportunities for all.The Government of Peru has been increasing its budget for investment in social policies annually  reaching unprecedented figures. By way of example  I can point out that the budget for 2015 has increased by 12 per cent over that of last year  and that approximately half of that increase has been allocated to education and health care. The remainder is primarily for the expansion of social programmes  the development of infrastructure and the improvement of public safety  since public safety is another major priority of my Administration. Given that challenge  we constantly monitor citizens’ demands and organize State action to effectively address those requests robustly and effectively in order to generate the climate of peace and trust much needed by our families.Historically  Peru has faced another impediment to development: corruption. That is why we are taking drastic measures against those people who  in shameful exercise of their duties and public functions  betray citizens’ trust. In that regard  in Peru  we are implementing a concept of education and public and political ethics to be followed not only by those who govern Peru but by all citizens  with a major emphasis on those who implement and enforce the law. We are also considering barring from public office for life those who commit acts of corruption while carrying out their public duty.I would now like to talk about another major challenge that we must overcome  namely  the world drug problem. I would appeal to the international community to continue to strengthen dialogue and cooperation so as to counter that scourge. We therefore believe that the special session of the General Assembly will be an opportunity for the international community to jointly address that issue in a cooperative way. The scope of the threat is clearly global  and our response must incorporate that dimension. We have given priority to a comprehensive strategy to implement alternative development and to support social inclusion programmes. In that way  we are regaining not only the territory but also  most importantly  the people.However  in order to ultimately overcome that challenge successfully  all relevant actors must participate actively. The joint and shared responsibility of producers and users  as well as the transit and financing countries  must facilitate the establishment of a comprehensive strategy  in which all those involved assume their responsibilities and adopt binding solutions.On the economic front  the recent adoption of a national production diversification programme to expand our production base  bring about a historical change in the country’s economic structure and create formal employment seeks to leverage our capabilities and resources by promoting sustainable industrialization  entrepreneurship and access to science and technology. We are thereby adding value to our production and making our growth and development sustainable.We seek to continue expanding and deepening our trade relations  improve the existing 17 trade agreements that cover approximately 95 per cent of our foreign trade  while also moving towards the completion of the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization. Peru’s aspiration to a more integrated world is widely recognized. We therefore give particular priority to any participatory forum  such as the Pacific Alliance  which is an initiative that promotes the free movement of persons  goods  services and capital and cooperation among its members  as well as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. That aspiration also includes the right of all countries to achieve the highest level of social  economic and trade development. We therefore reiterate once again the call to end the economic blockade against Cuba  which affects that country’s economic growth and delays its social and human development and has an impact on the welfare of its citizens.Peru’s relationships with its neighbours are excellent. I wish to highlight the recent settlement of the maritime dispute with Chile  achieved on the basis of international law and the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes  as well as the fact that the handing down of the ruling of the International Court of Justice was the fastest in its history. In general  the way in which the entire case was conducted makes Peru and Chile an example for the world.Peru affirms its active participation in the international community. In that context  we will be the host country for the twentieth United Nations Climate Change Conference in December. On that occasion  the discussions will be important but national commitments will be essential. Today  I say that we need to organize the largest alliance in history to address that critical challenge  in which the agreements reached will define the future of our civilization. As the host country  I urge the heads of State and Government to maintain their political will  so as to move forward constructively with representatives that have the capacity to take decisions. It is not only a matter of capitalizing on the Green Climate Fund but also one of clearly setting out national commitments and achieving a binding agreement.We must be conscious that  for the first time  humankind has achieved the capacity for mass destruction without resorting to nuclear energy. In that regard  it is vital that the international community become aware that world problems  such as climate change  require global  rather than national  responses. According to a 2011 study by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean  the cost of global warming to Peru is revealed in floods  droughts  thaws and warming waters and amounts to approximately 4 per cent of Peru’s annual gross domestic product (GDP). If we do not take immediate action  the economic impact of climate change could be over 5 per cent of GDP by 2030 and 20 per cent by 2050. Peru also recently ratified the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from Their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity  which will soon be in force to promote such genetic resources.Today’s general debate finds us in a complex scenario with various severe political  humanitarian and economic crises. We are faced with major global economic challenges regarding international security and global governance. The Security Council’s ability to respond to the various crises around the world has revealed the need to reform its work methods  including those related to the use of the veto. The Security Council needs to respond in an effective way to those situations  which requires comprehensive reform  including increasing the number of permanent and non-permanent members  making that body more efficient  democratic  transparent and representative.Specifically on the Palestine issue  my Government confirms the need to address the root causes of that conflict through negotiations to achieve a viable and lasting solution  overcoming the status quo and enabling Palestinians and Israelis to live in peace and to prosper in the two States with secure and recognized borders.The international community faces various ever-growing phenomena that transcend borders. I am referring to terrorism  transnational organized crime  the global drug problem  corruption  trafficking in persons  sexual exploitation  trafficking in young boys and girls and in adolescents  and arms smuggling  among others. With regard to acts committed by terrorist groups all over the world in recent months  my country knows the consequences of such acts very well  and they have been most energetically rejected by my Government.Combating terrorism is a responsibility that the international community must assume within the framework of the law  with full respect for the fundamental rights of all peoples and the sovereignty of States. Regarding the condemnable events that have occurred in several regions of the world  the Government of Peru has expressed its strong rejection of such barbaric and terrorist attacks by extremist groups against the lives of innocent civilian hostages and religious and ethnic minorities. Those intolerable events deserve the firmest condemnation by the international community.Peru is not just a country with its own history; it is also a civilization. Its culture is part of the world heritage of humankind  as recognized by UNESCO. That recognition signifies a universal recognition of the extraordinary work of our ancestors  who knew how to harmonize development and the environment in a sensible and creative way.I would like to conclude by reiterating Peru’s commitment to the development and implementation of the post-2015 agenda  focusing on sustainable development goals  and by reiterating my call to allocate the means required to make them a reality. In the context of the upcoming Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP-20) in Lima  I wish to reiterate my commitment and that of the Peruvian Government to the Conference objectives  and we call upon the international community to participate actively with a constructive spirit for sustainable development in the interest of our peoples. Peru  the cradle of the Inca civilization and the international capital of excellent gastronomy  is ready to welcome everyone."
"137",5598,"PHL",69,2014,"On behalf of the Philippine Government  we offer our warmest congratulations to Mr. Kutesa on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I assure him of the Philippines’ steadfast support as he provides the leadership and inspiration in the daunting task of continuing the pursuit of a transformative and inclusive post-2015 development agenda. In choosing the theme for his presidency  he has positioned people at the centre of this development agenda. This people-centred agenda is also at the core of President Benigno S. Aquino III’s Social Contract with the Filipino People  which is underpinned by a regime of good governance.I would like to address the following issues  which are consistent with both the President’s Social Contract and the United Nations post-2015 development agenda: progress on the Millennium Development Goals; climate change and disaster-risk reduction and management; the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham; the Ebola virus disease outbreak; peace  security and the rule of law; disarmament  peacekeeping  migration  the protection of women and children; and the call for United Nations reforms.Fourteen years ago  a shared vision of a decent and secure life for all our peoples motivated us to adopt the Millennium Development Goals. We all vowed to undertake a mission to fight poverty and disease; grant children of school age access to primary education; improve gender equality  care for mothers and children; provide our communities with safe drinking water; protect our environment from further degradation; and mobilize international partnerships and resources to help those in great need. Today  based on the latest report on the Millennium Development Goals  our collective efforts have reduced by half the number of people living in extreme poverty  provided over 2 billion people with access to safe drinking water  and achieved success in the fight against malaria and tuberculosis. But  with one year to go  much remains to be done.The Philippines’ scorecard shows that we have made considerable progress in the areas of extreme poverty eradication  under age 5 mortality  the fight against both malaria and tuberculosis  access to safe drinking water  and gender equality. Like many other developing nations  however  we continue to face challenges in other areas. We have recently taken pause to consider new strategies. We have also realized the importance of strengthening good-quality data collection and analysis as a tool for measuring our Millennium Development Goals and to aid our decision-making.A year ago  before this very same Assembly  the Philippines called for a post-2015 development agenda anchored in respect and promotion of human rights  accountable governance and inclusive development (see A/68/PV.22). All our current national efforts are founded on these pillars.The greatest challenge to the Philippines in meeting the Millennium Development Goals has been the series of disasters that have visited our country. Super-typhoon Haiyan  the strongest typhoon to have hit landfall in recorded history  had a significant impact on the modest progress we had achieved towards the Millennium Development Goals. This and the disasters in other parts of the world remind us of the urgent need to address climate change.Two months ago  we completed a comprehensive rehabilitation and recovery plan for the Haiyan-affected areas. The comprehensive plan requires a considerable amount of resources and effort  but the Philippines and its international partners are determined to see this massive rebuilding and rehabilitation plan to full completion. We are resolute in not only building back  but building back better. Once again  let me reiterate the Filipino people’s gratitude for the outpouring of assistance from the international community for the victims and survivors of Haiyan. Its response and solidarity were indeed timely  overwhelming and inspiring. At this time  we look forward to the forthcoming Third World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai  Japan  and to the first-ever World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul  Turkey  during which we hope to share the lessons we have learned from Haiyan.Just as the international community mobilized as one in extending help to the Philippines in the aftermath of Haiyan  it should also do so in the case of two present-day scourges: the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) and the Ebola virus disease outbreak. The Philippines condemns the war crimes and crimes against humanity being perpetrated by ISIS. We support Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) on foreign terrorist fighters  adopted on 24 September  because we believe that resolute and immediate action is necessary to suppress that group. As a responsible member of the international community  the Philippines will do its part in the global efforts to thwart ISIS and its false ideologies.On the Ebola virus disease outbreak  the Philippines recognizes its threat to global health and its impact on development. Based on our capacity  we will support the international community’s efforts in arresting the spread of this scourge through the auspices of the World Health Organization.Development efforts are jeopardized by setbacks brought about by threats to peace  security and the rule of law. We must ensure that conflicts do not undermine any development agenda that we pursue. We must rededicate ourselves to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and relevant international conventions and agreements to resolve all conflicts peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law.In this spirit  I am pleased to share the Philippine experience in building peace in the southern Philippines. With the signing of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro  we are optimistic that peace dividends in the form of investments  jobs  economic opportunities  access to basic services and infrastructure will finally redound to the benefit of our Muslim brothers and sisters. We are grateful to the United Nations and the international community for their role in supporting us through the long and challenging journey of this peace process.As we herald these achievements of peace at home  however  we face the reality of exacerbating tensions in our regional seas. Again  the Philippines has resorted to the rule of law in trying to resolve these tensions. The Philippines believes that the core instrument for resolving maritime disputes is the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). We have invited a State party to settle our maritime disputes peacefully through UNCLOS  including its provisions on dispute settlement  specifically arbitration under annex VII to the Convention.However  it has refused to join us and has continued to unilaterally embark on an expansionist claim that violates the legitimate rights of the Philippines and other littoral neighbours under UNCLOS  such as their exclusive economic zones and continental shelves. Instead of peacefully resolving the maritime disputes within the framework of UNCLOS  the said State has embarked on a series of dangerous  reckless and forceful activities in an attempt to impose unilateral change in the maritime status quo of the South China Sea. Those unilateral activities escalated the tensions and threatened peace and stability in the South China Sea.In 2012  after forcibly occupying the tiny rocks of Scarborough Shoal  within 126 nautical miles of the Philippine island of Luzon  the aforementioned State refused to abide by a mutual agreement to de-escalate tensions by not withdrawing its vessels from the said rocks. Earlier this year  said State imposed a unilateral moratorium on fishing in some areas of the South China Sea that infringes on the legitimate sovereign rights of the Philippines and other coastal States to their exclusive economic zones. In the past two years  it has undertaken massive land reclamation activities in Johnson Reef  Mckennan Reef  Hughes Reef  Cuarteron Reef and Gaven Reef in the Spratly Islands.Those unilateral activities  among others  form part of a pattern of forcing a change in the maritime status quo in order to advance a so-called nine-dash line position  an expansive claim of indisputable sovereignty over nearly the entire South China Sea  which is in contravention of both the 2002 China and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and the UNCLOS. The Philippines supports the Secretary-General’s call for States parties to clearly define and publicize the limits of their respective maritime zones so that parties will have greater certainty concerning their maritime spaces.UNCLOS provides a viable mechanism for resolving conflicts  inter alia through arbitration. Arbitration is an open  friendly and durable mechanism for the peaceful settlement of maritime disputes. Arbitration  in defining maritime entitlements  is intended to benefit all. Therefore  the Philippines is more determined than ever in its pursuit of all possible means under international law to keep the conflict from escalating and undermining regional peace  security  and stability.At the 47th meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of ASEAN  in Nay Pyi Taw  the Philippines proposed the triple action plan to reduce tensions. Our triple action plan proposal contains immediate  intermediate and final approaches to address the provocative and destabilizing activities in the South China Sea. It is a positive  comprehensive and constructive framework that brings together various initiatives that the Philippines and other countries have been advocating on the issue of the South China Sea for several years.As an immediate approach  the triple action plan calls for the cessation of specific activities that escalate tensions in the region  pursuant to paragraph 5 of the 2002 ASEAN-China Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. Paragraph 5 calls for  first  self-restraint; secondly  no inhabitation of uninhabited features  including massive reclamation; and thirdly  the handling of differences in a constructive manner. For the intermediate approach to managing tensions until a final resolution is achieved  the triple action plan highlights the need for the full and effective implementation of the Declaration and the expeditious conclusion of a code of conduct. As a final approach  the triple action plan underscores the need for a settlement mechanism to bring the disputes to a final and enduring resolution anchored in international law.The Philippines is pursuing such a resolution through arbitration and believes that the arbitration decision will clarify maritime entitlements and will pave the way for the full resolution of the maritime disputes in the South China Sea. Those approaches under the triple action plan can be pursued simultaneously  and they do not prejudice territorial claims. We enjoin all to be united in addressing the challenge of resolving this issue in accordance with the rule of law.On disarmament  the Philippines is deeply concerned about the threat of weapons of mass destruction  from the Middle East to the Korean peninsula. The Philippines has remained firm in its position on the total and complete elimination of nuclear  biological and chemical weapons. The Philippines strongly believes that the conference on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction should be convened as soon as possible. The Six-Party Talks on the Korean peninsula should restart. We need a successful outcome to the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to ensure the credibility of the Treaty.The Philippines strongly supports the ongoing discourse on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons that has been gaining ground within and outside the United Nations. We will continue to lend our voice to calls for nuclear disarmament until we have reached the goal of global zero. The Philippines also deplores the use of landmines and improvised explosive devices and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons  which  unfortunately  still continue around the world.United Nations peacekeeping missions are crucial to international peace and security. The Philippines  through its continuous participation in peacekeeping missions  has shown its steadfast commitment to contributing to that worthy cause. Let me take this opportunity to thank our partners in the international community for their invaluable assistance in recent incidents involving our Philippine peacekeepers  specifically in the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force in the Golan Heights. Our collective action has highlighted the importance that the international community continues to accord to United Nations peacekeeping.In the face of grave danger  Filipino peacekeepers have bravely helped to safeguard world peace. They have served with honour  distinction and professionalism in implementing peacekeeping mandates. We are deeply concerned about the continuing and emerging dangers faced by all United Nations peacekeepers  and urge the United Nations and all fellow Member States to ensure that those dangers are addressed comprehensively. We believe that outstanding operational and tactical issues relating to United Nations peacekeeping must be resolved at the highest levels as soon as possible. The Philippines reiterates its solid commitment to upholding multilateral peacekeeping  collective security and the rule of law.When we speak of inclusive development  we must take into full account the invaluable contributions that migrant workers make to global development and progress. Their well-being is a shared responsibility and part of the international community’s commitment to promoting inclusive societies. Those migrants are especially vulnerable in times of conflict and should not be forgotten. They deserve the complete support and cooperation of the international community in ensuring their safety  security and well-being. For such an important task  all countries — whether receiving  transit or sending — must be fully involved.We are also alarmed that migrants  particularly women and children  continue to be victims of trafficking. National and international efforts to prevent trafficking  prosecute traffickers and assist in the recovery and rehabilitation of victims must be strengthened. From a broader perspective  we should fully respect the rights of migrants by according them equal treatment in all countries. The Philippines will continue to support efforts to protect the basic rights of migrants  recognize their contributions to development and secure for them a place in the inclusive societies that we envision in the post-2015 development agenda.As we discuss and negotiate the best ways to deliver and implement the post-2015 development agenda  we should take concrete action on the proposed United Nations reforms that have been the subject of years of discussions and dialogues. The Philippines supports change and reform in the United Nations to strengthen its ability to meet new demands and deliver its mandate in the most effective  transparent  accountable and efficient manner. Reforms should include a better selection process for the Secretary-General  the President of the General Assembly and executive heads of the United Nations; an increase in the membership of the Security Council; a review of the use of the veto power in the Security Council; an increased budget for peacekeeping missions; and ways to make full and effective use of partnerships across the range of United Nations activities. For example  if we were to elect a woman to be the next Secretary-General of the United Nations  that would be a powerful signal on gender equality and empowerment.As we set the stage to roll out a new set of goals for the post-2015 development agenda  let us not lose track of the equal importance of an enabling political and social environment to support the goals. When conflicts and insecurity endure  when disasters strike  when pandemics break out  when terrorism spreads and when the Earth’s bounties are confronted with depletion  we face the real danger that our development agenda will fail. It is our responsibility  therefore  as States Members of the United Nations  to exert every effort and expend every resource at our command to make the United Nations the instrument for promoting peace  progress and development."
"138",5617,"PLW",69,2014,"Without trying to be melodramatic  I believe that my country  the Pacific region and the world have reached a crossroads. In this International Year of Small Island Developing States  leading up to the climate change negotiations at the twentieth and twenty-first Conferences of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  the third International Conference on Financing for Development and the impending adoption of the post-2015 development agenda  viewed within the context of our rising oceans  the Ebola crisis in Africa and the apparent societal inferno in progress in the Arab world  we find our societies  our cultures and our economies under serious attack  never before experienced on so many fronts. We can continue business as usual along our current course and wait for the horizons to clear the global haze or we can choose a different road  one that will give our critical habitats the chance to recover and thereby ensure their continued ability to sustain us. Am I a foolish dreamer or a simple pragmatist? I guess that only time will tell.However  I will say one thing. My country  small as it is  will not go down without a fight  using every available tool  nor will the Pacific region  whose people comprehend first-hand the real and current impacts of climate change and recognize that their oceans are becoming polluted and their fish stocks depleted. That is why the Pacific leaders at this year’s Pacific Islands Forum supported the Palau Declaration under the theme “The ocean: life and future”. Within that theme and Declaration  the Pacific leaders highlighted the fact that  in order to survive  we will have to continue to play a central role in the stewardship of one of the greatest endowments of the world — the Pacific Ocean. That is because  in our short lifetime  we have experienced a dangerous combination of human impacts that threaten the foundation of our Pacific livelihoods.That is why we have called on the global community to support the efforts of the Forum countries to sustainably use their ocean resources and to conserve their valuable underwater heritage. That is why Palau  Kiribati  the Cook Islands  New Caledonia  the United States of America  the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands are currently in the process of declaring and establishing protected marine areas of different sizes and requirements to reverse the current trends of overuse and overexploitation and thereby ensure a healthy ocean for our children.That is why we are committed to ensuring the launch of negotiations by September 2015 for an international agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction. That is why we are calling upon the United Nations to ensure a stand-alone sustainable development goal (SDG) on oceans.However  while we are strongly in favour of that critical SDG  we are concerned that the post-2015 development dialogue may be too broad. We must remember that an agenda of everything is effectively an agenda of nothing. Above all  our goals and targets must be realistic  practical  simple  transparent and measurable. In that context  we must continue to focus on the vulnerable countries and the people most in need. To accomplish that objective  we must recognize that one size does not fit all and that we must continue to concentrate on a common but differentiated response.Our international community has years of experience of what does and does not work with our Millennium Development Goals. It is now time to complete the work on the remaining half and to continue to improve both the level and the responsiveness of our financing mechanisms. We must also ensure that the bulk of the financing reaches those that need it most and that their share is not a mere drop in the bucket.In the Pacific  we believe action must begin in one’s own backyard. In my country  in the next several months  we will formalize the establishment of a national marine sanctuary  which will include a complete prohibition on purse seine fishing that covers 100 per cent of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ)  a “no-take” marine sanctuary that covers 80 per cent of the Palau EEZ; a highly regulated fishing zone that covers approximately 20 per cent of the EEZ and will provide for Palau’s domestic fishing needs alone; and a prohibition on commercial fish exports. Through our global actions and our partnerships between developing and developed nations and between the private and the public sectors  we can achieve a transformational shift in the way we think about the use of our Earth’s natural assets. By recognizing the ocean as a joint and primary asset of every citizen on our planet  we can move towards the global management of our global ocean exclusive economic zone.We must never shift from the need for a global climate change initiative that addresses the threat to all people of all nations. Climate change is our planet’s silent war. It must not remain on the back pages of our minds and our global commitments. We must move it to the front page  alongside global conflicts  so that it receives the attention and the financing that it deserves. And we must understand that  in terms of public health  climate change is a defining issue for our century.Climate change affects the air that we breathe  the food that we eat  the water that we drink and the infectious diseases that find their way into our homes. Our world leaders  whether from developed or developing countries  must overcome the failures of our own lost generation. As the Secretary-General said  the race is on  and now is the time for leaders to step up and steer the world towards a safer future. A temperature increase of 3.6 degrees is simply not acceptable. If that is the best objective that our global leaders can agree on  we may as well throw in the towel and stop having children  because there will be no future for them.By the end of 2015  our global leaders must announce a new direction with new and realistic commitments and practical actions  supported by a greatly enhanced financial commitment both to mitigation and to adaptation. Those commitments must include the ratification of the second amendment to the Kyoto Protocol. Within our discussions  migration should not be an option. As the young mother Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner from the Marshall Islands put it so beautifully on Tuesday  “No one is moving. No one is losing their homeland. No one is becoming a climate change refugee”.Our small island nations  which are the first to feel the impacts of climate change  the first to feel the impacts of diminished marine resources and the first to wet our feet in sea-level rise  are ready and willing to lead. We do not call for action from developed nations that we are not willing to take ourselves. Last year  my country committed  under the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership  to a 20 per cent contribution of renewable energy to the energy mix and a 30 per cent reduction in energy consumption by 2020. We are well on the way to achieving those goals.Since its independence  Palau has been blessed with strong partnerships. For over 50 years  the United States has provided its support and friendship. Without its support to Palau’s transition  revenue independence and infrastructure development  we would not be where we are today. Palau stands strongly behind the United States in its ongoing efforts to guide the international response to the horrific situation in Syria and Iraq and its actions to respond to the threat of the Islamic State in Iraq and Sham. Let us not forget that global peace and stability are critical if we are to achieve our development agenda and respond to the issues of climate change and ocean regeneration.We wish to give special thanks for President Obama’s support for oceans and the expressed intent to set aside 10 per cent of our global oceans as marine protected areas. Finally  we thank the United States for past and future technical and financial assistance in our efforts to implement our National Marine Sanctuary. We continue to look forward to finally completing our Compact of Free Association agreement  which reflects this close and special relationship.Palau would also like to acknowledge the very significant economic support that we have received over the years from our good friend  Japan. We are hopeful that the Security Council expansion and reform process will result in Japan’s permanent membership on the Security Council. We also are hopeful that Japan will continue to support and enhance public and private assistance to our exclusive economic zone surveillance efforts and our continued efforts to develop our National Marine Sanctuary.In addition  Palau would like to thank the Republic of China on Taiwan for its friendship and economic support in assisting Palau to achieve our Millennium Development Goals and would urge the United Nations system to involve Taiwan in the process of developing and implementing the post-2015 development agenda. I would also call upon the United Nations to support Taiwan’s broader participation in the United Nations specialized agencies and regional economic integration mechanisms  as its participation in the World Health Assembly  the International Civil Aviation Organization  the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership would demonstrate its ability to contribute to global and regional initiatives.We also would like to express our thanks to the Australian Government for its ongoing partnership  its annual aid assistance focused on education and its commitment to providing $2 billion to the Pacific region to replace its aging marine surveillance fleet.Finally  we would like to recognize the very broad list of partners around the globe that make our efforts to ensure a sustainable future possible  including New Zealand  the European Union  private organizations  non-governmental organizations and civil society. Partnerships such as those are commitments. We would not be where we are today without them. In the post-2015 development environment  we must all recognize that our actions as individuals  States  nations and regions have an impact on all our partners on planet Earth. If we are to save our oceans and if we are to stem the tide of greenhouse gases  we must establish a long-lasting system of global partnerships and respect.At the end of the day  we must recognize that some of us are developed and some of us are not. The means of implementation in terms of oceans  climate change  biodiversity and all of the other issues that require global solutions are therefore a recurring and central issue. Without effective partnerships  change will simply not occur  and without legally binding commitments with respect toour oceans and climate change  we will not make the transformative changes that we need to make in the next generation.As a small island developing State and a member of the Pacific community  I am ready  willing and able to commit to doing my share. I am even willing to lead. But let us not fool ourselves. The only way to make a difference in this modem global era is to go beyond our self-centred mentality. By standing together  we can indeed craft a sustainable future for our children and for generations to come."
"139",5658,"PNG",69,2014,"Allow me  on behalf of the Government of Papua New Guinea  to congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. Papua New Guinea supports his leadership as we work with him on the ambitious theme of “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to Ambassador John Ashe for his strong leadership in setting the stage for enhancing the sustainable development agenda of Member States  especially of small island developing States (SIDS). We also commend the Secretary-General for his leadership and untiring commitment to advancing the cause of global peace and security to enhance the multidimensional global development agenda.It has been a long and sometimes hard road for the people of Fiji over the past eight years. We therefore warmly congratulate the people of Fiji for their return to constitutional and democratic rule following their general elections this year. We welcome the return of Fiji to the Commonwealth and to the Pacific Islands Forum. In wishing the people of Fiji well  Papua New Guinea will continue to stand ready to assist them  as it has done in the past  along with other major Pacific partners  in areas where such assistance can be effective as Fiji embarks on its new path forward.The recent third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  held in Samoa  was a great success. We commend the adoption of the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action/Samoa Pathway  which reiterated the sustainable development priorities of SIDS  which has been affirmed by the international community.But the impacts of climate change continue to pose a serious challenge to the sustainable development of SIDS. The full range of damaging events — such as rising sea levels  coastal erosion  salinization of the fresh water table  prolonged and severe droughts  flooding and other extreme weather and loss of and damage to vital infrastructure — remains a constant concern for SIDS. Many SIDS  especially in the Pacific  have reached a tipping point. While the right thing for us to do is to respond to the challenges by working smarter and harder to improve the livelihoods of people at risk  the bigger and advanced countries of the world must not only do likewise; they must also redouble their efforts in partnering with us.As part of our support to Pacific SIDS  Papua New Guinea has launched the Pacific Development Assistance Programme  which is aimed at assisting Pacific SIDS in critical areas of development such as education  health  capacity-building  climate change and the reconstruction of important infrastructure after natural disasters. We reiterate our call on the international community  including the United Nations  to work together with SIDS in the spirit of genuine and durable partnership.We commend the Secretary-General for convening the successful Climate Summit last week. In supporting the outcomes  we must build on the political momentum generated as we move towards Lima this year and  importantly  towards Paris in 2015  where the international community must conclude a legally binding agreement in order for us to collectively address the adverse impacts of climate change.The international community stands at an important crossroads. The imminent deadline of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the transition to the post-2015 development agenda have rightly become the centre stage of the global agenda. We support a people-centered and transformative post-2015 development agenda underpinned by global partnerships that support national ownership of sustainable development.We welcome the adoption by the General Assembly  by resolution 68/309  of the report of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals (A/68/970)  which recommended 17 goals. We must chart a realistic path  with goals that are attainable given the necessary means of implementation. We also commend the work of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing  which is critical to the successful implementation of the post-2015 development agenda.In that respect  the Pacific island developing States note with appreciation the inclusion of the important proposed stand-alone goals on oceans and seas  sustainable energy and climate change. Along with the other proposed goals  those goals should form the basis for the intergovernmental negotiations that are to take place. Papua New Guinea will participate in those negotiations.My Government remains fully committed to those efforts because we have experienced the galvanizing impact of the MDGs  which has helped us take national ownership and develop a home-grown sustainable development paradigm. While my country’s MDG scorecard remains a work in progress  my Government has undertaken various initiatives to redress the situation. We have retailored the MDGs to our national priorities  with 88 indicators connecting them to our national development plans.A recent report by the United Nations country office on progress to achieve the MDGs was optimistic and positive. The report found that Papua New Guinea had made important strides towards achieving the MDGs  especially since the general elections in 2012. They include the bold decision to run budget deficits until 2017  which  the report notes  has enabled the nation to invest in essential areas.My Government is implementing a policy of free education for all primary-school children  resulting in an increase in school enrolments by as much as 80 per cent in some areas. We now have around 2 million children in schools. In the health sector  we are witnessing a reduction of rates in early child and maternal mortality  HIV/AIDS  malaria and other communicable diseases. More mothers and children are getting access to health care as a result of our free health-care policy. Our infrastructure development programme is improving Papua New Guinea’s business environment and creating opportunities for our people to participate meaningfully in national development.A key cornerstone of our development road map is a people-centred focus on population management and stabilization. It entails empowering individuals to take leadership and full responsibility to improve their livelihoods through appropriate measures. Our economy has grown over the last decade at an average rate of 6 to 8 per cent per annum  and is projected to reach 20 per cent in 2015. That growth is transforming our country  especially with revenue from the completion of our first liquefied natural gas project and its exports.This is a new economic and development age for our economy. The unprecedented and transformative economic progress will coincide with the pursuit of the post-2015 development agenda. We are clearly focused on actively participating in the process and in its implementation at the national and regional levels. Our Government is fully committed to ensuring that we manage the transformation carefully and effectively. Our challenge is to ensure that the growth delivers the maximum benefit to our citizens.Recently  our Government launched a $100 million initiative with our leading national bank  the Bank of the South Pacific  to make home loans more affordable for our citizens. We are also facilitating financial inclusion services for our people. We are grateful to our development partners  including the United Nations  Australia  New Zealand  the United States  Japan  China and the European Union. My Government has helped with the capital for the first national women’s bank and for microcredit schemes to help our people at the grass-roots level become owners and drivers of their future well-being. In addition  we are giving priority to small and medium enterprises to drive national development.Furthermore  my Government is developing a national statistics development strategy to provide a road map for Papua New Guinea to continually improve and update the collection and management of its statistical information in order to improve decision-making. That includes embarking on a national biometric identification card system to record and maintain the population information of our citizens.Despite our economic growth  social issues remain a challenge. My Government values our women and girls  who constitute half of our population  as equal development partners. We are making sure that gender empowerment and equality continue to be a cornerstone of our responsible sustainable development. We therefore support the work of UN-Women.I am pleased to inform the Assembly that my Government has committed record funding of $10 million this year for various initiatives  including partnering with the United Nations Population Fund to make available 40 000 contraceptive implants as important intervention measures for the health of our women and girls of child-bearing age. That will be scaled up to $20 million by 2015. My Government  in partnership with our development partners  is also investing in upgrading vital midwifery skills  along with enhancing our health referral systems to address complicated pregnancies. As a member of the Executive Board of UNICEF  we will promote and participate in the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.My Government welcomes and pledges our support for the President’s timely agenda for strengthening international peace and security. As a responsible Member of the United Nations  we are committed to fostering global peace and security. As such  my country is deploying a modest level of troops to the United Nations peacekeeping missions in the Sudan and South Sudan. As our capacity grows  we intend to contribute more.We are concerned about the increasing conflicts and tensions in many parts of the world  particularly those involving non-State actors. An unacceptable heavy toll of destruction is exacted upon millions of innocent children  women and men  often uprooted from their homes  dislocated and downtrodden and their dignity humiliated. We must rebuke and unite against the rising tide of intolerance  bigotry and hatred under various banners.We again condemn terrorism in all its manifestations. We join the international community to combat that global threat. Our support for Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) against terrorism  which was recently adopted  is a reaffirmation that inhuman atrocities committed cannot and should not be condoned by the international community. Those responsible for such inhuman atrocities must be held accountable.We are also concerned by the rising tensions between and within certain countries and the re-emergence of the ugly head of another potential arms race. The world does not need that; rather  we must recommit our efforts for global disarmament that supports a transformative development agenda that brings long-lasting improvement in the livelihoods of people everywhere.The Ebola crisis is a concern that is not limited just to West Africa. It is an international crisis  one which we  the international community  must address together as we have done with severe acute respiratory syndrome and HIV/AIDS. Those diseases and pandemics do not recognize national sovereign borders. Like other countries  Papua New Guinea has taken appropriate measures to address the potential spread of Ebola.We note with concern that progress in the Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism has been slow. We need to strengthen efforts to complete that process. Papua New Guinea urges the implementation of the report and conclusions of the United Nations visiting mission to New Caledonia this year  and thereby calls on the United Nations and the international community  particularly the administering Power  to support the process of decolonization under the Noumea Accord. The Summit of the Melanesian Spearhead Group in June 2013 supported through a declaration the efforts of the Front de libération nationale kanak et socialiste in New Caledonia.Papua New Guinea strongly believes that the international community is a better  more secure and harmonious place because of the United Nations. Certainly there are areas in the United Nations where reform is required  as is the case with any large organization. We need to recommit ourselves to the areas where the Organization has been successful  and in other areas we need to build adequate systems. Our ultimate objective must be to promote a more effective  more accountable  more responsive and more caring United Nations — a United Nations capable of meeting the challenges of the twenty-first century.Papua New Guinea therefore shares the President’s intention to further reform  rejuvenate and strengthen the Security Council to allow for equitable geographic representation. Regrettably  that important organ does not reflect today’s geopolitical realities. We again join many other Member States in calling for the reform of the Security Council in both categories of membership.At this time next year we will be celebrating 40 years of nation-building in Papua New Guinea  just as the United Natons commemorates its seventieth anniversary. We continue to be a proud  united country of many diverse cultures and peoples speaking more than 800 languages. We are also rapidly transforming our traditional way of life to that of a modern country in just one generation.In conclusion  I recommit my country to the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations and pledge to work closely with all other Member States to collaborate on solutions to the many issues we all face as humankind."
"140",5704,"POL",69,2014,"I would first like to congratulate Mr. Kutesa on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.In the opening sentences of our Charter  we read that the United Nations was set up to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and in the equal rights of nations large and small. In the year marking the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War and the seventy-fifth of the start of the Second World War  those words hold a particular resonance for us — for Poles  Europeans and every society affected by those tragedies. Both wars were waged partly on Polish territory; the second began with Nazi Germany’s aggression in collaboration with the Soviet Union. Our past compels us to reflect on the Charter’s words and those events of twentieth-century history  which form the backdrop to our decision-making at the national level  and similarly bind together the entire international community gathered here at the United Nations.One result of the First World War was to foster the dream of a world without war. That belief and general desire bore fruit in the League of Nations  the first collective security system in history. It included all the factors needed to make a positive mark on history and to maintain peace and security. It functioned on a foundation of important rules that prohibited war and encouraged the peaceful settlement of disputes. It had shared bodies  disarmament conferences and an international judiciary.Despite all those institutions  however  we were unable to make a world without wars. The League eventually became an easy target  if not an object of ridicule. Yet it was not the League itself that failed. It was failed by its members  and chiefly by the Powers that had been entrusted with special responsibility for implementing its principal task. They failed their test in the face of the expansion of totalitarian regimes on both the left and the right. The emergence of communism  national socialism and many militaristic dictatorships was in part due to the First World War. Those systems fed on conflict  because ideological war and war against other peoples — against other men — were part of their identity.Those threats could have been resisted in time  but the democratic world failed  choosing a short-sighted policy of appeasement and the satisfaction of dictatorships’ appetites at the expense of weaker States. The price paid for that negligence was the Second World War  and the whole of humankind had to pay a price that would once have been unimaginable. It is from the horrible experience of that war  of the Holocaust  that the legal notion of genocide stems. Its originator and the author of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was a Polish lawyer  Raphael Lemkin  who understood the criminal nature of both kinds of totalitarianism even before the war.After the hecatombs of the war  the international community decided once again to build a system of collective security. I am glad that next year we will be celebrating the seventieth anniversary of the foundation of the United Nations. There are very few now who remember the world without our Organization  and it would be difficult to imagine the world without its activity. During the nearly seven decades of its existence  the United Nations has had a track record of amazing achievements  but also many failures.Today  however  the situation is especially worrying  as symptoms of the problems that once brought down the League of Nations are reappearing. We are witnessing a rebirth of the super-Power  a return to the thinking that divided the world into categories of geopolitical zones of influence and that has already led the international community into a morass of hatred  confrontation and conflict. The United Nations should remain vigilant in the face of a return to such attitudes— it should tolerate no departure from the principles of security and international relations laid down in the Charter. Tolerance of such attitudes always ends badly and not infrequently leads to catastrophe.We cannot overemphasize that the occupation of Crimea and the aggression in Ukraine violate the standards of international law and trample on the fundamental values of the United Nations. The ideological background of the conflict is a return to the rhetoric of the first half of the twentieth century  a return to the logic of zones of influence  of might is right  and of ruthless imperial domination of weaker neighbours  which are apparently obliged to be obedient satellites of a Power redesigning the foundations of the civilized international order.The Security Council  the organ responsible for peace  proved to be ineffective when faced with conflicts in Ukraine and other regions of the world  partly due to its rules of operation. We are threatened by a further descent into powerlessness if such rules are not amended. It is salutary that the General Assembly rose to the challenge when  in resolution 68/262  of 27 March 2014  it took the side of the weaker party that was being targeted in an act of imperial aggression.I feel all the more sad and concerned uttering the foregoing words  since we are celebrating the joyful twenty-fifth anniversary of the abolishment of communism and the collapse of the Soviet bloc in Poland  which is also being celebrated in other countries of the region. That “spring of nations”  the second in the history of Europe  brought freedom to the nations of Central and Eastern Europe and respect for human rights and good democratic governance. At the time  changes for the better took place throughout Europe  and even worldwide. The Iron Curtain fell and so did the bipolar division of the world. The Cold War confrontation and its accompanying threats of nuclear conflict became things of the past.That historical change began in Poland with the establishment of the 10 million-strong Solidarity movement  a peaceful opposition movement against totalitarian oppression and the violation of nations’ rights. The victorious parliamentary elections of 4 June brought about the formation  on 12 September 1989  of the first non-Communist Government in our part of Europe since the Second World War  the Government of Tadeusz Mazowiecki.Just two weeks later  on 25 September  precisely 25 years ago  the Minister for Foreign Affairs in that new Government  Professor Krzysztof Skubiszewski  addressed the Assembly from this very rostrum (see A/44/PV.4) and proclaimed that the new Poland would not respect the logic of zones of influence. He further revealed that we would respect existing treaties and obligations  as well as the security interests of other States  and none of that would result in any limitations with respect to choosing or changing the system of polity.That new logic of international relations has been most beneficial for Europe  where a great wave of unification has been set in motion thanks to the strengthening of the mechanisms of integration of the European Community and its expansion to include many new States. In our region  the European Union is a synonym for peace. It was established so that there would be no more wars on a continent that had previously been notorious for them. And indeed  the European Union has become a significant force for peace in Europe and far beyond its borders  to which Poland has contributed in a highly active way.We had the right to hope that the benefits of the end of divisions in Europe and of the logic of imperial zones of influence would be shared by a growing number of States and nations — and not only in Europe — and that they would be able to decide their fate democratically and build their lives in peace and prosperity  free from external domination. We have hoped and continue to hope for a democratic modernization of Russia. But what happened six months ago in Eastern Europe dealt a blow to that hope and threatened security on our European continent. In our part of Europe  people are again asking themselves whether war as a method of obtaining a political goal will also be the long-term European reality. We cannot acquiesce to the brutalization of international life anywhere in the world — far less so in Europe  where the wounds of two World Wars are still healing.Yet wars and conflicts are also continuing in other parts of our globe and are creating countless victims  suffering and destruction. We have all been surprised by the rapid development of the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The brutality of the actions of its fighters  who are murdering and persecuting people of every faith  including those who profess Islam  must inspire terror and trigger a response from the international community. ISIL’s barbarism is a challenge for all of humankind  irrespective of religion  ethnic origin or political viewpoint. We  the States faithful to the United Nations Charter  cannot shirk our responsibility for providing security. We are responsible for protecting those threatened by cruel violence. Yet everything must be done to ensure that the actions we take do not contravene the United Nations Charter.We express our concern and sympathy for the civilian victims of the conflicts and tragedies in Syria  Libya  Israel  the Gaza Strip and many African States. All those conflicts  and to an even greater degree the civil wars in some African countries  are accompanied by humanitarian catastrophes. The United Nations  and especially the super-Powers that can influence the participating parties  should do everything to stop them.Nobody could ever take the place of the United Nations and its agencies in providing aid to refugees and other victims of humanitarian tragedies. On behalf of Poland  I hereby express appreciation for them. and recognition for the thousands of courageous members of humanitarian organizations  United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations who  amid all the dangers and frequently at the cost of their own lives  hurry to the aid of those who suffer persecution. They help those whose security and health is threatened — those left alone  without a roof over their heads  who are far away from homes to which  due to destruction  many will never be able to return. An ever-increasing number of people are experiencing suffering and cruelty linked to military conflicts. That horrifying trend must be stopped by our common efforts.The fact that  in so many places  we are witnessing conflicts that entail human tragedy and the deaths of thousands of people is due  as a general rule  to a failure to observe fundamental human rights. Entire communities and nations are denied influence over political decisions. Power without control is  in most cases  corrupt and self-loving  incapable of lifting countries out of underdevelopment and poverty. That is the background to the conflicts and rebellions in Ukraine  Iraq  Libya and many other places in the world. That is why we must increase our efforts to help by offering development assistance to bring about social  economic and political transformation. Otherwise  the only alternative to dictatorship will be chaos.Poland is especially attached to the role of democracy in the life of nations  their development and international activity. We know how much we lost because of the absence of democracy under communism  and we know how much we gained when we returned to democracy as a means of achieving our civic aspirations and an expression of our national sovereignty. It was for that purpose that a broad international initiative by the Community of Democracies was born in Warsaw in 2000. That is precisely why my country established the international Lech Wa..sa Solidarity Award for activity in support of democracy and fundamental freedoms.Poland steadfastly believes that sustainable development cannot be achieved without the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms for all. We will strive to attain the appropriate inclusion of those questions in the new United Nations development agenda. Through our experiences over the past few decades in our history  we have learned the importance of solidarity  responsibility and involvement — the triad of principles in the United Nations system we are faithful to.We fully acknowledge the involvement of the United Nations in the improvement of the social and economic situation in those regions of the world where conditions are the most difficult. Poland actively participates in the definition of the priorities and means of implementation of the new development agenda that will replace the Millennium Development Goals of 2000  and we will purposefully participate in making it a reality. The new development agenda should fully and coherently integrate the economic  social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development  while at the same time focusing on the reduction of poverty and protection of the natural environment.Reaching an international understanding on that matter is a task that is as ambitious as it is difficult — yet it is necessary and feasible. The output of the previous Assembly session  worked on by the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals under the highly efficient co-chairmanship of Kenya and Hungary  defines the course of further discussion on the matter. Poland will continue its active involvement in a dialogue that should bring about the development of a new  ambitious and universal post-2015 development agenda.It is vitally important to halt any further global climate change caused by the development of human civilization and to adjust to the changes that are already irreversible. Here lurk existential issues pertaining to security  the problems of economic development  the maintenance of biological diversity in the Earth’s ecosystem and quality of life. In its capacity as host of the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Warsaw in November 2013  and as we still hold the presidency of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  Poland remains committed to achieving a successful conclusion to the negotiations. We believe that it is possible to achieve an understanding in a manner that is fair to countries at various levels of economic development. Agreement is possible  and I hope such an understanding will be arrived at in the near future. I would like to reiterate that  despite the hardships and costs of economic transformation  Poland has decreased its greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 30 per cent since 1988 — that is  it has greatly exceeded the reduction obligations stipulated in the Kyoto Protocol.Poland is deeply involved in various fields of activity covered by this Organization  ranging from human rights to disarmament. That is why we know perfectly well that nothing can replace the United Nations system  which is continuously improvable. Poland is currently assuming an increasing measure of responsibility for cooperation in development  humanitarian aid and climate protection. We are ready to share our experience and our ideas as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the period 2018-2019. We intend to support a reform of that body that will increase its representative character and  in parallel  reinforce its efficiency. The reform should primarily concern the Council’s mandate in situations involving the principle of the responsibility to protect  which was approved by our community in 2005. The idea must be to develop a mechanism that will provide the Council with the capacity to act in such situations  while at the same time making it impossible to use the mandate of the Council for purposes other than the discharge of that responsibility.I have raised that idea from this rostrum twice already. It should perhaps be combined with a broader reform of the Council  the outlines of which were given shape before the historic summit held in 2005. The situation is unchanged from nearly 70 years ago — we want to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and the rights of nations  large and small."
"141",5730,"PRK",69,2014,"On behalf of the delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  I should first like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea fully endorses the main theme of this session  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”. Development is one of the core missions of the United Nations. With peace  it constitutes one of the two pillars for the sustainable development of humankind. During the first 15 years of the new millennium  the world has seen the poverty rate reduced by half. It is proof of success  illustrating the correctness of the Millennium Development Goals  adopted at the Millennium Summit  with the elimination of poverty as the main target.It has been a particularly difficult time for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. However  we too have overcome severe hardships. Despite an unprecedentedly persistent economic blockade  military threat and political obstruction  we have firmly safeguarded national dignity  effectively deterred war and put the stagnant economy on an upward track under the leadership of the great General Kim Jong Il. Today we have at last secured a reliable springboard to leap into a powerful nation  following the guidance of respected Marshal Kim Jong Un.In the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea today  a grand construction boom is in full swing  and modern factories and enterprises befitting the era of the knowledge economy are being built and founded at record-breaking speed in many parts of the country. We have observed a great leap in our fishing industry and livestock farming  as well as a blooming new twenty-first century civilization in the living environment and cultural and welfare spheres for future generations and the working masses.The climate change Summit held just a few days ago was a successful gathering that constituted part of the active measures being taken across the United Nations system to ensure the survival of humankind and sustainable development by protecting the global ecosystem and addressing climate change.The United Nations and international relations should be democratized further. The principle of sovereign equality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations is exactly same as the principle of respect for sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations. However  acts of high-handedness and arbitrariness — veiled under various disguises such as democracy  humanitarian crises  counter-terrorism  human rights protection and non-proliferation — are committed brazenly in the form of sanctions  blockade  military threat and armed intervention. That is the stern reality we witness today.Proceeding from its consistent position of opposing interference and sanctions in all their manifestations against sovereign States  our delegation holds that the unilateral economic  trade and financial blockade imposed by the United States against Cuba should be immediately dismantled.With respect to the issue of enhancing the central role of the United Nations  we see its functions and role regarding peace and security lagging far behind others. As stipulated in the Charter  Member States entrusted the Security Council with the maintenance of international peace and security as its first and foremost responsibility. Present reality shows that in lieu of the Security Council — which is still mired in the paralysis of the Cold War — a permanent member seeks to act as the military police of the world through military blocs or bilateral military alliances that have nothing to do with the United Nations.The anachronistic stereotypes and prejudices of the Security Council find their most extreme expression in the prevailing situation on the Korean peninsula. The world remembers that the situation on the Korean peninsula reached the touch-and-go brink of war last year. It started with the United States-South Korea joint military exercises aimed at occupying the capital city of Pyongyang of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.In January  the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea made a proposal to stop hostile military acts on the Korean peninsula  but provocative joint military exercises against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea were forcibly conducted in March  April and August. The Government of the Democratic People’s Republic officially referred to the Security Council the issue of suspending such war exercises  which seriously endanger the peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the region as a whole. However  the Council turned its back. As the joint military exercises were led by one of its permanent members  the Council was bound to close its eyes  block its ears and shut its mouth  no matter how enormous in scale  aggressive in purpose and dangerous in nature they were.Even in the Cold War period  measures were in place between the East and the West to restrict the number of military exercises in which more than 40 000 troops took part. We are obliged to ask why such war exercises  with the participation of more than 500 000 troops at a time  are needed annually only on the Korean peninsula  nearly a quarter of a century after the Cold War ended.At present  the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has set economic construction and improvement of the people’s living standards as its major task. Accordingly  a peaceful environment is vital in allowing us to lead the recently improving trend of the national economy to sustainable development. A peaceful environment and the reduction of tensions are more precious to us now than at any time. The tense situation on the Korean peninsula does not help us. On the contrary  it presents a serious obstacle to our efforts to achieve economic development and an improved living standard.War exercises focused on landing  long-range nuclear bombing and commando operations aimed at occupying the capital city of another country can never be viewed as defensive. The claim that they are annual in nature is just a veiled attempt to succeed in a surprise attack after creating chronic immunity to them.The reform of the Security Council should no longer be delayed. The Council’s current structure and method of work have long been out of date  as confirmed by the expressed general will of Member States reflected in resolution 47/62  adopted in 1992. The Security Council should no longer be an exhibition showcase for the extreme manifestation of the double standard. We must put an end to the unjust practice whereby the military exercises waged by a permanent member of the Council are covered up with no regard to their serious threat to peace and security  whereas those conducted by a Member State in response are called into question  although they are inevitable and self-defensive in nature.Likewise  the Security Council simply ignores the killing of Palestinian civilians by Israel under the patronage of a permanent member  yet selectively takes issue with the actions of the Syrian Government in defence of the sovereignty and stability of its country. This unjust practice cannot be tolerated. In particular  no act should be allowed to encroach on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria under the guise of counter-terrorism.The Security Council should no longer serve as a forum for the spreading of lies. Eleven years ago  we heard with our own ears the accusation made at a Security Council meeting by a permanent member that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (see S/PV.4701). A military invasion followed  and tragic bloodshed resulted. Only then did the world come to realize that it had heard the big lie of the century. However  because the big lie had come from a permanent member  the Security Council kept silent again. As a result  the bloodshed continues even today  after 11 years.The Security Council should not be abused as a tool to justify high-handedness and arbitrariness. The United Nations Charter stipulates that the Security Council should act in conformity with the principles of justice and international law. The Security Council has no authority to adopt a resolution that prohibits the peaceful launch of a satellite by a Member State  as that is in contravention of international law  in particular the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space  including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies.The reform of the Security Council would  in essence  democratize the United Nations and international relations. The United Nations is not a monarchy and the Security Council is not a senate. The reform of the Security Council will not be possible unless its members decide in good faith to give up their prerogatives in the interests of democracy. Given the changing times and the demands of the majority of Member States  the permanent member that is most vociferous about the export of democracy should reflect on whether or not its preaching is just hypocrisy. Should the Security Council fail to reform itself and remain out of step with the times  Member States may well opt for a United Nations without such an anachronistic and undemocratic Council.The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea maintains that all problems pertaining to international relations should be resolved not by high-handedness and arbitrariness  but in strict accordance with the principles of sovereign equality enshrined in the United Nations Charter. The nuclear issue is a matter of the sovereignty and the right to exist of a Member State and must take precedence over peace and security. The hostile policy  nuclear threat and stifling strategy pursued by the United States for more than half a century inevitably prompted the decision of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to become a nuclear-weapon State.The nuclear deterrent of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is neither intended to threaten or attack others  nor a bargaining chip to be exchanged for something else. The nuclear issue will be resolved if and when the substance of the threat to our sovereignty and right to life is removed through the termination of the hostile policy of the United States towards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.Politicization  selectivity and double standards are out of place when dealing with human rights issues. The abuse of human rights for political purposes is in itself the biggest human rights violation. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is firmly opposed to all attempts and actions to force regime change on specific countries by alleging abuse of human rights. The United States does not recognize the national sovereignty that safeguards the human rights of our people. That being the case  it is hypocritical of it to find fault with our human rights issues. It is all the more preposterous that the United States should talk about a human rights dialogue when it adamantly prevents the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea — the party directly involved — from participating in the meeting on the latter’s own human rights situation.The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is always open to dialogue and cooperation in the case of genuine human rights issues that are devoid of any form of political motivation or hypocrisy. The Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is willing to promote human rights dialogue and cooperation on an equal footing with other countries that are not hostile to it. It is also willing to facilitate technical cooperation  contact and communication with the United Nations and other international organizations in the human rights field.The reunification of the fatherland is the supreme desire of the entire Korean nation. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea maintains that national reunification should be achieved not through a confrontation of systems but by a confederation formula whereby two systems coexist in a single country. It is the only way to prevent war and safeguard peace. The Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is sincerely striving by both word and deed to develop inter-Korean relations and to orient them towards reunification through confederation.As South Korea has relinquished its military prerogatives to the United States in their entirety  it has no idea how many weapons of mass destruction of various kinds — capable of destroying the Korean nation more than hundreds of times over — are now deployed and hidden on its own soil. It should therefore refrain from prattling and dreaming about the unrealistic and fictitious proposal for reunification copied from the formula of other countries.I should like to assure members that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will constructively participate in delivering on the post-2015 development agenda at the current session and thus make an active contribution to the work for the successful adoption of the development agenda next year on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. Independence  peace and friendship are the foreign policy ideals of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. As in the past  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will fulfil its responsibilities and discharge its role as an independent Member State by steadfastly adhering to these ideals in United Nations activities."
"142",5775,"PRT",69,2014,"At the outset  I should like to congratulate the President on his election  which testifies to the strong commitment of Africa to the United Nations and to multilateralism. I also wish to express my appreciation for the dedication to the Assembly of his predecessor Ambassador John Ashe. I reiterate my gratitude to the Secretary-General for his leadership at the helm of our Organization and for his relentless efforts in favour of peace in such a difficult and complex time in international life. I commend him also for convening the Climate Summit  which has renewed political support for the achievement in 2015 of a fair  universal and legally binding climate agreement. Portugal  and the European Union as a whole  will continue to work tirelessly and in an inclusive manner towards the achievement of that goal.During this session  we face the enormous challenge of renewing and building upon the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  with a view to adopting the post-2015 development agenda. The President may count on the support and commitment of Portugal on that and other issues and in the ongoing work of the General Assembly  which is the first home of multilateralism and of legitimate international collective action. The commitment of Portugal to the United Nations  to the Charter and to its principles and values is firm  resolute and enduring.At this Assembly session  Portugal is a candidate for the Human Rights Council for the 2015-2017 term. We hope to have the support of all members in the upcoming election. If elected  Portugal will be serving for the first time as a member of such an important body.Last April Portugal underwent its second Universal Periodic Review by the Human Rights Council. Our positive national human rights record was widely acknowledged. Portugal has actively participated in multilateral human rights forums  in particular in the Human Rights Council  submitting annual resolutions on the right to education and on economic  social and cultural rights. We hope to be able to make an even greater contribution to the Human Rights Council over the coming three years  as we deeply believe in the Council’s ability to strengthen the capacity of States to comply with their human rights obligations.In that context  Portugal has submitted a bold set of pledges and commitments that will guide the discharge of our mandate with the purpose of promoting and protecting the universality  indivisibility  inalienability and interdependence of all human rights — civil  cultural  economic  political and social. Through our actions during our last mandate in the Security Council  in 2011 and 2012  we demonstrated that consistently promoting and upholding human rights was a priority for us. If elected to the Human Rights Council  Portugal will engage in its work  fully committed to a strong  independent and effective multilateral human rights system. Portugal is in fact a party without reservations to eight core United Nations human rights treaties and all their optional protocols.We continue to witness events that we expected to see eradicated in the twenty-first century — large-scale human rights violations  the deprivation of vast populations of their most elementary dignity  and a disregard for basic international principles such as the territorial integrity and sovereignty of States. Today the Charter of the United Nations remains as relevant as it was 69 years ago. In order to deal with the crises we face today we must base our search for fair  legal and lasting solutions on the generous and ambitious principles and norms of the Charter. The Charter offers the necessary institutional mechanisms  but their functioning and effectiveness depend on the political will of all Members of the Organization.Terrorist  extremist and radical groups deserve our most vehement repudiation and condemnation. They constitute  in the first instance  a threat to States and to the populations of the territories in which they are based. They also present a risk to regional and global peace  security and stability. That menace requires concerted and firm responses from the international community. The self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is a sinister example of that kind of criminal and barbaric action. It must be fought and neutralized. The Security Council summit and resolution 2178 (2014)  which it adopted on the worrying phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters  were important steps in that direction.The Middle East continues to require special attention. In Iraq we have been witnessing inhumane terrorist actions targeting defenceless populations  victimizing mainly women  children and persons belonging to ethnic and religious minorities. The situation in Iraq cannot be disconnected from the prolonged conflict in Syria  where the levels of violence and suffering are  by their dimension and duration  beyond words. All parties must assume responsibility for finding a political transition to a democratic and pluralistic society.Once again we come to the Assembly without progress in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The expectations that we all shared here a year ago have been dashed. The recurring cycle of hostilities must come to an end. The conflict we saw in Gaza this summer must not happen again. I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate Egypt for brokering the ceasefire and to recognize the efforts of other regional and international partners  including the Secretary-General and United States Secretary of State John Kerry.There will be no lasting peace or stability in the Middle East without a solution to that issue. I reiterate my country’s support for a solution based on United Nations resolutions  establishing a sovereign  independent and viable Palestinian State  living side by side with the State of Israel  whose legitimate security concerns must be guaranteed.The positive signs that we saw a year ago regarding the Iranian nuclear programme were confirmed with the signing of the Joint Plan of Action in Geneva. A new political impetus is now needed. Portugal supports and encourages the ongoing negotiations with a view to a comprehensive agreement.The events of 2010 and 2011 in Northern Africa had an unprecedented political  economic and social impact. The countries there are now confronted with significant challenges with regard to the consolidation of political reforms  sustainable economic growth and security. Portugal is currently co-chairing the Western Mediterranean Forum  also known as the 5+5 Dialogue  which brings together 10 countries from the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean. We wish to strengthen the contribution of that platform to the enhancement of cooperation and confidence-building among its countries.Libya is an important partner in that Forum  and it is with great concern that we see the deterioration of the situation in that country. The international community must give its assistance to the political transition process  but it is paramount that all Libyan stakeholders commit to an inclusive  genuine and fruitful national dialogue.In Europe  the Ukrainian crisis and the illegal annexation of Crimea brought back tensions that we thought were outdated. We welcome the ceasefire agreement and appeal for its full implementation. Portugal encourages the parties actively to seek a lasting political solution that respects the sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and democracy in Ukraine.Africa is a significant partner for Portugal. African States are not only political partners but also  increasingly  business and investment partners in a relationship based on parity and mutual benefits  which drive job creation and economic development. While fully respecting Africa’s ownership  we also seek to contribute to international efforts  notably those of the United Nations  aimed at stabilizing conflicts or preventing security risks in Africa. Therefore  Portugal is participating in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali. We also stand ready to engage in multinational efforts to strengthen security in the Gulf of Guinea  and we are willing to cooperate in the reinforcement of the maritime capacities of the countries of the region.In recent months we have received good news from the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  a friendly country and member of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP). The restoration of constitutional order  the holding of free elections and the inauguration of legitimate democratic institutions  two years after the April 2012 coup d’état  are surely praiseworthy signs of hope. The enormous socioeconomic difficulties and the recurrent and severe political instability that Guinea-Bissau has been suffering for a decade and a half did not prevent the people from electing their new leaders through free  transparent and orderly elections.The opportunity to turn the page of history must now be seized. The people of Guinea-Bissau and the authorities are taking the right steps. Consolidating the progress achieved requires support from the international community. International partners can and must play a decisive role in areas such as financial assistance and building technical capacity  underpinning the priorities identified by Guinea-Bissau. Further  we believe that a stabilization force based on the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Mission in Guinea-Bissau  possibly enlarged to incorporate new African partners and mandated by the United Nations  would be appropriate. Therefore we welcome the initiatives supporting Guinea-Bissau undertaken by the United Nations  together with  in particular  the African Union  the CPLP  ECOWAS and the European Union.At the Millennium Summit  Heads of State and Government made the historic and inspiring decision to adopt the Millennium Development Goals. We now have the responsibility to accelerate the achievement of those Goals while at the same time preparing a new development agenda. Portugal is strongly committed to the definition of that new agenda. We need a transformative new global partnership that mainstreams human rights and combats inequalities. It should also promote peaceful  stable and just societies  advancing also the important issues of population and development. Universality and shared responsibility are key concepts in that regard. But the universality of the post-2015 agenda should not be synonymous with insensitivity to the specificities of the least developed and most vulnerable countries  such as small island developing States.New challenges such as climate change  illicit trafficking  piracy and pandemics are major threats in today’s world. The outbreak of Ebola in Western African countries demands strong  combined efforts by the international community to contain and eradicate that plague. Portugal is participating in the current urgent global effort  notably in Guinea and in the framework of the United Nations operation.Despite the efforts of previous Presidents  the reform of the Security Council has not yet happened. Portugal’s position on that subject is well known. In spite of persistent differences of approach among the membership  we must not give up. Together we must find a solution  making the Security Council a body more representative of today’s world. The seventieth anniversary of the United Nations is an opportunity to bring about Security Council reform.Portugal is by tradition a seafaring nation and has recently adopted a new national maritime strategy focusing on blue growth. We actively support United Nations efforts for the sustainable management of the oceans and their resources  and we co-chair the working group that will complete the first global report of the marine environment. We advocate the adoption of an international instrument  in the framework of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. In June 2015 Portugal will organize a major international event on oceans  the “Blue Week”  to promote debate on maritime issues in all their dimensions. We look forward to broad participation in that event.The Portuguese language is the principal link that brings together the States belonging to the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries. It is a vehicle for global communication spoken by about 250 million people in their everyday lives  in commerce  trade  business  culture and social networks. It is also an official or working language in various international organizations  including specialized agencies of the United Nations. The CPLP has the ambition of having Portuguese as an official language of the United Nations. The summit in Dili last July confirmed the vitality of the CPLP. On that occasion Timor-Leste assumed the presidency of the Community  thus lending a whole new dimension and scope to the CPLP by having its presidency located for the first time in Asia.I would be remiss not to refer to the fact that on 20 November we will be celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Portugal is a party to that instrument without reservations  as well as to its three Optional Protocols. I take this opportunity to call for the universal ratification of the Convention and its Optional Protocols.During this sixty-ninth session we will also have before us a new draft resolution on establishing a moratorium on the use of the death penalty. We hope the draft resolution continues to enjoy significant and increased support this year.If we become a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council as we hope  we will act in accordance with the principles of cooperation and dialogue. We will engage with all States and other stakeholders in order to build bridges for the full implementation of human rights norms and standards. If we garner the trust of the Assembly  it will be a privilege to work  as a Council member  with the new United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  Prince Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein  to whom I reiterate our full support. I also wish to pay a special tribute to the former High Commissioner  Ms. Navi Pillay  for her outstanding job  often accomplished in particularly difficult circumstances.I conclude with a reference to the First World War  a tragic event mentioned at the very beginning of the United Nations Charter when it affirms the determination “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind”. As we mark the centenary of the First World War and prepare the celebration of the seventieth anniversary of our Organization  we must bear in mind and reflect carefully on those words of the Charter. The President can count on Portugal’s commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter in the pursuit of peace  development and respect for all human rights."
"143",5821,"PRY",69,2014,"At the outset  allow me  on behalf of the Republic of Paraguay  to offer you  Mr. President  our best wishes for success in your delicate and important tasks at the helm of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I also wish to express my delegation’s appreciation to Mr. John Ashe  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session  for his significant achievements.The Government of Paraguay is attending the general debate to reaffirm the importance and call for the strengthening of the United Nations as a forum capable of representing the interests of all Member States in our urgent search for a more just  united and equitable world  guaranteed by the full force of international law. At the same time  and as we approach the seventieth year since the creation of the most important debating forum in the history of humankind  we believe it right to recall that our Organization  the United Nations  was created precisely as a forum for peace among peace-loving nations  as expressed at the various international conferences that led to its creation.That reminder seems even timely and relevant to us  since the concept of peace is now more necessary than ever in various parts of the world such as the Middle East and the Black Sea region.The Republic of Paraguay reiterates its commitment to ensuring that all social issues are addressed. In that regard  the Government of President Horacio Manuel Cartes Jara is dealing decisively with the development  execution and implementation of social policies that address various demands  with special emphasis on the needs of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged sectors of our population  including the elderly  the rural population  indigenous communities  migrants  children  adolescents and women. We have an obligation to enable members of those groups to be included as full citizens.In that regard  I would make a special reference to the World Conference of Indigenous Peoples  held at Headquarters a few days ago  which was convened to listen to the true thoughts and feelings of our native and indigenous peoples. Indigenous cultural heritage has been and remains one of the key elements shaping Paraguay’s cultural identity and has led to miscegenation as the main social factor unifying the native Guarani population and the European conquerors. Our country is proud of the linguistic  cultural and political character of Paraguay  which boasts the native Guarani language of our ancestors as its everyday language.In line with the efforts made by the Government since it took office in August 2013  we believe solidarity and partnership is necessary among countries  whether developing or developed  and international financing institutions. We also take into account the fact that  often  vulnerability stems from other areas  such as a lack of decent jobs  educational opportunities  access to international markets and timely cooperation and from issues for which responsibility does not lie exclusively with the State but also with the private sector  as it generates wealth and decent employment. In that regard  we call on the United Nations bodies that work for cooperation to further strengthen their presence in Paraguay and support national policies aimed at strengthening democracy and social justice.For the first time since its inception nearly a decade ago  my country is aspiring to secure a seat on the Human Rights Council for the 2015-2017 period. For the Republic of Paraguay  the protection and promotion of human rights are the foundation for effective democracy. They are fundamental values that are enshrined and guaranteed in our Constitution  which expressly states that international human rights treaties cannot be rejected except through the procedures governing amendments to our Constitution. On the basis of those constitutional assurances and commitments  we are confident that we can play more than a constructive role and thus consolidate the actions of the Council to effectively strengthen the promotion and protection of human rights around the world.Paraguay  in accordance with its Government’s policy  will continue to continuously support and follow issues in the United Nations relating to the promotion of youth participation in social and economic development  persons with disabilities  migrant workers  the elimination of violence against women  the rights of the child  the elimination of discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs and the protection of human rights and their relation to extreme poverty.In Paraguay  we support the globalization of democracy through social development. We also believe in universal security based on respect for human rights as an unwavering commitment to the dignity of human life. We therefore hope to build a regional and global community that  hand in hand and in solidarity  devotes its efforts to eradicating hunger and poverty  effectively cooperating to promote the participation of all  in prosperity  through quality education and a system of inclusive social protection.As a sign of Paraguay’s desire to respond to the changing times  our President recently promulgated the Law on Free Access by Citizens to Public Information and Government Transparency as an important tool enabling every citizen to act as comptroller of public expenditures. The Law  which was recently adopted  states that all institutions must disseminate information as widely as possible. The Law also guarantees access by every citizen to all public information.We in Paraguay believe that the concept of development should include  as a sine qua non  the principle of social inclusion. The major challenge of achieving development that overcomes asymmetries leads inevitably to efforts promoting and achieving an optimal quality of life for all our citizens without exception. We must give a human face to our growth. Our citizens deserve  and have the right to  a more dignified life and overall well-being.We are currently working to establish a post-2015 development agenda that is sustainable and has a focus on poverty  education  health and social inclusion. We have learned that the Millennium Development Goals have been and are important but not sufficient  and that humankind should be the focus of policy. In that context  we believe that  for the post-2015 development agenda to be successful  it must be accompanied by a better distribution of international financial resources.Paraguay needs international cooperation that is aligned with its socioeconomic priorities  the development and strengthening of its institutions and preferential treatment for its most vulnerable sectors. We hope that the opening of developing countries helps bridge inequalities and that the same restrictions that the more developed economies are demanding in the process of their own development will not be applied. Paraguay’s position  like that of many developing countries  is that South-South cooperation is not a substitute for but a complement to North-South cooperation and triangular cooperation. We believe that the United Nations  as the universal forum  should play a central role in ensuring success in our efforts to achieve better international coordination and coherence in the economic and financial spheres.As the high-level Climate Summit was also held a few days ago here at Headquarters in New York  we believe it is necessary to recall that Paraguay is aware that climate change poses a serious and complex threat to the world  as highlighted by the growing negative impacts we are experiencing due to the resulting droughts  floods and other adverse phenomena  which spread poverty  cause forced displacements and may affect international peace and security.This situation urgently requires a coordinated and responsible global response in order to find ways to mitigate  alleviate and reverse climate change’s tragic and devastating consequences. In addition  Paraguay supports the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities  on the basis of which countries that have contributed more to the historical and current levels of pollution must shoulder correspondingly greater responsibilities. That principle should be used as an objective criterion  and its implementation will contribute to efforts to mitigate the global impact of climate change.The issue of landlocked developing countries is of fundamental importance for Paraguay’s foreign policy. The asymmetries and disadvantages that that geographical situation brings about will be offset only if there is international recognition of the need for a special and differential agreement on the country’s integration into the globalized world. Paraguay  along with other landlocked developing countries in the world  of which there are over 30  faces difficulties in terms of open access to international markets  mainly owing to the restrictions on free transit through transit countries and the lack of special and differential treatment  which would allow them to engage in greater and more competitive participation in world markets.This year is particularly important for us because in November the second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries  to be held in Vienna  will review the Almaty Programme of Action. While the condition of being a landlocked developing country is a disadvantage for Paraguay  we are convinced that we can overcome that adversity. We are working so that our territory can become  in the very near future  a favourable environment for integration and productive communication between the two major oceans  the Atlantic and the Pacific. The new programme of action to be adopted at the Vienna Conference should be the framework for mutually beneficial cooperation between landlocked developing countries and transit countries.Disarmament  non-proliferation and arms control are not just key factors to ensure international peace and security  but also guarantee that the most vulnerable countries can achieve sustained socioeconomic development. Only by securing a strong multilateral system with strict respect for the rule of law at the international and national levels can we ensure our mutual security. We are convinced that universal and binding international instruments in the area of disarmament and the Arms Trade Treaty  which will enter into force in the near future  will help improve the effectiveness of existing regional initiatives to prevent irresponsible actors from gaining access to weapons.Again  we urge Israel and Palestine to lay the foundation for social  political and economic reconstruction  which should enable both peoples to live in peace and harmony. Today more than ever  we must promote the negotiation process between the parties  which can lead to lasting peace so that Israel and Palestine can live side by side with secure borders and in peace.I also wish to note that Paraguay recognizes and welcomes the participation and contributions of the Republic of China (Taiwan) to United Nations specialized agencies  thanks to a rapprochement between the two parties of the Taiwan Strait. In a world beset by conflicts  my Government welcomes the efforts made by the Republic of China (Taiwan) to reduce tensions across the Taiwan Strait  which have contributed significantly to ensuring peace and stability.The Republic of Paraguay reiterates its commitment to international peace and security. In that context  we reaffirm the political will to increase  to the extent practicable  our contribution of troops to peacekeeping operations and to continue to train and equip peacekeeping forces in accordance with standards established by the United Nations  so as to progressively increase our participation in those missions. Regionally  we recognize the progress achieved by the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti  where the presence of specialized personnel in Paraguay’s armed forces  working with other countries in our region  have played a significant role in humanitarian assistance and infrastructure engineering projects and in improving the long-term standard of living to benefit many generations of Haitians.Since its inception  the United Nations has focused all its efforts on constantly evolving so that it can become a global structure capable of meeting the current needs of Member States. It is in the desire for such evolution that Paraguay supports the reform process for the Organization  thereby strengthening the General Assembly  which will lead to the restoration of functions entrusted to that body by the Charter of the United Nations  as the Assembly is the sole body with universal representation. On the issue of Security Council reform  we urge that such reform be done in accordance with the primary purpose of creating a more democratic Council. We can no longer delay expansion of that body. The Council must be more equitable  inclusive and democratic  reflecting the number of members of our Organization. We must improve its working methods and ensure greater transparency in its management.As we commemorate in 2015 the seventieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations  we hope to celebrate concrete results in the work of the Organization that transcend the mere celebration of the passage of time. We believe that consolidating the substantive post-2015 development agenda should lead to effective and real development for future generations. That is the greatest legacy we can leave.Finally  we urge the General Assembly to find more equitable and just means for establishing the list of speakers of Heads of State and Government for next year’s general debate."
"144",5840,"PSE",69,2014,"In this year 2014  proclaimed by the General Assembly as the International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People  Israel has chosen to make it the year of a new war of genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian people. It is the year in which the Assembly  on behalf of the countries and peoples of the world  conveyed the world’s yearning and determination to make a just peace that would achieve freedom and independence for the Palestinian people in their State of Palestine alongside Israel. The occupying Power has chosen to defy the entire world by launching its war on Gaza  in which its jets and tanks brutally destroyed lives and devastated the homes  schools and dreams of thousands of Palestinian children  women and men and  in reality  destroying any remaining hopes for peace.I addressed the Assembly on similar days in 2012 (see A/67/PV.12)  when I cautioned that the colonial occupying Power was preparing a new Nakba against the Palestinian people. I appealed to the Assembly then to prevent a new Nakba and to support the establishment of a free and independent State of Palestine. I returned to the Assembly Hall two months later (see A/67/PV.44) as Palestine was healing its wounds and its people were burying their beloved martyred children  women and men after yet another war waged then against the Gaza Strip. On that day  I stated that there was certainly not a single person in the world who needed the loss of the lives of thousands of Palestinian children in order to confirm that Israel insisted on occupation. The international community also did not need thousands of deadly raids and tons of explosives to remind it that there was an occupation that must end and a people who must be freed.Again today  we find ourselves full of grief and bitterness  raising the same long-standing conclusions and questions after a new war  the third in five years  waged by that racist occupying State against Gaza  a small  densely populated and precious part of our country. The difference today is that the scale of that genocidal crime is larger. The list of martyrs  especially children  has grown  as hs the number of the wounded  the disabled and the dozens of families who have been completely decimated. The difference today is that approximately half a million people have been displaced from their homes. An unprecedented number of homes  schools  hospitals  public buildings  residential buildings  mosques  factories and cemeteries have been destroyed — the Israelis pursued their vengeance against our young even into the cemeteries. The difference today is that the devastation caused by that recent aggression is unmatched in modern times  as confirmed by a witness  the Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.The latest war against Gaza constituted a series of absolute war crimes  carried out before the eyes and ears of the entire world  moment by moment. It is inconceivable that anyone today could claim not to grasp the magnitude and horror of the crimes. No one can support Israel’s right to self-defence without regard for the fate of the thousands of victims of our people. No one can ignore the simple fact  upon which we insist  that the life of a Palestinian is as precious as the life of any other human being. Ignoring the facts on the ground cannot erase such facts. We must also assume that no one can continue to wonder why extremism is rising and why the culture of peace is losing ground and receding  while efforts to achieve it are collapsing. And yet we continue to believe and hope that this time no one will try to help out the occupation by supporting its impunity and its attempts to evade accountability for its crimes.Here  today  in the name of Palestine  I affirm that we will not forget or forgive  and we will not allow war criminals to escape punishment. Before the Assembly  I affirm that the Palestinian people will hold fast to their legitimate right to defend themselves against the Israeli war machine and to resist Israel’s colonial  racist occupation. At the same time  I want to affirm that not for one moment will our grief  trauma and anger make us abandon our humanity  our values and our ethics. We will always maintain our respect for and commitment to international law  international humanitarian law and the international consensus. We will maintain the traditions of our national struggle established by the Palestinian martyrs  to which we have been committed since the start of the Palestinian revolution in early 1965.In the midst of a torrent of massacres and the turmoil of vast destruction  we saw the peoples of the world gather in huge demonstrations on the streets of many cities to announce their condemnation of Israel’s aggression and occupation and their support of freedom for Palestine. We also saw how an overwhelming majority of countries around the world declared themselves for the same noble position and rushed to give our people all kinds of support and assistance. And we saw a qualitative and quantitative expansion in the activities of the international grassroots boycotting campaign against Israel’s policies of occupation  apartheid and colonial settlement  especially among academic  cultural  student and youth groups. In the name of Palestine  we pay tribute to all who chose to stand with human values and demanded freedom  justice and peace. All of those manifestations of true solidarity constituted an important message to those who faced genocide in Gaza  helping them to feel that they were not alone.The recent war confirmed on the ground the essence of what the Israeli Government had been saying behind closed doors in negotiations. It came after long  difficult negotiations held over more than eight months under the auspices of the United States and through the efforts of President Barack Obama and his tenacious Secretary of State  John Kerry. We engaged in that endeavour and with the American Administration’s efforts with open minds and in good faith and a positive spirit. We laid out firm positions based on resolutions of international legitimacy. We genuinely respected all our commitments and understandings. Even as we watched the ongoing and escalating Israeli violations  we exercised incredible self-restraint  silencing our cries and tending to our own wounds in order to give the American efforts the best possible chance for success.However  as usual  the Israeli Government missed no opportunity to undermine the chances for peace. Throughout the months of negotiations  settlement construction  land confiscation  home demolition  killing and arrest campaigns and large-scale forced displacement in the West Bank continued unabated. The unjust blockade of the Gaza Strip was tightened. The occupation’s campaign specifically targeted the city of Jerusalem and its inhabitants  attempting to artificially alter the spirit  identity and character of the Holy City and focusing on Al-Aqsa Mosque while threatening grave consequences. At the same time  armed gangs of racist settlers persisted in their crimes against the Palestinian people and their land  mosques  churches  property and olive trees.Again as usual  the Israeli Government failed the test of peace. It breached an agreement with the United States Administration regarding the release from the occupation jails of a number of Palestinian prisoners  who we continue to insist should all be released. When confronted with simple questions during the direct negotiations or through the United States mediator  Israel had no hesitation in revealing its true positions. It refuses to end the occupation of the State of Palestine that began in 1967; rather it seeks to continue and entrench it  rejecting the Palestinian State and refusing to reach a just solution to the plight of the Palestine refugees. That is the Government of Israel’s official position. At best  the future it proposes for the Palestinian people consists of isolated ghettos for Palestinians on fragmented lands  without borders or sovereignty over its air space  water and natural resources  under the subjugation and control of the racist settlers and the army of occupation; at worst  it is a totally abhorrent form of apartheid. Some of the Israelis say they are for two States. Where is the State of Palestine? This is what they intend for the State of Palestine.Israel confirmed during the negotiations that it rejects making peace with its victims  the Palestinian people. All of this has been carried out along with an attempt to brand the conflict as a religious one against a background of increasingly rampant racism in Israel’s political and media discourse  as well as its entrenchment in the school curriculum and a series of laws and practices in favour of the occupation and its settlers. This culture of racism  incitement and hatred was glaringly apparent some months ago in an appallingly despicable crime committed by fascist settlers  who abducted Mohammed Abu Khdeir  a young boy from Jerusalem  burned him alive and killed him.This brings me to another fact of history. Over the years  the occupying Power has pursued a policy aimed at deliberately weakening the Palestinian National Authority in order to undermine it and make its role irrelevant. The occupation has targeted our relentless efforts to establish the foundations for the kind of State of Palestine that we want — a sovereign and independent State living in peace and building bridges of mutual cooperation with its neighbours  respecting its commitments  obligations and agreements and strengthening the values of citizenship  equality  nondiscrimination  the rule of law  human rights and pluralism.We want a State that deepens Palestine’s enlightened traditions of tolerance  coexistence and non-exclusion  strengthens the culture of peace  promotes the role of women  establishes an effective administration committed to the standards of good governance  and cares for the needs and interests of its people. The occupation struck  and continues to strike  a blow at this effort because our quest is the antithesis of Israel’s settlement policies  and because Israel seeks to destroy Palestine’s chance of creating an independent State within the framework of the two-State solution.When our efforts to end the internal division through national dialogue succeeded a few months ago and we prepared to restore the unity of our land  nation and institutions  we formed a national-consensus Government and began a process that was to lead to presidential and legislative elections. All countries around the world welcomed this achievement  with the exception of Israel  which has constantly sought to fragment our land and our national unity.Where do we go from here? The idea that one can simply return to the past patterns of actions that failed repeatedly is naive at best and  in any case  wrong. For it ignores the fact that it is no longer acceptable or possible to repeat methods that have proved futile  or to continue with approaches that have repeatedly failed and that require comprehensive review and radical correction.It is impossible — I repeat  impossible — to return to the cycle of negotiations that failed to deal with the core of the Palestinian question. There is neither credibility nor seriousness in negotiations in which Israel predetermines the results via its settlement activities and the occupation’s brutality. Nor is there meaning or value in negotiations in which the agreed objective is not ending the Israeli occupation and achieving the independence of the State of Palestine  with East Jerusalem as its capital  on the entire Palestinian territory occupied in the 1967 war. Moreover  negotiations that are not linked to a firm timetable for the implementation of this goal have no value. The time has come to end this colonial occupation.Palestine refuses to have the right to freedom of its people  who suffer terrorism at the hands of the racist occupying Power and its settlers and remain hostage to Israel’s security conditions. The Palestinian people are actually the ones who need immediate international protection — a protection they are seeking through international organizations. They are in need of the security and peace that they more than any other people are denied. And the children of Palestine are worthy of the world’s efforts to ensure that their childhood  dreams and lives will not once again be destroyed. It is time for the chapters of this renewed  ongoing tragedy to be closed.Those who were uprooted from their warm homes  good land and beautiful country in Al-Nakba 66 years ago  who were pushed into the misery of exile to live as refugees  and are now being forced into new waves of expulsion or onto ships of death on the world’s seas  need assurances. They need to be assured that they will not be displaced from their homes again  that their homes will not be destroyed again  and that they will not spend their lives waiting for the outbreak of a new war. Is it not time for this long tragedy to end?We will not forever accept demands to prove our good intentions by making concessions at the expense of our rights  to remain silent as we are killed and our land is stolen  and to understand the conditions of the other party and the importance of preserving its coalition Government  while its occupation becomes more entrenched. We are exhausted by the additional tests that we must undergo to prove our efficiency  competence and eligibility to earn our natural  simple right to live a normal life; our inherent right to expect a stable and ordinary tomorrow and to dream about more beautiful days; and the right of our youth to plan their future safely with peace and freedom prevailing over our land  like other peoples of the world. The time has come for a genuine and ust peace to prevail in the land of peace. As I have said more than once  we are the only people in the world that remain under occupation.All the Arab countries and ourselves have constantly warned about the disastrous consequences of the continuing Israeli colonial occupation and the denial of freedom and independence to the Palestinian people. We have repeatedly pointed out that allowing Israel to act as a State above the law without being held accountable or punished for its policies  aggression and defiance of the international community’s will and legality has provided fertile ground for  and an environment conducive to  the growth of extremism  hatred and terrorism in our region.Confronting the terrorism that plagues our region by groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and others  which have no basis whatsoever in the tolerant Islamic religion or humanity  and whose members are committing vile and heinous atrocities  requires much more than military confrontation. The matter is of the utmost urgency and requires much more than condemnations and declarations of positions  which are of course necessary. What is needed  first and foremost  is a comprehensive  credible strategy to dry up the sources of terrorism and eradicate its roots in all political  intellectual  economic and social spheres in our region. It requires the creation of solid foundations for a practical consensus rendering the fight against all forms of terrorism everywhere a collective task to be undertaken by an alliance of peoples  nations and civilizations. It requires  as a priority  ending the Israeli occupation  that in its practices and perpetuation  constitutes an abhorrent form of State terrorism and a breeding ground for incitement  tension and hatred.At a time when we are still suffering from the horrors of war  we face a formidable challenge to reconstruct what has been destroyed by occupation. This is the third time we are attempting to rebuild after the destruction inflicted on us by the occupation. We greatly appreciate the fact that next month  at the invitation of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Kingdom of Norway  the city of Cairo will host an international conference on relief and reconstruction for the Gaza Strip. Our Government will present comprehensive reports to the conference on the losses the acts of aggression have inflicted on various sectors of society  and it will provide details of plans and programmes to be rapidly implemented in the Gaza Strip  aimed at meeting immediate relief needs and the requirements for reconstruction  in full coordination with and under the supervision of the relevant United Nations agencies and bodies.Just a couple of days ago  the Palestinian faction emphasized its support for Gaza in order to facilitate reconstruction. While we reiterate our appreciation and gratitude to all the countries and organizations that hastened to help the Palestinian people both during and after the war  we are confident that brotherly and friendly countries will not waver in their support for the plans and programmes we will present  and that the conference will have practical results that can meet the expectations and needs of the victims of this act of aggression.We reaffirm here that the chief prerequisite for the success of all these plans and efforts is an end to the despicable ongoing Israeli blockade that has suffocated the Gaza Strip for years and turned it into the largest prison in the world for nearly 2 million Palestinian citizens. At the same time  we affirm our commitment to and the importance of consolidating the ceasefire through the negotiations being conducted under the auspices of Egypt. However  in order to avoid a repetition of the cycle of war and reconstruction every two or three years  it is imperative that we focus on the fundamental issue and starting point  which is that Gaza’s suffering will never be completely over until the occupation is ended and the State of Palestine’s independence achieved.During the past two weeks  Palestine and the Group of Arab States have been working intensively with the various regional groups in the United Nations to prepare for the introduction of a draft resolution on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for adoption by the Security Council and to advance efforts to achieve peace  which we still believe can be accomplished through international legitimacy. This endeavour reaffirms our commitment to achieving a just peace through a negotiated solution and a diplomatic and political effort through United Nations bodies. It is inspired by and based fully on the spirit and provisions of the many resolutions that have been adopted in the General Assembly and the Security Council  laying the foundations for a lasting solution and a just peace. There is nothing new here. All of these are previously adopted resolutions.This endeavour hopes to correct the failure of previous efforts to achieve peace by affirming the goal of ending the Israeli occupation and achieving a two-State solution for the State of Palestine  with East Jerusalem as its capital  over the entire territory occupied in 1967  alongside the State of Israel  and with a just and agreed-on solution to the plight of the Palestine refugees on the basis of resolution 194 (III)  with a specific time frame for implementing those objectives  as stipulated in the Arab Peace Initiative. There must be a time frame. That will be linked to the immediate resumption of negotiations between Palestine and Israel in order to demarcate the borders  reach a detailed and comprehensive agreement on all final status issues and then draft a comprehensive peace treaty between us and them.We are confident that this endeavour will enjoy the full support of those who are committed to ensuring that our country will not witness new wars and atrocities  who wish to support a campaign to combat terrorism  who believe we must act expeditiously to rectify the historical injustice inflicted by the Nakba on the people of Palestine  and who wish to see peace prevail in the land of monotheistic religions. The adoption of that draft resolution will affirm that this year the Assembly is striving to realize the International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People  who will continue to be steadfast in their struggle and will rise brave and strong from the rubble of destruction. As our poet Mahmoud Darwish has said  we are infected with the incurable disease of hope  and we love life if we are given a chance at it.There is an occupation that must end now. There is a people who must be freed immediately. The hour of independence of the State of Palestine has arrived  and I believe you are listening for it."
"145",5886,"QAT",69,2014,"At the outset  I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We wish him success in his mission. I would also like to thank His Excellency Mr. John Ashe for his work during his presidency. And I thank His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts to promote and operationalize the role of the United Nations.The start of this year’s session comes at a time when recent international developments are affecting the security and safety of all humankind. In that regard  it is essential that the United Nations live up to its role in the maintenance of international peace and security through all the mechanisms and means provided for in the Charter of the United Nations  explore every possible way of preventing conflicts and addressing their root causes  and work to settle them by peaceful means. We cannot achieve international peace and security without a dialogue based on the principle of equality and compliance with international law  implementation of the resolutions of international legality and respect for the principles of human rights and the rights of peoples.The Middle East went through an extremely dangerous phase during the recent war on our Palestinian brothers. There are no guarantees that it will not recur. Israel continues to persist in its policies of occupation and to defy the will of the international community by confiscating land in the West Bank and building settlements in an effort to perpetuate that occupation. Humankind was shocked by the tragic scenes and unprecedented images of destruction during the latest round of aggression targeting civilians in Gaza. Babies were killed in their mothers’ arms  almost half a million Palestinians were displaced and the Gaza Strip was virtually destroyed when people had hardly managed to rebuild after the destruction inflicted on Gaza during the previous war. Under international law and international humanitarian law  such acts are defined as crimes against humanity. The arrogance of power will not prevail over the resistance of the Palestinian people. I salute their steadfast resistance in the face of the occupation in Gaza and their insistence on regaining their legitimate rights. May the souls of the Palestinian martyrs rest in peace.Israel must realize that it can achieve security for its people only through peace  and that the occupation is bound to end. The damage caused by Israel’s repeated acts of aggression in the Gaza Strip in recent years  the unjust blockade imposed on it and the destruction wreaked on its infrastructure make it incumbent on the international community to compel Israel to implement internationally agreed-on resolutions  fulfil its obligations and hasten to remove every obstacle to lifting the blockade and launching the process of reconstructionn. The State of Qatar will spare no effort to provide assistance for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip  and we urge every country to follow suit.The international community’s response to the aspirations of the Palestinian people to freedom and national independence is vital to affirming the justice of international legality  especially since the question of Palestine is the last remaining issue on the decolonization agenda. In that context  temporary solutions and piecemeal settlements have proved useless and unacceptable. Israel’s intransigence compels us to resort to the United Nations as a framework that can accommodate all parties. The Security Council should shoulder its moral and legal responsibilities by upholding the principles of international legality and human rights and avoiding the selectivity that has characterized its approach to this issue in recent times. It should adopt a resolution  under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations  forcing Israel to end its occupation of the lands it seized in 1967 and to implement the two-State solution agreed on by the international community  according to a clear and time-bound political plan  within the framework of peace negotiations leading to a permanent settlement of the Palestinian question through a two-State solution  in accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative and the relevant internationally legitimate resolutions. The world is duty-bound to persuade the Palestinians that those who killed their children in Gaza will not be received in diplomatic forums as if they had carried out a civilized action because they had bombed Palestinians from the air without staining their hands with Palestinian blood.The tragedy of the Syrian people  now in its fourth year  represents one of the major challenges in the Middle East. This humanitarian disaster has been exacerbated and is becoming increasingly dangerous by the lack of a clear vision for a solution to the crisis  continued acts of murder and destruction  violations of human rights  the terrible human suffering and the displacement of nearly half of the Syrian people. This makes it incumbent on the international community to strive to end the bloodshed and the systematic destruction ofSyria by a regime that forces its people to choose between accepting its presence or burning down their country.We have already warned that the continuation of the regime’s policy of terrorism  genocide and displacement  as well as the failure to provide support to the Syrian revolution when it was still a civilian revolution demanding freedom and dignity  would push many Syrians to opt for self-defence. We have also warned the international community from the outset that if no action were taken about the situation in Syria  we would reach the point at which we now find ourselves. When the Syrian people defended themselves with weapons  we advocated providing them with support before the regime destroyed their country and before extremist organizations arose and flourished. No red lines were drawn to stop the actions of the Syrian regime. The world remained silent even when Syrian children and women were killed with chemical weapons and when its populated neighbourhoods were levelled with barrel bombs. Eventually  the Syrian people found themselves stuck between the grip of terrorism of the regime and that of extremist forces that thrived in the swamp of violence. The war of genocide waged and the deliberate displacement carried out by the regime remain major crimes.Confronted by this grim reality  the international community needs to provide all aspects of humanitarian aid to the Syrian people inside and outside their areas of refuge. We reiterate our call on the Security Council to promptly shoulder its legal and humanitarian responsibilities. It must support the Syrian people against the two dangers posed by the terrorism and crimes of genocide of the regime  and by the terrorist forces that have taken advantage of the prevailing misery  bitterness and the absence of the State and the international community. The first danger has begotten the second.Many areas of the world suffer from the terrorism being perpetrated under different pretexts and slogans that threaten the security and stability of the world and hamper the achievement of the desired development. No civilization has been spared terrorism in the modern era. There is no doubt that the most affected communities are those in which this evil seed had grown. This phenomenon is hostile to the diversity and pluralism that enrich communities. In the case of the affected Arab and Islamic societies  terrorism affects innocent people  impoverishes our societies by depriving them of humanitarian and religious diversity  muzzles the real demands of the peoples  and offends religion with its superficial and apostatic interpretations.Therefore we must all redouble our efforts to fight this phenomenon whatever its forms  target or source might be. It has been proved beyond any doubt that terrorism can be defeated only in its social environment. If societies are to stand with us in the fight against terrorism  we need to be fair and not push them to choose between terrorism and tyranny  or between terrorism and sectarian discrimination. We cannot win the war on terror if peoples are not satisfied that it is their war and not a war to stabilize a regime that is oppressing them.The Syrian people have suffered from tyranny and terrorism. The international community did not heed the cries for help of the Iraqi people  who have been the first victims of terrorism in Iraq. But those who fought terrorism and defeated it found themselves prone to marginalization and abuse by terrorist sectarian militias. It is therefore imperative to persuade the Iraqi people that they will not pay the a thousandfold price  and that when they defend their homeland they are merely defending their rights  dignity and freedoms  which must be guaranteed. This is what the majority of the Syrian people must be persuaded of after being soaked in the blood spilled by the Syrian regime for daring to demand freedom and dignity.In this context  the international community needs to stand firmly by brotherly Iraq in confronting terrorism and ending its ordeal. Preserving its sovereignty  territorial integrity and the diversity of its sects can be achieved only by defusing sectarian conflict and achieving Iraqi reconciliation that lays the foundations for a society free from sectarian and ethnic conflicts  with the participation of all political forces  without exclusion.In this context  the international community must also assist fraternal Libya in ending its current ordeal by making a serious effort to respect the will of the Libyan people and meet their legitimate aspirations for security and stability through reconciliation and the inclusion of all Libyan factions. From this rostrum  I call on all Libyan political forces to follow the path of national dialogue and to hammer out a formula for governance that meets the aspirations of the Libyan people  who have sacrificed so much for their freedom.On this occasion  I cannot but hail the nascent Tunisian experience  which augurs well for our future and owes its progress to the awareness and unity of the Tunisians and their insistence on the success of their experiment  despite continuous attempts by Powers that do not want pluralism to succeed in our region. Another successful instance of the peaceful transfer of power has been seen in Yemen. We were encouraged by the outcome of the national dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations and with the support of the Security Council  which adopted a resolution emphasizing commitment to the process and condemning those undermining its implementation.But it would seem that there are forces who are joining ranks in an attempt to thwart that experiment. Some oppose any change at all and would prefer to turn back the hands of the clock; others prefer sectarian conflict and sectarian and factional interests over justice and good governance for Yemen. Experience has shown that the use of violence and political action from a factional or sectarian perspective does not lead to a change towards a better system of governance  but poses a threat to the political entity itself.We call on our Yemeni brothers to preserve the achievements of the young people of Yemen  and those of national dialogue and wisdom  and not to abandon what they have accomplished. They must not allow anyone to drag them onto the path of sectarian violence. We also call on the United Nations to work on implementing its decisions on the achievements of the national dialogue  including rebuilding the army so that it can defend the legitimate institutions and stop the phenomenon of armed militias in Yemen. It has become clear that such forces would lead to civil strife and derail the process of peaceful transition.Many countries of the world still suffer from poverty and face difficulties in promoting their development at the desired pace. This holds true for the new post-2015 sustainable development goals  which constitute a common vision for future generations. I stress that the State of Qatar will pursue its efforts to build a partnership with the United Nations in order to adopt a post-2015 development plan that meets the aspirations of the peoples of all countries and regional blocs.I would also like to note that the State of Qatar has made progress in its national development plans and strengthened its regional and global partnerships  as confirmed by the United Nations 2014 Human Development Index. The State of Qatar has been ranked thirty-first globally  and today we continue the implementation of the comprehensive national strategy for human development based on the Qatar Vision 2030  aimed at achieving development in various fields.The State of Qatar will pursue its active policy of providing a space for dialogue in areas of conflict and for mediation between the various parties  as we believe in solving conflicts by peaceful means and have established a tradition of peaceful mediation. We will continue to provide a platform for dialogue among political currents  cultures and religions.In conclusion  I would like to reiterate the commitment of the State of Qatar to work with the United Nations to address common challenges and achieve the goals we all seek."
"146",5932,"ROU",69,2014,"It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly today on behalf of the Romanian delegation. At the outset  allow me to congratulate the Honourable Sam Kutesa on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session and to assure him of the full support of the Romanian delegation in fulfilling his high responsibility and functions.(spoke in French)As this is the first time I have had the honour to participate in this high-level debate  let me reaffirm my country’s peaceful mission as a promoter of peace and international security  the values of democracy  the rule of law and respect for human rights. The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization (A/69/1) over the past year again confirms that cooperation among Member States  based on the principles of the United Nations and in a spirit of solidarity  can meet the current challenges of our peoples.I would like to address some issues of interest to my country in regard to developments in international relations. Since the General Assembly’s general debate a year ago  the area of international security has witnessed the most complex and serious developments since the end of the cold war. In that context  we have a duty to reaffirm our commitment to the principles of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries  the non-use of force and the peaceful resolution of all problems between States  in accordance with international law.(spoke in English)One of the crises of utmost concern to my country is the current situation in Ukraine  given its impact on the security of the countries in Eastern Europe. The crisis started  as the Assembly knows  with the unilateral annexation of Crimea  an integral part of the sovereign State of Ukraine. That action on the European continent  unprecedented in recent decades  was followed by an internal conflict in the eastern regions of Ukraine  generated by forces pursuing separatist goals. I wish to reconfirm our clear and firm national position on the crisis in Ukraine. Romania rejects any form of external pressure on States in Eastern Europe with aspirations to achieve integration with Europe. Romania firmly supports the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and all countries. A strong  united and sovereign Ukraine  committed to its European path and to reforms in the economic and political fields  is in the best interests of Europe and the whole world.The international community has been involved in finding a solution to the crisis from its beginning. We commend the United Nations for its constant presence in the field and the efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to monitor the day-by-day developments on the ground and to support the whole international effort through its specific mechanisms.For many years  all countries of Eastern Europe and the Black Sea region have shared and openly declared the common goals of peace and cooperation. But instability and grave security concerns  such as in Ukraine  in Transdnistria  Ossetia and Abkhazia  and now in Donetsk  continue to pose obstacles to those goals. We must condemn aggression. We should not lose trust in the rule of international law. We should not lose faith in the benefits of cooperation  and we should all strive to prevent a spillover of the current crisis. The region has always been a bridge between Central Asia and Europe. At this juncture  we have a historical responsibility to assume  protect and preserve the potential for collaboration  cooperation and development in that part of Europe.Situated at the crossroads of the Danube and Black Sea regions  as well as serving as a bridge between Northern Europe and the Balkans  Romania is fully aware that regional cooperation is key for ensuring regional stability  for building confidence and for promoting the universal principles and values of the Charter of the United Nations. Joint initiatives on the economy  environment  infrastructure and cross-border cooperation have a long-term impact on all countries in our region. As a European Union member  Romania is an active contributor to the European Union Strategy for the Danube Region  to the Black Sea Synergy and to the South-East European Cooperation Process.We praise the solidarity expressed by the European Union and transatlantic partners in supporting a sustainable path for democracy and development in the Republic of Moldova  Ukraine and Georgia  assisting them to freely achieve their European aspirations. It was 75 years ago  based on the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact  that parts of Romania and some other independent States were dismantled. We have learned that history must not be an excuse for justifying actions against other countries. On the contrary  our answer to any temptation based on past history is strong support for democratic development  respect for the right to democratically choose one’s future  and respect for international law.I want to state that position clearly  on behalf of my country  as an expression of our democratic identity and responsible conduct in our relations with all our neighbours  and when speaking about the democratic future of all the countries in those regions  including the Republic of Moldova  Ukraine and Georgia. The desire to turn the extended Black Sea region into an area of peace  stability and prosperity should continue to guide our cooperation. We express our support  one again  for a democratic  secure and stable region  and we encourage our regional and international partners to broaden our solidarity with Ukraine  Moldova and Georgia.A source of concern to all of us is the multiplication of political  security and strategic challenges in the southern neighbourhood of the European Union and in the Middle East. The proliferation of radical Islamist movements and the emergence of new groups  such as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS)  have led to an enhanced terrorist threat. They represent a new breed of terrorism  which threatens to destabilize the entire Middle East and the world. ISIS goes beyond Iraq and Syria  and therefore represents a major challenge to the international order and must be dealt with by all States. We must all stand united and fight terrorism wherever it arises. I want to express my country’s firm support for building solidarity in confronting this new challenge.In the field of development  we believe that the current session of the General Assembly is crucial for the preparation of the post-2015 sustainable development agenda  which will guide our actions in coming decades. As a member of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  Romania made its contribution to that very important process  in accordance with the decisions taken at United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. Our national vision of the future goals was adopted by the Government of Romania in December 2013  and we are pleased to see that our areas of interest are reflected in the report of the Open Working Group (see A/67/941). The future development agenda should address poverty eradication and sustainable development  good governance and the rule of law. However  it should also provide a platform for social inclusion and the reduction of unemployment  giving our present and future generations of young people confidence and hope.Over the past year  the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance  especially the number of refugees and internally displaced persons  has grown to unprecedented levels. We commend and support the assistance provided to those persons by the United Nations system in close cooperation with international organizations  non-governmental organizations and international donors. Despite our limited financial resources  we have made efforts to contribute to the process of assisting refugees.In that respect  I would like to mention the activities of the emergency transit centre in Timisoara  Romania  established by the Romanian Government  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration. The centre  the first of its kind in the world  has proved to be a feasible mechanism offering safety to persons in urgent need of international protection  thereby becoming a practical expression of the human security concept. That contribution reflects the responsible conduct that Romania has always adopted in facing global challenges. We will continue to contribute to international efforts with the same dedication and responsibility as our troops and civil experts have already shown in several areas  such as Iraq  Afghanistan and Kosovo  or places in Africa.(spoke in French)The year 2014 has particular resonance for Romania and brings us closer to our national centennial  which we will celebrate in 2018. In 1989  Romanians chose democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We encountered difficulties  but our resolve led us to a successful transition.In conclusion  I would like to reiterate our firm and continuing commitment to the Organization and the Charter of the United Nations and their governing values and principles. Romania will continue to uphold international law and the principle of the peaceful resolution of conflicts  while promoting human rights in order to achieve prosperity for all."
"147",5978,"RUS",69,2014,"There is growing evidence today of a contradiction between the need for collective and partnership efforts in order to develop adequate responses to the challenges common to us all  on the one hand  and  on the other  the aspiration of a number of States to domination and a revival of the archaic bloc thinking based on military drill discipline and the erroneous logic of friend or foe.The United States-led Western alliance  which portrays itself as a champion of democracy  the rule of law and human rights within individual countries  acts from a directly opposite position in the international arena  rejecting the democratic principles of the sovereign equality of States enshrined the Charter of the United Nations and trying to decide for everyone what is good or evil.Washington has openly declared its right to the unilateral use of military force anywhere to advocate its own interests. Military interference has become a norm  despite the dismal outcome of all the operations involving the use of force that the United States has carried out in recent years.The sustainability of the international system has been severely shaken by the NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia  the intervention in Iraq  the attack against Libya and the failure in Afghanistan. It was due only to intensive diplomatic efforts that aggression against Syria was prevented in 2013. The various colour revolutions and other schemes aimed at changing unsuitable regimes inevitably give the impression that their goal is to create chaos and instability.Today Ukraine has fallen victim to that policy. The situation there has revealed the deep-rooted and systemic flaws remaining in the existing Euro-Atlantic architecture. The West has embarked on a course towards a vertical structuring of humankind tailored to its own standards  which are hardly inoffensive.After the West declared victory in the Cold War and the so-called end of history  the United States and the European Union opted to expand the geopolitical area under their control without taking into account the balance of legitimate interests of all the peoples of Europe. The Western partners did not heed our numerous warnings with regard to the unacceptable violations of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act  and time and again they have avoided serious joint work to establish a common space of equal and indivisible security and cooperation from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans.The Russian proposal to draft a European security treaty was rejected. We were told directly that only the members of the North Atlantic Alliance can have legally binding security guarantees  and the NATO expansion to the East continued in spite of the promises to the contrary given earlier. NATO’s instant switch to hostile rhetoric and the reduction of its cooperation with Russia  even to the detriment of the West’s own interests  and the additional build-up of military infrastructure along Russia’s borders revealed the inability of the Alliance to change the genetic code embedded in it during the Cold War.The United States and the European Union supported the coup d’état in Ukraine  recklessly justifying any acts by the self-proclaimed Kyiv authorities  who opted to suppress by force that part of the Ukrainian people who had rejected the attempts to impose an anti-constitutional order throughout the country and wanted to defend their rights to their native language  culture and history. It is precisely the aggressive assault on those rights that compelled the population of Crimea to take its destiny in its own hands and make a choice in favour of self-determination. That was an absolutely free choice  no matter what was invented by those who were responsible in the first place for the internal conflict in Ukraine.There have been attempts to distort the truth and hide facts behind blanket accusations at all stages of the Ukrainian crisis. Nothing has been done to track down and prosecute those responsible for the bloody February events at Maidan and the massive loss of human lives in Odessa  Mariupol and other regions of Ukraine. The scale of the appalling humanitarian disaster provoked by the acts of the Ukrainian army in south-eastern Ukraine has been deliberately understated.Recently  horrifying new facts came to light when mass graves were discovered near Donetsk. Despite Security Council resolution 2166 (2014)  a thorough and independent investigation into the circumstances of the loss of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 over Ukrainian territory has been delayed. Those guilty for all those crimes must be found and brought to justice. Otherwise  national reconciliation in Ukraine can hardly be expected.Russia is sincerely interested in the restoration of peace in a neighbouring country  and that should be well understood by anyone even slightly acquainted with the deep-rooted and fraternal relations between the two peoples. The path to a political settlement is known. As early as this April  Kyiv made a commitment in the Geneva Statement on Ukraine — agreed upon by Russia  Ukraine  the United States and the European Union (EU) — to immediately start a nation-wide dialogue involving all of Ukraine’s regions and political forces to implement constitutional reforms. The fulfilment of that obligation would allow all Ukrainians to agree on how to live in accordance with their traditions and culture and would allow Ukraine to return to its organic role as a link between the different parts of the European space  which certainly implies the preservation and respect by everyone of its non-aligned  neutral status. We are convinced that with goodwill and the refusal to support the party of war in Kyiv  which is trying to push the Ukrainian people into the abyss of national catastrophe  a way out of the crisis is within reach.A way to overcome the situation has opened with a ceasefire agreement for south-eastern Ukraine on the basis of initiatives of Presidents Poroshenko and Putin. With the participation of representatives of Kyiv  Donetsk  Luhansk  the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Russia  practical measures are being agreed on for the consecutive realization of those agreements  including the separation of the parties  the withdrawal of the heavy weapons of the Ukrainian military forces and of the militias  and the organization of monitoring through the OSCE.Russia is ready to continue to actively promote a political settlement  both under the framework of the well-known recommendations of the Minsk process and in other formats. But it should be quite clear that we are doing this for the sake of peace  tranquillity and the well-being of the Ukrainian people  and not to appease someone’s ambitions. Attempts to put pressure on Russia to force it to abandon its values of truth and justice are absolutely futile.I will allow myself a digression into recent history. As a condition for the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1933  the United States Government demanded from Moscow guarantees of non-interference in the internal affairs of the United States  obligations not to undertake any actions aimed at changing the political and social structure of America. At that time  Washington feared the revolutionary virus  and such guarantees were secured between America and the Soviet Union  on the basis of reciprocity.Perhaps it makes sense to return to that subject and reproduce the then demand of the American Government on a universal scale. Why not adopt a General Assembly declaration about the inadmissibility of interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign States and non-recognition of coups d’état as a method of regime change? It is time to fully exclude from international interaction attempts at illegitimate pressure by some States against others. The meaningless and counterproductive nature of unilateral sanctions is obvious in the example of the American blockade of Cuba.A policy of ultimatums and a philosophy of superiority and domination do not meet the needs of the twenty-first century; they are in conflict with the objective processes of forming a polycentric  democratic world order. Russia promotes a positive  unifying agenda. We have always been and will be open to discussing the most difficult questions  no matter how intractable they may seem at first. We will be ready to seek a compromise and a balance of interests and to agree to exchange concessions  provided only that the conversation is respectful and equitable.The Minsk Agreement of 5 and 19 September about the ways out of the Ukrainian crisis and the compromise about the dates of entry into force of the Association Agreement between Kyiv and the European Union are good examples to emulate  as is the readiness  at last  of Brussels to begin negotiations on establishing a free trade area between the EU and the Customs Union of Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan  as Mr. Putin suggested back in January.Russia has consistently advocated the harmonization of integration projects in Europe and Eurasia. Agreement on political benchmarks and terms such as “convergence of integration” would be a real contribution to the work of the OSCE on the topic of Helsinki+40. Another important aspect of that work would be to launch a pragmatic  de-ideologized conversation on politico-military architecture in the Euro-Atlantic area  so that not only members of NATO and of the Collective Security Treaty Organization but all the countries of the region  including Ukraine  the Republic of Moldova and Georgia  would enjoy equal and indivisible security and not have to make a false choice of “either with us  or against us”. New dividing lines must not be allowed in Europe  especially because in the context of globalization they could become a watershed between the West and the rest of the world.It must be stated honestly that no one has a monopoly on the truth; no one can forcibly tailor global and regional processes to suit their needs. Today there is no alternative to developing consensus on the rules of sustainable global governance in the new historical conditions  with full respect for the cultural and civilizational diversity of the world and the multiplicity of development models. To attain such a consensus on every issue will be difficult  perhaps tedious. But recognizing that in every State democracy is “the worst form of Government except for all the others” also took a long time  not until Churchill issued his verdict. It is time to recognize the inevitability of that axiom in international affairs  which currently suffer from a huge deficit of democracy. Of course  someone will have to break the age-old stereotypes  to abandon claims to eternal exceptionalism. But there is no other way.United efforts can be built only on the principles of mutual respect and mutual consideration of interests  as is done  for example  within the Security Council  the Group of 20  the BRICS States of Brazil  Russia  India  China and South Africa  and the Shanghai Cooperation Council.The theory of the advantages of collective work are confirmed in practice  for instance  the progress in settling the situation concerning the Iranian nuclear programme and the successful completion of the chemical demilitarization of Syria. By the way  speaking of chemical weapons  I would like to obtain honest information on the state of Libya’s chemical arsenals. We understand that our NATO colleagues  having bombed the country in violation of Security Council resolutions  do not want to stir up the disorder they created. However  the problem of uncontrolled Libyan chemical arsenals is too serious to turn a blind eye to. We believe the Secretary-General must show his responsibility in that matter.The main thing today is to see the global priorities and avoid making them hostage to a one-sided agenda. There is an urgent need to refrain from double standards in approaches to conflict resolution. By and large  everybody agrees that the key task is to resolutely counter the terrorists  who are trying to gain control of increasingly larger areas of Iraq  Syria  Libya  Afghanistan and the Sahel-Sahara region. That being the case  that problem cannot be sacrificed to ideological schemes or to settle a score. Terrorists  whatever slogans they hide behind  must be outlawed.At the same time  of course  the fight against terrorism should be based on the solid foundation of international law. An important stage in that fight was the unanimous adoption of a series of Security Council resolutions  including those on the issue of foreign terrorist fighters. On the other hand  attempts to act contrary to the Charter of our Organization do not contribute to the success of joint efforts. The fight against terrorists in Syria should be built on cooperation with the Syrian Government  which has clearly stated its willingness in that regard. Damascus has already demonstrated its ability to cooperate with the international community and to fulfil its obligations in the framework of the programme for eliminating its chemical weapons.From the very outset of the Arab Spring  Russia urged that it not be abandoned to the control of extremists  that a united front be created to counter the growing terrorist threat. We have warned against the temptation to take as allies almost anyone who declared himself an enemy of Bashar Al-Assad  whether Al-Qaida  Jabhat Al-Nusra and other fellow travellers of regime change  including the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)  which today is the focus of attention. As they say  better late than never. This is not the first time that Russia is making a real contribution to the fight against ISIL and other terrorist groups in the region. We are delivering large-scale supplies of arms and military equipment to Iraq  Syria and other Middle Eastern and North African countries  and we will continue to support their efforts to suppress the terrorists.The terrorist threat requires a comprehensive approach if we want to eradicate its causes and not be doomed to reacting to the symptoms. ISIL is only part of the problem. We propose to organize  under the auspices of the Security Council  an in-depth study of the threat of extremism and terrorism in all of their aspects throughout the Middle East and North African region. That integrated approach also presupposes that chronic conflicts should be considered  above all the Arab-Israeli conflict. The failure to settle the Palestinian issue over several decades remains  as is widely recognized  one of the main factors of instability in the region  and that helps extremists to recruit more and more new jihadists.Another area of our common work together demanding attention is uniting our efforts to implement the decisions of the General Assembly and Security Council to combat the Ebola virus. Our doctors are already working in Africa. There are plans to send additional humanitarian assistance  medical equipment and instruments  medicine and teams of experts to assist the United Nations programmes in Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone.The United Nations was established on the ruins of the Second World War  and it is entering the year of its seventieth anniversary. We all have an obligation to celebrate in an appropriate manner the anniversary of the great victory and to pay tribute to the memory of all who perished for freedom and the right of each people to determine their own destiny. The lessons of that terrible war and the entire course of events in today’s world require us to join efforts and forget about unilateral interests and national electoral cycles when it comes to countering global threats to all humankind. National egoism should not be allowed to prevail over collective responsibility."
"148",6025,"RWA",69,2014,"I want to start by congratulating you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly.We are living through a period of unprecedented progress in human development. The success of the Millennium Development Goals framework demonstrates that international cooperation remains strong  though we wish the expected results would come faster. Even on climate change  if the public and private sectors work together to increase investment in scientific research  we can look forward to a future where countries no longer have to choose between green energy and economic growth.While we work on building peace and well-being in Africa  crises elsewhere in the world have aroused grave concern. Efforts to address them seem to have little effect  and in some cases they may even make things worse.Two critically important public goods have been consistently undervalued by the international system in its approach to conflict resolution and peacebuilding. They are physical security and national identity. When security breaks down  the human costs are enormous. Extremists and opportunists are empowered. Citizens lose faith in public institutions  as grievances are settled in the street. As a result  sustainable gains in good governance cannot be made. It takes time and patience to build a better political system. There are no shortcuts. We are dealing with real people who want change  but with continuity and safety. They must be fully included in the process of consensus-building. That is because structures of governance that are not developed from within will not take root. We should encourage full ownership and partnership  and the approach of international institutions and Member States should take those realities into account. In countries that have known only peace  such arguments may sound self-serving. But they are not  because lives are at stake.The second neglected element is national identity. That is just as important. To manage the diversity in our societies  politics must be national in scope. Whatever differences we may have  our common citizenship is a bond that unites us. The negative experiences of nationalism have created doubt about affirming patriotism and national identity. However  what we see around the world today is that national identities are too weak  not that they are too strong. As a result  ethnicity  region and religion become the dominant currency of politics  and nations are torn apart. International systems should encourage efforts by Governments and civil society to strengthen national unity.In Rwanda  we have focused on building accountable governance institutions and renewing our dignity as a nation. As a result  Rwandans today are among the most optimistic and civic-minded people in the world. For us  stability is not an abstraction  it is a reality that abides in the minds and hearts of the people and the institutions they build to sustain it. Once achieved  the horizon expands from poverty reduction to wealth creation and the attainment of ever higher measures of human development.Therefore  our task in the international community is not to manage conflicts  but to help prevent and end those conflicts. If we focus on keeping people safe and bringing them together to solve their problems  we will be able to do so."
"149",6107,"SDN",69,2014,"At the outset  on behalf of the Republic of the Sudan  I would like to convey to Mr. Sam Kutesa our sincerest congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I also extend thanks and appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. John Ashe  for his wise and patient conduct of the deliberations of the previous session. We hope that this session will culminate in concrete results on important  universal issues  in particular the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda  which is a major topic of discussion at this session.Today  I address the Assembly at a time when the Sudan is on the threshold of an important new phase of comprehensive political participation that excludes no party  faction or group. On 27 January  His Excellency the President of the Republic of the Sudan  President Omer Al-Bashir  launched an initiative for an inclusive national dialogue  calling on the representatives of the Sudanese people to sit at the same table to discuss six major priorities: unity and peace  the economy  fundamental freedoms and rights  their identity  foreign relations and the issues of governance and the implementation of the outcomes of the national dialogue.The President’s appeal enjoyed an unprecedented response on the part of all political forces in the Sudan and the international community in view of the fact that both the Government and the opposition were convinced that dialogue was the only option at that time  as agreed by the people of the Sudan. There followed a succession of organizational and procedural consultations in order to translate the statement of His Excellency the President into concrete steps. The initiative even found a positive response among the armed groups that still existed. I would like to affirm the State’s intention to move the dialogue forward in the hope of achieving a national consensus on the political future of the country.In that regard  we greatly appreciate the ongoing efforts of the African Union and the African Union High-level Implementation Panel on the three major political  security and economic tracks. We call on the international community to promote a positive and constructive role in support of the Sudanese economy  in particular by lifting the unilateral sanctions  and by cancelling the Sudan’s accumulated debt  in line with the aspirations for broader political participation.The Sudan has continued to play an effective and positive role at the regional level on the African continent  with a view to establishing peace and stability in neighbouring States. When a conflict broke out in the Republic of South Sudan  the Sudan adhered to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of that country. The Sudan was the first State to provide humanitarian aid to those affected in South Sudan  and continues to do so. The Sudan is participating effectively with the Intergovernmental Authority on Development so as to put an end to the war and to conclude a reconciliation agreement between the two parties to the conflict in South Sudan. My country has received more than 100 000 internally displaced persons from South Sudan.In that context  we recall the Sudan’s constructive efforts for the restoration of peace and stability in the Central African Republic  thereby complementing other international and regional efforts. The Sudan is also actively working with Libya’s neighbours in assisting the Libyan parties to reach an agreement on a solution to the Libyan crisis. Internationally  I underscore the trilateral cooperation among the Sudan  Ethiopia and the Arab Republic of Egypt in order to ensure the common enjoyment of the waters of the Blue Nile and to avert any negative repercussions in that country.In that regard  we also stress the efforts of the Sudan in the area of border control and demarcation with neighbouring States in order to strengthen the border posts and border monitoring and security and to prevent transnational crime  including illegal immigration and the illegal transfer of small arms and light weapons. In that context  we appreciate the experience of the joint border forces of the Sudan and Chad  the Sudan and the Central African Republic  and the Sudan and Libya as models of successful regional security cooperation between neighbouring States in the interests of peace and stability. In that connection  I would like to recall that in mid-October 2014  the Sudan will host a conference  in partnership with Italy  the European Union and the African Union  on preventing illegal immigration  smuggling and human trafficking.Concerning the situation in the Middle East  the question of Palestine has continued to present a real challenge for the international community for decades. It has now reached a stage that requires the exceptional and prompt action of the international community in order to contain the situation and to move it forward towards sustainable peace in the Middle East  through the achievement of the legitimate and urgent demands of the Palestinian people  in particular the protection and reconstruction of what the Israeli war machine has destroyed. The entire world’s ongoing disregard for the genocidal war in Palestine and its failure to intervene to protect the Palestinians and their rights fuel extremism in the region and throughout the world. As long as the Palestinian people opt for a peaceful solution  it is imperative to support that direction in order to prevent despair from spreading and the pursuit of destructive solutions.We fully accept and support the theme of the post-2015 development agenda as a major topic for discussion at this session. However  there remain only a few months until the end of 2014 and we still have not achieved all the MDGs. We nevertheless remain very hopeful that we can overcome the obstacles that have impeded us from achieving those Goals and that the deliberations will culminate in a thorough preparation for the development of viable post-2015 sustainable development goals.In the United Nations Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2)  adopted in 2000  the Heads of State and Government unanimously agreed a set of principles and goals that laid the foundation for an international partnership to put an end to people’s suffering and poverty. The year 2015 was designated as the deadline for eradicating poverty and for ensuring well-being. However  the achievements reached on the eve of the end of 2014 are still short of our aspirations  since poverty  suffering  need  environmental deterioration and unemployment persist.The agreement of the world’s leaders with regard to mitigating poverty requires that the obstacles to achieving such development be overcome. However  the development partners that drafted the Declaration have adopted actions that run counter to its provisions and to human rights. Such coercive measures as unilateral sanctions outside the framework of international legitimacy have flagrantly damaged the content of the Millennium Declaration. That has had an adverse impact on the noble principles and purposes of the Declaration.Indications of the current situation in human development are that the Sudan has achieved concrete progress in several fields  especially in peace  health care  education and the standard of living. While acknowledging uneven degrees of progress between rural and urban areas  the Sudan has implemented a federal system to promote the role of local communities. However  such progress has been greatly damaged as a result of coercive and unilateral measures illegally and unjustifiably imposed against the Sudan  which have aggravated and delayed initiatives  thereby negating the Sudan’s role  and which continue to shackle the country’s economy. In that regard  I recall that the international consensus  achieved after the referendum in South Sudan that led to the separation of South Sudan  had been to cancel the Sudan’s debts. A number of States were assigned to do so in order to promote peace and development after the end of the war. However  that agreement has not been implemented so far.In the Sudan  in the context of our established commitment to the MDGs  we have formulated the required policies  which have gone a long way towards promoting several poverty-eradication projects and initiatives  such as the establishment of a funding portfolio for small families and those with limited income; programmes to recruit graduates and young people in capital projects; the promotion of the role of women in governance and management; and the strenghtening of the role of the zakat fund in promoting quick and short-term funds and other projects  which have resulted in helping thousands of families to play a productive role in paying the zakat. That is now under consideration by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation  so that it can be applied throughout the Islamic States.However  we must affirm from this rostrum the importance of the commitment to a common responsibility in achieving development objectives  because the international community must support and assist developing countries  especially the least developed  which represent the segment more in need of support and capacity-building. That is why  in the light of declining development assistance  we hope that deliberations at this session culminate in our taking practical steps in financing development for developing countries  especially those emerging from conflict. On the basis of those measures and in order to guarantee serving the objectives of development  my delegation feels it important to include the following requirements in the post-2015 development agenda.First  we should consider debt cancellation  providing the necessary funding and renouncing discrimination and exclusionary political considerations. Secondly  we should facilitate the transfer of development-related technology and information through advanced communications technology. Thirdly  we should suspend coercive measures  sanctions and all kinds of illegal measures imposed unilaterally by States outside the framework of international legitimacy. Fourthly  we should launch feasible initiatives in North-South relations  such as funding food-security projects  where my country can play a pioneering and effective role in their success. Fifthly  we should help the United Nations and its various organs to play an effective role in achieving their desired development objectives by providing the mechanisms enabling them to do so.This year’s general debate coincides with the United Nations Climate Summit  the outcomes of which we hope will provide a strong impetus for the current efforts to address climate change and to turn the grave challenge facing humankind into an opportunity for joint action in order to achieve a binding international commitment to supplement the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  take practical steps towards a green economy  and reduce the carbon emissions that threaten the safety of our planet. In that regard  the Sudan  a State affected by the climate change phenomenon  accords special importance to the environment issue. We recall that the drought and desertification that have hobbled Africa north of the equator are the living examples of the effcts of climate change  which have led to tribal conflicts over sources of water and pasture. The Sudan’s involvement in the United Nations Environment Programme over the past 40 years has been consistent with our concern in that regard.The Sudan remains in an effective global partnership in the fight against terrorism at the national level. We have come a long way in harmonizing our laws with international legislation and in working with international law and instruments relevant to fighting terrorism. We commit ourselves to those international laws and reaffirm our commitment against all forms and manifestations of terrorism. At the same time  we condemn any attempt to identify terrorism with any religion  race or culture and call for the redoubling of efforts to enhance international and regional cooperation to stand up to terrorism. The phenomenon of terrorism can be addressed and overcome only through a balanced international system based on equality and respect for the established principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. In that context  we feel that any unilateral action based on politicizing terrorism will not eliminate but exacerbate it. There are numerous instances supporting that conclusion.In conclusion  the Sudan affirms that international and regional security is an integrated  interconnected system and that the Organization has invested enormous efforts and resources in peacekeeping operations. It is now time to do so  and we have significant experience in that regard. It is time for the Organization to invest in peacemaking and peacebuilding by supporting developing countries and building the capacities of least developed countries so that they can achieve the MDGs and peace and development can supplement each other."
"150",6152,"SEN",69,2014,"I particularly welcome the opportunity today to represent His Excellency Mr. Macky Sall  President of the Republic of Senegal  before the General Assembly and to deliver this intervention on his behalf.In line with my predecessors  I would like to extend a warm welcome to Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa and express my delegation’s particular pleasure in seeing him assume the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. In reiterating our warm wishes for success in fulfilling his important duty  I assure him of the unwavering support of my delegation  which  as always  will contribute in a constructive manner to the full realization of the goals of the United Nations. I also pay warm tribute to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. John William Ashe  whose dynamism and open mind greatly contributed to the success of the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I also want to express  on behalf of the President of Senegal  our full gratitude to Secretary-General Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts in promoting peace  security  development and human rights.I am therefore particularly pleased by the opportunity to represent President Macky Sall and to take the opportunity offered to my delegation to welcome the conclusions of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals and those on the financing of sustainable development for the purpose of defining the main pillars of the post-2015 development agenda. The scope of those challenges  linked to this important moment for humankind  requires that our States adopt appropriate strategies and measures with a view to assuring a good transition and calmly facing the expected global transformation.The theme of this session — “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda” — provides an opportunity to deepen the discussion already begun during the previous session with a view to establishing a common vision on the ways and means to strengthen our commitment and our actions for sustainable and inclusive growth. It is therefore our mission to work towards inclusive development for present and future generations  given the many challenges faced by our people  particularly in the areas of education  health  the fight against poverty and extreme poverty  energy  climate change and endemic poverty.With that in mind  the Government of Senegal has resolutely moved towards a model whose goal is the creation of wealth and structural transformation of its economy. That is why we have adopted the Emerging Senegal Plan  which is  and for the next few years will be  the reference point for Senegal’s economic and social policies. Emerging Senegal is backed by a progressive dynamic that is firmly oriented towards sustainable and inclusive development.In the light of all of the above  we need to understand the importance of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development  whose Steering Committee  led by the President of the Republic of Senegal  deserves to be further supported and promoted  given its goals relating to poverty eradication and infrastructure development in Africa and the structural transformation of African economies. At this very moment  as we consider the issue of sustainable development  the world continues to be confronted with terrorism and various crises and conflicts that are just as dangerous for international peace and security. The Sahel and West Africa are faced with recurring threats from terrorist groups whose criminal actions undermine the foundations of our society and hinder our development efforts. We are pleased by the Security Council’s adoption yesterday of resolution 2178 (2014)  a strong resolution against terrorism.With regard to our subregion  our immediate neighbours in general and Guinea-Bissau in particular  Senegal would like to welcome the democratic process that led to the election of President José Mário Vaz. I urge the international community to support that fraternal country  with its enormous potential  including through a donors round table. Similarly  the efforts of the international community to help stabilize the Central Africa region are hampered by the arduous process of the disarmament  demobilization and reintegration of the main militias and armed groups  while the Horn of Africa  on top of terrorism  is still severely affected by the scope of conflicts with disastrous humanitarian consequences. Another part of Africa is suffering the effects of a scourge — rather  I should say a catastrophe — and that is the haemorrhagic fever caused by the Ebola virus. It certainly affects West Africa but is also a genuine threat to the entire world. We are pleased by the Security Council’s adoption by consensus of resolution 2177 (2014)  which was sponsored by 134 countries  including Senegal  and by the high-level meeting organized by the Secretary-General this very morning  which was a resounding success. The decision to establish the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response has reassured our country that the international community is aware of the scourge and that Ebola is not only an African matter but one that affects the entire world. That is why Senegal calls on the international community to take swift action to provide the necessary support not only to the countries affected by the virus  but to those of the entire West African region exposed to the ravages of this epidemic. The sooner we take action  the better we can control the epidemic. As for Senegal  we have set up a secure humanitarian corridor as a sign of solidarity with the brotherly countries that have been struck by the disease.Furthermore  concerning another important issue  that of Western Sahara  my country reaffirms its commitment to strengthening the historic fraternal ties among all of the countries of the Maghreb and Africa in general. With that in mind  all forms of separatism must be discouraged. In that regard  Senegal would like to reiterate its support to Morocco’s initiative to grant broad autonomy to Western Sahara in the context of respect for its sovereignty and for the relevant resolutions of the Security Council  for the sake of durable peace in the region. Faced with all of those pressing challenges  my delegation is convinced of the urgent need to establish a holistic approach that can enhance the resilience of countries facing recurrent crises and emerging new conflicts. From that perspective  a body such as the International Criminal Court (ICC) has  as part of its mandate  a significant role to play in re-establishing peace. Therefore  I would like to acknowledge here the distinctive honour recently bestowed on Senegal  via the person of Mr. Sidiki Kaba  Minister of Justice  who is the single African candidate standing in the election for the position of President of the Assembly of States Parties to the ICC  scheduled to take place in December.In any event  Senegal remains committed to its irreversible path in favour of peace and international security. It will continue to provide  with commitment and determination  its contribution to peacekeeping operations  while stressing the deployment of high-quality personnel  whenever it is requested and within its capacities. For a global solution to crises  we believe that in addition to policies addressing the issues  conditions must be conducive to restoring the economic capacities of countries affected by conflict. It is also urgent to strengthen cooperation and refine our prevention strategies to better cope with the escalating violence and new forms of conflict related to the spread of international terrorism.The thorny issue of the Palestinian conflict comes to mind. In that connection  Senegal welcomes the ceasefire of recent months. In its capacity as Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People  Senegal reiterates its call to revive the peace process and put an end to the blockade that has been suffocating Gaza since 2007. In this International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People  Senegal renews its support for a just  peaceful and negotiated solution as the only option capable of ending the conflict and achieving the creation of a viable  independent Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital  living side by side with Israel within secure  internationally recognized borders.Paradoxically  the acuteness of the current crises is symptomatic of the status quo that continues to bog down the process of Security Council reform. I hope that the upcoming celebration of the seventieth anniversary of our common Organization in 2015 will mark the start of a reformed and renovated Security Council. Senegal commends the French initiative to suspend the right of the veto in cases of mass crimes.Also during the Assembly’s seventieth session  non-permanent members of the Security Council will be elected for the 2016-2017 term. As a candidate  Senegal wishes to request from this rostrum the support of all Member States for its election next year to a non-permanent seat on the Council  25 years after its last term on the Council."
"151",6199,"SGP",69,2014,"I wish to convey our congratulations to Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We wish him success in the coming year.We are not living in the worst of times  but they are not the best of times either. Standards of living are far higher for more of the human race than ever before. But we face global crises of several types: internal and cross-border conflicts  epidemics  disasters both natural and man-made  climate change and international crime. We are facing grave threats from terrorism and extremism. The latest manifestation is the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS). It is brutal and cruel and a travesty of all that religion stands for. Its unspeakable acts of cruelty  including abductions and brutal murders of civilians  constitute crimes against humanity. Singapore condemns those terrorist actions in the strongest possible terms. ISIS will continue to target those who do not conform to its extremist agenda.The threat of such terrorism and radical ideology is not confined to the Middle East. It affects the whole world. An estimated 15 000 foreigners from at least 80 countries  including from South-East Asia  have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight. That fact that ISIS can attract so many foreign fighters highlights the need for a comprehensive strategy to counter them. In addition to military and intelligence efforts  we must also combat the radical ideology used to recruit foreign fighters  which fuels their extremist agenda.Singapore firmly supports all international and regional cooperation efforts. We welcome the strong leadership of the United States  in particular in the formation of the international coalition to combat the ISIS threat. We also welcome the Jeddah Declaration by Arab countries to stand united against ISIS. Security Council resolution 2178 (2014)  on foreign terrorist fighters  which Singapore co-sponsored  is an important step to combat global terrorism and will be critical to cutting off financial and material support for ISIS and preventing the movement of foreign terrorist fighters. No country can insulate itself from those problems. We need to combat them at all levels. Fair economic development  good governance and political and social stability will be critical in increasing a country’s resilience against those threats.The President’s choice of the theme “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda” for this year’s session and his emphasis on a comprehensive  action-oriented post-2015 development agenda are particularly timely. Singapore commends the work of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals and looks forward to the Secretary-General’s report of its recommendations.We also welcome the contributions of major forums  such as the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States (SIDS)  recently held in Samoa. Singapore had the privilege of co-chairing the preparatory committee for that forum with New Zealand. It is important that the views and concerns of small States be properly factored into the post-2015 development agenda. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were successful due to the pragmatic  outcome-based and quantifiable approach to the Targets. We hope that same approach will be taken in respect of the post-2015 development agenda. Those MDGs that were not fully achieved should be included as an intrinsic part of the post-2015 agenda. Regarding the principles for sustainable development  Singapore is participating actively in the discussions for the post-2015 period  focusing on those areas where we can contribute — key principles that were critical to our development path and might be relevant to other developing countries. First is the principle of honest and competent government. Corruption is a drag on development and an intrinsic source of social instability. Fighting it needs political will  strong leadership and unceasing vigilance from the whole society. Secondly  rule of law is integral to sustainable development. Governments need sound and effective institutions. Those institutions  including the civil service  the judiciary and law enforcement agencies  must be built on core principles of equal justice and meritocracy  regardless of ethnicity  religion or gender. Social capital — the trust that people have in one another  their leaders and the system — is as necessary to sustainable development as financial capital. The third principle is that economic and social policy must be pragmatic  not dogmatic. Singapore does not advocate any standard model of government or economic structure. The only model is to work with what you have within the context of a country’s culture and resources  prudently and for the benefit of the people. Policies have to be judged by their outcomes  not according to ideological content. Both consistent attention and responsive implementation are necessary to achieve long-term goals. We will put those ideas forward during the discussion.Since the urban centres of small States tend to have disproportionately large social  political and economic weight in the country  a dysfunctional urban centre can have a much greater negative effect on a small country than on a big one. Today  slightly more than half of the world’s population live in cities. By 2050  that will go up to 70 per cent. Most of that growth will take place in Africa  Asia and Latin America. As noted on page 17 of the report of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda  cities are where the battle for sustainable development will be won or lost. Mismanaged urbanization can intensify inequalities. Asia is already home to 61 per cent of the world’s slum dwellers  and Africa is home to about 26 per cent. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has predicted that by 2030  2 billion people could live in urban poverty. They will be at risk from overcrowding  epidemics  crime and pollution.Yet  urbanization has in fact been significant in the progress towards achievement of the MDGs  especially in reducing poverty. Successful cities bring up their rural hinterlands. Today  cities account for over 80 per cent of global gross domestic product. The outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (resolution 66/288  annex) itself recognizes that well-planned cities promote economically  socially and environmentally sustainable societies. They are engines for growth and are more resource-efficient than rural societies.The challenge is therefore really to manage urbanization well. Singapore has been contributing to the discussions on sustainable urbanization as co-chair of the Group of Friends on Sustainable Cities. Singapore’s Centre for Liveable Cities was established in 2008 to distil  create and share knowledge on sustainable cities. It has developed a Liveability Framework as a tool to analyse what a sustainable city would actually entail and help countries define the policies they need to achieve that goal. To us  a sustainable city means having a competitive economy  environmental sustainability and a high quality of life for all inhabitants  rich and poor alike. We hope that the Liveability Framework can be incorporated as part of discussions for the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development — Habitat III — in 2016.In the area of water and sanitation  last year Singapore submitted resolution 67/291 to the General Assembly to designate 19 November as World Toilet Day in the context of Sanitation for All. This year  we will observe that Day together with relevant United Nations agencies and civil society organizations by focusing on the serious problems faced by women and girls who lack basic sanitation access. That issue needs greater attention than it has received so far.What is the way forward? Once the post-2015 development agenda has been agreed  countries will need to consider implementation. South-South  North-South and triangular cooperation in capacity-building and sharing experiences are important parts of the way forward. In our early years  Singapore benefited from the expert advice of specialized agencies  international organizations and developed countries. In 1992  we set up the Singapore Cooperation Programme to share our development experience  the successes and the failures alike  with other developing countries. The Programme is designed to build capacity in fields that could be of interest to countries  in the hope that that will smooth their developmental path. Recently  at the third Small Island Developing States Conference in Samoa  Singapore launched a dedicated package for SIDS.Singapore supports the universal and inclusive approach to the post-2015 development agenda. Each society must draw its own lessons from its own experiences and find solutions according to its national circumstances. Naturally  there will be differences of opinion  but we must not lose sight of the ultimate goal of ending extreme poverty in our lifetimes. With the MDGs  we managed to halve the number of people living below the poverty line  and there is real hope that we can do even better.Let us all work together to ensure that by the seventieth anniversary of the inception of the United Nations  in 2015  we can unite around a clear vision of how to provide our future generations the future we want."
"152",6232,"SLB",69,2014,"On behalf of the Government and people of Solomon Islands  I extend warm congratulations to you  Sir  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uganda  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. My delegation reaffirms the core function of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative body on all global issues. We look forward to working with you in “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  which is the theme that you have chosen for this session.My delegation pays tribute to your predecessor  Mr. John Ashe  who has done a sterling job in setting the stage for a post-2015 development agenda. Under his watch  he convened four high-level events and two thematic debates in shaping the new development paradigm. President Ashe also guided the work of the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable Development Goals in developing universal sustainable development goals (SDGs). Today  we have 17 carefully crafted and delicately balanced SDGs  accompanied by 169 targets. A means of implementation is attached to each goal  which  if honoured  will trigger a seismic shift in the way that we do business.We look forward to the Secretary-General’s post-2015 synthesis report later this year. That report will provide a structure for our post-2015 negotiations. My delegation is mindful of the fact that the outcome of the third International Conference on Financing for Development  scheduled for mid-2015  will feed into the negotiation process. Solomon Islands commits itself to ensuring that our people own and buy into the post-2015 development agenda.The Solomon Islands’ scorecard on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) remains mixed across all eight Goals. We are on track for achieving some of them  off track for others and in the process for three Goals. However  we remain committed to consolidating our MDG gains and are beginning to build the foundation for integrating a new development agenda nationally at all levels.If sustainable development is to grow roots in any country  it needs to be nurtured in a politically stable environment. The Solomon Islands National Parliament passed the Political Party Integrity Bill in May. The act allows political parties to develop and to operate in a regulated and systematic manner  thereby instilling a predictable and stable political atmosphere  which is an essential condition for development.I am pleased to inform the Assembly that  under the leadership of the Prime Minister  the Honourable Gordon Darcy Lilo  the ninth Solomon Islands Parliament concluded its four-year term early this month. As the people anxiously look forward to exercising their right to vote in the forthcoming national general election  we will do so using the biometric voter system for the first time. As a young democratic State  we are constantly improving our governance system and correcting past election irregularities. We could not have achieved that without international support and partnership. To our partners  I convey once again the deep appreciation and gratitude of Solomon Islands.Solomon Islands would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate both Fiji and New Zealand on their newly elected Governments and Parliaments. We stand ready to strengthen our bilateral relations with our two neighbours and to address issues of mutual concern. We also convey our best wishes to the Kingdom of Tonga for its November national general elections.Solomon Islands has continued to serve on the Executive Board of UN-Women. Gender-based violence is a major economic leakage in any country’s development. It reduces women’s productivity in all three dimensions of sustainable development. Gender-based violence also imposes a cost on the wider society. Last month  the Solomon Islands National Parliament met its international obligation under the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and adopted family protection legislation. The act protects families from domestic violence  deals with perpetrators and provides practical support to victims of violence. The legislation has received strong national visibility and promotes gender equality. Solomon Islands wishes to acknowledge UN-Women’s Markets for Change project in the country. The project aims to improve market governance and on-site services for women. It recognizes and addresses our rural women’s challenges and will  hopefully  encourage more women to engage in economic activities.The year 2015 marks the twentieth anniversary of the Platform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on Women. Solomon Islands conducted a national review on its implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and has identified three areas of achievements: recognition of gender equality  the economic empowerment of women and awareness of gender-based violence. We believe in the notion that progress for women is progress for all. We remain committed to implementing the Platform for Action.The third International Conference on Small Islands Developing States (SIDS)  convened in Samoa  reaffirmed SIDS as a special case for sustainable development given their unique and particular vulnerability. The once-in-a-decade Conference adopted the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway  which outlines 19 priority areas. The outcome document (A/CONF.223/3  annex) calls for a comprehensive review of United Nations support to SIDS.In that connection  Solomon Islands seeks closer relations with the United Nations. We would like to see the United Nations Development Programme Subregional Office in Solomon Islands upgraded to the status of country office. After more than three decades of the United Nations managing Solomon Islands relations from abroad  it is time to invest in such relations in my capital.With regard to a related matter  Solomon Islands continues to be underrepresented in the composition of United Nations staff. However  we are grateful for and welcome the United Nations annual recruitment drive in Solomon Islands and hope to fill our employment quota soon  with Solomon islanders joining the diverse United Nations staff.Health remains a precondition for sustainable development. Solomon Islands has continued to demonstrate its commitment to improving the health of its people. In July  the first 20 Solomon Islands doctors graduated from medical schools in Cuba. Solomon Islands would like to thank Cuba for the scholarships awarded to the doctors  as well as to the remaining 80 Solomon Islands medical students. This year alone  we will witness more than 30 new doctors joining our health services. It is the vision of the Government to double the number of doctors in the country in the next two years  to continue to strengthen our health-care infrastructure  putting in place health and social protection systems  and to work towards making health-care coverage in Solomon Islands universal.Solomon Islands joins the international community in calling for the lifting of the economic and financial blockade imposed on Cuba by our friend and partner  the United States of America. After more than five decades of sanctions on Cuba  it is time to reset relations between the two neighbours on the basis of good-neighbourly relations and respect for territorial integrity and political sovereignty.One of the principles of the SDGs is that we must not leave anyone behind. There are States knocking at the door of the United Nations  ready to take on multilateral responsibilities. The Republic of China on Taiwan continues to seek full and effective participation with three United Nations specialized bodies  namely  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).Those United Nations bodies deal with urgent global issues in which we all have an interest — from climate change to the evolving health challenges. ICAO works to keep our travelling public and air services safe. I wish to note that 45 million passengers passed through the Republic of China  Taiwan  in 2012. We do not have the luxury of time to turn a blind eye to the required cooperation. The global challenges before us are too great for narrow interests to adopt a wait-and-see approach and to keep postponing action that is needed.The Republic of China  Taiwan  is a country that has transformed itself from a developing country into an industrialized one. It is the twenty-seventh-largest economy in the world and has experience  technology and capability from which our shared agenda can benefit. We have all to gain and nothing to lose by inviting the Republic of China  Taiwan  to become the 195th member of the UNFCCC  the 192nd member of ICAO and the 195th member of the WHO.The Solomon Islands partnership with the Pacific Islands Forum  under the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands  continues to create positive conditions  allowing the country to begin a limited rearmament of its police force. The private sector and the international community have responded to the changing environment  with the European Union upgrading its representation in my capital  Honiara  and more and more non-traditional partners accrediting their envoys to Solomon Islands. A new commercial bank was incorporated and entered the Solomon Islands market  making it the fourth commercial bank to provide financial services to our vibrant population.Sustainable development for Solomon Islands  as a coastal State  includes its seabed resources beyond its 1.3-million-square-kilometre exclusive economic zone. The Solomon Islands has registered a number of continental shelf claims with the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS). My delegation is pleased to see that one of the claims is now being examined by the Subcommission of the CLCS. We look forward to further engagement with the Subcommission during the course of this session.The world is facing a series of crisis and conflicts in Africa  the Middle East and now in Europe. In dealing with conflicts  we must exert greater effort in seeking the peaceful settlement of disputes. We must collectively counter extremism  terrorism and crimes against humanity  and protect civilians  operating within the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.As the principal organ of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security  the Security Council must be part of that solution. Despite the call of world leaders for the speedy reform of the Security Council in 2005  nine years on we are still working at it. At the tenth intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform in July  there was overwhelming support for the expansion of Security Council membership and for making the Council more representative and accountable in terms of improving its working methods. An advisory group mandated by your predecessor  Mr. President  produced a non-paper. It provided structure to the last session’s discussions and can be used as a basis for negotiations during this session. We look to you for leadership on that.Turning now to the recent outbreak of Ebola  the gravity  scale and spread of the Ebola virus in West Africa is unprecedented and demands urgent international cooperation. The Ebola disease has halted services and disrupted the lives of many people in the affected countries. The Solomon Islands supports our Secretary-General’s action to establish the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response  and acknowledges global efforts in mobilization of resources to combat the disease as a matter of urgency.As stated by other delegations  decolonization remains an unfinished business of the United Nations. If we are to deliver on the Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism  we will need the cooperation of all parties — including the administering Powers  the Non-Self-Governing Territories  and regional and subregional organizations — to honour their commitments under the Charter of the United Nations and the 1960 Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.The Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG)  made up of Fiji  Papua New Guinea  Vanuatu  Solomon Islands and the Front de libération nationale kanak socialiste  continues to follow the question of New Caledonia in the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization (Committee of 24). The Group welcomed the Committee’s visit to New Caledonia in March  and noted its concerns relating to the Territory’s electoral process and needed legislation in keeping within the spirit of the Nouméa Accord. Those issues have implications in preparing for a credible referendum process  consistent and in conformity with the universally accepted principles and practices of self-determination  as defined by resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions of the Assembly.My delegation would also like to acknowledge the diligent work of the Committee of 24 in examining the question of French Polynesia. Solomon Islands continues to reaffirm its support for the inalienable rights of the people of French Polynesia to self-determination  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. It is our hope that the Decolonization Committee will soon visit the Non-Self-Governing Territory  in cooperation with the administering Power.Solomon Islands  as a member of the MSG  is working in collaboration with Indonesia on human rights concerns in Papua and West Papua  the two easternmost provinces of the Republic of Indonesia. On 21 May  Solomon Islands established its Embassy in Jakarta with the genuine intention of continuing to cooperate with Indonesia on many important issues of mutual concern  including those taken up together by MSG members.Solomon Islands welcomes the World Conference on Indigenous People. More than 90 per cent of our population are indigenous Melanesians and Polynesians speaking more than 87 different languages. Our diverse cultures are under threat due to forced relocation from ancestral lands as a result of sea-level rise. Their right to live in harmony with nature is being threatened by the declining health of the planet.Climate change remains the greatest challenge of our time. It calls for the widest possible international cooperation on the part of all. This month  Solomon Islands ratified the second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We encourage parties to the Protocol that have not ratified the amendment to do so as soon as possible. It is in our collective interest to see the Protocol enforced. We remain deeply concerned on the slow progress of climate-change negotiations  and hope that the General Assembly will invite the UNFCCC to conduct its negotiations in New York  where diplomats from all parties to the Convention are located all year round. We need to accelerate the pace of negotiations. This must be done while working with our technical experts in the process.In looking at the 2015 Climate Change agreement  Solomon Islands would like to see a credible agreement that will guarantee the survival of the SIDS and the least developed countries (LDCs). The agreement must be comprehensive in scope  addressing mitigation  adaptation  finance and technology transfer. It must be inclusive  and respect and respond to the special needs of SIDS and LDCs. The agreement must be flexible enough to respond to the changing science and be adequately resourced.Climate-change risk remains at the forefront of our sustainable development path. The flash floods of great magnitude and intensity that occurred in Solomon Islands in April claimed lives and destroyed homes and infrastructure. Damages and losses are equivalent to 9.2 per cent of Solomon Islands’ gross domestic product. This has created pressure in the form of new expenses  prompting the Government to borrow and secure grants externally. Solomon Islands remains grateful to its neighbours — Australia  New Zealand  Nauru  Tuvalu  Samoa and Papua New Guinea — as well as Turkey  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  Botswana  Sri Lanka and the Republic of China on Taiwan  among others  that have supported our national rehabilitation and recovery efforts.Despite the disaster challenges  Solomon Islands remains determined to build a resilient society. We are on track in building two hydro-projects in two provinces  in partnership with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. In partnership with Japan  we are expanding our port facilities to promote and enable domestic  regional and international trade. I am pleased to say that  since the sixty-eighth session  a number of domestic airports and 18 bridges have been constructed  further uniting our scattered population. This would not have been possible without the support of Australia  New Zealand and the European Union  and we express our gratitude to our traditional partners.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirms that  without additional mitigation actions  we are heading towards a 3.7-4.8°C world. The fifth IPCC assessment report indicates that by 2030  89 per cent of coral reefs are projected to experience severe coral bleaching  with the temperature increasing by 1.5°C. By 2050  at 2°C we are looking at 100 per cent coral reef bleaching. These developments will occur in our generation and will have an impact on tourism industries and fish stocks  potentially driving households in the SIDS and LDCs into poverty traps.We call on the international community to respect the principles of fairness and justice and to put SIDS and LDCs at the heart of international cooperation. In that connection  my delegation welcomes the Secretary-General’s Climate Summit  held last week. We also support your proposal  Mr. President  of convening a high-level debate on climate change during the course of this session. We do so because our lives depend on it.Let me conclude by reaffirming the commitment of the Solomon Islands to striving for a just  equitable and inclusive world. Implementing the post-2015 development agenda provides us with our first and last line of defence in guaranteeing a sustainable future for our current and future generations."
"153",6278,"SLE",69,2014,"I bring to the Assembly fraternal greetings and best wishes from Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma  President of the Republic of Sierra Leone  and his beleaguered people. President Koroma deeply regrets that  for obvious reasons  he is unable to participate in the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly. He has  however  instructed me to deliver to the Assembly this message from him:“I congratulate the President on being elected to conduct the affairs of the sixty-ninth session of the Assembly and assure him of the support and cooperation of my country  Sierra Leone  during his tenure. To his predecessor  Ambassador John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda  let me  on behalf of my Government and people  express our appreciation for his astute leadership and skill in smoothly directing the work of the past session of the General Assembly.“My sincere thanks and appreciation go to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his constructive and dynamic leadership of the Organization. Sierra Leone deeply appreciates his forward-looking and laudable initiatives on the issues of sustainable energy and climate change  among others. In particular  I appreciate his robust response to the Ebola epidemic that is causing so much havoc in our lives and threatening our dignity and our very existence. We will continue to support those highly ambitious and commendable initiatives for a better and safer world.“Sierra Leone commends the President on the choice  appropriateness and sense of urgency of the theme of the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly  and we join him in calling for a structured dialogue  strengthened global partnership and enhanced cooperation for its achievement. Sierra Leone wishes to reiterate the need to generate the required global political will to address unfinished business in the context of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by focusing on implementation gaps and new and emerging challenges. As Chair of the small Group of Seven Plus States  Sierra Leone reaffirms the call of this group of fragile and post-conflict States for the support of goal 16 of the outcome document of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. Goal 16 is one of 17 priorities of the post-2015 development agenda and envisages promoting peaceful and inclusive institutions as a stand-alone aim.“My country is battling one of the biggest life-or-death challenges facing the global community. As I stated in my address to the Secretary-General’s high-level meeting on response to the Ebola virus disease outbreak  Ebola is unlike previous threats  not because something similar has never occurred before  but because the Ebola outbreak has mutated into a phenomenon for which my country  my region and the global community were grossly ill-prepared. Isolated communities are becoming less frequent in our globalized world. Mutating viral diseases like Ebola can no longer be neatly isolated simply by sealing off a country in a corner of the world. The Ebola outbreak in our region provides the first challenge to infrastructure  human capital and public health and surveillance systems that are too weak to deal with the faster occurrences of animal-to-human  and human-to-human transmissions of highly contagious diseases that have been made possible by quicker transportation  increasing urbanization and dense networks of people moving between rural and urban areas and across borders.“We have been slow to meet this new challenge because no one recognized that this confluence of trends could emerge with such virulence in West Africa. Our international partners were slow to recognize the threat for what it was  and when recognition did come  it was accompanied by a spontaneous reaction of fear and panic that led to the closure of borders and the imposition of travel restrictions to and from Sierra Leone and our subregion.“This is the very first time Ebola has come to our region and to my country  Sierra Leone. We did not bring it on ourselves. We are rebuilding our infrastructure  implementing policies that were increasing our growth rates  improving our health-care and literacy indicators  enhancing our peace  and strengthening our democracy. We are contributing troops to the United Nations peacekeeping operations in other lands  as our share of the peace dividend. The world was lauding us for doing so many things right  for being a symbol of fast-paced recovery from a decade-long devastating civil conflict  for promoting and protecting human rights  and for advancing along an impressive path of socioeconomic reconstruction. We were gearing up our health-care system to fight the known ailments of our land  such as malaria  maternal and infant mortality  Lassa fever  tuberculosis and typhoid  when Ebola struck. Based on the knowledge we had  based on the advice we were given by our international partners  we mobilized to meet this unfamiliar threat. But the staff  equipment  medicines and systems we had were inadequate  and this slowed our effective response.“Several months down the road  the international community has finally come around to the view that the Ebola outbreak is a challenge for everyone  and that  while Sierra Leone and its sister republics are at the front line of this fight  the heavy aerial and ground support of the world are required to defeat the outbreak  for Ebola is in many ways worse than terrorism. As a country  we have taken extraordinary measures  including declaring a state of emergency and shutting down the country for three days to get health educators into every household in the country. Today  most of our people know that Ebola may present with the same signs as malaria  typhoid  diarrhoea and other infectious diseases  but that it is far more deadly  and that there is a need to modify behaviour in order to counter its transmission.“Socioeconomic disruptions are already being felt. We are no longer able to engage in our cultural practices  such as shaking hands when we gladly receive each other  or hold religious and communal burial ceremonies. Our people live in fear and cannot understand the nature of a disease that claims lives and prevents family members from burying their loved ones.“The indeterminate suspension of several ongoing development projects  and the disruption to farming  mining  manufacturing  construction  tourism  trading and public transportation  following the outbreak of Ebola  are now undermining the growth and human development prospects of the country. The International Monetary Fund has estimated that our gross domestic product will drop by 3.3 per cent in 2014 from 11.3 per cent to 8 per cent. Ebola has placed a stranglehold on the socioeconomic prospects of the country  and  in addition  we risk reversing the hard gains achieved in peacebuilding.“We salute the great efforts of countries  as well as international and national organizations  that have committed resources to our common fight. We welcome the adoption of the landmark Security Council resolution 2177 (2014) and its General Assembly counterpart  resolution 69/1  both of which recognize the Ebola outbreak as a threat to international peace and security. We also salute the Secretary-General for his initiative in establishing the first-ever United Nations emergency health mission  the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response  to lead a concerted and coordinated effort to contain and defeat this scourge within the subregion.“We know that to defeat the disease and prevent future outbreaks anywhere in the world  we must improve our capacities for quicker response. In Sierra Leone  this calls for faster deployment of staff  medicines and equipment at the global and national levels. Globally  a faster response means quickening the pace of resource mobilization and disbursements  as well as the development of vaccines and curative medicines. Nationally  our effort must rapidly translate into effective urban and rural community response initiatives. Any break in this chain of fast response makes the challenge more difficult to meet  and not meeting the challenge means more deaths in our country and the increased possibility that the virus will mutate and spread to areas from which it is currently absent.“The world needs a faster global response infrastructure to deal with this new trend that is today manifesting itself in the West African nations of Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone  but to which no country can be immune. Ebola is winning the race against us. To make an impactful start in reversing this trend  we must have more treatment beds than there are Ebola cases. Only when the number of available beds surpasses the number of cases can we say that Ebola has been brought under control. This is a fight for all of us. We must prove that humankind is equal to overcoming this new challenge to our collective existence.“We also believe that it is high time for this Assembly to make its voice heard regarding the flight bans and cancellations that have accompanied the deadly Ebola outbreak. The World Health Organization and many others have advised against imposing blanket flight bans. We therefore urge Member States to re-examine their policies of isolating and stigmatizing Ebola-affected countries and their respective citizens. The world is too globalized for policies that shun engagement with a democratic nation. The United Nations was founded on a mandate to confront human insecurity  not shun it. Moreover  this Organization was founded on the principle of doing better than before. We strongly urge loyalty to the founding ideals of our global Organization.“Despite the daunting challenge facing us as a nation and subregion  Sierra Leone will remain a trusted and strategic partner in the global effort to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable peace  stability and development. My Government is committed to forging closer bonds with all countries  especially within the context of the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States.“As Coordinator of the African Union Committee of Ten Heads of State on the Reform of the United Nations  we will continue to advance the African Common Position on the reform process of the United Nations by reaching out and engaging with other interest groups in a bid to reach a common understanding of how to obtain a strong  inclusive  united  transparent and accountable Security Council. While the world now acknowledges the historical injustice represented by the fact that Africa is the only continent not represented in the permanent category of Council membership and  at the same time  is underrepresented in the non-permanent category  it is about time for this Organization to take the necessary bold steps to put into practice our reaffirmation of the equal rights of nations  large and small. Indeed  as we gear up to celebrate 70 memorable years of the existence of the United Nations  it is an appropriate time for the Organization to promote the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members and to ensure for all the rights and benefits resulting from membership.“We are encouraged by the progress made in strengthening peace and democracy within member countries of the Mano River Union  and we shall continue to support initiatives for the sustenance and growth of democratic order  peace and security in the subregion. We will continue to adhere to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) protocols for peace  democracy and stability and will sustain our support for the building of the ECOWAS logistical depot in Sierra Leone. We firmly support the African Union rapid intervention initiative for peacekeeping and peace-support operations. We have also ratified the Arms Trade Treaty and the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto. We are currently working to incorporate them into our domestic law.“My Government will continue to contribute troops and support international peacekeeping operations for international peace and security  and we will accordingly seek capacity-building and other support in such laudable ventures. We are  however  dismayed by the current trend of events in South Sudan  the Central African Republic  the Gaza Strip  Syria  Ukraine  Iraq and other parts of the world that are still in conflict. We will commit Sierra Leone to the global search for common agreement on the root causes of those conflicts and encourage dialogue to work out resolutions that are peaceful and sustainable. We support the two independent States solution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.“Sierra Leone condemns any act of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations in the world in general and in Africa in particular. Terrorism is a common enemy to international peace and security. Sierra Leone prides itself on its high level of religious tolerance  and we believe that people of all religions and ethnic backgrounds must be able to coexist in peace and harmony everywhere in the world. We likewise view acts of drug trafficking  human trafficking  smuggling of migrants  marine piracy  cybercrime  abductions and all other organized or unorganized transnational criminal activities as serious threats to global peace  stability and development. My Government will strengthen national capacities and contribute through international cooperation to preventing and combating those crimes.“As a post-conflict country  we are aware that sexual violence in conflict is one of the greatest and most persistent injustices in the world today. We are therefore supportive of the United Kingdom’s Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative and the subsequent Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict. We support the work of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. We also fully support the United Kingdom Government’s leadership in promoting global advocacy against the use of children in armed conflicts.“We are following the unfolding developments at the International Criminal Court and are supportive of the efforts to ensure judicial accountability in ways that are respectful of Africa’s concerns for the ability of its statesmen and stateswomen to steer the countries of the continent towards greater security  reconciliation  peace and development.“My Government will continue to support the work of the Human Rights Council. We are committed to the moratorium on the death penalty and have gone a step further in the process of commuting capital offences to life imprisonment in our statute books.“In conclusion  while applauding the international community for supporting our aspirations  we wish to remind the world that fighting the Ebola virus disease in West Africa is a matter of life and death for the whole of humankind. The World Health Organization finally got it right when it declared the outbreak as a global health emergency  but an emergency requires a response faster than what is currently obtaining. We can defeat Ebola and  as already noted by experts  future outbreaks of diseases of that nature anywhere in the world can also be defeated by quickening the pace of response. Our understanding of that unprecedented outbreak is better now than at the beginning  and our response has improved accordingly. While our capacities are getting better coordinated  there is still room for strengthening those capacities to ensure effective national ownership and leadership of all response mechanisms. Undoubtedly  we can do better than what obtained at the beginning of the outbreak  and we must do all we can to end such a grave threat to our collective survival. We will also continue our engagement with all stakeholders to build our public health system beyond Ebola.“On the occasion of the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly  let me reiterate our deepest condolences to the families and relatives of all our brave men  women and children who have lost their lives to the Ebola virus disease. May the Father most high receive their souls and the souls of all faithful departed into his merciful hands.”"
"154",6325,"SLV",69,2014,"I am proud to represent a small but great nation  El Salvador  before the Assembly. Our history has been full of painful moments  but also times of hope and courage. For years  we struggled to achieve democracy. We marked a historic global milestone when we became the first country in the region to end a painful civil war through dialogue and reconciliation in order to begin to build a democratic country.Like most developing countries  we face the familiar challenges of reducing poverty and social inequalities and building the conditions needed for families to have healthier and safer lives. Experience has shown us that it is only through solidarity  respect  inclusion and equity that we can overcome those challenges. In recent years  we have made significant strides in human development. In rural areas  we have reduced extreme poverty to 13.6 per cent; we have allocated 14.8 per cent of our gross domestic product to social spending; and we have raised primary education coverage to 93.7 per cent and reduced illiteracy by a little over 5 percentage points. We have achieved an important reduction in maternal mortality  and we have improved sanitation services and access to drinking water for the population.We have witnessed significant changes  and just as we did 14 years ago at the Millennium Summit  we are working on the parameters that will lead us to a more just and equitable world. However  our debt to humankind remains. We continue working to create factors that can enhance our human development and provide stronger social protection  which will allow us to ensure universal access to basic social services on a sustainable basis.We are one year away from the most important world summit in our history  where we will evaluate the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  in particular the goals that have been achieved  and where we will define the new post-2015 development agenda  based on a new comprehensive  transformative and inclusive development paradigm. We believe in a vision for development that meets the needs of our peoples  in which all human beings have a full and dignified life  living in democracy and enjoying the right to sovereignty and determination and the right to choose our path towards peace and development. The new agenda must integrate universal issues  such as migration  climate change  food security  education  health  public safety and world peace. We must not keep repeating the errors of the past. Based on the experience of the MDGs  we must reduce the inequality gaps and the structural causes of poverty and exclusion.The new global agenda requires us to come to an agreement on how to face the great threat of climate change  which afflicts us with hardships and limits the opportunities for families to live with dignity. The next few months are key for the establishment of a road map to implement the parameters of the new development paradigm. We must work together  using an approach based on shared but differentiated responsibilities.It is urgent to amend the existing financial architecture and international cooperation mechanisms so that they meet the needs of our peoples with effective institutions and transparent mechanisms. We must renew the terms under which development assistance is granted  review its amounts and ensure the implementation of procedures that facilitate the principles of sustainable development. The new development indicators should make exclusion and inequality visible. To that end  measurements must focus on whether needs are met and opportunities provided. The objectives and goals should address personal fulfilment and our right to the pursuit of happiness as much as the economic growth of countries.I call upon the United Nations to maintain its resources and programmes in Latin America  and in particular in Central America  regardless of the macroeconomic classification of our countries. To reduce the United Nations presence would only exacerbate the serious economic and social inequality problems suffered by the region.Financing for development is vital for the implementation of the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda. I reaffirm the resolution adopted by the Council of Ministers of the Central American Integration System (SICA)  which stresses that financing for development should be based on the priorities of the countries concerned  making use of innovative financing mechanisms. We must explore new sources  such as the resources found in offshore areas  a global asset to which only a handful of countries now have access. El Salvador expresses its commitment to the new global alliance for development  based on the Monterrey Consensus  the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development and the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (resolution 66/288  annex).Much work still lies ahead. However  countries will not be able to accomplish that work unilaterally  but should rather take action within the framework of the United Nations. We must also unite to advance the reform process of the United Nations  especially since we need a strengthened and renewed Organization. We need a General Assembly  the main forum for global debate  with an agenda focused on the most pressing issues of the international community  and a Security Council open to increased representation and participation by all Member States. We call for the strong support and political will of all Member States  so that we can have an Organization that can provide timely support in the face of the new challenges posed by history. In the context of those global challenges  our Government reaffirms its call for a comprehensive and inclusive development agenda for social peace  capacity-building and consensus-building across sectors.In recent years  my country has launched a transformation process that focuses on sustainable development  the fight against poverty and the reduction of inequality  exclusion and social injustice  and that promotes an equality agenda with a focus on gender and human rights. In our country  the Universal Social Protection System Law is an invaluable tool that integrates for the first time a network of social policies and strategies that provides basic services to people  is focused on the most vulnerable population groups and is designed to address the main challenges we face.El Salvador makes every effort to improve the quality of life of the population and to build the conditions that will help us to strengthen family unity  values and create opportunities for new generations and raise awareness about the risks of irregular migration  especially to the United States. I call upon the international community to support us in overcoming the situation generated by the increased flow of unaccompanied migrant children travelling to the United States. The United Nations system  including the General Assembly  must play a greater role in addressing the migration issue and recognize that human mobility is a relevant factor in the Organization’s work and include it in the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda.As we address that phenomenon  which has many causes  we are convinced that we must act with a comprehensive approach that provides protection for the rights of our children  ensures respect for the due process of law and provides support for the reunification of children with their parents. We must work with the communities of origin of the migrant population to create better conditions and increase the investment in education  health  safety and jobs — all from a perspective of joint responsibility among the countries of origin  transit and destination.Threats to public safety represent another major challenge faced by our country and others in the region and throughout the world. We will not rest until we ensure the necessary conditions for Salvadorans to live safely and in peace. The various sectors of our society are responding to the call of our Government  and we hope that the international community will strengthen its support for the titanic struggle that El Salvador and Central America are waging against violence in all its different forms.We observe with concern the many conflicts and threats to international peace and security. We deeply regret the loss of lives  particularly of children  as a result of the indiscriminate attacks in Gaza. We welcome the peace plan presented by Egypt  and we urge the parties involved to endeavour to ensure a firm and lasting peace that achieves the coexistence of two States  Israel and Palestine  within secure borders.We are concerned about the recent attacks and human rights violations committed by the self-proclaimed Islamic State against the defenceless civilian population. We call on the international community to close ranks in United Nations bodies so as to put an end to those brutal acts. Only the coordinated action of our multilateral system can achieve the results to which we all aspire.We will always be committed to peace. All citizens of the world must become peacemakers  as Saint John Paul II himself said during one of his visits to El Salvador. El Salvador  as a beneficiary of United Nations support during our historic peace process  cannot fail to strengthen its commitment to support peacekeeping operations around the world. As a country  we are providing support through our prompt contribution to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali  and we are standing with the Haitian people in their recovery process  as part of a joint effort of the United Nations system  which cannot be neglected.I wish to stress that human rights is one of the priority working areas of our foreign policy. In that context  El Salvador has presented its candidacy to the Human Rights Council  which will hold elections at this session of the General Assembly. Our candidacy represents an opportunity for us to continue to fulfil our international commitments and to demonstrate the importance of living under the rule of law in harmony with our environment.In our efforts in pursuit of peace and inclusive and equitable development  there is no place for contempt for fundamental principles and freedoms. I refer here to the economic  trade and financial blockade against the sister Republic of Cuba  which  in spite of that unilateral action against its people  has overcome the obstacles and adversity imposed on it with exemplary perseverance and determination. Consequently  El Salvador calls for an end to the blockade. We believe that the inclusion of Cuba in the list of States sponsors of international terrorism is unfounded. Cuba must be removed from that mechanism  whose sole purpose is to justify the blockade.I want to highlight the contribution to multilateralism made by the countries of Central and Latin America and their regional organizations. Let me mention in particular the Central American Integration System  where we have be able to set out a multidimensional regional agenda that guides our regional work through five main pillars: economic integration  social integration and the fight against poverty  comprehensive disaster management and the adaptation to climate change  institutional strengthening and democratic security.The Central and Latin American region needs international support for the Central American Security Strategy  which will allow our Governments to complement national efforts and have a greater impact on regional security. I reiterate the call for the international community to give its full support to the Strategy. The activities of regional bodies  such as SICA and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  are fundamental and are aimed at strengthening solidarity and cooperation among all peoples of the world.As I have stated  we are witnessing an unprecedented process of change in the world  which brings with it both opportunities and challenges. If we are to succeed  we must unite and integrate our peoples and Governments in a global community — committed to the values of democracy  peace  equality  progress and development. I conclude by stating that  within our modest possibilities  we are ready to meet that challenge."
"155",6350,"SMR",69,2014,"On behalf of the Government of the Republic of San Marino  I would like to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session  and to wish you every success in your work. The delegation of the Republic of San Marino assures you  Sir  of its full cooperation throughout the session. I would also like to express my country’s gratitude to the outgoing President of the General Assembly  Mr. John Ashe  for his work during the sixty-eighth session. My country also wishes to extend special thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the energy and determination with which he leads the United Nations and for his sensitivity towards all Member States  without exception.In particular  I would like to underscore the importance of the climate change Summit organized by the Secretary-General in New York on 23 September. It provided the Heads of State and Government with the opportunity to demonstrate their political will for a global agreement on that issue. The Republic of San Marino contributed to the work through the participation of its Head of State  thereby underscoring the importance and acknowledging the indissoluble link between climate change and sustainable development. The effects of climate change  which are often tragic  are one of the most serious threats to the future of humankind and a challenge that all States  in the context of a joint action coordinated by the United Nations  are called on to face with commitment and determination. We are accountable to future generations for our ability to achieve the goals of environmental protection  energy saving and energy generation from renewable sources.Climate change is one of the causes of many natural disasters that have befallen our planet  including this year. We need to respond effectively to the many very serious humanitarian emergencies  which show the clear interdependence of the global threats now facing humankind. Today  a strong  rapid and coordinated response at the international level is necessary to deal with the very serious outbreak of Ebola that has developed in some West African States and has become a global threat. The most affected countries must not be left alone or isolated. On the contrary  they must be supported and helped. San Marino was among the sponsors of resolution 2177 (2014)  recently adopted by the Security Council  which underscores the need for an immediate mobilization of the international community.We are deeply moved by the problems at the international level  and  in the light of the theme of this session  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  we recognize the need for a renewed commitment to freeing the world from extreme poverty  inequality and hunger. However  we are aware that the full achievement of such goals is seriously compromised when peace and security  on the basis of respect for the equal dignity of all human beings  are not ensured. This year  we have sadly witnessed too many incidents that represent a serious threat to peace  security and respect for human rights. It is therefore impossible not to share the widespread perception of a weakening of the United Nations capacity to intervene and the subsequent questioning of United Nations-led missions.Let us consider the following events. Since March 2011  the conflict in Syria has already caused more than 200 000 deaths and injured hundreds of thousands. It has forced millions of people to flee their homes and their countries to escape a war that shows infinite forms of cruelty and ferocity. The Republic of San Marino has strongly condemned and continues to condemn the violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law committed in Syria by all parties to the conflict  without exception. The recent resurgence of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has of late claimed the lives of more than 1 000 civilians  among whom were many women and children  for the most part Palestinian  including those who had sought refuge in United Nations schools. The San Marino Government and Parliament have appealed to both sides to let their guns fall silent and the desire for dialogue prevail  aware that dialogue is the only way to achieve a peaceful coexistence of the two peoples.The situation is very serious in Iraq  where ongoing ethnic and religious cleansing is taking place with unprecedented violence. In the name of religion  systematic and massive human rights violations  only partially documented and evidenced  are being perpetrated. Such violations constitute massive crimes against humanity. A coalition of States is undertaking a joint response. San Marino hopes that the interventions are coordinated under the auspices of the United Nations. In particular  it greeted with satisfaction and co-sponsored resolution 2178 (2014) on foreign terrorist fighters  unanimously adopted by the Security Council on 24 September  under the leadership of the United States President  Barack Obama.The war that is being fought in some parts of North Africa is causing the migration of thousands of desperate people leaving for Europe every day in the hope of arriving safely — a migration that  unfortunately  often turns into tragedy. The Mediterranean continues to witness the deaths of migrants from many areas of Africa and Asia. The information provided by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is evidence — as if evidence were necessary — not only of the utter tragedy of the situation but also of the need for a more united European action to address it.In addition  this year has seen the crisis in Ukraine  which is a serious threat to the peace and security of the entire European continent  owing to both the large number of victims and also the fact that fundamental principles  such as the territorial sovereignty and self-determination of peoples  are called into question.These events demand the presence of the United Nations and call for the entire international community to assume its responsibility and to restore the Organization’s capacity to intervene in order to protect the citizens of the entire world through the peaceful resolution of disputes between States  as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in numerous General Assembly resolutions. These events also underscore the need for a reaffirmation of our Organization’s profoundly democratic nature so that each State  large or small  can make its voice heard and contribute to the work and resolutions of the United Nations. These events require that the cultural and religious diversity and the manifold traditions represented within our Organization do not hamper the pursuit of possible solutions. On the contrary  they should be a valuable resource  enabling us to adopt an approach that unites the interests of the entire international community.We recognize the duty and the responsibility to work tirelessly for the definition and the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda. However  given the seriousness of the international situation  a simple appeal will not suffice. On the contrary  precisely because  in many cases  a lack of integration between the economic and the social and environmental aspects has hampered the full achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  as the report notes  we are convinced that we need new momentum and a new beginning in order to restore elements able to promote a culture of life  tolerance  acceptance and solidarity within our communities and populations. The first element of that process  aimed at building a culture of inclusion  is the family. Recognition of the urgency to create such a culture demands of all States a common commitment and renewed consideration to promote the protection and support of the family. Indeed  the family is clearly the place where our main relationships governing human coexistence are developed. For that reason  weakening and marginalizing the family has often caused great existential confusion in younger generations with many serious personal and social consequences.In this spirit and with the utmost determination  each State must assume its responsibility and leave no stone unturned in resolving the numerous conflicts  which Pope Francis has referred to as the third world war  since  if they were to prevail  they would nullify the plan for balanced development in the third millennium  as it should be defined in the United Nations agenda. San Marino is a small State that has in its century-old history always considered freedom and peace as the supreme goods to be preserved and protected. Based on that identity  it is honoured and proud to contribute to the community of the United Nations. With humility we call on all States to make every effort to give the United Nations strength and authority as the central referral body we so keenly need today."
"156",6387,"SOM",69,2014,"It is a pleasure to join the Assembly today. Yesterday a journalist asked me to describe Somalia in 15 seconds. First  let me say that Somalis are great storytellers  so asking a Somali to say anything in 15 seconds is very difficult. I really had to think about where to begin. I told him that if he could think of a problem  then Somalia has it  and often at the same time as other problems — war  piracy  extremist terrorist groups  famine  droughts  floods. But that was the Somalia of yesterday  not the Somalia of today. I fear that many people’s experience of Somalia is confined to films — such as the recent Captain Phillips and re-runs of Black Hawk Down — or YouTube scenes of the horrific Westgate Mall incident in Kenya  or an ever-growing number of titles on library bookshelves that include the words “failed State”  or references to a long war. But if we shrink our perspective to just that glimpse  we miss the beauty of the very different picture that we are painting right now in Somalia. The Somalia I lead as President is a very different country. My Somalia is not a 15-second summary of problems. It is not a Somalia of failure.We may still be fragile  but we are no longer a broken State. September of 2012 marked a milestone for Somalia with the establishment of a new Federal Government built on national consensus and universally recognized by the international community. At its start  the Federal Government of Somalia faced multiple complex challenges  a stark lack of resources and only very basic institutional and Government structures. The country was divided  with no clear path to unification. Al-Shabaab and other militia groups controlled most of our territory. The task ahead of us was daunting and the expectations from both our people and our international partners were very high. Everything was a priority  from security to political inclusivity  and from health care and education to private-sector development and basic economic reform.We faced the significant challenge of having to build frameworks and institutions while simultaneously delivering immediate  tangible benefits for our people  in the form of schools  hospitals  roads and more. We had to deliver on that long list of interrelated priorities while simultaneously dealing with a politically fragmented environment and fighting a war against terrorist groups. And we have succeeded. The foundation for the future has been laid through our clear military defeat of Al-Shabaab  which has been made possible only through the joint efforts of the Somali National Army and the African Union Mission to Somalia. More than 70 per cent of Somalia’s southern and central regions has now been liberated from the scourge of Al-Shabaab and restored to the control of the Federal Government of Somalia.Over the past two years we have focused on building foundations and laying the groundwork for reform. We have developed legal frameworks  governance structures and public financial management reform processes. We have formalized Somalia’s presence in the international community  strengthened our relationships with neighbouring countries  restructured key institutions  established forums for dialogue  developed a path for political reform and put in place the architecture for linking international support to our priorities through the New Deal Somali Compact.We have made major progress in reforming public financial management  putting in place better accountability measures  controls and governance structures. Key legislation has been drafted  budget policy developed and the capacity of the offices of the Accountant General and Auditor General strengthened. An annual budget  developed with the implementation of Government-wide work plans and priorities in mind  has been delivered. A new governor and board of directors have been appointed for the Central Bank of Somalia  which we launched from scratch. A financial governance committee  constituting an advisory body held jointly by the Federal Government and international financial institutions  has been established to provide greater transparency and oversight of financial transactions in Somalia.We can take heart in the fact that distinct progress has been made in moving the country from failed-State status to that of a nascent nation with functioning institutions. Today  in September 2014  I am confidently able to say that  with the support of the Somali people and the engagement of the international community  Somalia has undergone a remarkable transformation. Today we have a country that is beginning to unite as a nation  behind a vision that in 2016 will see a federal and united Somalia  a Somalia that will meet our aspirations for a better future.But we cannot rest there. Somalia has always had an enormous capacity for playing a long game  and now more than ever we must stay our course. Somalia is at a critical juncture in its efforts to achieve security and stability. This past year has seen a rise in terrorist groups and activities around the world. Today  the reach of terrorists is not confined to one country; it is a global issue that requires global action. More than any other fragile State today  Somalia has significantly advanced in its fight against terrorism. We are winning the war  but we must also win the peace. President Obama spoke earlier this week of being at a crossroads of war and peace (see A/69/PV.5). As Somalis  we know better than any other nation the truth of that statement. We are at that juncture.That is why we know that solutions cannot be only military in nature. Yesterday we were reminded of the origins behind the establishment of the United Nations. We were reminded of the power of peaceful political reconciliation. Military intervention can end war  but it cannot propagate peace. Dialogue  reconciliation  forgiveness — those are the tools of peacebuilders  the tools of nation-builders.As President of Somalia  I reaffirm our commitment to denying extremist ideology and its servants any hiding place in Somalia. Somalia’s strategic location makes it a gateway between the Arabian peninsula and the African continent. We cannot defeat Al-Shabaab only to allow other extremists  such as the militant group known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria  to find fertile ground. Although the security situation in Somalia is improving and Al-Shabaab is becoming a spent force  we cannot afford to rest until we achieve a final victory. We must strengthen Somalia and make it into a firewall  both for security purposes and ideologically. Somalia must be strengthened in order to prevent the African continent from being once again invaded by violent extremists who target innocent civilians  spreading their ideology of death. Solutions must be sought by applying the rule of law  pursuing human rights and affording access to justice. People must be allowed to determine their own future and to find their own place in that brilliant future.We must not forget the importance of political reconciliation and reform in maintaining long-term stability and creating an enabling environment for development gains. Two years ago  it quickly became clear that the formation of a unified and federal Somalia was the key to delivering peace and building sustainable security. The Vision 2016 framework was developed to encapsulate that important national goal. Vision 2016 outlines the framework for federalism through reconciliation  the adoption of a revised permanent constitution through a referendum and the path to democratic elections. It is a tall order that cannot be overstated.The Federal Government has undertaken to revise our Provisional Constitution by 2016 and adopt it by means of a public referendum. We have undertaken to deliver a federal Somalia made up of member states. We have undertaken to deliver credible  national elections. We have not failed on the side of ambition  and we must not fail to deliver on our ambition. And we are delivering. Led by the Federal Government  together with existing and emerging regional stakeholders inside Somalia  we have made significant progress in the formation of interim regional administrations in the south-west and central regions of Somalia through dialogue and consultations.The Constitution Review and Implementation Commission was set up in May 2014 and started work on reviewing the current Provisional Constitution of Somalia. The approval and adoption of the Provisional Constitution is critical to an inclusive political settlement that paves the way for sustainable security and development in Somalia.In order to create a federal State  it will be essential to ensure the full participation of subfederal administrations in the political transformation of Somalia. The Boundaries and Federation Commission will be established and will devise the mechanisms for supporting the process of federating Somalia. The National Independent Electoral Commission will be endorsed by Parliament by the end of 2014. The Federal Government is committed to inclusivity and  while observing the principles of Somali-Somali dialogue  is taking concrete steps to engage all Somalis  including women and minority groups  in the political process of nation-building. We have seen great progress in connecting the Government to the Somali public  thanks to the improvement of service delivery  particularly in the area of education. In two years we have enrolled close to 100 000 students in public schools and appointed 2 000 teachers.We are investing in the strengthening of our Somali national forces. The Somali National Army is a key element in defeating Al-Shabaab  and we are working with our international partners to ensure that we have a well-trained  well-equipped  integrated national army and other defence institutions in place  so that Somalia will one day be well able to defend its own peace and participate in international peace.However  it grieves me to report today that the humanitarian situation in Somalia is extremely critical. About 3.2 million Somalis need life-saving or livelihood assistance right now. A terrible mix of drought  rising food prices  increasing malnutrition and insecurity is plunging Somalia into a humanitarian crisis not dissimilar to the horrific famine of 2011. Out of a population of 12.3 million in Somalia  more than 1 million people face acute food insecurity today and an equal number of people are internally displaced. Three months ago the humanitarian community and the Federal Government sounded the alarm about the impending crisis. Humanitarian response plans were prepared and launched. Swift action by the Federal Government to set up an interim interministerial committee and interventions with humanitarian partners and donors has mitigated the current crisis. However  a sustained and scaled-up response is required now to prevent a free fall. The humanitarian appeal for Somalia remains severely underfunded. Only 32 per cent of the requested $933 million has been received. This situation must be addressed urgently. As we enter the last third of the year  more than half a billion dollars is still required for life-saving activities. Over the past 18 months  Somalia has seen a significant amount of progress in its political  economic and development sectors. If the current humanitarian situation deteriorates into a crisis  all those gains will be undermined. We have come too far to allow that to happen.It is clear that  despite challenges  Somalia is moving forward on the path of integration  inclusivity and peace. We are leaving behind the disorder and discord spread by a distorted ideology. I was told a remarkable story recently  a true story that I think illustrates perfectly the power of reconciliation and the triumph of compassion over brutality. One of our Somali non-governmental organizations (NGOs) is running a social reconciliation programme in some remote areas of Somalia. It consists of 12 weeks of intense facilitated discussions about truth  designed to disrupt the cycle of violence and create a safe space where people can tell their stories and  through that exercise  nurture understanding. A young man whose family had moved to another country when his father was murdered by another man from his village heard of the programme. He heard that the Somali NGO was training programme facilitators  people who would be able to move freely from one village to another and teach others the way of peace and reconciliation. Rather than as an opportunity to pursue peace  this young man  filled with anger at his father’s murder  saw it as the ideal way for him to exact revenge. He would return to Somalia  undertake the training course  gain access to his family’s old village under a false pretext  and while there he would kill his father’s murderer.He therefore came home to Somalia  bought a weapon  underwent the training and went to the village. He made sure that his father’s murderer attended the training  while harbouring the destruction of his father’s enemy in his heart. But then  something started to happen. As he helped the villagers tell their stories of violence  of the endless cycle of horror  of the terrible choices they had had to make  his heart softened. He understood that any choice that involved violence was a not a choice at all. One day he stood up at the training centre  addressed his father’s murderer  explained that he had plotted to kill him and begged his forgiveness.In a way  this one man’s story echoes the national history that we are beginning to tell in Somalia today  namely  that our future will not be built on the ashes of revenge. It will not be built on the stones of violence. We reaffirm our choice of peace. We reaffirm that reconciliation  the path that we have chosen  will be won through dialogue  through inclusive politics  through creating a shared vision of what Somalia can be in the future. Our success requires the support of our international partners  but most of all it demands the ownership and the commitment of the Somali people  which we are assuring. As we continue towards democratization  now is not the time for scepticism. We have laid out our plans  and we need to stand together to execute and deliver.Our achievements and progress have been made possible by the determination of the Somali people. We welcome and acknowledge the strong support of our international partners and look forward to their continuing engagement behind our nationally led agenda. I acknowledge the commitment and the sacrifice of our Somali defence institutions and grieve the loss of our soldiers and security staff who died in pursuit of peace. I renew my commitment to serve the Somali people. Somalia is indebted to their resilience and perseverance in the face of extraordinary challenges. Somalis look forward to walking  together with the nations assembled here  towards a peaceful  prosperous future for the nation call Somalia. We are very much indebted to the family of the United Nations."
"157",6393,"SSD",69,2014,"I congratulate you  Mr. President  your country  Uganda  and the African continent on your election to the presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. My delegation and I pledge our full support to you  Sir  in this important mission. I also wish to congratulate Ambassador John Ashe for successfully completing his term.We are all bound by our moral duty and legal obligations to address the challenges confronting the world today. We need to act in solidarity to promote global peace and security for the good of our nations. In this context  I urge the United Nations and all Heads of State and Government to support the current peace initiatives in the world  especially those in the Middle East  the Central African Republic  Somalia  Mali  the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of South Sudan. We need to find appropriate ways and means to end these conflicts and many others in the world  and to pave the way for all the nations and peoples of the world to live in peace and to enjoy their basic rights.In addition  the Security Council needs to be strengthened to deal with new global challenges. Therefore  we support the call of the African leaders for a comprehensive review of the Security Council to ensure that Africa and the other continents are well represented in this important international body  in accordance with the African position as stipulated by the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration. This will create a more inclusive Security Council and empower all the continents to play a greater and more effective role in promoting global peace and security for the benefit of the human race. More importantly  it will ensure that the Security Council continues to fulfil its purpose and be more able to achieve its mandate.The journey of my people from conflict to peace  independence and freedom was costly. It was characterized by economic and political marginalization  a prolonged war  humanitarian disasters  the loss of millions of lives and untold human suffering. At independence  we acquired a country with a multitude of challenges  ranging from weak national institutions and inadequate physical infrastructure to limited human capacity and weak security mechanisms. We are grateful the international community for its support and for continuing to provide humanitarian and development assistance.I have no doubt that the world has followed with shock and disbelief the violent conflict that erupted in South Sudan on Sunday  15 December 2013  which was plotted by my former Vice-President  who wanted to seize power by force. He was too impatient in his thirst for power. He did not want to wait for the general elections scheduled to take place in 2015  when he could have sought a mandate from the people of South Sudan  as required by our transitional Constitution. The failed coup and the ensuing rebellion resulted in the loss of many innocent lives  the destruction of property and damaged community relationships. However  the coup was foiled  and the Government is continuing to defend the country and the people against the rebellion.The Government and the people of South Sudan take this opportunity to thank the United Nations  the African Union  the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD) and the entire international community for their prompt action to restore peace and stability in my country. My Government is unwaveringly committed to resolving the conflict peacefully  and my negotiating team has been in Addis Ababa  Ethiopia  since January  talking with the rebels about peace  in order to close a dark chapter in the history of our young country and  on a new page  to pave the way for us once again to embark on the difficult mission of socioeconomic development  which our people urgently need.With the dedicated efforts of the mediators  we were able to sign an agreement on cessation of hostilities between the Government of the Republic of South Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army in Opposition on 23 January and to reaffirm our commitment to the agreement on 9 May. My Government has demonstrated its firm commitment to peace  has unreservedly honoured those agreements and is continuing to negotiate in good faith to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. However  the rebels have violated the agreements too many times and have refused to sign the Protocol Agreement  which is a crucially important document signed by the Heads of State and Government of IGAD  including myself as a party to the conflict. That important document forms the basis for resolving the crisis peacefully and inclusively. Therefore  I urge the international community to prevail on the rebels to sign the Protocol Agreement.We appreciate the fact that the international community is rightly concerned about the humanitarian crisis and human rights abuses that resulted from the failed coup and the rebellion. In that regard  my Government has ordered an investigation into those abuses and has also accepted to cooperate with the Commission of Inquiry formed by the African Union to carry out investigations into allegations of human rights violations. We are determined to hold accountable those who are found responsible  as we do not condone impunity under any circumstances.My Government recently signed into law provisions to guarantee freedom of expression in the media. It has also ratified three United Nations core conventions  namely  the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and its first Optional Protocol; and the Convention on the Rights of the Child  the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict and the Optional Protocol on the sale of children  child prostitution and child pornography. Those are all positive measures put in place to address some of the concerns.The conflict in South Sudan is purely a political struggle for power and not an ethnic conflict  as has been reported. The citizens displaced by the conflict  especially in the three states of Jonglei  Unity and Upper Nile  have sought refuge in the neighbouring states of Lakes  Warrap  Central Equatoria and Eastern Equatoria and in neighbouring countries. Those innocent victims of the conflict urgently need and deserve humanitarian assistance. We therefore thank the United Nations  the Government of Norway and the stakeholders for organizing the donor conference in Oslo  Norway  in May to support our humanitarian needs. We also deeply appreciate and welcome the high-level ministerial meeting on South Sudan that the United Nations organized on 25 September as a sideline event of the sixty-ninth session of the Assembly  during which a number of donors made pledges of support. My Government is fully committed to providing humanitarian access and has taken the necessary measures to facilitate access for humanitarian agencies.The conflicts within our two countries of South Sudan and the Sudan tend to be interconnected. That is why we in the Republic of South Sudan will exert increased efforts to strengthen relations with the Republic of the Sudan. Our oil flows through the territory of the Sudan. In the spirit of cooperation  my Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation will soon commence more joint visits with his Sudanese counterpart to donor countries to appeal and lobby for lifting and waiving the Sudan’s foreign debt  as was agreed in the Cooperation Agreement between the Republic of the Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan. There are outstanding issues associated with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  especially the final status of Abyei. The Republic of South Sudan and the Sudan are working through those issues with the members of the the African Union High-level Implementation Panel mediation team and our other partners to find an amicable  peaceful solution with the Sudan. 1 am committed to addressing those outstanding issues  and I am in direct communication with President Omer Al-Bashir of the Sudan to resolve those issues through dialogue.Furthermore  my Government and the people of South Sudan would like to state our appreciation and thanks to the countries that have expressed support for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in my country  especially the United States of America  China  Egypt  South Africa  the Sudan  Kenya  Uganda  Ethiopia  Norway  the Congo and Namibia  together with many others.My Government is collaborating with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) and other stakeholders  such as community leaders  political parties  civil societies and faith-based organizations  to build trust with the internally displaced persons in UNMISS camps and to encourage them to return to their homes and their pre-conflict areas and resume their normal livelihoods. With respect to our cooperation with UNMISS  my Government would like to express its concern regarding the latest mandate of UNMISS  which has very serious implications for service delivery to my people. I note in particular that the new mandate does not allow UNMISS to respond to requests from national  state and local partners for assistance in important activities connected with capacity-building  peacebuilding  disarmament  demobilization and reintegration  security sector reform  recovery and development.Notwithstanding the fact that the activities I have just mentioned are of paramount importance to South Sudan  we strongly believe that the main objective of UNMISS is to support peace and reconciliation first and foremost. We humbly request the Security Council to reconsider its decision when the UNMISS mandate comes up for renewal in November. Also  we would further urge UNMISS to engage in reorientation of its activities relating to the mandate of protecting civilians and to shift from protection-by-presence to protection-by-action. This is very important because the presence of troops that do not move does nothing to save the civilian population. It is vital that they become active. They must also encourage those in UNMISS camps to return to their homes. UNMISS needs to protect the civilians in their neighbourhoods  not in camps  because ours is a huge country — larger than France.The theme of the current session is “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”. It is no surprise that the Republic of South Sudan  as a three-year-old country facing numerous challenges  will not achieve the Millennium Development Goals. We commend the Secretary-General and the Working Group for coordinating the discussions on the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs)  which will form the post-2015 global development agenda. It is vital that the SDGs focus nations’ efforts on reducing poverty; ending hunger and achieving food security; addressing our health concerns  especially those issues affecting women and children; promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; addressing the issues of access  equity and quality of education; and tackling youth unemployment.We firmly believe that the attainment of the SDGs will require strong  sustained partnership  collaboration and coordination at the international  regional and national levels  and leadership from the United Nations. For our part  we will spare no effort and will work in conjunction with the international community and our partners in the New Deal  as a fragile State member of the Group of Seven Plus  to attain the new development goals.I wish to take this opportunity to express our solidarity and support to the victims of Ebola in the greater West Africa region  particularly in Liberia  Guinea and Sierra Leone. We acknowledge the leading role of the United States of America in assisting the continent to combat the virus. It is vital that the SDGs address such global health threats.The Republic of South Sudan strongly condemns all forms of terrorism  including piracy  which has become a menace to international peace and security.Climate change is now recognized as a major global threat — a threat that could wipe out planet Earth and the entire human race. I commend the Secretary-General for convening the recent climate summit to focus attention on this global problem  and I urge all the members of the Assembly to heed the call of the Secretary-General and take bold action. I am pleased that the SDGs cover environmental issues of concern to the international community  and I hope the climate summit to be held in Paris in December 2015 will result in an agreement on a new global legal framework for tackling climate change. We must win the race against the clock to save our planet and humankind before it is too late. To echo Ms. Graça Machel  tackling climate change requires leadership  courage and ambition from all of us. Let us act in solidarity to create the future we want.Finally  Sir  I reiterate my resolve to restore peace to the people of South Sudan  to fully implement the cooperation agreements with the Republic of the Sudan  to provide unrestricted support to humanitarian assistance  to respect human rights and ensure democratic governance in my country  and to strengthen working relations with UNMISS and all the members of the international community without exception. We will work in unison to establish a safe  secure  peaceful and prosperous South Sudan.We are all one in this world — whether strong or weak  rich or poor. Let us therefore stick together."
"158",6425,"STP",69,2014,"It is a great honour and pleasure for me to take the floor for the first time in this world forum as Prime Minister and Head of Government  proudly representing the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe.At the outset  please allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at the sixty-ninth session and to offer our full support during the current session  which we wish to be crowned with success. Your election resulted from the Member States’ recognition of the experience that the Republic of Uganda has accumulated and of the increasingly significant role that the African continent plays in the international community in consolidating peace and security worldwide. It also reflects your efforts to achieve sustainable development for the developing countries  in addition to your outstanding professional qualifications  which testify to your technical knowledge and life experience. We are certain that your diplomatic experience will greatly contribute to the favourable outcome of our work and help us to discover ways of resolving matters of major concern to the international community. We also welcome the important and relevant theme of this session  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”. The post-2015 development agenda  when properly defined and structured  will certainly become a useful instrument to guide developing countries  particularly those of the African continent  to sustainable development.We wish to express our appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his competent  selfless and zealous stewardship of the Organization. We congratulate Mr. John William Ashe  who zealously and selflessly presided over the deliberations of the Assembly at the sixty-eighth session for the past 12 months. The pertinence of the theme chosen for the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly is clear in the light of the persisting economic and financial crisis that continues to ravage the world. We must combine our efforts and focus them on building the more just and auspicious future to which our peoples legitimately aspire. To that end  Africa has identified the six pillars on which its sustainable development should rest: structural economic transformation and inclusive growth; science  technology and innovation; people-centred development; environmental sustainability  natural resources management and disaster management; peace and security; and finance and partnerships. From our perspective  those pillars emanate from the aspirations of our African nations. All partners of the African continent should take them into account in the arduous efforts to bring about sustainable and equitable development and enhance the dignity of our peoples. Therefore  Sao Tome and Principe believes in sustainable development in Africa  based on the pillars proposed by the African Union. It calls on the United Nations to adapt its programme to the specific realities of Africa  without losing sight of the accomplishments of certain countries in attaining some of the eight Millennium Development Goals.It is an indisputable fact that the raison d’être of the United Nations is to maintain peace and security around the world  which is a sine qua non for the promotion of development. However  in the light of the significant changes that the world has undergone since the establishment of our Organization in 1945  we must stress the urgent need to adapt it to the new challenges of our time. Therefore  we again reiterate our call for the acceleration of the ongoing process of reform throughout the entire United Nations system  in order to imbue its operations with greater dynamism  representativeness  effectiveness  capacity and legitimacy  thereby leadingto the maintenance of peace and security and thus to the promotion of development worldwide.We unfortunately continue to observe the persistence of some conflict areas and the outbreak of new tensions  with alarmingly significant humanitarian repercussions  throughout the world. In Mali and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  despite the relative stabilization of conflict zones as a result of United Nations efforts  we think that the combined operations must continue in order to consolidate and strengthen the achievements. We are grateful for the resolution of the situation in Guinea-Bissau  where the transition process has led to the election of a new President of the Republic and a new Government  thereby repositioning the country in accordance with regular and institutional democratic processes. However  it is incumbent on the international community  particularly the United Nations  the African Union  the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries  to continue to collaborate and combine their efforts to consolidate the democratic rule of law so that our sister nation may advance the progress and well-being of its people.It is with enormous and fraternal satisfaction that we commend the political actors in Mozambique for their great maturity and for taking into account the higher interests of their people by recently signing a peace agreement  thereby avoiding more suffering and loss of human lives.With regard to the Central African Republic  we welcome the decision of the United Nations to dispatch the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic to end the suffering of that country’s people and clear the way for national reconciliation. The reconciliation process began with the recent Brazzaville forum and should be completed by the Bangui forum and the holding of elections. These should open a window of opportunity for the resolution of the disturbing crisis in the Central African Republic  which is in our subregion  and enable it to return to institutional normalcy.With respect to South Sudan  we encourage efforts to convince the conflicting parties to engage in negotiations with a view to seeking solutions for their existing differences and ending the suffering of innocent civilians. In Western Sahara  the long-standing situation continues to be a matter of concern for us and to require a greater involvement from the international community so that the long negotiation process can finally be completed. Therefore  we renew our call for the involved parties to return to the negotiating table in order to reach a mutually acceptable political solution.In the light of the resurgence of acts of international terrorism everywhere  it is imperative for all the members of the international community to coordinate their actions  since that is the only way the world will be able to overcome that scourge. To that end  we wish to note our apprehension and express our concern with regard to the actions perpetrated by Boko Haram in our neighbour  the Republic of Nigeria  and the consequences of such actions. Nigeria is a country with which Sao Tome and Principe maintains ties of friendship and multiple relations of understanding and cooperation in areas of common interest. We are also troubled by the recent phenomenon of the Islamic State and its implications. The Middle East  unfortunately  continues on the path of bloody conflicts. These have taken an enormous number of human lives  owing to the long-standing hostilities between Israel and Palestine  whose devastating consequences the world recently witnessed. Therefore  we welcome the recent ceasefire between the two parties  and we renew our call for a negotiated solution that will ensure the Palestinian people’s right to control their own destiny  as well as the State of Israel’s right to exist  in accordance with the relevant resolutions.Similarly  there is no military solution for the persistent internal conflict in Syria  which has also created disastrous humanitarian consequences. Therefore  we welcome the recent ceasefire between the parties and renew our call for a compromise to be reached  with the help and support of the international community  in order to end the hostilities and clear the way for a frank dialogue across the negotiating table and a political solution for lasting peace.As to the conflict in Ukraine  which is also causing the loss of many human lives  the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe regrets the situation and calls on the parties to move forward rapidly  through dialogue  in resolving their differences. The international community must make all efforts to facilitate such dialogue.We believe that the Assembly will agree with us when we say that global security is vital for the sustainable development of our countries. Therefore  considering that Sao Tome and Principe is centrally located in the Gulf of Guinea  a region that is strongly affected by piracy  terrorism  drug trafficking and other illicit acts committed at sea  we have taken national steps to fight those phenomena  including the drafting of a legislative framework for the modernization of the armed forces  based on a strategy that focuses decisively on the sea and its resources.At the subregional level  we have worked  as part of the tripartite partnership of ECOWAS  the Economic Community of Central African States and the Gulf of Guinea Commission  to implement the recommendations of the Summit of Heads of State and Government on Maritime Safety and Security in the Gulf of Guinea  held in Yaoundé. To that end  we welcome the progress achieved in the process of establishing the Interregional Coordination Centre  which is scheduled to begin operations very soon  and we renew our call to the international community to continue with us on the arduous task of ensuring our collective security.We strongly believe that taking steps to reduce the harmful effects of climate change is a responsibility that must be shared by developing countries and developed countries alike  in order to ensure the continuity of the clean development mechanism  particularly for the least developed countries  as well as to mobilize the political will for a legally binding global agreement through the adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties  scheduled to take place in Paris in 2015.The trade embargo imposed against Cuba decades ago constitutes another matter of great concern for us  and we therefore renew our call for the sanctions to be lifted. Cuba should be allowed to address its economic and social development challenges in an environment of normalcy  without the restrictions imposed by such sanctions  and to take better advantage of opportunities for trade relations on an equal footing with other States Members of our Organization.The African continent is once again assailed by an epidemic of haemorrhagic fever caused by the Ebola virus  with incalculable consequences. In the light of the high level of mortality and the devastating effects of the disease  on the one hand  and the chance that it may spread to other areas of the world  on the other hand  we must urgently identify synergies to engage in an all-out struggle to save the thousands of lives that are threatened by this terrible scourge.In Sao Tome and Principe  we fortunately have not yet seen any Ebola cases. However  in the light of our country’s vulnerability  our economic and financial weaknesses  and our health institutions’ lack of experience in dealing with the outbreak  we have prepared a contingency plan and taken prevention and response measures  including entry and exit restrictions at our ports and airports  which may impact our fragile economy. Members will understand that we must count on the World Health Organization’s help and on the support and experience of friendly nations in order to protect our population against all sources and forms of contamination. In that regard  we welcome the Secretary-General’s initiative in convening a high-level meeting on the margins of this session in order to discuss the matter and take appropriate measures.Before I finish my statement  please allow me to note the situation of calm and progress between the two sides on the Taiwan Strait. We welcome that environment and encourage the parties to develop their relations through negotiations. Our country is pleased to see the participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the General Assembly of the World Health Organization and applauds the fact that Taiwan was invited  for the first time since 1971  to participate in the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization in 2013.Therefore  and considering the enormous potential of Taiwan  we would like to see its participation further extend to other specialized agencies of the United Nations  such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  and to the implementation process of the post-2015 development agenda  in which it could be of significant help to the international community.In conclusion  we reiterate our country’s willingness to continue to participate in the efforts to mobilize wills and facilitate synergies for the achievement of the basic principles and noble objectives that guided the establishment of the United Nations.It is certain that today we are a democratic country with a community of free citizens  but challenges will continue to arise in the future. Therefore  we have taken steps to consolidate democracy  so that our citizens may have an increasingly aware and active involvement in our collective existence and the political debate may be broader and more responsible. It is hoped that these steps will enable compromises among all the political forces to be achieved and to serve as the basis for the reforms that our country needs. We are fully aware that our country’s economic performance hinges on political stability and our citizens’ trust in our democratic institutions.I cannot conclude without informing the Assembly that Sao Tome and Principe will hold long-awaited legislative  regional and local elections on 12 October. The electoral process is being managed in an environment of full normality  and we have resolved the financial difficulties related to the elections with the generous support of our development partners  to which we express our profound gratitude and esteem. We expect the election results to be transparent and fair  as our tradition dictates  and that our country will continue to be a benchmark of democracy in our subregion."
"159",6466,"SUR",69,2014,"My statement today is made on behalf of the President of the Republic of Suriname  His Excellency Mr. Desiré Delano Bouterse.We want you  Mr. President  to be assured of our support in these turbulent times of international politics. Your task will not be easy. We pay tribute to your predecessor  Ambassador John Ashe  for his excellent leadership during the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly.We also want to express our support to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in his endeavour to steer the United Nations vessel through the rough waters of shifting economic forces and rapidly changing political arenas  in an environment where violence and intolerance  whatever the root causes  seem to prevail. Although interdependence  self-determination and non-interference should be the guiding principles of the international community  we are faced with an incredible desire for domination in the name of undefined  so-called national interests.We have examined some of the arguments used to invade Grenada and compared those to the arguments used to justify the military involvement in Ukraine. What striking similarity! We have tried hard to understand the value of a referendum in the case of the Malvinas and the value given to the referendum held in Crimea.States with media  military and economic vulnerabilities such as ours cannot but feel extremely uncomfortable with the custom-made slogans  devoid of any genuine moral value  that are imposed on our minds as precooked recipes.We express our sincere wish that the United Nations should develop the muscles needed to restructure and democratize itself and move away from restrictive veto powers towards inclusive legal institutions that can effectively apply and monitor adherence to the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. We see that as the only way forward to achieve the ultimate goal of sustainable development  even for the smallest members of the international community. The real proof of civilization is total respect for the seemingly insignificant members of any social entity. Let us  then  become truly civilized.In sharp contradiction to the turbulence and challenges mentioned  we want to draw the attention of this body to the Latin America and Caribbean region  which is  relatively speaking  a unique area of peace and tranquillity. It is important to answer the question: how is that region showing us the way forward? From a military point of view  it is an area of the world that is nuclear-free. The Treaty of Tlatelolco has proved to be an effective instrument to monitor and maintain Latin America and the Caribbean free from nuclear threat.Furthermore  it is important to note that  at the political level  interdependence has become the driving force of both multilateral and bilateral relations. Small and large States alike interact on the basis of established treaties and principles of mutual respect  mutual concern and mutual benefit. The Union of South American Nations  the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in particular have played an important role so far in furthering that cause.The third  and certainly the most important  factor that ensures durable peace in our region is the implementation of people-oriented socioeconomic policies. We have seen such programmes developed in Brazil  Bolivia  Chile and my own country  Suriname  to mention a few. The emphasis on policies and programmes related to health care  education  youth and sports is rapidly changing the image of Latin America and the Caribbean. We invite the world community to take note of those positive realities in our functioning democracies  as they translate into regional integration processes with nothing less than a bright future.Looking at the positive picture at the national level  we must also address the challenges of dealing with all forms of transnational organized crime in the Latin American and Caribbean region. Suriname fully supports all initiatives deployed to face those challenges.Having said that  we must assess two areas of concern that our nation faces today. Economically speaking  the latest International Monetary Fund report indicates that Suriname has reached an average per capita income of approximately $10 000. Our gross domestic product (GDP) is primarily based on the mining sector  where gold mining and the production of crude oil and derivatives represent 33 per cent of our national output. That sector is responsible for 90 per cent of our total export revenue.We are aware of the fact that the nature of that sector is extractive and  as such  is subject to depletion. In order to ensure the sustainability of the economy  the Government has developed a policy to ensure that the revenue from the non-renewable sectors is invested in developing human capital to ensure the full fruition of the capacities of the Surinamese people in their own interest and the interest of the entire nation.To ensure that that policy will materialize  President Bouterse announced  at the outset of his term  a social contract that has been given substance in the following programme: a legal framework guaranteeing a minimum wage  health-care coverage for every citizen and pensions for the elderly.In the past four years  Suriname has implemented new programmes to promote advanced education at all levels  including after-school care programmes for primary and secondary students and scholarship programmes for higher education. Furthermore  legal instruments are being prepared as part of a full safety net to prevent dropouts.In the same vein  various programmes have been developed in close cooperation with other CARICOM States to combat the incidence of non-communicable diseases. Our ultimate goal is for those initiatives to become part and parcel of future programmes of the Pan American Health Organization and the World Health Organization.With regard to the imminent threat of the spread of the Ebola virus  the Government has entered into close consultations with neighbouring countries  the subregion and the global community to design and implement programmes to coordinate and cooperate effectively so as to prevent the spread of the deadly virus.As a matter of course  we can sustain those initiatives only within appropriate fiscal discipline. We are forced to strike the right balance between economic growth  socioeconomic concerns and respect for our natural environment. In doing so  Suriname has been classified as an upper-middle-income country with an improved ranking in the 2013 United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report.However  that classification limits our access to concessional financing  which hampers our aspirations and endeavours to sustain the achievements I have mentioned. Honestly speaking  we are experiencing that decision as a punishment for doing well. A classification solely based on statistics  and not on our socioeconomic reality  will never serve the objective of sustainable development based on human development. We call upon the multilateral and bilateral funding institutions to adapt their policies to that approach.There is another area of prime interest to which we want to draw attention. Suriname’s territory is more than 90 per cent covered with forest  which annually absorbs 8.8 million tons of carbon  while our annual emissions are 7 million tons of carbon. Suriname thus absorbs 1.8 million tons of carbon more than it emits on a yearly basis. While many countries work towards becoming carbon-neutral  Suriname already qualifies as a carbon-negative country. With an annual deforestation rate of 0.02 per cent and having dedicated 13 per cent of the national territory to preserving and protecting vulnerable ecosystems  we are generating a national and global asset.In stark contrast to those positive realities  Suriname has  paradoxically  become one of the most vulnerable countries in the world as a result of climate change. At the recently held 2014 Climate Summit  Suriname indicated that sea-level rise will  inter alia  severely damage or destroy our coastal ecosystems  including most of our arable land; damage or destroy over 40 per cent of our GDP; damage or destroy the homes of over 80 per cent of our population; damage or destroy our world heritage-designated capital; and endanger the way of life of most of the people  who represent our cultural heritage and live along the coastal and river shores. Changes in rainfall patterns and rising temperatures are already leading to increased health risks and associated costs  decreased hydropower production and reduced access to river pathways.The serious absence of international commitment to supporting us so that we can take the proper measures to avoid the impending disasters is disturbing  and we have therefore been obliged to join with similar  vulnerable countries with strong environmentally active frameworks and a history of respect for ecosystems. We call on the rest of the world both to become more proactive in support of the measures that we are compelled to take  and to ensure that the relevant issues have a place on the international agenda.Suriname would like to emphasize the need for a fundamental restructuring of the United Nations  with the aim of making our Organization better equipped to deal effectively with the international issues at hand. We would like once again to point to the experience of Latin America and the Caribbean as a shining example of how durable peace can be achieved. In that context  the economic blockade of the Cuban people should be considered to be a regional anomaly that must end now.The role of women in achieving sustainable development  at the level of both civil society and political leadership  has proved an important factor in creating an atmosphere of tolerance in which we choose to use dialogue rather than resort to violence. We must continue to encourage our women — who make up more than half of the world’s population — to persist in their struggle for participation and inclusion and to share the burden of responsibility for peace and sustainable development.In conclusion  Suriname is ready and willing to play its humble part in helping to find workable solutions to the global issues at hand. We reiterate our commitment to all human rights and to a policy of interacting responsibly with the natural environment in our quest for sustained economic growth  as well as our commitment to peace through dialogue."
"160",6490,"SVK",69,2014,"At the outset  allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session and to wish you every success in your important duties.Let me begin with a quote by Edward Wilson:“The great challenge of the twenty-first century is to raise people everywhere to a decent standard of living  while preserving as much of the rest of life as possible.”To preserve life and the sustainability of the planet for every human is not pure theory. It is a practical question for our future and for that of our children. The Millennium Development Goals  the post-2015 framework and the challenge of climate change must form much more than the theoretical basis for our discussions. Those goals must identify  address  offer a solution to and solve problems that in one or two generations may bring the human race to the brink of its own existence.Seventy years ago  when the Second World War caused tens of millions of deaths  consuming all of the principles of humanity  the patriots and democrats in my country  Slovakia  took up arms and put their lives at risk to fight against evil and for liberty and democratic values. They fought together with many other nations to establish the foundation for new global cooperation  given shape a year later with the adoption of the Charter of the United Nations. The horrors of the Second World War  the failure of the international community to maintain world peace  the direct threat on the part of larger countries to use force against smaller ones and the absence of an international order and rules that are be universally accepted and respected were a painful lesson for us all.Cooperation among nations has come a long way in the past seven decades. The United Nations has played an important role on that road  but we have not gathered here to celebrate a false sense of success. We have to go much further than simply to identify challenges. It would be a lost opportunity if political correctness and diplomatic language were to limit us from openly and freely naming and discussing the problems that plague our world and the continents  countries and citizens that we represent. We must not betray the commitments that we all made to the principles of democracy  peace and security for every single citizen of our planet. We must look into the mirror to see what we are doing  how we do it  what we are doing or have done wrong and what we can do better. We believed that the number of conflicts would gradually decrease as our civilization matured and developed. However  today  we are confronted with the opposite reality. Instability is increasingly becoming the new status quo. Instability  poverty and hatred are the fertilizers and catalysts of terrorism  and terrorism is a threat to which no one is immune.A year ago  we Europeans could hardly imagine that  after investing so much effort in achieving peace and stability in our continent  a new armed conflict would arise in our neighbourhood. Conflict is dangerous both in its nature and in its consequences. Twenty years ago  Ukraine abandoned its nuclear programme in exchange for the security and territorial integrity guarantees granted by the United States  the United Kingdom  China  France and the Russian Federation. Today  instead of marking a major anniversary of achievement in the area of security and stability on the European continent  we are witnessing armed conflict and political instability. Instead of building a world without weapons of mass destruction  we encourage those countries that seek security under the lethal nuclear umbrella.Slovakia strongly denounces violations of the territorial integrity of any State. That is a trademark of our foreign policy. It is a pillar for the stability of the geopolitical architecture. We support that principle  and Ukraine and the annexation of the Crimea are not an exception. We are nevertheless convinced that dialogue and diplomatic efforts  with the participation of Russia  will lead to sustainable peace in Ukraine. We must respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the sovereign right of its people to decide their fate in a free and independent manner. The United Nations plays a crucial role in that matter. What Ukraine needs today is to restore peace and stability  implement reforms and be reassured of the strength of the guarantees for the inviolability of its territory. Slovakia is ready to participate in that process.Diplomatic language is full of allegories  but even the nicest language cannot hide the naked truth when people are being killed. Acts of barbarism and cruelty have become a freely available article. They are broadcast live to our homes. They make us insensitive to violence far away. At the same time  they create the feeling of having being born into an unsafe world  in which people ask: where is the effective protective umbrella of the United Nations?A year ago  we could not imagine the sudden rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)  which has become a global threat in a short time. It has overshadowed the long-term effort of the international community in Iraq. The ideology and acts of ISIL represent an unprecedented level of brutality and the twisted use of the media for their self-promotion. It represents the dangerous ideology of forcing violent changes to State borders. It embodies ethnic and religious cleansing  which will not stop at the borders of Iraq  Syria or the neighbouring countries  but has the ambition to spread beyond the region of the Middle East. The entire global community has the responsibility to act in order to end the suffering of the innocent victims of violence and to protect children and women. Today  we must to stand united in Iraq and prevent ISIL from taking root in the territory it has occupied and from consolidating its military and economic power.Autocratic and totalitarian ideologies always bring suffering  the restriction of rights  internal conflict  injustice and death. We are all too familiar with their ultimate price and catastrophic consequences. Among the many tasks facing the United Nations are the prevention of such ideologies from becoming successful  the protection of human rights  the adoption of every possible preventive measures to prevent conflict and the establishment of sustainable peace.Slovakia  with its own first-hand experience of transitioning from a totalitarian regime to democracy  supports efforts to create the conditions necessary for sustainable peace. We promote security sector reform as one of the key factors for success in the peaceful development in regions emerging from conflict  as well as for States going through a regime change to democracy. Stable security institutions such as the police and military can better fulfil their duties to safeguard human rights and protect their citizens  especially society’s most vulnerable members  including women and girls.The Slovak Republic actively fulfils its commitments to Afghanistan. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan is led by a diplomat from Slovakia. We remain convinced that in the aftermath of the recent presidential election  the new Afghan leadership will be able to create the conditions needed to achieve national and social unity and to continue supporting international assistance. I am pleased to note that the two former presidential candidates have reached an agreement  and we believe that that will contribute to Afghanistan’s stability. Slovakia is ready to continue to do its part in assisting the Afghan people in that endeavour.Disarmament is key to eliminating potential sources of tension and conflict. Last year’s signing of the Arms Trade Treaty was an important step towards establishing common legal standards for regulating and monitoring international trade in conventional weapons. The Slovak Republic was among the first 50 countries to ratify the Treaty  and we are hopeful that its implementation will contribute to eliminating the dangers of the illegal arms trade and thus strengthen global security.Last but not least  peace  security and stability are preconditions for development. The rule of law  democratic governance and human rights are essential for every single citizen. But we must address  respond to and solve the global issues that may be as deadly for humankind as a nuclear war — the changes that are occurring on our planet. Globalization has created borderless opportunities for entrepreneurship  but it has also created new challenges that we must deal with if we are to make life on Earth sustainable — climate change  inequalities in development and in the distribution of goods and services  poverty and unequal access to health and education.Slovakia is and will remain a responsible member of the global community. We participate in the discussion on financing sustainable development  offering our own experience of economic transition. Global challenges require global action and national responsibility. We are ready to do our share.The peoples of the world have vested in the United Nations an exclusive and global responsibility: to respond to violations of peace  ensusre respect for international law  protect human rights and deal with threats to humanity. Let us all make sure that it is able to continue to carry out those responsibilities. For decades  the Organization has been the forum where we can name those responsible for the murder of their own citizens on a massive scale  the leaders who worship a cult of hatred and intolerance  and those who favour arms over agreements and international law. But in the cases where we have failed  our failure has caused the suffering and death of innocent people.We  the United Nations  should not give up on the ideal of being the conscience of the world. Our Organization should be the authority with the ability to define  prevent and solve conflicts and problems. Together we must convince people around the world that we are safeguarding the international norms and principles that the United Nations is built on. If we fail to accomplish that within the United Nations itself  we will not be able to guarantee to humankind that totalitarianism  injustice  impunity and amorality will not prevail."
"161",6515,"SVN",69,2014,"Slovenia is among the vast majority in the international community that desire and strive for a lasting peace. However  the precondition for that is the peaceful resolution of all disputes. The United Nations was founded mainly to serve precisely that purpose  and that goal has often been achieved. Within the contemporary international community  the United Nations remains a very important tool for maintaining and strengthening world peace.However  contrary to the Charter of the United Nations  force is still being used in today’s world. There is even a strong feeling that  owing to new circumstances  the existing architecture of the United Nations — and above all the Security Council — is failing in that fundamental role. Long ago  a debate began on the reforms that were needed  but thus far  it seems to have resulted in no decisive changes.Hence  a sense of uncertainty about future stability and peace is gaining ground among the peace-oriented States of international community. If the United Nations is not reformed so that it can successfully cope with international conflicts  it risks being sidelined. Increasingly  deadlocks in the Security Council — which have sometimes come about for good reasons  but sometimes not — are taken as an excuse for resolving conflicts by force and without a United Nations mandate. If that trend continues  it may lead to the breakdown in the contemporary political and security architecture. It is our common task to remedy such problems rapidly  thoroughly and by consensus  especially with regard to the functioning of the United Nations and the Security Council; otherwise  it may be too late.I suppose we all agree that a reformed and effective Security Council is needed  with its permanent members exercising their powers responsibly and in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations. We have to use this opportunity to rethink the international security architecture  improve our capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts and reclaim our shared values and principles  which are enshrined in the Charter. With numerous ongoing conflicts around the world  we will have to do so before international peace is undermined.I cannot deny that  at times  in the absence of other means  specific circumstances may compel the international community to maintain peace by the use of force. Sometimes it is so. Nevertheless  a United Nations mandate is essential to ensure credibility  at least in principle. If  however  intervening without a United Nations mandate becomes the principle  the world will certainly arrive at a point where an arbitrary action may trigger a conflict of broad dimensions. I think there are no moral grounds for such risky behaviour.A comprehensive United Nations approach is also needed to address the global threat emerging in the broader Middle East and North Africa: the threat of terrorism  extremism and a militant radicalism that is distinctively different in its strategic approach and methods of operation. We all have to condemn that threat in the strongest terms and fight against it in a concerted manner  bearing in mind the framework of the mandate given by the Security Council. Because of the importance I accord to the Security Council  I would like to reiterate my support for Security Council resolution 2174 (2014) adopted two days ago  which was endorsed by more than 100 States.Although the debate on the reform of the Security Council has been going on for decades now  it has recently become especially relevant. My country  Slovenia  is committed to contributing to that debate to the greatest extent possible.Let me finish by saying that  while the vision of a world of peace may remain unfulfilled  the ideals that led to the establishment of the United Nations almost 70 years ago and the need to preserve our humanity remain. Let us pool our resources and ideas. Let us exert leadership  make the necessary reforms and recommit to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Let us re-establish dialogue and rebuild the trust we need so much. That is the only way forward to maintain global order on the basis of international law and leave a lasting legacy to the people and nations of this world."
"162",6560,"SWE",69,2014,"Let me first warmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. My commendations go to His Excellency Mr. John Ashe for his remarkable leadership of the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly.Over the past few months  we have been reminded of the challenges that we collectively face in the Middle East  with the brutality of a terrorist organization that has forced entire populations to flee and sent shock waves around the globe  in Africa  with the spread of the Ebola virus disease  and  in Europe  with the continued aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. It was in order to deal with challenges such as those that the United Nations was created. It is because challenges such as those continue to exist that we need strong international cooperation with a strong United Nations at its core.We welcome the fact that the international community has come together to deal with the challenge posed by the terrorist group that calls itself the Islamic State and to take joint action to address the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters. Sweden is part of that common effort. When the Iraqi Government requested assistance in halting that terrorist group and in providing relief for its victims  Sweden was one of the countries that responded by offering additional humanitarian support.At the same time  we must remember that neither here nor elsewhere in the region can crises be resolved by humanitarian or military means alone. Political engagement is  and will remain  indispensable.We must support the new Iraqi Government  just as we must pursue a political solution to the conflict in Syria. We must do our utmost  on both sides  to reach an agreement with Iran on its nuclear dossier. Furthermore  we must seek a lifting of the closure regime on Gaza  as well as a restart of negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians  with the aim of ending the occupation and  at last  achieving a viable two-State solution.We welcome the readiness displayed this week here at the United Nations to take strong collective action in support of the countries affected by the devastating Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Sweden  together with others  has provided substantial support. We are currently considering further steps to help those who are affected.For decades  Sweden has been a close partner to Africa and will continue working with the growing  democratic and economically successful Africa that we see emerging  as well as with the parts of that continent that are still struggling with poverty  conflict and disease. True to that ambition  in the conviction that security and development belong together  our engagement in peacebuilding and our contribution to the implementation of the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States with regard to Somalia and Liberia will continue.Russian acts of aggression and the illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory constitute serious breaches of international law and have created a security crisis in Europe  entailing significant risks to global stability. When a permanent member of the Security Council  the body entrusted with the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security  attacks a sovereign country without any justification whatsoever  the world must react resolutely. If aggression is tolerated  there is no telling who the next victim will be. If we accept the changing of borders by force  we also accept reopening the most painful chapters of our history.Defending the principles of international law  including the inviolability of borders  must be a responsibility and an interest of all States. The Security Council should have formed the first line of defence for those principles. Too many Governments around the world have stayed silent when they should have spoken.While a great deal has been accomplished since the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  we cannot accept the fact that hundreds of millions of people are still lagging behind — many of them in conflict-affected and fragile States. It is therefore important to accelerate efforts to address the unfinished business of the MDGs.The United Nations has successfully presided over a post-2015 consultation process with a near-global reach. All actors involved should be commended for that. Sweden will now actively contribute to the intergovernmental deliberations in 2015 on the new universal development framework. With that in mind  we look forward to the Secretary-General’s synthesis report as a further guide for our work.The world needs a transformative and universal new framework for sustainable development. The new goals will need to be accompanied by a strong monitoring and accountability framework  allowing us to measure progress and ensure accountability at all levels  thereby ensuring that the global goals are translated into actions that makes a real difference for real people. To achieve the new goals  the agenda must be accompanied by a broad international consensus on financing for development and effective partnerships for sustainable development. The United Nations  for its part  must be fit for that purpose so as to take on the post-2015 development challenges in an effective way.The time leading up to the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda will be filled with challenging negotiations. However  Sweden is confident that  one year from now  we can arrive at a package that provides a solid basis for a future that is more prosperous  more gender-equal  more peaceful  more democratic  more respectful of human rights and more sustainable for us and our children.Neither development nor peace is possible without a strong focus on the role of women. By empowering women  we simultaneously promote both peace and development. Gender equality is not only just economics but also smart economics. A fundamental step towards gender equality is to ensure for women their sexual and reproductive health and rights  including freedom from violence. We have the normative frameworks in place  including Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women  peace and security. The time has come to translate those norms into action.One of the most serious global challenges is that of climate change. The impact is hardest on the world’s poorest and most vulnerable populations. Even if we manage to limit the increase in temperature  the world will experience significant adverse effects  especially in low-lying vulnerable island States. Sweden has successfully demonstrated that it is possible to separate greenhouse gas emissions and economic growth. Since 1990  we have reduced our emissions by more than 20 per cent while experiencing economic growth of 60 per cent. For several years  Sweden has been a top contributor to climate financing  not least through our development cooperation  with a focus on adaptation in the least developed and most vulnerable countries.Together with Colombia  Ethiopia  Indonesia  the Republic of Korea  Norway and the United Kingdom  Sweden initiated the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. The Commission’s recent report brings good news. Its recommendations will bring net economic benefits to countries at all income levels  including new jobs  cleaner air  better health  lower poverty and more energy security. The report  “Better Growth  Better Climate”  points to a new and better direction for our future.In Paris in 2015  we will have a common responsibility to reach a global and legally binding agreement that keeps us below the 2°C target. We must redouble our efforts to ensure that the Paris summit is a success.Throughout history  people have moved between countries  regions and continents in pursuit of a better life. Today  numerous crises and conflicts have forced more people from their homes worldwide than at any time since the Second World War. The responsibility for giving shelter and protection is most often borne by neighbouring countries. The international community is called upon to increase its solidarity and to strengthen international protection for those who need it. Sweden is heeding that call through its refugee policy and its tradition of being a place of refuge for people fleeing persecution and oppression. Last year  Sweden was the fifth largest donor to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In recent years  Sweden has been one of the top resettlement countries in the world.The debate on migration often revolves around problems and challenges. The fact is that migration offers huge opportunities and is a powerful enabler of development. Migration contributes to development and reduces poverty for migrant households. It also helps to fill needs in the labour market and to encourage trade and investment. Coordinated action and strong global cooperation are needed to maximize the positive effects of migration. Sweden is actively engaged in such global efforts  including  recently  through our chairmanship of the Global Forum on Migration and Development.Sweden is currently the second largest recipient of asylum-seekers in the European Union and by far the largest on a per capita basis. The makeup of migration flows to our country has varied over time  but those who have come to our country have in common that they have all enriched our society. They have further opened our eyes to other peoples’ suffering and created closeness to the outside world.Sweden’s commitment to disbursing 1 per cent of its gross national income in development assistance  including our substantial contributions to the different parts of the United Nations system  enjoys strong popular support. The same goes for the public backing of our participation in United Nations peacekeeping. Some 80 000 Swedes have served in United Nations peacekeeping missions over the years  with our latest deployment being our contribution of forces to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali  which is currently under way.Sweden is a candidate for a seat on the Security Council in 2017-2018  with the support of the Nordic countries. We strongly believe that global challenges require multilateral governance structures that are effective and legitimate. A strong and well-functioning United Nations is at the heart of that system. Continued United Nations reform aimed at improving our ability to promote peace and security  reduce poverty  contribute to sustainable development  alleviate suffering and increase respect for human rights is a work in progress  to which we all must contribute. Sweden is prepared to do its part.I will make one final point. It is now 53 years since Dag Hammarskjöld lost his life while on mission in Africa. Sweden welcomes the report of the Hammarskjöld Commission on the death of Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld (A/68/800  annex) and the request by the Secretary-General to the General Assembly to consider it. We join the Secretary-General in encouraging Member States to declassify any relevant records that may bring new evidence with regard to the crash of his plane. We welcome all that can be done to achieve further clarification of that matter. Such actions should be carried out with due regard for the integrity of Dag Hammarskjöld and the other individuals who were killed  their families and their memory."
"163",6598,"SWZ",69,2014,"It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session on behalf of His Majesty King Mswati III  Head of State of the Kingdom of eSwatini. I convey the congratulations and best wishes of His Majesty the King and the people of the Kingdom of eSwatini to the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session  a son of Africa. We commend the Secretary-General and his staff for the good work they are doing in creating an enabling environment for all humankind to live in peace despite the multiple challenges facing the world.As we gather here  we are very mindful of the new challenge that confronts the global community following the outbreak of Ebola in some parts of the African continent. That disease is claiming hundreds of lives and diverting focus and resources from essential development initiatives. It is also a serious drawback to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals and is a threat to humankind. We urge the United Nations and its Members to spare no effort in providing all the necessary assistance at its disposal to curb the disease and prevent any further loss of life.My delegation takes this opportunity to thank the General Assembly for convening the high-level plenary meeting known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples. It was particularly opportune  as indigenous knowledge and practices substantially contribute to the sustainable development agenda.Last week the General Assembly held its twenty-ninth special session  on follow-up to the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development beyond 2014. My delegation was pleased to participate in that event. We reaffirm the Kingdom’s commitment to the Programme of Action  which is as relevant today as it was twenty years ago.This year the regular session of the General Assembly was preceded by the Climate Summit  at which Heads of State and Government deliberated on issues of environmental protection. Those issues are critical to the achievement of sustainable development  particularly for the developing countries. We are pleased that the Summit was able to mobilize sufficient political support for guiding the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Lima in December. The issue of climate change is crucial for many of our developing economies  especially on the continent of Africa. It has a direct effect on our national objective to produce enough food for ourselves. The unpredictable weather conditions continue to be of great concern to our farmers. We shall continue to call upon the United Nations to expedite the issue to prevent further adverse effects on our lives.The theme of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session is “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”. It resonates well with our call for a development agenda that is inclusive. It is a clear indication that we are transcending the era of the Millennium Development Goals  entering a new chapter of the development agenda. As we set the stage for the post-2015 development agenda  my delegation is heartened to see that we have not forgotten our collective inability to meet all the Millennium Development Goals.I commend the co-Chairs of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals for the manner in which they ably guided the proceedings of the Group. We welcome the outcome document of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals (A/68/970) and the goals and targets contained therein. The Kingdom of eSwatini is pleased that the framework for the post-2015 development agenda has taken into account those Millennium Development Goals that have not yet been met  especially the eradication of poverty. As we begin a new era  let us not forget our previous commitments  and let us continue to emphasize the urgency for the developed partners to honour their official development assistance commitments.Food security remains a critical challenge for the African continent  and we wish to reiterate our call for the provision of adequate financial resources  the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and technical assistance to developing countries if we are to achieve our development goals. We have abundant resources on the continent. However  there is a great need for value addition to our products in order to maximize our food-production initiatives.The Kingdom of eSwatini continues to set aside a sizeable budget for agriculture. Due to the negative effects of climate change  we have a programme to construct dams for irrigation throughout the Kingdom. Assistance to subsistence farmers with farming inputs has also been increased with the intention of increasing their yields and thus increasing food production in the Kingdom.The Kingdom of eSwatini fully supports the African Union’s road map for development  Agenda 2063  which is critical to attaining the Millennium Development Goals. We are confident that  with United Nations support  that approach will accelerate Africa’s regional economic integration agenda and help realize it  facilitate integration in the world economy and ultimately improve the continent’s living standards.Africa is home to the majority of the world’s fastest-growing economies  and trade remains an integral part of the development agenda. Focus is now on sustaining that growth through boosting intra-African trade and establishing the continental free trade area. It is important  however  that access to the global markets remain open to mutually beneficial conditions that promote the United Nations ideals of increased international cooperation and trade.We are encouraged by the renewed commitment for the economic development of the African continent as resolved in different summits. The continent abounds with investment opportunities in different sectors  such as infrastructure  information  communication  technology and energy  to name but a few. That will  no doubt  have a huge impact on the sustainable development programmes for the continent. It will also contribute handsomely to job creation  particularly for the youth.We should ensure that the post-2015 agenda is cognizant of the special development needs of developing countries  particularly those in Africa. We also give particular recognition to those developing countries that have special challenges due to their geographical position  such as small island developing States and landlocked developing countries. My delegation hopes that the agenda will also take into consideration the special plight of middle-income countries  where the majority of the world’s poor reside.The Government of the Kingdom of eSwatini is pleased to note that the Republic of China on Taiwan continues to contribute to global issues  and the positive developments taking place in that region are encouraging. We encourage their full participation in all United Nations structures.As we meet here  in some parts of the world people are living in fear as every day thousands of human beings  especially vulnerable groups  are losing their lives to terrorists. We encourage the United Nations to take a leading role in promoting peace and coexistence in the world. We call on all those who are fighting to find a lasting  peaceful solution to their problems through dialogue and not through the barrel of a gun.In conclusion  the Kingdom of eSwatini would like to commend the United Nations and related agencies for being a key factor in helping to overcome the many complex challenges facing the world today. We reiterate our call for peaceful solutions and dialogue in all conflict situations so that the United Nations may achieve its noble objectives. We take pride in and reaffirm our commitment to the principles and ideals contained in the Charter of the United Nations. May the Almighty God bless us all."
"164",6626,"SYC",69,2014,"It gives me great pleasure to begin this address with warm congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I also wish to congratulate His Excellency Mr. John Ashe on his inspiring leadership of the Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.This year  we marked the 100th anniversary of the First World War. Our forefathers in 1918 called that War the war to end all wars  because they knew  as we know today  that no society can aspire to development and a better way of life without peace. At that time  many Seychellois people gave their lives to defend that ideal. Despite being one of the smallest nations in the world  geographically far removed from the centres of power and of conflict  our people have always known that we cannot be at peace if the world is not at peace. I take this opportunity to salute those who made the ultimate sacrifice in those turbulent times of 1914 and those islanders who showed that no matter how small we may be  we can make a meaningful contribution.However  the turbulent events that have unfolded before our eyes during the course of 2014 have shown very clearly that the world is not at peace. The heinous and murderous acts of global terrorist activities in recent weeks remind us of the increasing threat posed by terrorism and of the pain that it brings to innocent victims. That is coupled with a multiplication of regional conflicts and instability within States.In order to build peace  we must reinforce our commitment to multilateralism through the United Nations  while also ensuring that we accord the highest priority to more inclusive and effective development. In that context  I commend the President for placing the discussion in this year’s general debate under the banner of “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”. Seychelles takes pride in having achieved most of the Millennium Development Goals and continues to impart greater impetus to ensure that the remaining challenges are effectively dealt with by 2015.For small island developing States (SIDS)  the sustainable development goals are essential to allow for the implementation of development transformation. We must recognize that the current development framework of the majority of development institutions is still not favourable to the development of SIDS. Most development gains are still assessed ultimately through gross domestic product (GDP) per capita measurements  which do not adequately identify the threats to human development or the opportunities that exist  especially for small island States.Seychelles warmly welcomes the outcomes of the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  held in Apia  and would particularly like to thank the Government and people of Samoa for their leadership in establishing a platform for action to support the development of SIDS.Seychelles has championed three priorities that are outcomes of that conference. The first is the need for a vulnerability index to be used as a more effective tool for addressing the development needs of SIDS than GDP per capita. The second is the need to address the debilitating debt of SIDS through innovations  such as debt for climate change adaptation swaps. The third priority is the need to build opportunities for SIDS on the basis of their strengths  not their weaknesses; hence  the need to support a blue economy approach  whereby SIDS can better utilize their oceanic potential and whereby we can be large-ocean nations.Those three priorities are not specific only to SIDS. The development challenges of SIDS highlight the deficiencies of the development framework for all developing nations. A vulnerability index allows us to target those areas that place our societies at risk. An effective vulnerability index adopted by the United Nations will allow us to better target the diverse needs of SIDS  least developed countries and landlocked countries  as well as States threatened by desertification or those most prone to natural disasters. It is an inclusive view of development.Ownership of the blue economy also widens development perspectives for our whole planet. It is high time that we realize the immense potential of our oceans. We cannot apply the principles of a green economy and of sustainable development without recognizing that we are applying them in a blue world  for over 70 per cent of our planet is covered by oceans and seas. For developing nations  the ocean is a shared opportunity. It is therefore essential that we address our oceans  and the challenges therein appropriately  through a stand-alone sustainable development goal on oceans.The right to development belongs to us all. True development is therefore not only about economic growth or the total wealth that a country can create. It is about the constant improvement that we need for the well-being of people. It is about being able to build a future for our children based on shared opportunity. In that vein  I reiterate the call that the international community not spare any effort in helping the nations of West Africa to overcome the Ebola pandemic  which is a health issue of international concern. Ensuring that the affected communities have access to the right medical support will save lives not only in West Africa but across the world. Ebola is not just an African problem. It is a global problem.We also remain preoccupied by the conclusions of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. That is why SIDS have continuously underlined the scientific research being conducted on climate change  which shows that a warming of even 1.5°C will have a negative impact on all countries  even if islands are on the front line. However  the science also tells us that we still have a window where we can act decisively and effectively.A legally binding agreement that sets a course for increases of no more than 2°C is achievable  but all countries  large or small  must make it happen. It is not a subject that we can leave aside to take up later  to debate at a later date. We call on all partners to ensure that the upcoming Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  which will meet in Lima  sets the stage for concluding a meaningful and legally binding agreement in Paris in 2015.I would also like to reiterate the importance of fulfilling commitments to jointly mobilize over $100 billion annually by 2020 for the full operationalization of the Green Climate Fund  which should be capitalized as soon as possible. I also underline the importance of ensuring that the most vulnerable  in particular SIDS and African nations  have access to the appropriate resources as quickly as possible. Further  we call for SIDS to be part of the decision-makers on issues of climate change and to be allocated a permanent seat on the Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts.Seychelles will also continue to advocate for a solution to the debt trap in which many of us  especially SIDS  find ourselves. A solution that Seychelles has brought forward in partnership with the Nature Conservancy  an international non-governmental organization  is proposals for debt-for-adaptation swaps. SIDS are often constrained in their development because of large debt-to-GDP ratios. Transferring that debt into climate change adaptation projects will address the SIDS need for greater flexibility in addressing their development challenges while also making a real impact in terms of building climate change resilience by creating marine protected areas  not only locally  but globally. That concept will also allow for the application of climate change funding in order to achieve leverage for adaptation projects while reducing financial barriers for small island developing States.(spoke in French)Faced with the challenges of security  transnational crime and extremism  the United Nations requires significant reform and must rise above its divisions to help build a world in which human beings can live  wherever they are  in dignity and free from want and fear. More than ever  it is necessary to encourage the search for collective solutions to address all sorts of phenomenon that undermine the balance of our world.That is the sense that guides every action of my country. Seychelles is indeed ready to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century in a spirit of openness and dialogue with all peoples  for a world of peace and human brotherhood. We are working in Africa  particularly in the Indian Ocean  with a view to the region becoming one of shared peaceful  democratic and prosperous development.The Indian Ocean region is grateful to the United Nations  and the Seychelles once again thanks its specialized agencies  as well as our various partners  for the invaluable role each one has played and still plays in the fight against maritime piracy  which has already had a deep impact on our development plans. Statistics show that today maritime piracy has declined  but that hardly indicates that that threat has disappeared. Therefore  we must remain vigilant  and we still need the support of all to help dispel the profound aftereffects it has left for our economy. Over the years  maritime piracy has had serious repercussions on fishing  tourism  shipping and port services. Seychelles continues to work in harmony with all its partners  since any slackening in the face of that unpredictable phenomenon could have consequences.The Seychelles is actively involved with partners in our region and beyond to better target organizers of cross-border trafficking in the Indian Ocean zone. We have established a regional information centre that allows better coordination between our region’s forces and also aims to better manage the monitoring and protecting of our shared maritime space against the shared threats  whether piracy  narcotics trafficking or illegal fishing.In the same vein  the Seychelles will continue to support the Security Council decision to strengthen the United Nations-African Union partnership in Somalia. It is a difficult task  for which I wish to affirm our solidarity with the African and United Nations staff involved. I take the opportunity to urge the international community to continue supporting efforts to restore peace and reconciliation in Somalia. The international community must not lose patience in view of the mixed results achieved so far. For our part  we have taken action bilaterally and with regional and multilateral partners to help Somalia strengthen its capacities in areas such as fisheries management and development. The United Nations must always show the way and inspire the necessary efforts to bring together the means necessary in the struggle and to coordinate them with the States concerned.Seychelles also expresses solidarity with all African countries affected by conflict or instability. We are committed to working together so that we can build together  in the African Union  the transformative Africa that we foresee through our 2063 strategy.Seychelles  like all African countries  also expresses solidarity with the Palestinian people  given the challenges of the continuing conflict in the Middle East  and we reiterate our wish for peace between the two neighbouring States based on the 1967 borders.We also take the opportunity to recall the importance of lifting the economic embargo against Cuba  an island country that depends on trade access to better support its development  as all island States do.All those problems and challenges justify the United Nations remaining the leaven of international peace and security  but also and especially the conscience of humanity. Here I commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his remarkable work at the head of our Organization at a time when human history is facing enormous challenges. Indeed  much remains to be done  but optimism remains  for the helm is in good hands. The United Nations will effectively discharge its mission if all the nations that gave rise to it  large and small  provide it with the necessary means and entrust it with the responsibility for carrying out actions in the service of humanity. Seychelles  for its part  remains ready to play its role to its full capacity  in this noble and exciting mission."
"165",6673,"SYR",69,2014,"I would like to congratulate you  Sir  and your friendly country  Uganda  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its current session and to wish you success in leading the work of the session  bearing in mind the important and neutral role of the President of the General Assembly. I would also like to thank your predecessor  Mr. John Ashe  for his efforts.Many events and significant changes have taken place since I stood here last year (see A/68/PV.21). Those events have surprised many of the countries represented here today  but they did not surprise us  since we have been warning the international community about trends leading towards the current situation for the past three and a half years. Speeches from this rostrum have focused on the economic and political crises that we have been waiting for the international community to resolve. However  talking about such issues is no longer a priority.What we have been witnessing for a few months is much more dangerous than all the political and economic crises that have been happening in the world. More than once and from more than one international platform  we have talked about the grave threat of terrorism that is striking Syria. We said that such terrorism would not be limited to the territory of my country  since terrorism has no boundaries. Extremist ideologies acknowledge only themselves and do not recognize anything but slaughter  murder and torture. Today we are witnessing what the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)  the most dangerous terrorist organization in the entire world in terms of its unprecedented funding and brutality  is doing to Syrians and Iraqis of all stripes and religions. That terrorist organization is enslaving women  raping them and selling them in slave markets. It decapitates and cuts off limbs  teaches children to slaughter and murder and destroys historical and cultural monuments  as well as Islamic and Christian symbols.All that is happening before the eyes of the entire world and countries that have vowed always to fight terrorism  even though they themselves have not experienced the scourge of terror. Today I stand here to ask the following. Is it not time for all of us to stand united in the face of the serious threat of terrorist takfiri ideology worldwide? Has the time not come for all of us to admit that ISIL  the Nusra Front and other Al-Qaida affiliates will not remain within the borders of Syria and Iraq but will spread to every place that they can reach  starting with Europe and America? Should we not learn the lesson of what happened in previous years and unite all international efforts so as to deal with those groups? Those organizations have rallied extremists from all corners of the Earth and brought them to one place to train and arm them. They then spread their ideology and terrorism through those extremists back to where they came from.Some people may say that a resolution was recently adopted unanimously under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations in order to prevent the expansion of that organization and other terrorist groups and to eradicate them. It is true that it is better to arrive late than never. The resolution  adopted on 15 August  in fact came too late. However  the issue here is whether everyone is serious about its implementation  as we have not yet seen any serious steps to implement it. Furthermore  we have not seen any real sense of fear among the regional States that continue to provide all kinds of support to those terrorist groups  not enough fear to cause them to work for the implementation of the resolution. On the contrary  what we see on the part of the United States Administration is a policy of double standards and alliances in order to carry out certain political agendas  in particular by supporting with money  weapons and training groups that they call moderate.That will lead only to more violence and terrorism  the shedding of more Syrian blood  a protracted Syrian crisis and the prevention of any political solution. Such behaviour creates fertile ground for the growth of terrorist groups that are committing the most heinous crimes on Syrian territory. That requires all of us to seriously and effectively address and eradicate terrorism in order to restore security and stability in Syria and the region. Today  enslaved women look to us to see what we will do for them  their sisters and their children. The sons and daughters of the victims beheaded by ISIL await our action and our response in the face of the atrocities that are being committed daily by that terrorist organization  the Nusra Front and other groups.Combating terrorism cannot be achieved through unimplemented United Nations resolutions. Intentions are meaningless. We can fight terrorism through the real implementation of resolutions or  clearly  by means of military strikes. But  most importantly  it can be achieved by preventing States from arming  supporting  training  funding and smuggling those terrorist groups. We must also deprive terrorism of its resources. Striking terrorism militarily while some States continue to support terrorist groups will create a vicious cycle from which the international community will not escape for decades.Military strikes should take place at the same time as the implementation of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014)  adopted on 24 September under Chapter VII. We must also put pressure on countries that provide multifaceted support to such terrorist groups. Those countries are well known to us all. The most important issue is to put pressure on those countries that have exported and continue to export extremist Takfiri ideology  thereby seriously jeopardizing international peace and security. ISIL is an ideology transformed into an organization that is supported  armed and trained to be unleashed against Syria  Iraq and Lebanon like a monster.Let us together put an end to that ideology and its exporters. Let us simultaneously put pressure on the countries that have joined the coalition led by the United States so as to put an end to their support of armed terrorist groups. Only then does combating terrorism militarily become viable. Otherwise  our presence there will not measure up to the tears of the captives  enslaved women and children who have fallen victim to Daesh  the Nusrah Front and other groups.Once again  the Syrian Arab Republic reiterates that it stands with any international effort to combat terrorism. We stress that that must be done with full respect for the lives of innocent civilians and for national sovereignty  in conformity with international agreements. At the same time  the Syrian Arab Republic would like to thank all countries that have stood firm and rejected any prejudice to the sovereignty of other States  underscoring respect for international resolutions.It is high time to unite all our efforts against such terrorism  since everyone is surrounded by the imminent threat and no country is immune to it. My country maintains its declared position of the 1980s with regard to fighting terrorism before it becomes rampant  as is currently happening.In Syria we respect our commitments and honour our promises and pledges. We have confirmed that position on more than one occasion  particularly since the beginning of the Syrian crisis.Syria agreed unconditionally to attend the Geneva II Conference on Syria and participated in its deliberations with an open mind  although we were convinced that the solution to the crisis should be Syrian-owned and take place on Syrian territory. However  as a goodwill gesture  in order to put an end to the shedding of Syrian blood  we went to Geneva  only to find a delegation that was not negotiating on behalf of Syrians.First  that delegation has no influence whatsoever on the ground in Syria and has neither popularity nor legitimacy among the Syrian people. The delegation was negotiating with the Syrian Government while following the orders of its Western masters. It does not believe in combating or contronting terrorism. Furthermore  that delegation does not respect Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. and it verbally refuses to ask terrorist groups to stop their terrorist acts. We know that that opposition and delegation would not be able to pressure anyone  either armed groups or any Syrian faction on the ground.We went to Geneva with the priority of combating terrorism  since we believed  and continue to believe  that we cannot embark on any political solution while terrorism is still rampant in Syria. Some in Geneva opposed our acknowledging the fight against terrorism as a priority  although it is a paramount part of the provisions of the Geneva declaration. However  the delegation of the so-called coalition continued to reject any proposal to tackle or to condemn terrorism.Now we see the entire international community adopting our view that fighting terrorism is the top priority and that nothing whatsoever can be done as long as terrorism brutally strikes everything in its way and terrorists return to countries from which they came. Once again  we emphasize that we are ready for  and even actively seek  a political solution in Syria and talks with all honourable opposition members who oppose terrorism in Syria and among Syrians themselves on Syrian territory.Everyone assumed their responsibility in the presidential elections  which took place before the eyes of the world. The will of the Syrian people is greater than that of all those who have tried to suppress it for more than three years now. That was demonstrated when the entire world heard the voice of the Syrian people both inside Syria and beyond.Now  after the presidential elections  we would like to tell all those who desire and look forward to a political solution in Syria that they must first respect the Syrian people’s will  which was expressed explicitly  clearly  firmly and loudly. For the first time in Syria’s modern history  they chose their President in multiparty elections  with international monitors from several countries who witnessed the integrity and transparency of the elections  as well as the enthusiasm of the people to participate in them.I would like to emphasize that the Syrian people have made their choice. Those who want to speak on behalf of the people must first be representatives of the people and  secondly  must respect the people’s will and their decisions. Any dialogue must therefore be based on respect for the will of the Syrian people and their decisions. Accordingly  we are open to a political solution in Syria with a genuine opposition that seeks the prosperity  stability and security of Syria — an opposition that does not depend on external elements and speak on their behalf  an opposition that has an impact in Syrian territory and has deep roots inside Syria  not in hotels and Western capitals. It must be a national opposition that upholds fighting terrorism as its priority and encourages the ongoing national reconciliation efforts  paving the way for a successful political solution.Humanitarian needs in many basic areas have increased because of the continuing terrorist attacks in Syria. The inhumane sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States have exacerbated the poor living conditions of Syrian civilians. At the same time  my Government is striving to meet the basic needs of our citizens  in particular those forced by terrorist acts to flee their homes. We are doing that in cooperation with the United Nations and its humanitarian agencies  in the context of the humanitarian response plans agreed by those bodies with the Syrian Government.We should note that a great number of our people have been forced to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. Regrettably  some of those countries put displaced Syrians in military training camps resembling places of detention in order to train them to take up arms. From this rostrum  I underscore the fact that the Syrian State guarantees for those citizens who wish it a safe return and a decent life  free from the inhumane conditions that they suffer in those camps. I affirm Syria’s readiness to make every effort to deliver aid from international organizations to all Syrian citizens  without any discrimination whatsoever and wherever they are  in the context of respect for our national sovereignty.The Syrian Arab Republic confirms its resolve with regard to the full restoration of the occupied Syrian Golan up to the line of 4 June 1967. It also emphasizes its rejection of all actions taken by Israel  the occupying Power  to change the natural  geographical and demographic characteristics of the Golan  in clear violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions  in particular resolutions 497 (1981) and 465 (1980).Syria also affirms that the Palestinian question is the central issue for the Syrian people  who support the inalienable and legitimate rights of the brotherly Palestinian people  particularly their right to return  to self-determination and to establish an independent State on their land  with Jerusalem as the capital.Last September  Syria accepted the initiative of the President of the Russian Federation  His Excellency Mr. Vladimir Putin  and acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention on the basis of the need to render the Middle East a zone free of nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass destruction. We also wanted to prove to the whole world our commitment to stand firm against any use of chemical weapons. Syria has met its obligations pursuant to its accession to the Convention and has fulfilled its commitments despite the current difficult situation.Were it not for Syria’s cooperation with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)-United Nations Joint Mission  the Mission could not have completed that task. The Special Coordinator of the Joint Mission  Ms. Sigrid Kaag  expressed her happiness at and gratitude for the Syrian Government’s fruitful and constructive cooperation  which led to the completion of that unprecedented work.As a State party  Syria is committed to the full implementation of the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention within the framework of the OPCW. However  the big question remaining is whether those who are supplying terrorists with chemical and other types of weapons will stop doing so and abide by international law  especially the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Security Council resolutions related to terrorism.Syria stresses that a Middle East zone free of all weapons of mass destruction cannot be established unless Israel  the only nuclear Power in the region  accedes to all treaties banning the proliferation of such weapons and puts its nuclear facilities under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. At the same time  we emphasize the right of all countries to acquire and develop nuclear technology for peaceful uses.The imposition of unethical  unilateral coercive economic measures by the United States and the European Union contravenes international law and the principles of free trade. Therefore  we call for lifting the blockade that the United States has imposed on Cuba for decades  and we renew our call to lift and stop all the unilateral coercive measures imposed on Syria and the peoples of other countries  such as Iran  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  Venezuela and Belarus.We look forward to the United Nations being able to realize the aspirations of our peoples to live in dignity and to achieve development and food self-sufficiency  free from all forms of terrorism  tension and confrontation  in implementation of the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations  in particular safeguarding the States’ sovereignty and equality in rights and obligations. We also believe that priority should be given to concerted efforts by the international community to combat the terrorism of Daesh  Nusra Front and other Al-Qaida affiliates and to drain their resources so that security and stability will prevail in our region and the entire world."
"166",6718,"TCD",69,2014,"The sixty-ninth session offers us a theme that invites us to deepen exchanges on the development model that we want for the world post-2015. The theme  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  is perfectly in line with the theme of the sixty-eighth session  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”.At previous sessions  we have acknowledged that development through the achievement the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has not produced the expected results for many States. Among the main causes for this are the weakness of solidarity in financing the Goals; their poor adaptation to the concerns and realities of Africa; and the many global financial  food  environmental and security crises that arose. The unanimously welcomed drafting of a post-2015 agenda gave us the opportunity to review the MDGs in greater depth and to respond relevantly. Africa  for its part  has adopted a Common Position that requires the adherence of all States and their partners. This Common African Position is part of the Africa Vision 2063. That is why my country  Chad  fully supports it and hopes that this approach will figure prominently in the post-2015 agenda.Unfortunately  we note that on the eve of the important post-2015 meeting  the same security risks remain. Armed conflicts and the phenomenon of terrorism are becoming persistant threats in several areas of Africa. They are aggravated by the migratory phenomenon that deprives our continent  Africa  of its workforce. We must therefore join our efforts to bring adequate and energetic responses to these phenomena  which dangerously compromise the future of our continent.I take this occasion to hail the upsurge of solidarity that we are witnessing on the part of the international community in combating terrorism and underdevelopment. Africa remains in favour of various strategies for security and development in the Sahel initiated by the United Nations  the European Union and many other organizations. We hope that the implementation of these programmes will be effective so as to allow our continent to effectively combat these ongoing phenomena.Beyond international support  these security challenges require African countries to take their security into their own hands by implementing laws that will ensure security at the national  regional and continental levels. The countries of the Sahel — Burkina Faso  Mali  Mauritania  the Niger and Chad — have mobilized through the Group of Five countries of the Sahel to combine their efforts in building a strong system of resilience  good governance  security and peace. It is well known that the security of one country or region is directly linked to its development  that of its neighbours  and thereby to that of the entire continent.The terrorism summit convened by the African Union Peace and Security Council  over which we presided on 2 September in Nairobi  was a part of these constant efforts. It sought to consider in depth the terrorist threat and to agree specific and concrete measures to consolidate the efficacy of collective actions against this scourge. The summit also gave us the opportunity to highlight our solidarity with Kenya in particular  and more generally with the East African region  which is facing the threat of the terrorist Al-Shabaab group.The decision to create such mechanisms as the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises or the African regional force for the Sahel-Sahara and Central Africa  was the fruit of this regional and continental resolve to respond appropriately to terrorism  which is progressively gaining ground in Africa. We call on the countries of the Lake Chad Basin Commission to take the necessary measures to bring the joint multinational force into operation in order to combat the terrorist activities of Boko Haram.With respect to conflict resolution  Chad continues to contribute to peace and reconciliation in Africa. This goodwill is borne out by the organization on its territory  at Amdjarass in the north  of a forum of peace and reconciliation between the warring brothers of Darfur. Chad welcomes the holding of the Brazzaville forum on reconciliation and inclusive dialogue between Central African brothers  where it played an active part in seeking solutions to Central African crises.My country welcomes the inter-Malian dialogue towards a definitive return to peace and security in that country. It welcomes the reconciliation process under way in South Sudan to persuade the South Sudanese to take up the peace pipe. We are convinced that sincere dialogue and surpassing ourselves are virtues that can assist in resolving these issues. My country will continue to support this process of dialogue and reconciliation.Regarding the new Libya — a country that has barely begun to exist as a homogenous entity after the fall of the Al-Qadhafi’s regime and his assassination — the violence has intensified and the people live in constant fear. Libya’s neighbours are striving to assist that brotherly country to recover its stability. The entire international community is called upon to act on the severe security situation in that country. Libyan brothers of different political and social beliefs must understand that peace can come only from the Libyans themselves. They must therefore resolutely commit to a political settlement  the only proper path to ensure peace  unity and territorial integrity for Libya.Chad  a neighbouring country of Libya  the Central African Republic  the Sudan and Nigeria  is hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons who have fled armed conflicts or terrorist threats. Since 2003  we have welcomed more than 500 000 refugees from these neighbouring countries and more than 200 000 Chadians repatriated from Libya and the Central African Republic for security reasons  including displaced Chadians. A national plan for global response developed by the Government and its technical and financial partners has been adopted and is being implemented  but it requires the financial and material support of the international community.These various conflict situations are compounded by other  no less important challenges such as poverty  underdevelopment and illnesses. I note in particular the severe Ebola crisis affecting certain countries on the African continent  ravaging populations and gravely affecting the economies concerned. Chad will make its financial contributions to these countries. The international community must act  and act quickly  in a coordinated manner as the Ebola virus knows no borders. I commend the upsurge of solidarity on the part of the international community in containing the spread of this scourge.Beyond Africa  we call for a peaceful resolution to the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria  and between Israel and Palestine  to name but a few. On Palestine specifically  we feel that the disproportionate use of force and the human and material damage incurred in Gaza are unacceptable and challenge the human conscience. It is extremely urgent to find a solution to this conflict  which has lasted for far too long. We therefore call on all parties for restraint and dialogue in order to reach a just  global and lasting solution.Regarding the embargo to which Cuba has been subject for many years  we once again reiterate our call for it to be lifted  pure and simple.Peace  stability and development are intrinsically linked to respect for laws and universal shared values  of which justice is the basis. Nevertheless  we note with regret that these universal principles are not often respected  especially by the powerful of this world. This is the case for the International Criminal Court  which  instead of being neutral  impartial and independent  seems more to practise double standards and only pursues the weak. Some 90 per cent of indictees are Africans.The debate on the reform of the Security Council must be concluded  taking into account the interests and concerns of all States so that it reflects the actual makeup of the world. It is unjust that a billion inhabitants live in the only continent without a permanent representative in that organ.At the national level Chad has a national development plan for 2013-2015 and a national programme for food security which seek to ensure resilient and emerging development by 2025  supported by sustainable and diversified sources of growth that create added value and employment. The plan ensures that each Chadian has appropriate access to basic social services  decent housing and to adequate training opportunities. I again thank all our partners who announced their participation in financing these two programmes at the Paris conference in June.In order to promote a serene climate in national political life Chad has implemented mechanisms for political governance  the latest of which is the national framework for political dialogue created in April 2013. This mechanism is better adapted to current political events as it includes civil society along with political parties. These mechanisms have led to stability conducive to economic and social development in a country where challenges remain considerable.To improve governance  Chad has adhered to the monitoring mechanism of the African Union and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. That adherence clearly demonstrates our resolve to manage our national resources in complete transparency. Chad will continue to work to consolidate the rule of law and good governance through substantial reforms of its institutions  to combat unemployment by creating jobs for youth  and to combat poverty and food insecurity."
"167",6764,"TGO",69,2014,"I would like to extend to the President  on behalf of the people and Government of Togo  as well as on my own behalf  our warmest congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  my country’s sincere congratulations on and encouragement for his efforts to enable our Organization to meet the challenges facing our world.By giving the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly the theme “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  the President wished to remind Member States of their responsibility to spare no effort in defining  as we look ahead in the context of the post-2015 period  a development agenda commensurate with the challenges facing the world. Indeed  it is undeniable that defining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been beneficial to humankind. While not all of those goals will be achieved by all our States  our commitment to working together to attain them has enabled us to make notable progress towards each of the Goals throughout the world. The new development agenda should therefore provide States with an appropriate road map that takes into account the diversity and complexity of situations and developments resulting from the experience gained in implementing the MDGs.For its part  the Togolese Government remains determined and mobilized to continue and to scale up the necessary efforts in the context of a new post-2015 development programme with a view to a more tangible reduction in the level of poverty in our country. In recent years  the incidence of poverty has in fact been reduced by three points in Togo. That trend is supported by an improvement in the business climate that provides good prospects for increasing the success of the job creation programmes being implemented in the country for the benefit of young people.In that regard  we note  among other elements  the positive impact as a result of conducting several job creation and grass-roots development programmes. In the same spirit  we have established the National Fund for Inclusive Finance  whose goal is to make financial services accessible to the most vulnerable people  in particular women  who are generally excluded from access to credit from traditional financial institutions.In the field of agriculture  Togo continues to develop the National Agricultural Investment and Food Security Programme. Its implementation has led not only to satisfactory results in the context of food self-sufficiency but also to agricultural surpluses for several crop years  particularly that of 2013/14.In terms of health  encouraging results have been achieved in reducing the maternal and infant mortality rates and in combating HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis.With regard to the preservation of the environment and improvement in living conditions  robust actions have significantly increased the level of access to sanitation and clean water. Moreover  the Government has stepped up its adaptation efforts to curb the impact of climate change  in particular  with regard to disasters caused by economic imbalance  which undermines the well-being of our citizens. Our country is actively strengthening the institutional mechanism for disaster management. Togo has increased its contribution to the protection of world heritage and to international security through significant efforts in its resolute fight against the trafficking of protected species  as evidenced by the neutralization of several networks and the seizure of large quantities of ivory.The forward-looking vision of Togo as a country able to ensure and take ownership of its development in all respects has led the Government to initiate Vision Togo 2030. Launched in April  that initiative is based on a participatory approach. It should ultimately  with the accelerated growth and job creation strategy  allow my country to better ensure its achievement of the MDGs and the post-2015 development agenda  which we wholeheartedly desire. I would like to thank the entire United Nations system and all the countries that have helped us to achieve the progress made.The situation of chronic instability prevailing in Africa today  in particular in the Sahel-Sahara region  is of concern. With its experience as a non-permanent member of the Security Council  on which it served in 2012 and 2013  my country  Togo  is now more certain than ever that our agenda for peace and the new architecture for international security must reflect the new situation of the regionalization of conflicts.Unfortunately  another factor that further threatens the survival of States and their development efforts is terrorism. In Africa  for example  Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab frequently carry out acts that destabilize brother countries  such as Nigeria  Cameroon  Somalia and Kenya. Nevertheless  my country welcomes the joint efforts of the international community  which helped to thwart the armed terrorist groups  in particular in Somalia and Mali. We truly appreciate the efforts of the French Government to remain engaged in the Sahel region so as to continue the fight against terrorists alongside African countries in Operation Barkhane. However  it is important that such efforts continue and strengthen and that the international community spare no effort in supporting the affected African countries  just as it has mobilized to counter the spread of terrorism in Iraq  Syria and elsewhere in the world.Beyond the effective control of borders  in vast geographical areas such as the Sahel  which in recent years has mobilized the international community to fight against terrorism  it is  in our view  equally essential to further secure our coasts in order to eradicate  with the same determination  maritime piracy.In that spirit  mindful of the stakes involved  Togo took the initiative to host an international conference on maritime security and economic development in Africa in Lomé in 2015 under the auspices of the African Union. Togo seeks to play a leading role in providing  with the support of all like-minded partners  a framework to implement measures that have been recommended on various occasions to make the African coast a key space for international trade  free of organized predators  who instil fear along our coasts.With regard to the promotion of peace  stability and security in our countries  the deteriorating situation in the Central African Republic  Libya  South Sudan  Syria  Palestine  Ukraine and elsewhere in the world is of the gravest concern to us owing to the harmful consequences. Such repercussions are likely to call into question the very existence of those countries and to destroy their precious development efforts.My country  Togo  has recovered stability. It is moving forward towards a new horizon with renewed confidence. The daughters and sons of Togo have now chosen to build the future in a climate of peace and national harmony. Election after election  Togolese democracy is being built and strengthened through dialogue and consultation. It is being established with functioning institutions  with the support and vigilance of a determined civil society and all citizens  who are more aware than ever of the remaining challenges to overcome in terms of democracy.The plan for our society  which is mobilizing Togo  seeks above all to make the country an active and responsible member of the international community  determined to work hand in hand with other nations  so as to systematically thwart the conduits of tension  break the cycle of violence everywhere and prevent entrenched insecurity. Those are prerequisites not only for social peace but also for economic development.I cannot conclude my statement without reminding the Assembly of the great peril to human survival threatening the entire African continent  and West Africa in particular  with the outbreak of the Ebola virus. In that regard  I would like to welcome the Security Council’s adoption of resolution 2177 (2014)  which describes the disease as a threat to international peace and security.Recognizing the importance of human capital in development work  my country welcomes efforts by multilateral and bilateral actors to stem the epidemic. We launch an urgent appeal to the bodies of the United Nations system and to States to be more concerned about the fate of our populations  in particular  those in Liberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea  by supporting our efforts to save the infected and prevent the spread of the disease  which knows no boundaries.I hope that the common values that we share and affirm resonate well beyond the confines of diplomatic negotiations and that daily find direct and clear expression in places where peace  security and shared prosperity are tangibly enjoyed."
"168",6809,"THA",69,2014,"I am here to pay my country’s highest tribute to the United Nations for the work it has done to improve the lives of people around the world. Thailand is fully committed to what the United Nations stands for and to realizing through the United Nations the hopes we all share. We are also firmly committed to fulfilling our responsibilities as a Member of the United Nations  because the United Nations can achieve its vision only when we act together in unity.This year  the theme is the post-2015 development agenda and how to truly make a difference in the lives of the people on the ground. Many countries have achieved many of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). For example  they have succeeded in reducing poverty and have achieved their education and health-care goals. But there are many other countries for which achieving the MDGs has not been easy. Therefore  as we move towards the post-2015 development agenda  we must renew our commitments to make sure that no one is left behind.For Thailand  development is not just about gross domestic product. To be sustainable  development must go hand in hand with democracy  human rights and peace and security  the pillars of the United Nations. It must be allowed to grow in an environment that is free from conflict. Building a strong and robust democracy is the challenge that many of us face. As in many countries  Thailand has learned the lesson that democracy is more than having elections. Democracy must be based on respect for the rule of law  and it must be about good governance  transparency  accountability and equal access to justice.That was not the case for my country before 22 May. Before that date  we were at a political impasse. We had a dysfunctional democracy. We were in danger of more turmoil. And there was a very real possibility of bloodshed. Political opposition parties were given the chance to save democracy  but they failed because they were unwilling to compromise for the sake of the country. That chain of unfortunate events made the military intervention necessary. We all wished that things had not had to turn out that way. But if the situation had been allowed to continue  Thailand’s democracy would have been torn apart. That would have undermined Thailand’s stability and the stability of the region.Thailand is now going through a period of transition. We remain fully committed to democracy and human rights  and we know we cannot go against the tide of democracy. Thailand needs a real and functioning democracy  one that delivers on the aspirations of the people. Let there be no doubt that Thailand is not retreating from democracy. But we do need time and space to bring about reconciliation  undertake political reform and strengthen our democratic institutions. We do not want a repeat of what happened on 22 May.In addition to implementing our road map for returning to full democracy  we are also getting our economy moving again. Confidence has returned and growth has been restored.Thailand is committed to playing an active role with its partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in order to build an ASEAN community of peace and prosperity. We are committed to working with our partners in the international community to address the many global challenges we face  such as climate change  transnational crime  pandemics and human trafficking. Most of all  we are committed to working with our partners to realize the development agenda  because real and lasting peace is based not on State-centred security but on people-centred security.Development must transform people’s lives and open the door to a better future for all. Development must empower individuals  communities and societies. That lies at the heart of the sufficiency-economy philosophy of His Majesty the King of Thailand  and that philosophy has guided our development efforts for decades. The sufficiency economy is about promoting the right values  drawing on the inner strengths of each community and building resilience from the grass-roots level up. In doing so  we are able to lay a solid foundation for sustainable economic development at the national level.But in today’s world  no nation can be an island of prosperity unto itself. More than ever  we need a strong global partnership  whether in order to realize the post-2015 development agenda or to meet shared challenges.First of all  that partnership must meet the challenge of human security  the most pressing of our time. Human security is about human dignity  human rights  equity  equality and social justice  the promise of a better future for all and ensuring that in our rush for development we do not sacrifice the environment that sustains us. Ensuring human security should be at the heart of sustainable development.But while we advance the development agenda  we cannot ignore the immediate threats that require our concerted action. Today we are confronted with some immediate threats to the global partnership  such as the Ebola crisis and the humanitarian crises in the Middle East — Syria  Libya  Iraq and the Gaza Strip. It pains us to witness the senseless death of civilians  especially children  in the conflict in the Gaza Strip. The situation demands that we work even harder to bring lasting peace to the Palestinian people and to meet their aspirations to statehood  as well as to affirm the legitimate right of the Israeli people to security.As the situation in the Middle East unfolds  we are also deeply concerned about the rising threat of radicalism and extremism. There can be no justification for the brutalities and atrocities we have seen. We must rise to that challenge to peace  to our peoples’ livelihoods and to the gains we have made in economic and social development. While some radical and extremist movements have indeed been able to draw recruits from many parts the world  their mission is nothing more than the use of terrorism and fear of to advance their objectives.Our peace and security and development are all connected. In order to achieve them  we must all try to contribute as much as we can and to meet our international responsibilities as best we can. Some of us may have the capacity to do more than others. But if we all do our part  we can make the world better and safer. That is why Thailand has sent volunteers to its neighbours to work in health and education and why we sent medical teams to Japan in 2011 as part of the relief efforts following the earthquake and tsunami.The Thai flag and Thai personnel have been associated with peacekeeping operations in many places around the world. We were in Timor-Leste and in the Sudan  and along the India-Pakistan border. And we were part of the coalition formed to combat piracy in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia. The role of the military  however  is not limited to war and conflict alone. Even in times of peace it plays an important role  especially now  when we are dealing with many challenges such as natural disasters. That is why Thailand is promoting humanitarian assistance and disaster relief cooperation in the ASEAN region and beyond. Perhaps the time has come for ASEAN to begin to explore the idea of a regional humanitarian assistance disaster recovery task force.As members of the international community  we must all share the responsibility to stay true to the original promise of the United Nations  which is to promote social progress and better standards of living in larger freedom for the peoples of the world. It is because of Thailand’s commitment to the United Nations that we have submitted our candidature for a seat on the Human Rights Council for the 2015-2017 term and on the Security Council for the 2017-2018 term. We hope our friends will once again give us their trust and allow us to serve.Whether the issue is democracy  development or peace  we all must assume our responsibilities because we are  after all  a family of United Nations."
"169",6834,"TJK",69,2014,"It is my great pleasure to endorse the warm congratulations extended to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election to the responsible post of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I take this opportunity to express gratitude to Mr. John Ashe for his important contribution to the work of the General Assembly at its prior session.My delegation shares the determination to eradicate hunger and poverty and to promote progress in elaborating the post-2015 development agenda. In our view  the post-2015 development agenda must be based on the foundation of the development goals formulated in the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and envisage ways and means of responding to the challenges of a new generation.The main goal of the post-2015 development agenda should be the eradication of poverty and inequality  as well as promoting sustainable development based on balanced consideration of social  economic and environmental factors. The sustainable development goals  based on the three pillars of sustainable development  the Rio de Janeiro principles and national specificities and priorities  should serve as the key components of the post-2015 development agenda. In that respect  we support the recommendations of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. Experience has shown that a goal can be achieved only if specific plans are complemented by the development of effective mechanisms for its review and implementation. Our hope is that this forum will become an important venue for ongoing dialogue and review of the implementation of the sustainable development goals.Addressing issues concerning the financing of sustainable development efforts is equally important in achieving sustainable development. Global partnerships for development based on the Millennium Declaration have contributed to a certain extent towards the achievement of a number of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). However  gaps and flaws in global partnerships continue to cause additional difficulties on the path towards full and timely implementation of the MDGs.We consider it necessary to strengthen and expand global partnerships in accordance with previous commitments. On that basis  new global partnerships should be established for the benefit of sustainable development  which will become the key element of the global system of promoting and advancing sustainable development. In that regard  we note the key importance of the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing  the intergovernmental process tasked with discussing proposals to establish a United Nations mechanism to promote development and technology transfer.Tajikistan has consistently strengthened its efforts to achieve the MDGs. Extra measures have been undertaken to create a favourable investment climate  including a balanced budget policy  diversifying the economy and increasing employment opportunities.The National Development Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan up to 2015 is a road map for the Government to achieve sustainable economic growth  to provide the population with better access to basic social services and to reduce poverty.As a result of such measures to ensure economic growth  in recent years we have managed to significantly reduce the level of poverty in the country. As a United Nations pilot country for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  we plan to carry out a comprehensive review of the implementation of those Goals in Tajikistan in 2015. The lessons learned from the implementation of the MDGs will be taken into account during the development of a new programme of sustainable development for the period up to 2030. We are willing to closely cooperate in a transparent way with United Nations agencies and programmes  partner countries and other relevant organizations.As members may be aware  on 22 March 2005  in New York  we saw the launch of the International Decade for Action  “Water for Life”  2005-2015  which promoted the coordinated implementation of the MDGs. The International Decade provided a strong impetus for various initiatives and efforts at different levels to promote access to safe drinking water and sanitation  to advance the integrated management of water resources  to strengthen and expand water cooperation and to raise awareness of water-related challenges.At the same time  global climate change  increasing economic growth  higher population levels  the degradation of water sources and the deteriorating quality of water resources present the international community with additional extensive challenges. The reduction in water resources as a result of climate change may impede the achievement of sustainable development and aggravate the situation  in particular in arid and semi-arid regions  which continue to experience the greatest water shortages.The International Year of Water Cooperation  which took place last year in the context of promoting the International Decade of Action  “Water for Life”  2005-2015  underscored the need for water resources management to be regulated on the basis of the principle of joint development  which provides for a broad framework for the harmonization of interests and the strengthening of mutual trust in addressing water issues. On the basis of the principle of joint development  water resources management could ensure the sustainable management of water resources  which is a key component of sustainable development. In that regard  we propose conducting a comprehensive review of the implementation of the International Decade of Action  “Water for Life”  2005-2015  and jointly developing specific recommendations to strengthen and revitalize the United Nations water agenda.We believe access to modern and affordable energy services to be a key priority for achieving sustainable development. Tajikistan continues to consistently and comprehensively develop its energy potential  focusing on the integrated development of renewable sources. In addition to the construction of small- and medium-scale hydropower plants  larger regional projects are being developed. We are also exploring opportunities for the use of wind and solar energy. Through such projects  Tajikistan is significantly and specifically contributing to the reduction of harmful emissions and to the establishment of a solid foundation for sustainable development. I would like to take this opportunity to underscore that all those projects are being implemented in a transparent way  with due consideration for the social  economic and ecological aspects of the sustainable development of the country and the entire region.Tajikistan supports the holding of the Ten-Year Review Conference on the Implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action on 3 to 5 November in Vienna. We believe that the new programme of action for the landlocked least developed countries will provide additional opportunities for the further integration of such countries into the world economy. We should support and encourage as much as possible way the efforts of that group of countries to expand and to improve transport and energy infrastructure  the diversification of the economy and the streamlining of regional and interregional connectivity.While the Organization’s transformative agenda provides unique opportunities  unfortunately  it also tends to strengthen the interlinkage between today’s threats and challenges. It is in the common interests of Member States to consistently implement the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and to effectively counter terrorism in all its forms and manifestations  including the use of the Internet for the purpose of terror.Illicit drug production and drug trafficking are also serious global issues. In recent decades  Tajikistan has gained extensive experience in combating drug trafficking. Under the country’s President  the Drug Control Agency has been functioning successfully for 15 years. We have been actively strengthening counter-narcotics cooperation with neighbouring States  including within regional organizations. At the initiative of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan  Emomali Rahmon  Dushanbe will host a regional anti-narcotics conference in 2015  a year before the special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem. The proposals of the conference participants will jointly help to develop a new international counter-narcotics policy. We look forward to the support of the United Nations  relevant States and international organizations for that conference.In that regard  we attach great significance to coordinated and joint efforts with Afghanistan in combating drugs  as well as on other issues. The friendly Islamic State of Afghanistan is facing new challenges and expects the appropriate support from the international community. We are convinced that the fraternal Afghan people  with the support of the community of nations  will be able to successfully address the difficulties facing them. We believe that  in the current circumstances  the United Nations must take the lead in coordinating international efforts for the resolution of the question of Afghanistan.Tajikistan believes that Afghanistan must be fully involved in the multifaceted regional cooperation process. It is critical to fully include Afghanistan in the multifaceted regional cooperation processes. The involvement of neighbouring countries in the development of Afghanistan  while taking into account the regional context in the post-conflict rehabilitation of the country  is key to the success of the ongoing efforts of the international community.In our view  strengthening lasting peace and stability in conflict and post-conflict situations requires genuine assistance in addressing economic and social issues and support for efforts to restore effective Government institutions and a sustainable basis for long-term development. The regional multilateral structures must actively participate in strengthening security and stability  in implementing large-scale infrastructure projects and programmes and in expanding constructive and concrete cooperation and interaction.In early September  Dushanbe  the capital of Tajikistan  hosted the fourteenth summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The heads of the SCO member States called for the strengthening of regional cooperation  joint development and mutual prosperity. They adopted measures on the liberalization of trade and investment and the improvement of transport and communications systems and on ensuring food and energy security. They also addressed other urgent regional issues of fundamental interest to our people.In conclusion  I would like to stress that it is impossible to resolve the issues facing the General Assembly without strengthening  reforming  rationalizing and updating the entire United Nations system. Comprehensive reform of the United Nations should contribute to its strengthening and the enhancement of its capacity to respond to the latest developments in the world in a timely and adequate manner and to meet modern challenges and counteract modern threats. The current Assembly session provides a unique opportunity for the search of joint coordinated ways of addressing pressing issues  which we need take full advantage of."
"170",6855,"TKM",69,2014,"First  I have the honour to convey words of greeting and wishes of peace and prosperity to the Member States and their people on behalf of the President of Turkmenistan  Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow. I should like to congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election to the post of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session and wish him success in his forthcoming responsibilities. I should also like to express my appreciation to Mr. John Ashe  President at the sixty-eighth session  for his skillful and effective work in this post.The current session of the General Assembly is taking place against the background of difficult processes that we see in various regions of the world. Assessment of these processes and their causal relationships may differ  but it is apparent that in view of prevailing conditions the world community needs to apply balanced  sober and a highly responsible approach to emerging and potential challenges and threats.The peaceful resolution of these conflicts must be achieved by diplomatic approaches. It is an objective and imperative requirement of our times. Experience once again vividly demonstrates that there is no military solution to the international and internal conflicts in today’s world. It is our firm conviction that the role of the United Nations is acquiring decisive importance. The United Nations must play the leading role in reconciling contradictions  preserving global stability  and strengthening peoples’ faith in international institutions and legal frameworks.The Security Council is called on to assume a special responsibility. Its functions and authority under the United Nations Charter cannot be questioned or used to satisfy some individual or group interest. The Security Council is and must remain the only universal legitimate body for maintaining global peace and stability and safeguardingthe political and moral foundations of the modern global architecture.Turkmenistan has unceasingly and consistently advocated the expansion and maximum use of the United Nations peacekeeping potential. Today  the need for this is especially relevant. Therefore  our country proposes to actively begin the development of common approaches with a view to reducing and  in future  completely eliminating all potential risks of confrontation.As the Assembly will recall  the President of Turkmenistan stated at the sixty-sixth session that it was necessary to adopt a United Nations declaration on the priority use of political and diplomatic means to solve international problems and their further consideration at the General Assembly. We are ready to engage in meaningful and constructive discussions with all interested parties on this issue.The logic of the development of global processes in the sphere of security dictates the need for fundamental strengthening of regional cooperation mechanisms. For Central Asia  such cooperation should ensure favourable conditions for preserving and maintaining lasting peace and stability and for successful responses to terrorist threats  extremism  organized crime and drug trafficking.In this connection  we consider it relevant to create a standing mechanism of political consultations to coordinate steps aimed at maintaining security in this area  as well as preventing and neutralizing conflict situations and combating new threats. We propose that serious consideration be given to the idea of convening a forum on security and cooperation in Central Asia under the auspices of the United Nations as a starting platform for further work in this area.We stand ready to host such a forum in 2015 in Turkmenistan’s capital  Ashgabat. As the host country of the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia  Turkmenistan advocates multilateral support for its work  which has proven to be highly effective. It is not by chance that in August 2012 the United Nations Security Council emphasized the great importance of preventive diplomacy and early settlement of disputes and in this connection supported the efforts of the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia. We are convinced that in the context of current and future developments of political  economic  environmental and humanitarian processes in the Central Asian region and neighbouring areas  the mandate of the Centre will be especially relevant and necessary. We therefore call for more active involvement of that Centre in various aspects of regional problems with the support of Member States.Turkmenistan also believes that it is essential to establish a more focused and substantive interaction between the Regional Centre and international organizations  including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  the European Union  the Shanghai Cooperation Organization  the Commonwealth of Independent States  and other bodies  with a view to elaborating common approaches to such current issues as transnational threats  terrorism  illegal drug trafficking  environmental challenges  management of transboundary water and energy resources  and regional security in the context of the situation in Afghanistan.In speaking of this  I wish to underline that the settlement of the situation in Afghanistan is a key factor in achieving regional peace and stability. It is essential to support the positive processes that are taking place in this country and to provide the Afghan people with real assistance in achieving reconciliation and accord. That can be achieved only through peaceful negotiation. There are no other options here.As a neutral country and Afghanistan’s immediate neighbour  Turkmenistan offered its political space for the organization of a broad-based inter-Afghan national dialogue under the auspices and active involvement of the United Nations. We already have joint experience in conducting negotiations in such a format. We believe that it could be used today as well. Such dialogue  in addition to purely political aspects  implies the discussion of a full set of measures aimed at providing specific economic support to Afghanistan and the involvement of that country in regional integration processes and future infrastructure projects.For many years Turkmenistan has provided assistance to its neighbour in building social facilities and initiated the implementation of major transport and energy projects with Afghanistan’s participation. In particular  I note the project envisaging construction of the Turkmenistan/Pakistan/India gas pipeline  preparations for which are nearing the final stages. Another major project  which was launched in May last year  involves the construction of a Turkmenistan/Afghanistan/Tajikstan railway. We consider these projects to be key in rebuilding the economy and social spheres of Afghanistan  and enabling it to make thetransition to a peaceful and creative existence.For a number of years our country has consistently supplied electric power to Afghanistan on highly favourable terms. In the near future  thanks to the commissioning of new power-generating capacities in Turkmenistan  we are prepared to increase the volume of power supplied to Afghanistan many-fold. As in the past  we provide purpose-oriented training of specialists for the Afghan economy  health care and social spheres. We will continue to provide all-encompassing help to the fraternal Afghan people. It is our principled position.Turkmenistan believes that the irreversible nature of the disarmament process is the most important prerequisite for the peaceful and creative development of the region and the establishment of a climate of trust  openness and cooperation in Central Asia. Our country proceeds from the assumption that the inert model of the past century  which was based on the constant build-up of armaments  has become irrelevant in today’s world. Furthermore  it considerably hampers and sometimes directly undermines efforts by States towards social and economic development  the enhancement of people’s standards of living  and the development of successful economic cooperation. It is our conviction that the fewer weapons there are in the world  the more stable and peaceful its development will be  and the more trust and understanding among countries and peoples will deepen.We call for consistent strengthening of international and regional cooperation in reducing the arsenals of weapons of mass destruction and the effective implementation of the non-proliferation regime. As a party to the basic disarmament treaties and conventions of the United Nations  Turkmenistan intends to continue to provide support to all the relevant processes.In this connection  while emphasizing the landmark nature of the first session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons that was held in Vienna in 2012  Turkmenistan believes that it is key to continue the current dialogue on measures aimed at expanding the international legal framework of non-proliferation.This dialogue becomes especially relevant in view of the practical steps that are being taken in order to implement the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia. Our country stands ready to engage in constructive disarmament cooperation with the Office of the Deputy Secretary-General and to participate in the implementation of a number of initiatives in this regard. One of the practical steps in the implementation of measures for disarmament could be the improvement of existing United Nations structures. In this context  we believe that it will be useful to consider the establishment of a United Nations subregional disarmament centre in Central Asia.Turkmenistan looks forward to the logical continuation at this session of the broad-based dialogue on energy security as one of the fundamental elements of the United Nations sustainable development strategy initiated by the President of Turkmenistan. As is well known  in May 2013 the General Assembly unanimously adopted resolution 67/263 entitled “Reliable and stable transit of energy and its role in ensuring sustainable development and international cooperation”. The resolution was sponsored by 71 Member States. The adoption of the resolution was yet another major and consecutive step in advancing international cooperation in the sphere of energy. We believe that adherence to the letter and spirit of that document should acquire a substantive and purpose-oriented nature.In this connection  we call on Member States and the Secretariat to actively undertake consultations on the practical implementation of the provisions of this resolution. In particular  we note the institutionalization of the work of the international group of experts on energy cooperation and nominating representatives of Member States to that group. In December  the first international meeting of experts will take place in Turkmenistan. It is designed to launch systematic work on the establishment of a new legal framework of cooperation in sustainable energy. We invite Member States and all interested parties to take part in it.The outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro  entitled “The future we want” (resolution 66/288  annex)  emphasizes the central role of transport and mobility in sustainable development. We fully share that approach. Moreover  Turkmenistan is convinced that it is high time to undertake systematic global cooperation and strategic planning in transport as a separate  long-term area of United Nations activity.In early September  Turkmenistan’s capital hosted a high-level international conference dedicated to the role of transport and transit corridors in ensuring international cooperation  stability and sustainable development. The Ashgabat Declaration adopted at the end of the Conference reflects the need to develop new modern criteria for cooperation in this sphere that are oriented towards diversification  security  accessibility  environmental safety of the transportation infrastructure  and its maximum correspondence to the realities of current global development  taking into account the needs of developing countries  including landlocked States. As the President of Turkmenistan emphasized in his address to the participants at that conference  the global transport strategy of the twenty-first century is a strategy for integration  combining geographical and infrastructural opportunities with the technical and technological potentials of States and regions.The very fact of the convening of that conference was a momentous event  signalling a comprehensive approach to the development of transport and transit corridors based on constructive and real partnerships. Our country has submitted the Ashgabat Declaration to the Secretariat for its distribution among Member States as an official document. We hope that it will be studied with interest and that there will be further use of this Declaration in international agreements  including those of the sixty-ninth session of the Assembly.With a view to the accelerated development of international transport infrastructure  Turkmenistan advocates closer cooperation and partnerships with specialized bodies of the United Nations  first and foremost the Economic Commission for Europe and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. We are convinced that such cooperation corresponds to the logic of modern development and international cooperation in transport in the Eurasian continent.Turkmenistan fully supports the decisions taken during the Summits on Climate Change held in Copenhagen and Cancún  at the seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Durban  and at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. We look forward to the continuation of constructive international dialogue on these issues. We are convinced that it is necessary to consistently combine efforts at the international  regional and national levels. In this context  we welcome the Secretary-General’s efforts to implement the agreed-upon decisions and his sense of utmost responsibility in his approach to international cooperation with respect to climate change issues. Our country recently launched a number of specific initiatives aimed at enhancing regional and global cooperation in this sphere.I wish to single out Turkmenistan’s humanitarian efforts as a member of major United Nations humanitarian agencies. Turkmenistan takes practical steps to ensure the rights and freedoms of its citizens. In particular  our country devotes major attention to solving issues relating to the rights of refugees  migrants and stateless persons. Last June  in our capital  the Government of Turkmenistan  along with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  organized the International Conference on Migration and Statelessness. Upon its conclusion  the Conference adopted a declaration that spells out urgent tasks to improve multilateral cooperation  strengthen international legal frameworks  and reform national legislation on migrants andstateless persons and their legal and social protection  material support and adaptation. Turkmenistan will endeavour at this session to translate the main provisions of this outcome document into reality. We reaffirm our desire and readiness to continue close cooperation with the IOM  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  Member States and all stakeholders.Our country views the sixty-ninth session as a major step towards consolidating international efforts to resolve key issues on the global agenda  to reaffirm the leading role of the United Nations in maintaining and strengthening universal peace and stability and to agree on sustainable development goals. We reaffirm our strong commitment to cooperation with the United Nations  our readiness to actively participate and promote its peacekeeping  political and diplomatic endeavours and to implement its projects and programmes in the economic  social  environmental  humanitarian and other spheres.For Turkmenistan  partnership with the United Nations has been and continues to be a strategic priority  a conceptual and practical foundation for our activities in the international arena."
"171",6869,"TLS",69,2014,"In September 2000  before becoming an independent country and while under the administration of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor  we came to the General Assembly as observers in order to familiarize ourselves with the grand designs for the new century  in the form of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Twelve years after Timor-Leste was admitted into this prestigious Organization  here we are again to take part in a review of what has been done and of what has not been done  looking at reasons and impacts.Ultimately we want to revise the Assembly’s manner of operation and redefine plans and strategies. However  other speeches made both here and at the Security Council open debate yesterday (S/PV.7272) show the other face — the more troubling one — of world problems  which is the general unquietness of spirit and the pressure to use force in order to punish. I therefore add my voice to all those who spoke before me in stating my deep concern about the particularly difficult time in which the community of nations is living. The United Nations has been the unassailable forum for approaching international issues and continues to be the hope of millions of people throughout the world.In the year 2000  the challenges came from the condition of extreme poverty  educational deficits  enormous scarcity in terms of doctors and medication and lack of food production that affected the populations of many underdeveloped countries. Fourteen years later  little has been achieved despite the effort of the community of nations. Fragile or conflict-affected countries are the furthest from achieving the MDGs. Worse still  the challenges of the year 2000 have taken on a new path  with an increase in problems related to the rise of tensions and conflicts in many parts of the world.The Organization’s true greatness and its global leadership ability are measured in difficult times such as these  where the search for peaceful solutions through more intense dialogue may well determine the future of humankind. In order to respond to the challenges  we need an Organization that operates effectively. We need an Organization that is more active and less stereotyped — an Organization that strengthens cooperation with other organizations  particularly regional ones  and that acts with great respect for the sovereignty and the particularities of each State.Every action carried out so far has just been a continuation of past measures that  in most cases  failed to achieve results that can be considered positive. We are witnessing an increasing loss of trust and we are faced with a crisis of values. More than trying to grasp the nature of the issues that are causing us to react  we must seek to understand the true causes of the problems. When faced with a threat that does not respect borders and that jeopardizes our commitment towards tolerance and peace  it is vital that we better understand the interconnectedness of problems  so as to locate the civility gap that prevents us from talking to each other and from finding consensus.We have always advocated the view that the use of military force does not establish universal values or build democracies. Misguided approaches that fail to recognize the various and diverse elements of threats or  worse still  that are based on contradictions and conflicts of interest  only serve to fuel the fire of radicalism and extremist actions. Accordingly  we must reflect and think things over  because as they stand  we are merely sliding into the darkness of war  upholding the ancient principle of “an eye for an eye  a tooth for a tooth”.That is why I reiterate to the General Assembly that our collective efforts to preserve world peace and security must reject ill-conceived plans that are only motivated by the strategic interests of the large Powers and their will to dominate. Instead  we need a plan that is more suited to the reality of each situation and that provides a true response to the main causes of the current crisis. This common agenda should not manipulate facts to produce collective reactions  but rather admit past mistakes related to the urge to impose peace through war. Only by correcting our way of thinking and acting will we truly be giving peace a chance.The responses to the crises faced by humankind should not be weakened by the desire to end war by waging war. Instead  they must be based on the desire to build a world of peace  supported by dialogue and by an effort — herculean  if need be — to respond to the root causes of problems that lead to terrorism  racism  extremism and intolerance. When dozens of millions of people throughout the world suffer the horrors of conflict and the countless abuses perpetrated in this century of globalization  the actions by the international community should give priority to the establishment of the best mechanisms for resolving the problems of exclusion  discrimination and marginalization of groups  sects and ethnicities.We must also ensure  from the very start  that the societies emerging from the ashes of those conflicts and committed to leaving the memories of the past behind are entitled to a vital transitional period with respect to their behaviours  their ways of thinking and acting  and their own internal rules and commitments. Otherwise  we will just be sowing the seeds for new conflicts that we may end up reaping later on. The war in Iraq  which has destroyed the legacy of a centuries-old civilization  and the bloody conflicts in Afghanistan  Libya  Syria and Ukraine  should make the international community draw its conclusions about the international standards applied in those contexts. The uncertainty and the bloody anguish that surround Israel and Palestine  with those two peoples destined to live side by side  should alert us once and for all to the fact that fear and insecurity for the future lead to hate  which is the root of all evils.Timor-Leste knows only too well the consequences and the scars of war. In addition to the hundreds of thousands of Timorese killed  we also witnessed the near-complete destruction of our country. A State born without the ability to ensure and promote the fundamental rights and liberties of its citizens is a fragile State that is unable to carry out its main mission.Immediately after the war  we started to reconcile Timorese society. We wanted to achieve peace  since without peace we could not feel free. We have also embraced Indonesia in order to achieve true and genuine reconciliation. Instead of feeding hatred and vengeance  we nurtured solidarity and tolerance between our communities. In that manner  we cultivated a sound relationship of cooperation between our States and our peoples.Western democracies are prone to paying for costly international tribunals for judging genocides. They also tend to feel shocked by the human rights violations that occur in developing countries. The issue with Indonesia cannot be seen only in terms of the actions by its military and its generals. Instead  it must be seen within a broader perspective  in which the Governments of the Western Powers sold sophisticated weapons like rifles  warships  fighters  ammunition  tanks and cannons to the Indonesian military  in addition to providing it with training  so that it could decimate the Timorese. That is why we Timorese and Indonesians preferred instead to record the truth of the facts  to close this painful chapter in our past and to look to the future  which required and continues to require much effort to develop both nations and improve the living conditions of both peoples.With its pluralistic and tolerant society  Indonesia is more than a close neighbour. Indeed  it is an inspiration for Timor-Leste. Under the wise leadership of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  we have witnessed the establishment of a modern democracy that harmonizes progress with the promotion of national  regional and international peace. We sincerely hope that the peaceful transition to President Joko Widodo will bring more success to that great nation. And I say this in a year when Timor-Leste is celebrating the twelfth anniversary of its independence.We have learned from our weaknesses and today we are living in an atmosphere of social and political peace. We are very familiar with the challenges that are inherent in the efforts of developing a nation and of building peace and security. We are very thankful for the support that the United Nations and all donor countries have provided to Timor-Leste. Nevertheless  the years of partnership have also taught us important lessons  which we have been sharing with the world  particularly the fragile States. We are encouraging them to take ownership of their processes and be committed to the future of their citizens.We have also started to be more internationally active. We have been working hard within the scope of the Group of Seven Plus  a group that brings together 20 fragile and conflict-affected countries. In addition to sharing experiences and knowledge and seeking to put the needs of those countries on the global development agenda  we continue repeating  as many leaders have been doing since yesterday  that without peace there can be no development. In turn  without development there can be no room for democratic transition  since democracy is a dynamic process of assimilating principles and values  rather than a process to be measured by elections alone.And that brings us to the subject of the general debate at this sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly — the post-2015 development agenda. Inequality is increasing dangerously throughout the world  with wealth being concentrated in the hands of a few to the detriment of us all. Even after the world learned of the greed and the corruption of the international financial system that led to the global financial crisis  we are now seeing how the faltering economic recovery is benefiting only those who were responsible for the financial meltdown in the first place. Despite the best efforts of the Secretary-General and his team at the United Nations  we are almost in 2015 and know that 2.2 billion people throughout the world are already in or are entering the ranks of the extreme poor  without even knowing what the Millennium Development Goals are.In that regard  I must draw attention to the incorrect practice on the part of international organizations to view each of the 193 States Members of the United Nations in the same manner  regardless of whether they are large or small  rich or poor  young or in a transitional period or centuries-old  developed  with emerging economies  or underdeveloped. And these development indices create scales of values that are both unfair and demotivating to the majority of the least developed countries. Accordingly  all of us in attendance here today have a historic opportunity to share our thoughts on the enormous challenges ahead of us  so as to outline a truly transformative agenda in which no country is left behind.However  the issue that deserves our collective attention and requires urgent measures is the mitigation of the environmental threats that continue to increase and are hindering the legitimate perspectives of emerging and developing countries. Fortunately  yesterday’s summit on climate change raised expectations in relation to actual action plans being implemented in some countries. The plans will be expanded to the global level next year in Paris. Some developed countries have also committed to providing capital to the Adaptation Fund  which is vitally important to developing countries. Ms. Emilia Pires  the Minister of Finance of Timor-Leste  was a member of the high-level panel that advised the Secretary-General on that agenda.In 2013 and until August  Timor-Leste had the honour of assuming the presidency of the sixty-ninth session of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). As such  we had the privilege of presiding over the session for one year and working with ESCAP and the nations of the Asia-Pacific region in order to achieve progress and improve human development. Timor-Leste is committed to that noble ideal and to that deserving mission of helping to nurture a culture of peace in our region through the gradual and persistent reduction of social inequalities within each country and among countries.However  in our region  including within the scope of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  countries are cooperating and promoting peace  which has enabled the rise of the Asian region  led by China  and lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. However  we cannot but be concerned by the developments in the East and South China Sea.That brings us to a key issue that is of vital importance to Timor-Leste. I am speaking of the need to set maritime borders between countries in a clear and serious manner  in line with international law. Back in 2002  when we began to walk our own path in freedom  we saw a globalized world in which the arrogance of the powerful and the ambition of the rich  who prey upon the inexperience and ignorance of the poor and the weak to act dishonestly and in bad faith  prevailed  as a serious insult to universal values. And I must affirm that big multinationals have always played an improper and disloyal role  acting dishonestly and in bad faith when dealing with poor countries.Timor-Leste  a young  small and poor country  was caught off guard in that sophisticated culture of manipulation and deceit. Nevertheless  we want to continue believing that international mechanisms  such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  contribute to justice between nations and understanding between peoples  so as to defend sovereign rights and the truth.Today  those commitments are vital in order to start rebuilding trust in the world system and to prevent tensions from increasing. The strengthening of dialogue and tolerance and the promotion of a new diplomacy must be translated from a set of good intentions into actual deeds in the international arena. But what is truly intriguing is the fact that no decent country has yet advocated the need to carry out inquiries to determine the origin of the weapons used to massacre civilians  particularly those used to kill women and children  so as to identify the true beneficiaries of the world crisis — those who are selling weapons to uncontrolled gangs throughout the world.Before I conclude  I would like to inform the Assembly that this year  Timor-Leste has assumed the rotating presidency of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP). In that forum  we want to use diplomacy and cooperation to nurture our joint economic potential by making use of our regional ties. We also want to spread a message of peace  human rights and social justice throughout all the forums in which we are represented.Guinea-Bissau is a member of that community and a country with which Timor-Leste has been closely involved  including within the scope of the Group of Seven Plus  particularly once Timor-Leste realized that Guinea-Bissau had been left to its fate at the mercy of international sanctions. After a devastating cycle of coups  we felt that the people of Guinea-Bissau needed peace and stability  and we saw how their leaders were striving to achieve a collective commitment that would benefit the people and the country.Timor-Leste had the honour of providing financial support and of sending a technical team to provide assistance throughout the entire electoral process in Guinea-Bissau. That process  which involved massive democratic participation  was a success and restored constitutional order in the country. Still  as we all know  elections are but a starting point  and a State without the means to ensure the basic needs of its people faces countless challenges that can jeopardize the promise of peace and national cohesion.In line with the subject of the debate in the General Assembly  I must say that it is now urgent to create the conditions to enable Guinea-Bissau to move from fragility to resilience by supporting its State agencies. Guinea-Bissau needs to restore its public administration and its State agencies  as well as to reform its defence and security sector by modernizing its forces. Furthermore  Guinea-Bissau requires a financial boost in order to jump-start its economy.Within the scope of the CPLP  we want to have active collaboration with the authorities of Guinea-Bissau and with its international partners  namely the Economic Community of West African States  so as to hold an international conference on aid to Guinea-Bissau as soon as possible. The conference should start by focusing on matters of extreme urgency  such as salaries  food  security  fuel and health. Timor-Leste has already contributed $6 million  which corresponds to one month of public-sector salaries in the country. I also urge every country in attendance to join Timor-Leste and the CPLP countries  in keeping with the highest values of international solidarity  in supporting the consolidation of the achievements made so far by the people of Guinea-Bissau. Indeed  that is something that will also convey a promise of peace to the entire African continent.And I cannot talk about Africa — a continent that is already wounded on the inside and ravaged by hunger and poverty — without mentioning the scourge of the Ebola virus  which is presently challenging the international health system itself. That epidemic  which is unprecedented in our time  requires a vital and urgent commitment by the international community. This morning in the Ebola campaign I found out that Timor-Leste will provide $1 million as immediate support within the spirit of solidarity that guides the Group of Seven Plus  which includes Sierra Leone  Liberia and Guinea-Conakry. Next year we will also be allocating an equal amount to help fight the epidemic.The great challenge in today’s world is liberating people from fear. I am talking about the fear of difference  insecurity  hunger  poverty and disease  the fear of losing power or the fear of becoming a slave to power. In today’s unbalanced and unequal world  we need to have the courage to speak a language of trust and tranquillity. We need to pacify minds  encourage dialogue and free people from doubt and feelings of injustice so that they acquire greater tolerance and greater respect for differences and diversity. We need to free people from the yoke of poverty and from the deplorable conditions in which they are living so as to ensure their right to development. We still have time to write a different and more humane tale for today’s generation and future generations.Timor-Leste wants to make an active contribution to a better world  where each country may live in tolerance  harmony and tranquillity within a true atmosphere of friendship and solidarity that promotes peace. Such peace must start in the minds and behaviours of the people at every level of society  so that they can have a positive influence on the policies of the global centres of decision-making. That is the only way for us to believe that the baby from the Marshall Islands who touched all our hearts two days ago may be certain that her future is guaranteed and that she will be able to live in those small islands that make up her country."
"172",6885,"TON",69,2014,"I would like to congratulate you warmly  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session  and to assure you that the Tongan delegation will fully support the crucial work ahead under your able leadership. I would also like to thank your predecessor  Mr. John Ashe  for his sterling conduct of the previous session  especially his championing of issues relating to small island developing States (SIDS). And I pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his exemplary stewardship in advancing the commitment of the United Nations to building a more peaceful and prosperous world amid the diverse and complex issues it faces today.My delegation and I welcome the theme of this year’s general debate  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  and we look forward to the three high-level thematic debates and the high-level event to be held next year. As we work together to formulate a historic post-2015 development agenda  we are cognizant that we must be ambitious and transformative in our approach in order to ensure tangible benefits for our people. Responsive access to financial resources is essential if we are to cement the adoption of a meaningful development agenda and its full implementation.Tonga supports the consensus that the report of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals should be integrated into the post-2015 development agenda  with a global commitment to eradicating poverty by 2030. The proposed sustainable development goals on oceans  seas and marine resources and climate change are woven intimately and intricately into the fabric of the very survival of Pacific small island developing States. Without them  our joint aspirations for sustainable development and economic growth will not be achieved  and we will be left behind. The Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway  known as the Samoa Pathway outcome document  was endorsed by SIDS leaders and their partners earlier this month. It is a blueprint for the sustainable development of small island developing States for the next decade and should therefore be integrated into the form and substance of the post-2015 development agenda.In order to guarantee harmony in our implementation of the development agenda  Tonga agrees that each country should take primary responsibility for its own economic growth  social development and environmental sustainability. However  that can be fulfilled only with the active engagement of all relevant stakeholders through genuine and durable partnerships. We look forward to working together towards the summit in September 2015 when Heads of State and Government will adopt a post-2015 development agenda that will be inclusive and people-centred. It will be a historic event  adding further meaning to the celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations.This year  the Pacific island leaders endorsed the Palau Declaration on “The Ocean: Life & Future”  which is concerned with charting a course to sustainability. Tonga is a joint custodian of the Pacific Ocean  whose natural resources form the bedrock of economic  social and environmental development in the Pacific islands. The well-being of the Tongan people is therefore premised on the sustainable development  management and conservation of the ocean and its resources. The management of seabed exploration and exploitation is an important facet of Tonga’s interests in the oceans  and we have worked diligently through the relevant institutions established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to ensure that activity within the area located in the Pacific Ocean is managed appropriately for the benefit of humankind.For the first time  Tonga sought election to a seat on the relevant body established under UNCLOS  the Council of the International Seabed Authority  and was elected by acclamation by its member States. This year  Tonga passed legislation related to seabed mining activities within Tonga’s jurisdiction and under the provisions of UNCLOS. We joined our Pacific Island neighbours in supporting the call for launching negotiations by September 2015 on an international agreement under UNCLOS on the management and conservation of the ocean and its resources  both within our national jurisdiction and in areas beyond.Tonga commends the Secretary-General’s initiative in convening the recent Climate Summit as a forum for world leaders to deliver bold announcements on climate change mitigation and adaptation. In the spirit of sustaining international cooperation  we support the urgent call for States to address the adverse impacts of climate change. The collective response will depend on the outcome of the ongoing negotiations being conducted through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Nevertheless  it should be based on the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibility  as enshrined in the Convention. The principles and overall objective espoused by the Convention must be fully observed if the threat of climate change is to be effectively addressed and overcome for our common benefit.The Global Risks Report 2013 ranked Tonga as the second most vulnerable country in the world to natural disasters. That vulnerability was demonstrated by our first category-5 cyclone earlier this year  which devastated our central island group  displacing thousands and resulting in millions of dollars’ worth of damage. However  and fortunately  it caused only one fatality. Today  that same central island group is experiencing an unseasonable drought. Tonga has used a whole-of-country approach — through its joint national action plan on climate-change adaptation and disaster-risk management — to establish a base from which to move forward with adaptation measures. In terms of mitigation  we are gradually reducing our fossil-fuel consumption.Tonga applauds the convening of the high-level event on combating climate change  and it would like to recall here that Pacific island countries were among the first to raise the alarm on the implications of climate change for security  both regionally and generally. In that regard  we support the call to the Security Council to reconsider its stance and to recognize the links between climate change and international peace and security. We also support the call to the Secretary-General to appoint a special representative on climate and security to research those links and report back to Member States.Tonga associates itself with those Member States that have appealed for a meaningful approach  going beyond the rhetoric  to reforming the Security Council through an intergovernmental process in order to make it more representative and inclusive. We also support the request of Heads of State and Government in the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 55/2) that its goals include the important work of revitalizing the General Assembly. That general reform process must continue if we are to ensure greater efficiency  representativeness and transparency throughout the United Nations system as a whole  thereby enabling this great institution to be better prepared to respond to the realities we live with today.Finally  for future generations to live in a better world  we must work harmoniously to fulfil our responsibilities and ask the Almighty to guide us through our growing challenges."
"173",6925,"TTO",69,2014,"I would like to thank and congratulate Mr. John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda  who during his time as President laid the foundation and established the conditions for formulating a new development agenda geared to influencing the sustainable development of the members of the General Assembly.I would also like to congratulate the new President on his election to the presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. His tenure comes at a time when the global family is facing very serious threats from the Ebola virus and from what I call the terrorist virus  threats that demand that we all marshal our human  financial and other resources in a global partnership aimed at combating these modern plagues. The President’s tenure also comes as we are about to commence the second phase of our formulation of the post-2015 development agenda. I am confident  as I am sure we all are  that he will administer and lead with distinction.Today it is a privilege for me to share with the Assembly the perspectives of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago on our priorities for delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda  according to the President’s aptly selected theme. Last year we considered how we would set the stage for the process to be launched during this sixty-ninth session on finalizing the post-2015 development agenda. I noted then that when we adopted the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and introduced the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  a new chapter opened for the United Nations (see A/68/PV.10). That chapter would see the United Nations positioned as a vehicle for assisting developing countries  especially the most vulnerable  in their efforts to reduce poverty and hunger  and for providing an environment that would enable States to develop their economies and thus help their people rise out of persistent poverty.Measures must now be put in place to spur a proactive rather than reactive approach to the issue of development in this transformative post-2015 agenda. With the experience of the challenges and lessons encountered in the past 14 years in the implementation of the MDGs  we are now at a critical juncture in putting into operation the elements we agreed to at the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) so that they will constitute the future we want. The current model was built on what we agreed to at the Millennium Summit  but in some ways it has fallen short of the expectations of many developing countries.However  the Government and people of Trinidad and Tobago have been able to achieve this objective because it formed an integral part of our 2011 medium-term policy framework  through which we incorporated and aligned the MDGs and their targets with Trinidad and Tobago’s medium-term national priorities. Consequently  some of the goals  targets and indicators were modified in the light of Trinidad and Tobago’s unique development circumstances and its achievement of several of the MDGs. That approach resulted in  for example  modified targets for education  including achieving universal early-childhood education and a 60 per cent participation rate in tertiary education.However  I am delighted to say that we have surpassed many of our own targets  as well as some of the MDGs. So in Trinidad and Tobago we now have universal free primary- and secondary-school education  and  as I said  we have surpassed our target of 60 per cent in the tertiary sector and have 65 per cent participation. That too is free. I am also pleased to underscore that my country is well poised to achieve 70 per cent of the 43 targets across the eight goals that are considered relevant to the national context. That percentage consists of 42 per cent of targets that have already been met and 28 per cent that are likely to be met by 2015. So we say that with good success  and lessons learned  we know what we still have to work on.I now turn to a short discussion of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Trinidad and Tobago  as part of the CARICOM region and the global community  welcomes the outcomes of the various milestones in the process we have achieved to date. As a member of CARICOM  we have been an active participant in the Open Working Group on the Sustainable Development Goals. We have therefore been witness to the sweeping and unprecedented global participation and interest in that process and its outcome. As a collective effort  the crafting of the sustainable development goals undoubtedly captured a spirit of openness  inclusiveness and partnership  all of which underpin this new phase of policy design and implementation. Along with the report of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing (A/69/315)  the 17 goals adopted in July form a solid foundation.It is my respectful view that in delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda we must and should prioritize key issues for this session of the General Assembly. I have identified four such priorities. The first  I believe  is for us to renew our commitment to achieving the MDGs. Even in the one year we have left  with more dedicated effort we can make further advances on our original objectives. As the MDG Gap Task Force Report  2014: The State of the Global Partnership for Development highlights  although progress has been made in some areas  the gains must be accelerated and in some areas a renewed effort is needed to close the glaring gaps that still exist. Some of those gaps are in important areas such as access to affordable essential medicines  and in long-term debt sustainability  particularly for small States  which is an essential element of the global partnership for sustainable development. Implementation will be a key measure of our commitment to the aspirations for the post-2015 development agenda.The second priority is operationalizing “The future we want” (resolution 66/288  annex). In the Rio+20 Conference in 2012  we agreed on many of the foundation elements for the post-2015 development agenda. Coming out of that  we now have several key documents to further inform and guide us on the way forward. We have  for example  the report of the Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Global Sustainability (A/66/700); the sustainable development goals; the report of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing; the outcomes of the structured dialogues on a technology facilitation mechanism (see resolution 68/310)  and the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production.“The future we want” also outlines some key emerging challenges that we need to urgently address in the context of the post-2015 development agenda. Some of those issues  as the Assembly will recall  include non-communicable diseases  the increasing urgency to address climate change  and the imperative of addressing the needs of marginalized groups  including women  youth  children and persons living with disabilities. Those are the building blocks of the future we want to form the basis of the post-2015 development agenda. Together with the institutional support of the high-level political forum on sustainable development  the reformed Economic and Social Council and the United Nations Environmental Assembly  we have a solid foundation for fashioning a global partnership in support of poverty eradication through sustainable development.We look forward to the Secretary-General’s synthesized report  which should place all of those elements in the context of a fully integrated post-2015 development agenda and give due consideration to the needs of countries in special situations  including small island developing States  least developed countries  landlocked developing countries and Africa. As a specialized conference mandated in “The future we want”  the outcome document (A/CONF.223/3  annex) of the recently concluded Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States — the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action — should also be appropriately addressed in the upcoming Secretary-General’s report.The third priority is for us to revitalize the global partnership in support of sustainable development. The 8 August 2014 draft report of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing has highlighted that current financing and investment patterns will not deliver sustainable development. In fact  it goes on to say that“[w]hile design and implementation of policies will be on the national level  achieving sustainable development will require international support and cooperation”.Those are the core prerequisites for a global partnership in support of sustainable development. However  in order make such a partnership meaningful  it is my respectful view that it must also include the following four particular elements.First  it must include reform in the international financial institutions  targeting on systemic failures and focusing on building resilience that can sustain growth in open and vulnerable economies.Secondly  it must include the successful completion of the Doha Round of trade negotiations  which will ensure that the rules of trade and commerce do not continue to operate so as to slow  impede or negate development gains and aspirations in our very small and vulnerable economies. I note that the third International Conference on Financing for Development is scheduled to take place in July 2015. That will be critically important to ensuring that a meaningful and effective global partnership for development will become a reality for the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda.Thirdly  on the point of a revitalized global partnership in support of sustainable development  I wish to strongly reiterate the support of Trinidad and Tobago for an end to the economic embargo against Cuba. The perpetuation of those measures against a developing country undermines our collective aspirations for a post-2015 development agenda in which no one should be left behind.Fourthly  our priority should be for us to address the mitigation gap for achieving the target of below 2 or 1.5˚C target for limiting the increase in global greenhouse gas emissions and achieving an ambitious  legally binding agreement on climate change in 2015 to be applied from 2020. That agreement should set the world on track to achieving carbon neutrality by 2070  and by so doing ensure that the global climate will support the sustainable development of present as well as future generations.Our collective action on climate change should take into account the survival of the most vulnerable States in particular  such as our small island developing States  as the front line of increasingly severe impacts of climate change. It should also be firmly rooted in the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities  recognizing that developing countries’ finance needs for mitigation and adaptation to climate change cannot be met exclusively from domestic resources  given the competing demands on public finance. I believe that every Head of Government and every Head of State would recognize those competing interests in their own nation States.It is therefore essential to put the Green Climate Fund into force early. It is my hope that the partnerships and announcements made at the United Nations Climate Summit 2014 on Tuesday  23 September  will serve to catalyse more ambitious action on climate change in the near as well as in the long-term and build the momentum necessary for a successful Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Lima in December and in Paris in 2015.Those are the elements of the global framework  which should occupy our full attention and commitment over the course of the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Those elements will be supported by critical enabling actions at the regional and national levels. For us in the context of the Caribbean Community  we have been doing our part as a subregion of small island and low-lying developing States to foster regional integration in support of the sustainable development of all of our peoples. CARICOM Heads of State and Government have agreed on the vision of“a Caribbean community that is integrated  inclusive and resilient; driven by knowledge  excellence  innovation and productivity; a community where every citizen is secure and has the opportunity to realize his or her potential with guaranteed human rights and social justice; and contributes to and shares in  its economic  social and cultural prosperity. A community which can be a unified and competitive force in the global arena”.That vision is the collective ambition of the States members of CARICOM  agreed in the context of a strategic framework plan for period 2015-2019. That plan will come through the implementation of six integrated strategic priorities  which include building economic  social  environmental and technological resilience through a coordinated foreign policy and research and development innovation.In support of the implementation of those six priorities  CARICOM Heads of State and Government have called for a post-2015 development agenda that will work in tandem with what we are discussing at the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly and needs to focus on the eradication of poverty as a central pillar  the adoption of a people-centred approach through an intergovernmentally agreed agenda  and an agenda that incorporates broader measures and appropriate approaches and criteria to complement the gross domestic product per capita as a measure of development. Importantly  those broader measures must foster an enabling global policy environment that is more conducive to the achievement of development objectives and affords greater policy coherence across institutions  including those in the areas of trade  finance  environment and development.Those regional initiatives in support of advancing the sustainable development of the people of CARICOM are being designed and implemented in the context of a broader strategy for mitigating the vulnerability inherent in countries as small and open as ours  In the context of a limited and narrow resource base  the focus is on nurturing and developing our human resources through an emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship. It is an approach that focuses on the full realization of the human rights to development and a life of dignity.Consistent with this approach  I turn to another matter close to our hearts in the region as we continue to advance the global cause of truth  justice and reconciliation  within the context of reparatory justice for the victims and the descendants of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. As a region we are determined to engage in reparatory dialogue with the former slave-owning European nations in order to address the living legacies of these crimes. This is a critically vital element of the socioeconomic development aspirations of the region as the victims of these crimes and their descendants were left in a state of social  psychological  economic and cultural deprivation. In addition  they have been left in a state of disenfranchisement that has ensured their suffering and debilitation to this day  and from which only reparatory action can alleviate their suffering.I hold that sustainable development cannot be achieved in an environment where people are denied their basic rights to live free from fear  with daily deprivation of the necessities of life due to the ravages of war and other types of instability. It is for these reasons that Trinidad and Tobago is concerned by the developments in Ukraine and other parts of the globe  which have caused pain and suffering to hundreds of innocent victims. They too must be allowed to live freely.At the same time  we note with grave concern the continued failure to find a lasting solution to the decades-old Arab-Israeli conflict  which has caused tremendous loss of life and destruction of property in the Gaza Strip  and has left emotional and psychological scars on those almost 2 000 families who lost loved ones. Trinidad and Tobago remains committed to the negotiation of the two-State solution as the preferred means to bring lasting peace to the region so that the people of Palestine  so long denied their rightful place in the international community  can live in larger freedom with their Israeli brothers and sisters. To that end  we call for the implementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions geared towards the resolution of the conflict and the lifting of the illegal embargo imposed on the Palestinian people since 2005.Likewise  as co-sponsors of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014)  on threats to international peace and security caused by terrorists acts  adopted at Wednesday’s summit  we remain optimistic that the resolution may serve as a catalyst for greater international cooperation in the fight against terrorism.We in Trinidad and Tobago have been the victim of terrorists in 1990  when there was an attempted coup against the newly elected Government by terrorists and extremists. Members will agree that this new terrorist phenomenon could be dubbed a terrorism “virus” as it is spreading throughout the global family. The Assembly will agree that terrorism has been undermining  and continues to undermine  the sovereignty  territorial integrity and peace and security of the peoples of the Middle East and further afield.Members of the Assembly will also recall that  in my inaugural address to this body in September 2010 (see A/65/PV.20)  I indicated that the time was right for the adoption of a treaty to regulate the international trade in conventional arms. That has now come to be history with the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT); after yesterday’s High-level Treaty Event  it now has the requisite number of States parties for its entry into force  which is likely to be on 25 December of this year. We are very happy about that.The entry into force of the ATT will require States parties to make important decisions to implement the provisions of the Treaty at the First Conference of States Parties  which is likely to be convened by mid-2015. One of these decisions is on the location of the ATT secretariat. Over a year ago  my country announced its candidature to have the ATT secretariat located in Port of Spain. That bid has been endorsed by all 14 CARICOM States and has so far received the support from a number of States from diverse regions. The hosting of this important body in a region which is disproportionately affected by the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and its association with other trans-boundary crimes  such as drug trafficking  would be a significant development. It will assist in the full and effective implementation of the Treaty  and contribute to the reduction  if not the elimination  of illegal weapons in the hands of criminals whose actions continue to threaten the sustainable development of our region.The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is committed to providing the necessary resources to host the secretariat  and this has been transmitted to all Members of the United Nations. I call once more on all those States which have not yet announced their support for our candidature to do so and to ensure that the principle of equitable geographic distribution in the location of major global bodies is observed. No country or region  in my respectful view  must continue to have a monopoly in hosting important institutions which are established for the benefit of all.Trinidad and Tobago is satisfied that  among the 17 sustainable development goals adopted by the General Assembly on 10 September  goal 3 ensures healthy lives and promotes well-being for all ages. The health and well-being of our people are critical to ensuring productive lifestyles which are critical to sustainable economic development  growth and achieving a transformative past-2015 development agenda. Health and well-being are one of the 10 thematic areas of development identified by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago.It will be recalled that CARICOM  of which we are a member  was largely responsible for calling the attention of the General Assembly to the need to adopt a resolution to focus attention of the effects of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as a major contributor to human mortality. Nevertheless  while we continue to make strides in tackling the incidence of NCDs  we are cognizant of the need to combat the spread of infectious diseases within our region and in different regions  which threaten the survival of people in many nations.Security Council resolution 2177 (2014)  which was co-sponsored by Trinidad and Tobago  garnered unanimous support  including that of the Secretary-General  for dealing with the Ebola virus. We congratulate the Secretary-General. Members pledged to take action at the global and regional levels to combat the spread of Ebola to supplement the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response. Trinidad and Tobago remains committed to playing our part in eradicating infectious diseases undermining the health and well-being of our people.It is for this reason that  prior to the adoption of resolution 2177 (2014)  on Ebola  as Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago I wrote to the Secretary-General of CARICOM requesting that a meeting of States members of the Community be convened to discuss and agree on sustainable policy responses at the national and regional levels alike concerning public health issues  including Chikungunya and the Ebola virus.Finally  the Assembly can rest assured of the support of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago in assisting the United Nations family in shaping a transformative post-2015 development agenda. Our support will come not only through our representation in the various organs of this global institution but also by continuing to adopt policies at the national level geared towards putting people at the centre of all developmental objectives. I say once again: any development agenda which alienates people or places them at the periphery and not the centre will not bring sustainable development and will be doomed to failure. Such failure stands against the commitment we have all made and the purposes we are serving at the Assembly. Our work is cut out — for all of us  together in global partnership  to achieve the goals that we have set ourselves."
"174",6972,"TUN",69,2014,"At the outset  I would like to extend my warm congratulations to Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa  representative of the friendly nation of Uganda  on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I would also like to express my thanks and appreciation to Mr. John Ashe and his team  as well as to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.In this world  where a surfeit of bad news overshadows the good work of creativity  reform and recovery  we continue our peaceful transition to democracy. We have managed to eliminate a dictatorial regime at the least possible human cost. We have begun a difficult transitional stage with a comprehensive national dialogue  and we have written a consensual constitution and built democratic State institutions. We are now preparing for legislative and presidential elections to be held before the end of the year in order to transform Tunisia into a stable  democratic  forward-looking State. Internal and external forces continue to undermine our democratic  peaceful transition through terrorist acts and political assassinations. However  our people are resolved to pursue their efforts to achieve success  despite the aggression of diabolical forces.Tunisia today is a test for a peaceful democratic transition in an Arab country that lived for too long under despotism. We are attempting to reconcile democracy and political Islam. We are pursuing an ongoing national dialogue. We are distributing authority between secular modernists and Islamists. We are using moderation to grapple with the counter-revolution and to eliminate the residues of despotism through a just transition. We are also testing new socioeconomic approaches. We are promoting comprehensive development initiatives that will combat poverty and that will be in harmony with the environment. We have a broader social vision in line with the policies and vision of the United Nations with regard to addressing global warming  climate change and the post-2015 sustainable development agenda  as well as the Secretary-General’s Global Education First Initiative. We are also committed to our own policies that aim to achieve world peace  especially within the Arab world to which we belong  and on the African continent  where we seek to definitively overcome the past and look to the future.Tunisia’s development process is unfolding in the heart of a region that is currently witnessing political upheavals that  in some cases  have had painful consequences for us too. Transnational radical armed groups have since the beginning of the revolution been targeting us and have killed many of our soldiers and security personnel  hindering our security apparatus in an attempt to abort the drive for democracy and to impose alternatives rejected by the majority of our people.The volatile situation in Libya is cause for concern because the stability of that sister neighbouring country affects our own stability. We hope that the Libyans will  through national dialogue  achieve an advanced  democratic stable State without outside military intervention  which would only add insult to injury. We encourage the wise men of Libya  both within and outside that country  to preserve broad national consensus and the security  unity  stability and prosperity of their country through a peaceful  political solution. We hope from the bottom of our hearts that our brothers will manage to achieve that.We are concerned by the spread of violence on the eastern front of the Arab world  which has reached unprecedented levels of brutality  including decapitation  the chopping off of hands and the execution of prisoners. We are appalled by such violence and attacks on our Christian brothers and other religious minorities  who form an integral part of our Arab and Islamic heritage and culture. We are ashamed of such practices in the name of our Allah  who defines himself as the compassionate and the merciful. According to the Koran  whoever kills an innocent soul kills all humankind  and whoever gives a new life to such a person saves all humankind. That has happened all too frequently of late. Nothing can justify the indiscriminate violence at such unprecedented and horrific levels. We condemn the execution of prisoners  be they Arab  Muslim  French  American or British. We are all human beings and belong to one human family. We seek to understand this phenomenon so as to be able to address its root causes.The violence and counter-violence we are witnessing today are the cumulative result of five decades of misguided policies of despotism that denied people their rights and basic freedoms  distributed wealth to some and consigned others to poverty. Such policies  which have exploited religion in the service of politics  are like magic that has now turned against the magician. They run counter to Arab and Islamic civilization. The problem cannot be solved by entrusting it to the police and army. The situation demands bold policies that take into account all those levels and that establishes regimes that are in harmony with their people. All political prisoners should be released and there should be an ongoing national dialogue with the participation of all moderate political sectors that are committed to peace. The economy needs to serve the interests of the majority  with an emphasis on advanced education under the banner of freedom and respect for the values of the Arab and Muslim countries. Only such policies will lead to united  peace-abiding societies. Our people yearn to improve their standard of living and to broaden the vistas for future generations.For many decades  some of the major Powers supported despotic regimes in our country on the pretext of maintaining stability. If the same problems are not to be repeated  they must help to achieve internal reconciliation. Resorting to military solutions may lead to meaningless wars that could endanger the whole world. We therefore strongly call for the blockade of Gaza to be lifted in order to enable it to build a port and airport  and not just to open the border crossings but also to fulfil the political right of the Palestinian people to a geographically contiguous  secure  independent State  with East Jerusalem as its capital. The Gazans who are living without shelter are pleading to our consciences for the reconstruction of Gaza and return children to their destroyed schools’ classrooms and playgrounds. We pray to God to end the nightmare engulfing the people of Syria through the banishment of its dictator and the formation of a Government of national unity.Tunisia  as a Member of the United Nations  understands how important it is that the Organization be capable of dealing with such huge global changes. We support the granting of permanent membership in the Security Council to Brazil  Germany  Japan and India  to be followed by permanent-member status for an African country  to enable it to deal with the world of today  which is no longer that which existed at the end of the Second World War. That war ended with the defeat of fascism  dictatorship and Nazism and  eventually  Communist totalitarianism. While so much of today’s world has been democratizing so rapidly  it is now threatened with climate  economic and political problems. To deal with them  every country must preserve its gains and create the machinery needed for prevention  protection and commitment.It is good that we have the International Criminal Court (ICC) for punishing despots who abuse their peoples’ rights; we should also have a tool that prevents them from surviving and staying in power. Tunisia has therefore proposed establishing an international constitutional court that could advise all liberated peoples and hand down decisions on illegitimate  bogus elections that lead to Government by force  which clearly runs contrary to international legitimacy and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This idea has been well received in academic circles and international symposiums. We reiterate our call for support for such democratic institutions so that this proposal can be presented to the Legal Committee.We hope that an international court such as this can be realized and could enable us to deter despots  support freedom and democracy and eradicate the sources of violence and conflicts among peoples. I hope that establishing such a court will not require the decades that it took to bring about the birth of the ICC  and we hope that Tunis  our capital  can have the honour of hosting one of the United Nations institutions that have so far been the preserve of the advanced countries of the northern hemisphere. It is high time to give some thought to allowing the liberated cities of the South to host such institutions."
"175",7019,"TUR",69,2014,"I greet the Assembly respectfully  and I hope that its sixty-ninth session will provide favourable results for all countries  peoples and humankind. I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as the President of the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session and to thank Mr. John William Ashe for his work as President at the sixty-eighth session.The sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly is being held on the hundredth anniversary of the First World War  which broke out in 1914. We sadly see that lands affected by the First World War are still deprived of stability  peace and prosperity even after a century. A wide area — ranging from Iraq to Syria  from Palestine to Yemen  from Libya to Afghanistan and to Ukraine — is witnessing scenes that leave deep scars on the conscience of humankind. People still die from hunger and communicable diseases in the twenty-first century. Children and women are brutally murdered in wars. The poor countries struggle with hunger  malnutrition  communicable diseases and lack of education  while the rich countries of the world enjoy prosperity. Climate change poses a major threat to the future of our world and that of our children. That situation  which is a stain on human dignity  directly concerns all of humankind and therefore  of course  the United Nations.Let me again  at this sixty-ninth session  stress that no one is innocent in a world in which children are killed  no one is safe  and no one can enjoy peace and prosperity. In the past year alone  6.3 million children under five years of age lost their lives worldwide. As a result of the war in Syria  17 000 children have died  375 000 have been injured  and 19 000 have lost at least one body part.This year 490 children were killed and 3 000 were injured as direct targets of the most modern and murderous weapons used against the Gaza Strip in Palestine. As they played on a beach  ran around in a park  took refuge in a mosque or school  or were comforted in their mothers’ laps  they were mercilessly killed in front of cameras and before the eyes of the world. We also see that those attempting to draw the world’s attention to the deaths of women  children and the disabled in Palestine are being variously labelled by others. Those objecting to the murders in Iraq and Syria and the murder of democracy in Egypt are again being subjected to certain unfair and groundless accusations and almost immediately accused of supporting terrorism.The global conscience is aware that those who are ruthlessly criticizing some countries for lack of freedom of the press are ignoring the 16 journalists killed in Palestine and the pressure put on members of the media. I will speak very clearly. Those who stand by and remain unresponsive to the killing of children  the vicious murder of women and the overthrow with weapons and tanks of Governments that have come to power through the will of the people are openly participating in those crimes against humanity.Even more significant  the modern world’s double standard leads to substantial and serious distrust among many people. That feeling of distrust affects the United Nations — where we are today — and other international organizations and threatens the sense of justice  while filling millions of people with despair. That distrust plays a principal role in fuelling the growth of international terrorism today. The double standard with regard to the oppressed and the indifference to the killing of children help to foment terrorism around the world. Those who lose hope in the United Nations and other international organizations are desperate and are helpless to resist the clutches of terrorists.The problems in Iraq have wrought havoc among the Iraqi people. More recently  the difficulties have spread beyond Iraq’s borders. Unfortunately  Iraq has now become a haven for terrorist organizations. The current crisis in Iraq directly affects the countries in the region  particularly Turkey. Given the newly established Government in Iraq  it is our hope that Iraq will make a fresh start. Turkey will stand by the Iraqi people in their search for peace and stability. Likewise  the Syrian crisis is spilling over the borders of that country. The unresolved issue of half a century — Palestine — is already a root cause of many problems in the region.Implementing a two-State solution  lifting the blockade against Gaza and establishing an independent  viable State of Palestine alongside Israel is a political  human and moral necessity. Many have spoken about a two-State solution from this rostrum. However  speaking about it is not sufficient. It is high time to act. It is no longer appropriate simply to talk about the issue — we must advance beyond that. Thousands of people are dying while we talk instead of acting. I think  at this point  it is a sad indication of the limits of our sense of responsibility here at the United Nations. We must therefore move forward. We must address these problems at the United Nations without any further delay in order to prevent more deaths of innocent people and arrive at a solution.Let me also say that the world is larger than the five permanent members of the Security Council. The fact that they have rendered the United Nations ineffective  despite the situation in the world  must not be accepted by the global conscience. Otherwise  decisions taken at the United Nations will depend on a single country. That is  if one country disagrees  then a decision will not be taken or implemented. The United Nations failed to find a solution as more than 2 000 innocent people were killed within only two months in Palestine. In Syria  the United Nations failed to find effective solutions as more than 200 000 people were killed and more than 9 million people were displaced in the past four years.I find it strange that we focus on issues selectively. If 2 000 people are killed by chemical weapons  then we focus on chemical weapons  and we consider the killing of 2 000 people by chemical weapons to be a crime. But what about the killing of 200 000 people by conventional weapons — is that not a crime? I cannot understand such an approach or such a mentality. Let us clarify our thinking. Let it be understood that the use of any kind of weapon leading to the deaths of people is a crime  whether by chemical or conventional means.The elected President in Egypt was overthrown by a coup. Thousands of people wanted to defend their electoral choice and were killed. Yet  the United Nations and democratic countries have done nothing but stand by while those events unfolded and the person who conducted the coup was legitimized. If we wish to speak meaningfully of democracy  then we should respect the choice of the people at the ballot box. If  on the other hand  we intend to defend people who come to power via a coup  then I must call into question the whole existence of the United Nations.The United Nations is also unable to take an effective stance in the face of uncontrolled events  such as terrorism and migration in Iraq. This silence  desperation and unresponsiveness can no longer continue. We need more efficient and speedy decision-making mechanisms if we are to be able to address global and regional problems. Furthermore  the United Nations should act more courageously in standing up for the right side of the issues.Let me point out another problem. We do not approve of any kind of terrorism that is supposedly carried out in the name of religion  and we believe that such acts are hugely disrespectful to all religions. We strongly condemn tying Islam  which means peace  to terrorism. It is highly offensive that Islam and terror are spoken of together. Similarly  those who call their inhuman acts Islamic are offending the religion of Islam  every other religion  and humankind generally.Turkey has been trying very hard to build peace and prosperity in the region. We do not interfere in the internal affairs of any country; we respect and support the territorial integrity of every country in the region. Regarding the question of Palestine and Israel  we have been working to try to achieve a two-State solution based on peace and mutual respect. Our sensitivity to this issue is based on the principle that the right to live of every human being is sacred.We have approached the problems in our region on humanitarian and moral grounds alone  heedless of race  religion  sect or interests. Our country is sheltering 1.5 million people who have had to leave Syria  and mostly from our own resources. Let me repeat  1.5 million refugees are in my country. As the host country  we are providing them with food  medicine and education. As for support from the rest of the world  there has not been much  unfortunately. So far we have spent more than $3.5 billion on the Syrian refugees in our country. Of the roughly 4 million Syrian refugees in the world  1.5 million are in Turkey  with the rest in Jordan  Lebanon  Iraq  Egypt and other countries. By contrast  I would like to ask what the strong and rich countries of Europe are doing. So far they have sheltered only 130 000 Syrian refugees — 130 00 in all of Europe  while in Turkey alone we have 1.5 million  plus the 2.5 million in the other countries I just mentioned.The crisis in Syria has become a regional and global issue  so much so that it is impossible to remain indifferent to it  whether for political or humanitarian reasons. On top of this  we have treated 102 injured civilians from Gaza in our hospitals. Turkey has also taken in 30 000 Yazidis fleeing Iraq  and  just before I came to New York  we opened our borders to Kurds fleeing Syria. It was Turkey who gave them humanitarian aid. In the past five days alone  the number of Syrian refugees entering our country exceeded 150 000.Five hundred years ago  we opened our doors to Jews who had been expelled from Europe. We have always protected the rights of Christians in Europe  and today we are still opening our arms to those in need  regardless of their religion  race or sect. I am proud to say that Turkey allocates 2.1 per cent of its national income to humanitarian aid  and as such has become one of the most generous countries in the world. In addition  thanks to the experience we have gained throughout history  we have always maintained our objectivity regarding terrorism  sectarian conflicts and other crises  and we have always based our approach on the defence and protection of people’s rights.I would like to point out here that Turkey is not a country that supports or condones terrorism. We have fought terrorism  because we suffered from it for 30 years  and are still suffering from it. Turkey is also strongly against every kind of anti-Semitism  Islamophobia and racism. I have said myself that anti-Semitism is a crime against humanity  and I may be one of the few political leaders who has so clearly expressed this to the world. Similarly  the whole world should accept that Islamophobia is also a crime against humanity.Turkey would like to see a solution to the problem in Cyprus. We would like to see an end to the occupation of territories in Azerbaijan. We have always voiced our strong support for the territorial integrity of Ukraine. We stand ready to support regional and global peace at all costs  and we will continue to be a unique friend to our friends. We will always stand firm against terrorists  oppressors and killers  especially the killers of children. We will fight for democracy and prosperity with all our heart and soul. We are always ready to join forces with other countries within the framework of those ideals and on this common path  and that  of course  is the kind of cooperation that humankind is seeking today.In that context  I should also say that we look to the General Assembly to support Turkey in its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council  and we thank the countries that are backing us. To that end  I hope that the sixty-ninth session of the Assembly will begin the work of wiping away the tears  blood  poverty and injustice staining the face of the Earth. I wish the Assembly and its President  Mr. Kutesa  every success  and I would like to convey my country’s sincerest greetings to all the nations represented here."
"176",7035,"TUV",69,2014,"It is indeed a great honour and pleasure to participate in this General Assembly debate at its sixty-ninth session on behalf of the Government and people of Tuvalu. I extend my congratulations to Mr. Kutesa on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We wish the Assembly success under his able guidance. I also wish to thank the outgoing President  Ambassador John Ashe  for a successful sixty-eighth session. Likewise  I applaud Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  the Secretariat and all the specialized United Nations agencies and staff for their tireless efforts and energy.Let me also note for the record Tuvalu’s sincere congratulations to the people and the new Government of Fiji under Prime Minister Bainimarama for the successful holding of general elections. In the same vein  we also congratulate New Zealand on its successful elections.Through the United Nations  we have worked diligently to deliver on the noble visions and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Our shared goals are world peace  security and prosperity. Tuvalu celebrates its thirty-sixth anniversary of independence next week on 1 October  and we remain committed and proud to be a Member of this great body. We must applaud the achievements of the United Nations.But we should not be over-congratulatory. Tuvalu also feels the sadness of the loss of lives and the suffering of fellow human beings from crises the world over. The losses resulting from terrorism  poverty  environmental degradation — especially climate change — and Ebola  along with the loss of lives owing to political conflicts in Syria  Israel  Palestine  the Middle East  Ukraine and many other regions of the world  are most disturbing  even for distant countries like my own Tuvalu in the Pacific. Tuvalu shares in the grief of those people. We in the United Nations must work harder to address the root causes of such crises. We support the ongoing reform efforts in the United Nations  and in particular we urge the reform of the Security Council through an expansion of its permanent and non-permanent seats and its agenda  in order to include climate change as a Security Council issue.As we go on  though  one question stares us right in the eyes. Do we leaders really care? And do we mean what we say here at the United Nations  in this great Hall? Recently a kindergarten class in Tuvalu asked me this question: “Do we have a tomorrow  and can you  as Prime Minister  save us?” Reflecting on how this body can help respond to those fundamental questions gives me mixed feelings. We are indeed encouraged by the momentum of some strong leadership on climate change  as was displayed at the Climate Summit earlier this week.But we are also discouraged by the lack of concern displayed most conspicuously by the deniers of climate change  including some of our neighbours in the Pacific. Tuvalu believes that the United Nations must not be distracted by them. We must remain committed to turning the momentum of the political leadership set in motion this week into real action for a more collective  strategic and pragmatic response to world crises. We must walk the walk  as well as talk the talk  on every front of our human crises if we are to ensure global peace and security.We have talked a lot in the United Nations about designing sustainable development goals and a post-2015 development agenda. The tentative goals and targets identified are reflective of a membership that is seeking the same high aspirations and honourable goals as those enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  namely  a world of peace  security  opportunity and prosperity. The United Nations must remain universal and relevant in bringing the real issues and events into focus and keeping the attention of the global community. It should be more responsive and understanding of the diverse circumstances and needs of its membership and the importance of contextualizing its strategic activities  taking into account the variable and special circumstances of each Member. It must also improve its presence in all countries  particularly in vulnerable States like Tuvalu.We must also heed the lessons of the world financial crisis  which reversed some of our hard-earned development advances related to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Those global realities affect even remote  small island countries like Tuvalu  and can further exacerbate their vulnerabilities. The new sustainable development goals  with better accountability and transparency measures  must provide economies  big or small  with the capacity to address vulnerabilities and ensure sustainability. They must also help to improve the means of implementation and create governance mechanisms that are inclusive and in which the voices of all countries and all stakeholders  including local Governments and authorities  are heard in decision-making.The dedication of 2014 as the International Year of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) is much appreciated. At the beginning of this month we congregated in the beautiful and tranquil island of the independent State of Samoa for the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  which concluded with an outcome document outlining the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action  or Samoa Pathway  and with the creation of many constructive partnerships aimed at addressing the special needs and circumstances of SIDS.While Tuvalu acknowledges and greatly appreciates the support of the United Nations membership  and the exemplary leadership of the Samoan Government and people  leading to the Conference’s huge success  we also believe that the ultimate measure of success for SIDS is the delivery of tangible action on the ground  reflecting and accommodating their unique  special case. It is urgent that we seriously consider the proper integration of the SAMOA Pathway and a special window for SIDS into the post-2015 sustainable development agenda of the United Nations  and into all other programmes in the United Nations and its specialized agencies  in order to achieve their effective implementation  with particular attention to simplified access to climate change financing for small island developing States.The graduation criteria and their application to least-developed countries (LDCs) require proper scrutiny and review  because they are mostly not relevant to the characteristics of SIDS. A small island developing State may achieve a high per capita gross national income and a high human development index  but it will always be a small island developing State; one cannot graduate from the natural constraints and environmental vulnerabilities of being a small island developing State. Recognizing the call made in the SAMOA Pathway and given the ambiguity surrounding the recommendations for Tuvalu’s LDC graduation  Tuvalu seeks further deferral of that graduation until a thorough assessment and review of the application of LDC graduation is done  taking full account of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s recent Least Developed Countries Report 2013 and other studies dealing with Tuvalu.With Tuvalu’s 24 square kilometres of land juxtaposed against 900 000 square kilometres of the Pacific Ocean  the sea has always been our people’s lifeline to food and economic growth. As a custodian of the Pacific Ocean  Tuvalu fully supports a sustainable development goal on oceans  as we do the Palau Declaration on oceans issued by the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum. We call on the United Nations to honour the health of the oceans  because they are the Earth’s life-support system. To that end  we also support the commencement of negotiations towards an implementing agreement under the law of the sea that can better protect the oceans.The seriousness and urgency of the need for action to combat climate change have been reaffirmed  not only by the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change but also by world leaders  and was strongly echoed by youth leaders this week in this very Hall. What more do we need to hear to stop the denial of the need for action against climate change? In Tuvalu  we are experiencing unprecedented  life-threatening effects of climate change. As a low-lying country with an elevation of barely two or three metres above sea level  like our fellow atoll island nations of Kiribati  the Marshall Islands  the Maldives  Tokelau and all other small island developing States  Tuvalu is finding that its security and survival  and the future and human rights of its citizens  are being seriously compromised. We cannot continue along that path.The Secretary-General’s Climate Summit  held earlier this week  which  on behalf of Tuvalu  I was honoured to co-chair with the President of Bolivia  gave us yet another opportunity to hear from young people  women and community leaders on the front line of the impacts of climate change from every region of the world  including my own Pacific region. Their message from the front line is simple  loud and clear: leaders of the world  do it! Save us!Time is running out  and it would be grossly immoral  extremely irresponsible and even illegal to pretend that we did not hear the alarms and voices of those who are suffering at the forefront of climate change. Tuvalu highly commends the Secretary-General for his strong leadership and welcomes the annoucements made by those Heads of State and Government who contributed to actions against climate change during the Summit. We commit to building on that momentum and that of the recent SIDS meeting up to the Lima meeting later this year and onwards in Paris in 2015.Tuvalu fully supports a stand-alone sustainable development goal on climate change. We urgently need a commitment from all countries to supporting a new climate change protocol  to be concluded in Paris in 2015. We must urgently address climate change in a legal and forward-looking manner. Otherwise  our post-2015 agenda will be meaningless and many will be left behind. We therefore urge all parties to work urgently to negotiate a new protocol  to curb greenhouse gas emissions and to keep the average temperature rise well below 1.5°C. The protocol must include loss and damage and insurance mechanisms for SIDS against climate change and must provide adequate and accessible financing for adaptation support to SIDS  such as Tuvalu.There is no time for half-measures  such as we witnessed in Copenhagen in 2009. It is also critical that the new Green Climate Fund and the other existing climate change funds be adequately resourced and that access by SIDS be simplified for expedient action on the ground.We all must step up and commit to reducing our emissions and to supporting those who are vulnerable. As for my own country  despite our negligible greenhouse gas emissions  we are committed to employing 100 per cent renewable energy for our electrification by the year 2020. We are already well on the way to achieving that target  thanks to the generous support of international partners  including the European Union  Japan  New Zealand  Italy  Austria  the United Arab Emirates  the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the International Renewable Energy Agency. Tuvalu is also a party to the Majuro Declaration.Tuvalu has made steady progress towards the achievement of its MDGs  with strategic complementary assistance from the donor community. We have designed a road map for development to move forward from the MDGs  and to the sustainable development goals in general. We have adopted and implemented national policies on financial management  women and gender development  people with disabilities  young people and the protection of families  as well as on other sectors of national priority  such as climate change  energy  food security  fisheries  information technology  health care  education and outer islands development. Much needs to be done in order to properly deliver on those policies. We are committed to doing that. We call for support from our international partners through mutual partnerships with us in Tuvalu.The future we want is one of inclusiveness  where all partnerships are important. The Government of Tuvalu reiterates its position that the economic  commercial and financial embargo against Cuba runs counter to the need to promote dialogue and to fulfil the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  which calls for solidarity  cooperation and friendly relations among all nations.Tuvalu also fully supports Taiwan’s meaningful participation in United Nations specialized agencies and mechanisms  including the World Health Organization  the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We recognize the cooperative spirit shown by Taiwan in its involvement in the post-2015 development agenda dialogue. We recognize the need to include Taiwan in the global fight against climate change. We also recognize Taiwan’s role as a regional peacemaker. Taiwan supports scholarships and capacity-building for experts  students and officials from Tuvalu and many developing countries.Finally  I want to say the following in clear and unambiguous terms. We are at a turning point for the future of small island nations such as Tuvalu. We can create MDGs and design sustainable development goals but  unless there is a global commitment to those goals  particularly against climate change  we will have failed humankind. Unless we stop greenhouse gas pollution  we will have failed future generations. The future is ours to create. Let us be bold. Let us take heed of the strong and loud message from those on the front line that we have heard here in this very Hall. Let us be seen as the ones that created a future for all — a future that includes saving human beings and saving the children of Tuvalu. For if we save Tuvalu  we save the world."
"177",7081,"TZA",69,2014,"I congratulate my brother Sam Kutesa of the Republic of Uganda on his well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. While wishing him every success in the discharge of his duties and responsibilities  my delegation and I promise him our full support and cooperation. Allow me also to pay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda  for his remarkable leadership of the Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.Our illustrious Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon deserves praise and appreciation for his leadership and the good work he is doing for our esteemed Organization. He has been performing his duty with courage  dedication  passion and commitment in driving the United Nations agenda. We will always be grateful to him.We welcome and fully endorse the theme of this year’s debate  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”. We expect the discussion on it to make important contributions in the intergovernmental negotiations about to start on the post-2015 development goals. As we dedicate our time and effort to the negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda  we must not lose sight of the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is important that any unaccomplished targets and indicators should be properly factored into the new agenda. In the meantime  we should ensure that we use the remaining 461 days to accelerate the pace of implementing the MDGs.The issue of financing the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda must be given special attention. I am mentioning this matter because experience has taught us that  other factors aside  we will fall short of attaining a number of the MDG targets and indicators because of unpredictable  unreliable  insufficient and untimely availability of financial resources. Therefore  for the post-2015 development agenda to be achieved  we must devise a mechanism to ensure stable  predictable and reliable sources of finance for their implementation.There is more to the year 2015 than the deadline for the MDGs and the onset of the post-2015 sustainable development goals. The year 2015 is also a deadline for the world to conclude a legally binding climate change agreement. We thank the Secretary-General for convening the Climate Summit that took place on 23 September  here at the United Nations. It afforded us a unique opportunity to put our minds together and deliberate on ways to save this planet from disaster and advance on clean development pathways. It was very opportune  indeed  to hold the Summit two months before the twentieth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP-20)  which is due to be held in Lima in December 2014  and one year before COP-21  to be held in Paris next year. In many ways  the Summit may help to make the work in Peru less difficult. As members know  a successful Lima Conference will mean a lot in terms of the Paris Conference  where we expect to conclude a legally binding climate agreement. We know it is not easy  but Tanzania and Africa as a whole are appealing to all countries from all continents to do whatever it takes to ensure that COP-21 delivers on the expectations all of us have. Failure should not be an option.United Nations reforms are long overdue. Reports that consultations and negotiations are not showing encouraging signs of progress are very frustrating indeed. We should remain steadfast and vigilant and not allow the momentum to be lost. We humbly request the President of the Assembly to use his good offices and long-standing diplomatic skills to revitalize the process and keep it on track. We must keep the flame burning.Global peace and security are in a state of flux. The events occurring in North Africa  the Middle East  Eastern Europe  the Great Lakes region and the Horn of Africa are matters of concern to all of us. Equally important is the menace of terrorism; the illicit exploitation of natural resources; poaching; and the illicit trade in narcotic drugs and weapons  which are making the world less secure.Terrorism is assuming new dimensions  making it a huge threat today because of its indiscriminate  lethal and callous character. Hundreds of innocent people have lost their lives or been abducted  with fatal consequences. No country is insulated from this menace  and nobody is safe. As such  it calls for all of us to play an active role in the fight against terrorism and cross-border crime. Al-Shabaab  Boko Haram  the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham and other terrorist organizations should not be allowed to have their way. Libya should not be left to disintegrate. The senseless fighting in the Central African Republic and South Sudan must be brought to an end. This world  under the leadership of the Security Council and regional organizations  has the capacity to do exactly that. Let us do what is required of us to stop the bloodshed  loss of life  suffering of innocent people and destruction of property.The horrifying scenes of bombings and the deaths of innocent women  children and men in the recent hostilities between Israel and Palestine are heartbreaking. Unfortunately  the conflict has been going on for far too long  despite the fact that the lasting solution is known: two States  living side by side harmoniously. That solution has been elusive. The time has now come for the United Nations  the United States of America  Russia  Europe and other global and regional Powers to come together in concerted efforts to make it happen. We should not wait any longer.As regards the question of Western Sahara  let me reiterate the appeal I made last year to the Security Council to do everything in its power to resolve that problem once and for all. Honestly  I cannot comprehend why that problem  which began around the same time as that in East Timor  nearly 40 years ago  should remain unresolved to this day. What are the insurmountable challenges impeding the United Nations from ending the impasse? I ask the United Nations to please do what is needed and put the Sahrawi question to rest. I know it can.Once again  we in Tanzania wish to join others who spoke before us in calling for an end to the sanctions and embargo against Cuba and its people. For over 50 years  the embargo has condemned the people of Cuba  including innocent children and women  to perpetual hardship and poverty. It is high time that the embargo be lifted and the people of Cuba given the opportunity to live in dignity like everybody else on this planet.This session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when our brothers and sisters in Liberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea are confronting the worst outbreak of the deadly Ebola epidemic to date. In those three countries  together with Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  some 2 400 people have lost their lives. The disease  which has no cure or vaccine as yet  presents a major threat to the countries where the disease is known to exist  but also to neighbouring countries and beyond. Unless the world succeeds in controlling the spread of this disease  there is every likelihood that it will become a global epidemic.Our collective efforts in that regard are the best way forward. I believe the world has the technology  knowledge and financial resources that  if put together  can defeat the threat posed by Ebola. We should also continue to support the efforts of the world’s scientists  who are working tirelessly  day and night  in search of a cure and a vaccine. We applaud the efforts being undertaken by the United Nations  the World Health Organization  the United States Government and other countries with the necessary technical and technological capabilities to assist the affected countries and wage the fight against the disease worldwideWe request four things. First  we must continue and  where possible  bolster that support until the spread of the disease is under control. Secondly  we must continue to assist other nations in West Africa and elsewhere on the African continent in building their capacities for surveillance  isolation and treatment. Thirdly  we must intensify our efforts to develop a cure and a vaccine to save the lives of those infected now and to prevent others from being infected. Fourthly and finally  we must help Africa; we must help African nations so that the stigma that is developing against Africa because of Ebola is stopped.Reports that a number of people from other continents are now shying away from coming to Africa and are cancelling travel plans because of Ebola are disturbing. That is threatening to kill the all-important tourism industry  trade and investment flows to Africa. May the United Nations and friends of Africa please help us to tell the world that Africa is a continent of 54 countries  not a country of 54 provinces. Not all countries in Africa have the disease. Moreover  many countries are far away from the concerned countries in West Africa. In fact  the affected countries are closer to Europe than they are to Kenya  Tanzania or South Africa in eastern and southern Africa  to mention but a few. As a matter of fact  they are 9 to 11 hours away by air from those countries. To cancel travel to our parts of Africa is incomprehensible and a gross injustice to the continent.I am confident that this seven-day debate on the theme “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda” affords us another opportunity to define a bright future for ourselves  our children  our children’s children and their grandchildren. We should seize the moment to build on the success stories and lessons from the many countries and peoples who have been successful. We should also learn from the challenges and failures during the implementation of the MDGs in conceiving the goals  targets and indicators of the post-2015 development agenda. Tanzania stands ready to cooperate with the rest of the Members of the United Nations family in building consensus on the post-2015 development goals.Allow me to conclude by appealing to everyone in this Hall to promise to work for a post-2015 development agenda that will make the world a better place for all of us to live in."
"178",7124,"UGA",69,2014,"First of all  I thank the General Assembly for electing His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa  our Minister for Foreign Affairs  as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. As the Assembly knows  the United Nations system needs reform to reflect the new needs and realities in the world today. Uganda will use the time of its presidency to make a small contribution towards the reform of the United Nations and its organs by pushing for the African agenda on that issue. Those reforms  as will be agreed by all of us  will strengthen the United Nations  not otherwise.Africa  Uganda included  is at long last emerging from the long night of decline that the continent has been through in the last 500 years — ever since 1472  when the Portuguese started encroaching on the African coastline. Those 500 years witnessed great traumas inflicted on the African continent  including the slave trade  colonialism  neocolonialism  plunder  human haemorrhage and  in some cases  even genocide. Those traumas resulted in the haemorrhage of the population and the depopulation of the African continent to the extent that by 1900 the population of the whole of Africa was only 133 million people  while that of China  which is only one quarter of the land area of Africa  was 489 000 million people. In other words  by 1990  the population of the whole of Africa was only a quarter of that of China  in a land area four times larger. Such traumas were possible in Africa owing not only to internal weaknesses but also external factors. Foreign aggression caused serious distortions in African societies. There was  for instance  the very-well-organized Kingdom of Kongo on the Atlantic coast at the time the first Portuguese explorer  Diego Cão  arrived there in 1483. The Kingdom covered parts of northern Angola  Cabinda  parts of the Republic of Congo and the western parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. As a consequence of the actions of colonialism  that polity  that Kingdom  declined and disintegrated. It is only now that the modern countries of that area are regenerating that portion of Africa. It is those distortions and the original endogenous weaknesses of Africa that the present generation of African leaders have been addressing. In many African countries  positive results are beginning to manifest themselves. The middle class in Africa is now of the magnitude of 313 million people  and that has boosted the purchasing power of Africa to $2.5 trillion. That purchasing power is growing at the rate of 3.2 per cent per annum. That growth and expansion of the African gross domestic product and purchasing power has happened despite inadequate roads  inadequate railways  inadequate electricity  and so on. Once those strategic bottlenecks are addressed  the sky will be the limit as far as Africa’s potential is concerned. One bottleneck that has bedevilled Africa has been the espousing of the pseudo-ideology of religious or tribal sectarianism  as well as chauvinism vis-à-vis women. When President Obama was walking out  I met him at the door and told him that he had copied some of my statement. That pseudo-ideology has fuelled most of the conflicts in Africa. We are also witnessing the same pseudo-ideology causing havoc in the Middle East and North Africa. When uninformed outsiders link up with those pseudo-ideologists  the permutation is most tragic. Sectarian ideology is pseudo and bankrupt because it is at variance with the people’s real interests of symbiosis and the exchange of goods and services  as well as integration for mutual benefit. Only parasites revel in such schemes. That pseudo-ideology should be banished and treated with the contempt that it deserves.With regard to socioeconomic transformation  Uganda is busy building hard-surface roads  electricity networks  railways  information and communication technology networks  a universal education system and a pan-Ugandan health-care system. Together with our neighbours  we have integrated our markets in the East African Community and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa. We also partner with others on common security solutions. Africa and the individual African countries are therefore becoming more credible partners with all serious actors beyond our shores. Uganda needs and welcomes investment  trade access  tourists and  in some cases  security partnerships that are approved by the African Union with our partners in the world  many of whom are Members of the United Nations."
"179",7171,"UKR",69,2014,"Ukraine  as a co-founder of the United Nations  knows why we established this Organization — for peace and stability. Do we have this peace and stability? No  and yet our global aim and global target is to do everything we can to protect our citizens and to deliver peace to our nations. The global agenda today consists of a number of things. Everyone has mentioned the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant  everyone has mentioned Ebola  and everyone has mentioned Ukraine. Frankly speaking I would be happy not to be in this situation  but we are a country that knows what terrorism means  and not in words but in deeds  in practice.Let me remind Members of the origin of the conflict that is evolving in Ukraine. Is it a domestic conflict? No. It is true that my country has some internal differences  but every country has differences and we are ready to handle and tackle those differences inside our country. The origin of the conflict is an invasion by the Russian Federation. A permanent member of the Security Council has violated the United Nations Charter  which is absolutely and entirely unacceptable behaviour  especially on the part of a permanent member of the Council. It would be better for Russia to be an “insecurity” member rather than a security one.Twenty years ago  Ukraine abandoned its nuclear weapons. We possessed the third-biggest arsenal in the world. When we agreed to relinquish our nuclear power arsenal in Budapest  Ukraine got guarantees of territorial integrity and sovereignty. Russia was a co-signer of and co-contributor to that memorandum. Instead of security guarantees  20 years later we received Russian military boots on Ukrainian soil. It seems that it is difficult to convince another country to stop nuclear proliferation. We are committed to our nuclear non-proliferation programme  but we need to have valid guarantees of our territorial integrity  security and independence.A few months ago  the Russian Federation annexed Crimea. One country  which is a Member State of the United Nations and a permanent member of the Security Council  a country that is armed to the teeth  just decided to grab the land of its neighbour  independent Ukraine. Let me commend the efforts of United Nations Member States that overwhelmingly supported the resolution supporting Ukraine’s territorial integrity and condemning the illegal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. They moved further. For today we can state that Russian troops are deployed in the east of Ukraine. The RussianFederation violated a number of bilateral and multilateral international agreements  starting with the United Nations Charter and ending with the resolutions on counter-terrorism that were adopted at the United Nations.We know what terrorism means  and we urge Russia to pull back its forces  to pull back its artillery  to stop supplying Russian-led terrorists  to restore control over the Ukrainian-Russian border  and to start real talks  peace talks. We are the country that needs peace. It is difficult to hammer out any kind of peace deal at the barrel of a gun made in Russia.Let me remind members of a tragedy that happened because of the Russian invasion. A few months ago  a civilian aircraft  Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17  was downed by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile  and 298 innocent civilians were killed. Ukraine mourns the victims. We pray together with the families from the Netherlands  Australia  the United Kingdom  Malaysia  Indonesia  the Philippines and Germany. Ukraine handed over the investigation to an independent body which is Dutch-led. We urge everyone to help us to bring to justice those responsible for this despicable crime  a crime against humanity.Every day  despite the ceasefire  we are losing Ukrainian soldiers and civilians  and the shelling is still going on. I reiterate once again that we need peace. What is the formula for this peace? The military option is definitely not the best option. It has to be a comprehensive approach which comprises diplomatic  financial  political and  only at the last  military options.The United States and the European Union imposed a number of sanctions against Russia. We do understand that sanctions are the way to start real talks and to hammer out a peace deal. We have no trust in words. We have trust only in deeds and actions. Once again we reiterate our commitment to restore law and order. We urge the Russian Federation to stick to its international obligation to execute everything that was written in Minsk. This is not a menu where one can pick the cherry. It means that Russia is to execute all 12 points of this memorandum. We ask our partners not to lift sanctions until Ukraine takes over control of its entire territory  starting with the east of Ukraine and ending with Crimea. Crimea was  is and will be a part of Ukraine.Let me end with a direct message to the Russian President. Mr. Putin can win the fight against the troops  but he will never win the fight against a united Ukrainian nation."
"180",7218,"URY",69,2014,"Ours is a harsh and difficult world — a complex  sometimes disgraceful world where 6 million children die each year before their fifth birthday  many from problems related to malnutrition; where violence has taken on a new dimension of terror and horror  with hundreds of thousands of deaths in Libya  Syria and Iraq; and where human rights violations and crimes against humanity occur more frequently and with greater ferocity and are the daily reality in those countries.It is a world where more than 8 million people die every year from tobacco consumption — an incredible genocidal activity that cannot be stopped and is promoted by markets that are increasingly more open  free  less regulated  and licensed to operate in contravention of people’s rights to life and health. It is a world where military bombs strike and kill those in schools  ethnic or religious minorities  or those who may adhere to different political beliefs. It is a world where natural disasters devastate countries one year and again the following year and the next  as they have in the brotherly countries of the Caribbean. In this world  those who act as global police have bequeathed social and political disasters wherever they have gone. Global governance has been inspired not by rights  but by interests. Those narrow interests were paid for with people’s lives  human rights violations and migration  in which people have had to leave their homes  cities and countries  vulnerable and facing anguish  violence and death again and again. The United Nations has been unable to build a system to find solutions  and it has failed fundamentally in its ethical dimension. There has been no dearth of work  documents or meetings  but there has been a lack of solutions for people. Our shared ethics should be based on the people. Our shared ethical structure in this case must be capable of incorporating our diversity  to free us with democracy and participation. We need to grow and develop multilateralism  which is the only path and basic instrument to promote that shared ethical structure  ensuring ever more rights for ever more people. We need to grow and develop in freedom.The political and financial crises of this world are linked to common values and ethical standards. Today’s world is one of sheer confusion in which humanitarian crises follow upon political crises  which in turn follow upon financial  economic and social crises. Here in this building we have our own microclimate; we wear elegant suits  eat in expensive restaurants and drive large  modern cars. What happens to people who are not insiders but who suffer in refugee camps where their families are killed  their villages are destroyed and they are tortured  or where their environments are destroyed by the effects of climate change? No one who has gained a right should lose it the next day; we need to protect that right. We need to offer better opportunities.The Millennium Development Goals have served as a useful tool to foster and channel efforts for specific purposes  but we should not leave countries alone in those efforts. Within that framework  we should step up our efforts every year and seek to define more clearly the sustainable development goals that will make up the post-2015 sustainable development agenda in a balanced  transparent and consensual way that envisions integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development: social  economic and environmental.We should eliminate poverty from the perspective of human rights and the recognition of those rights. The wealth that comes into the world causes an increase in the gross domestic product and exports and creates more dynamic investment  all of which must be accompanied by a logical recognition of rights. We are more developed and richer when we have more rights to exercise  when those rights are protected  and when we have more guarantees against the growing inequalities in the world. Poverty is experienced at many levels  and each country is responsible for granting ever more rights to help its people overcome poverty  improve conditions and eliminate discrimination. All efforts are valuable in every one of our countries  and as is every non-governmental organization that charts the way or denounces an abuse of human rights or seeks to improve opportunities for women  children  youths  retired people and migrants in different areas  such as health care  education  social protection  decent work  social and economic opportunities  whether they are employed as rural or domestic workers. In every individual there is an enormous potential that needs to be protected and fostered. The gender perspective that we need to promote should also be aligned with key rights for every individual who may suffer from even a little bit of discrimination in this world. The women’s agenda is one of the most powerful vectors for development that we can design. Any type of discrimination involves some form of underdevelopment  because discrimination based on gender  ethnicity  religion  disability  sexual orientation or migratory status is contrary to what our societies need. Our societies must be more inclusive. Our societies should incorporate every single one of those rights into our political system and legal protections  whether they relate to the right of same-sex marriage  the right of those who cohabit  or the rights of those with HIV. It is essential to fight for equality and to eliminate discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. All rights are part of the best social structure — love. Love is the essential factor that eliminates inequality and discrimination  that makes us all equal and that allows us to identify with our fellow human beings.The comprehensive human rights agenda must be based on an increasing number of rights for an increasing number of people so that everyone is able to grow in freedom and equality. We need to continue to make definitive progress on social topics such as communicable and non-communicable diseases. That includes those related to tobacco consumption  from which  as I mentioned  over 8 million people die every year. It is expected that that figure will continue to rise. It is therefore crucial that we have national policies that focus on healthy lifestyles.In 2013  Uruguay legalized the sale of cannabis  choosing an alternative regulatory model to combat drug trafficking and its disastrous consequences in society. We do not claim to be an example or a trailblazer  but we do  obviously  want to redesign the kinds of policies that have categorically failed to date and that have not produced the expected results.The critical situation in the world today with respect to food security is a structural problem. It is the result of bad global policies. One of every eight people  many of them children  suffer from chronic malnutrition. Humankind wastes more than a third of all the food we produce  which would be enough to resolve the problem of hunger. It is estimated that 30 to 50 per cent of the food produced every year is never consumed by people  and the situation is worsening due to soil erosion  growing water scarcity  climate change and the improper use of toxic substances in the food production chain.Combating climate change is a top priority. The need to implement policies today and not put them off until tomorrow is the moral imperative of every single individual in this Hall  so that we can give concrete content to the sustainable development goals and continue to grow. It is also important to continue to develop civil and political society  which we must support. The principle of the legal equality of States is essential. That is why my country rejects  for example  any coercive  unilateral or extraterritorial measures that contravene the norms of international law and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The clearest example of that is the unjust blockade imposed against Cuba. We would like to once again express our strongest rejection of it. Uruguay would like to unequivocally demand that Cuba be stricken from the list of countries who harbour terrorists.In the same vein  Uruguay would like to call for an end to be put to financial speculation by vulture funds. It is important that countries be able to restructure their sovereign debt in predictable  unchanging and just conditions without impacting development and  thus  the well-being of their people.Global peace and security are essential. The eradication of any form of violence in this world is a crucial issue. It is essential to have negotiated solutions that parties agree on  and contributions by peacekeeping missions are essential to providing maximal guarantees in the world.Human rights should be fully respected. They should be fully monitored  and guarantees should be provided in that regard to every individual. The authorities should ensure that human rights are fully monitored to ensure that their people enjoy the broadest possible freedoms.Uruguay deplores violence in all its forms. The substance of violence is bad at its core. There is no justification for violence to continue to spread in the world today. Every time one right is undermined  it is our responsibility  as those who govern  to lead the fight for its restoration. Every time justice is not rendered  it must be our mission  as leaders  to demand accountability. Every time we recognize a new right  it is our obligation to remember those who still cannot exercise that right and to work tirelessly for their benefit."
"181",7265,"USA",69,2014,"We come together at a crossroads between war and peace  between disorder and integration  between fear and hope. Around the globe  there are signposts of progress. The shadow of the Second World War that existed at the founding of this institution has been lifted  and the prospect of war between major Powers reduced. The ranks of Member States have more than tripled  and more people live under Governments that they elected. Hundreds of millions of human beings have been freed from the prison of poverty  with the proportion of those living in extreme poverty cut in half. And the world economy continues to strengthen after the worst financial crisis of our lives.Today  whether you live in downtown Manhattan or in my grandmother’s village more than 200 miles from Nairobi  you can hold in your hand more information than the world’s greatest libraries. Together  we have learned how to cure disease and harness the power of the wind and the sun. The very existence of this Organization is a unique achievement  with the people of the world committing to resolve their differences peacefully and to solve their problems together. I often tell young people in the United States that  despite the headlines  this is the best time in human history to be born  for you are more likely than ever before to be literate  to be healthy and to be free to pursue your dreams.And yet there is a pervasive unease in our world — a sense that the very forces that have brought us together have created new dangers and made it difficult for any single nation to insulate itself from global forces. As we gather here  an outbreak of Ebola overwhelms public health systems in West Africa and threatens to move rapidly across borders. Russian aggression in Europe recalls the days when large nations trampled small ones in pursuit of territorial ambitions. The brutality of terrorists in Syria and Iraq forces us to look into the heart of darkness.Each of those problems demands urgent attention. But they are also symptoms of a broader problem: the failure of our international system to keep pace with an interconnected world. We  collectively  have not invested adequately in the public health capacity of developing countries. Too often  we have failed to enforce international norms when it has been inconvenient to do so. And we have not confronted forcefully enough the intolerance  sectarianism and hopelessness that feeds violent extremism in too many parts of the globe.Fellow representatives  we come together as United Nations with a choice to make. We can renew the international system that has enabled so much progress  or we can allow ourselves to be pulled back by an undertow of instability. We can reaffirm our collective responsibility to confront global problems  or be swamped by more and more outbreaks of instability. And for America  the choice is clear — we choose hope over fear. We see the future not as something out of our control  but as something we can shape for the better through concerted and collective effort. We reject fatalism or cynicism when it comes to human affairs. We choose to work for the world as it should be  as our children deserve it to be.There is much that must be done to meet the test of this moment. But today I would like to focus on two defining questions at the root of so many of our challenges. Will the nations represented here today be able to renew the purpose of the United Nations founding  and will we come together to reject the cancer of violent extremism?First  all of us — big nations and small — must meet our responsibility to observe and enforce international norms. We are here because others realized that we gain more from cooperation than from conquest. One hundred years ago  a World War claimed the lives of many millions  proving that with the terrible power of modern weaponry  the cause of empire ultimately leads to the graveyard. It would then take another World War to roll back the forces of fascism  the notions of racial supremacy  and form the United Nations to ensure that no nation can subjugate its neighbours and claim their territory.Recently  Russia’s actions in Ukraine have challenged that post-war order. Here are the facts. After the people of Ukraine mobilized popular protests and calls for reform  their corrupt President fled. Against the will of the Government in Kyiv  Crimea was annexed by Russia. Russia poured arms into eastern Ukraine  fuelling violent separatists and a conflict that has killed thousands. When a civilian airliner was shot down from areas that those proxy forces controlled  those forces refused to allow access to the crash site for days. When Ukraine started to reassert control over its territory  Russia gave up the pretence of merely supporting the separatists and moved troops across the border.That reflects a vision of a world in which might makes right; a world in which one nation’s borders can be redrawn by another and civilized people are not allowed to recover the remains of their loved ones because of the truth that might be revealed.America stands for something different. We believe that right makes might  that bigger nations should not be able to bully smaller ones and that people should be able to choose their own future. Those are simple truths  but they must be defended. America and our allies will support the people of Ukraine as they develop their democracy and economy. We will reinforce our NATO allies and uphold our commitment to collective self-defence. We will impose a cost on Russia for its aggression  and we will counter falsehoods with the truth. And we call upon others to join us on the right side of history  for while small gains can be won at the barrel of a gun  they will ultimately be turned back if enough voices support the freedom of nations and the right of peoples to make their own decisions.Moreover  a different path is available — the path of diplomacy and peace  and the ideals that this institution is designed to uphold. The recent ceasefire agreement in Ukraine offers an opening to achieve those objectives. If Russia takes that path — a path that for stretches of the post-Cold War period resulted in prosperity for the Russian people — then we will lift our sanctions and welcome Russia’s role in addressing common challenges. That is  after all  what the United States and Russia have been able to do in past years — from reducing our nuclear stockpiles to meeting our obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to cooperating to remove and destroy Syria’s declared chemical weapons. That is the kind of cooperation we are prepared to pursue again  if Russia changes course.That speaks to a central question of our global age — will we solve our problems together in a spirit of mutual interest and mutual respect  or will we descend into the destructive rivalries of the past? When nations find common ground — not simply based on power  but on principle — then we can make enormous progress. And I stand before the Assembly today committed to investing American strength and to working with all nations to address the problems we face in the twenty-first century.As we speak  America is deploying our doctors and scientists  supported by our military  to help contain the outbreak of Ebola and pursue new treatments. But we need a broader effort to stop a disease that could kill hundreds of thousands  inflict horrific suffering  destabilize economies and move rapidly across borders. It is easy to see that problem as a distant problem  until it is not. And that is why we will continue to mobilize other countries to join us in making concrete commitments  significant commitments to fight the outbreak and enhance our system of global health security for the long term.America is pursuing a diplomatic resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue  as part of our commitment to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and pursue the peace and security of a world without them. But that can take place only if Iran seizes this historic opportunity. My message to Iran’s leaders and people has been simple and consistent: do not let this opportunity pass. We can reach a solution that meets Iran’s energy needs while assuring the world that Iran’s nuclear programme is peaceful.America is and will continue to be a Pacific Power  promoting peace  stability  and the free flow of commerce among nations. But we will insist that all nations abide by the rules of the road and resolve their territorial disputes peacefully  consistent with international law. That is how the Asia-Pacific region has grown. And that is the only way to protect the progress going forward.America is committed to a development agenda that eradicates extreme poverty by 2030. We will do our part to help people feed themselves  power their economies and care for their sick. If the world acts together  we can make sure that all of our children enjoy lives of opportunity and dignity.America is pursuing ambitious reductions in its carbon emissions  and we have increased our investments in clean energy. We will do our part and help developing nations do theirs. But the science tells us that we can succeed in combating climate change only if we are joined in that effort by every other nation  by every major Power. That is how we can protect the planet for our children and our grandchildren.In other words  on issue after issue  we cannot rely on a rule book written for a different century. If we lift our eyes beyond our borders  if we think globally and if we act cooperatively  we can shape the course of this century as our predecessors shaped the post-World War Two age.But as we look to the future  one issue risks starting a cycle of conflict that could derail so much progress. That is the cancer of violent extremism  which has ravaged so many parts of the Muslim world. Of course  terrorism is not new. Speaking before the Assembly  President Kennedy put it well:“Terror is not a new weapon. Throughout history it has been used by those who could not prevail either by persuasion or by example.” (A/PV.1013  para. 96)In the twentieth century  terror was used by all manner of groups who failed to come to power through public support. But in this century  we have faced a more lethal and ideological brand of terrorists who have perverted one of the world’s great religions. With access to technology that allows small groups to do great harm  they have embraced a nightmarish vision that would divide the world into adherents and infidels — killing as many innocent civilians as possible and employing the most brutal methods to intimidate people within their communities.I have made it clear that America will not base its entire foreign policy on reacting to terrorism. Instead  we have waged a focused campaign against Al-Qaida and its associated forces — taking out their leaders and denying them the safe havens they rely on. At the same time  we have reaffirmed again and again that the United States is not and never will be at war with Islam. Islam teaches peace. Muslims the world over aspire to live with dignity and a sense of justice. And when it comes to America and Islam  there is no us and them  there is only us  because millions of Muslim Americans are part of the fabric of our country.So we reject any suggestion of a clash of civilizations. Belief in permanent religious war is the misguided refuge of extremists who cannot build or create anything and therefore peddle only fanaticism and hate. And it is no exaggeration to say that the future of humankind depends on our uniting against those who would divide us along the fault lines of tribe or sect  race or religion.But this is not simply a matter of words. Collectively  we must take concrete steps to address the danger posed by religiously motivated fanatics and the trends that fuel their recruitment. Moreover  the campaign against extremism goes beyond a narrow security challenge. For while we have worked methodically to degrade Al-Qaida at its core and have supported a transition to a sovereign Afghan Government  extremist ideology has shifted to other places  particularly in the Middle East and North Africa  where a quarter of the young people have no job  where food and water could grow scarce  and where corruption is rampant and sectarian conflicts have become increasingly hard to contain.As an international community  we must meet this challenge with a focus on four areas. First  the terrorist group known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) must be degraded and ultimately destroyed. It has terrorized all those whom it has come across in Iraq and Syria. Mothers  sisters and daughters have been subjected to rape as a weapon of war. Innocent children have been gunned down. Bodies have been dumped into mass graves. Religious minorities have been starved to death. In the most horrific crimes imaginable  innocent human beings have been beheaded  with videos of the atrocity distributed to shock the conscience of the world.No god condones such terror. No grievance justifies such actions. There can be no reasoning or negotiation with that brand of evil. The only language understood by killers of that kind is the language of force. So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle that network of death. In this effort  we do not act alone  nor do we intend to send United States troops to occupy foreign lands. Instead  we will support Iraqis and Syrians fighting to reclaim their communities. We will use our military might to roll back ISIL in a campaign of air strikes. We will train and equip forces fighting those terrorists on the ground. We will work to cut off their financing and stop the flow of fighters into and out of the region. And more than 40 nations have already offered to join the coalition. Today  I ask the world to join in this effort. Those who have joined ISIL should leave the battlefield while they can. Those who continue to fight for a hateful cause will find that they are increasingly alone. For we will not succumb to threats  and we will demonstrate that the future belongs to those who build  not to those who destroy. So that is an immediate challenge  the first one we must meet.The second challenge is that it is time for the world  especially Muslim communities  to explicitly  forcefully and consistently reject the ideology of organizations such as Al-Qaida and ISIL. It is one of the tasks of all great religions to accommodate devout faith with a modern  multicultural world. No children are born hating  and no children anywhere should be educated to hate other people. There should be no further tolerance of so-called clerics who call on people to harm innocents because they are Jewish or Christian or Muslim. It is time for a new compact among the civilized peoples of this world to eradicate war at its most fundamental source  and that is the corruption of young minds by violent ideology.That means cutting off the funding that fuels such hatred. It is time to end the hypocrisy of those who accumulate wealth through the global economy and then siphon funds to those who teach children to tear it down. That means contesting the space that terrorists occupy  including the Internet and social media. Their propaganda has coerced young people to travel abroad to fight their wars and has turned students — young people full of potential — into suicide bombers. We must offer an alternative vision. That means bringing people of different faiths together. All religions have been attacked by extremists from within at some point  and all people of faith have a responsibility to lift up the value at the heart of all great religions. Do unto your neighbour as you would do — as you would have others do — unto yourself.The ideology of ISIL or Al-Qaida or Boko Haram will wilt and die if it is consistently exposed and confronted and refuted in the light of day. Look at the new Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies  whose purpose Sheikh Abdallah Bin Bayyah has described as “We must declare war on war  so the outcome will be peace upon peace”. Look at the young British Muslims who have responded to terrorist propaganda by starting the #notinmyname campaign  declaring that ISIL is hiding behind a false Islam. Look at the Christian and Muslim leaders who came together in the Central African Republic to reject violence; listen to the imam there who said that  while politics may try to divide the religious in that country  religion should not be a cause of hate  war  or strife.Later today  the Security Council will adopt a resolution that underscores the responsibility of States to counter violent extremism. But resolutions must be followed by tangible commitments  so that we are accountable when we fall short. Next year  we should all be prepared to announce the concrete steps that we have taken to counter extremist ideologies in our own countries — by getting intolerance out of schools  stopping radicalization before it spreads and promoting institutions and programmes that build new bridges of understanding.Thirdly  we must address the cycle of conflict  especially sectarian conflict  that creates the conditions that terrorists prey upon. There is nothing new about wars within religions. Christianity endured centuries of vicious sectarian conflict. Today it is violence within Muslim communities that has become the source of so much human misery. It is time to acknowledge the destruction wrought by proxy wars and terror campaigns between Sunni and Shia across the Middle East. And it is time that political  civic and religious leaders rejected sectarian strife. So let us be clear. This is a fight that no one is winning. A brutal civil war in Syria has already killed nearly 200 000 people and has displaced millions. Iraq has come perilously close to plunging back into the abyss. The conflict has created a fertile recruiting ground for terrorists  who inevitably export such violence.The good news is that we also see signs that the tide can be reversed. We have a new  inclusive Government in Baghdad and a new Iraqi Prime Minister welcomed by his neighbours; we see Lebanese factions that reject those who try to provoke war. Such steps must be followed by a broader truce. Nowhere is that more necessary than in Syria. Together with our partners  America is training and equipping the Syrian opposition to be a counterweight to the terrorists of ISIL and the brutality of the Al-Assad regime. But the only lasting solution to Syria’s civil war is political — an inclusive political transition that responds to the legitimate aspirations of all Syrian citizens  regardless of ethnicity  regardless of creed.Cynics may argue that such an outcome can never come to pass. But there is no other way for the madness in Syria to end  whether one year from now or 10. And it points to the fact that it is time for a broader negotiation in the region  in which major Powers address their differences directly  honestly and peacefully across the table from one another  rather than through gun-wielding proxies. I can promise the international community that America will remain engaged in the region  and we are prepared to engage in that effort.My fourth and final point is a simple one. The countries of the Arab and Muslim world must focus on the extraordinary potential of their people  especially the youth. And here I would like to speak directly to young people across the Muslim world. You come from a great tradition that stands for education  not ignorance; innovation  not destruction; the dignity of life  not murder. Those who call you away from that path are betraying that tradition  not defending it. You have demonstrated that when young people have the tools to succeed — good schools  education in math and science  an economy that nurtures creativity and entrepreneurship — then societies will flourish. So  America will partner with those who promote that vision.Where women are full participants in a country’s politics or economy  societies are more likely to succeed. And that is why we support the participation of women in parliaments and peace processes  schools and the economy. If young people live in places where the only option is between the dictates of a State or the lure of an extremist underground  then no counterterrorism strategy can succeed. But where a genuine civil society is allowed to flourish — where people can express their views and organize peacefully for a better life — then you dramatically expand the alternatives to terror.And such positive change need not come at the expense of tradition and faith. We see that in Iraq  where a young man started a library for his peers. “We link Iraq’s heritage to their hearts”  he said  and “give them a reason to stay”. We see it in Tunisia  where secular and Islamist parties worked together through a political process to produce a new constitution. We see it in Senegal  where civil society thrives alongside a strong democratic Government. We see it in Malaysia  where vibrant entrepreneurship is propelling a former colony into the ranks of advanced economies. And we see it in Indonesia  where what began as a violent transition has evolved into a genuine democracy.Ultimately the task of rejecting sectarianism and rejecting extremism is a generational one  and a task for the people of the Middle East themselves. No external power can bring about a transformation of hearts and minds. But America will be a respectful and constructive partner. We will neither tolerate terrorist safe havens nor act as an occupying Power. We will take action against threats to our security and our allies  while building an architecture of counter-terrorism cooperation. We will increase efforts to lift up those who counter extremist ideologies and who seek to resolve sectarian conflict. And we will expand our programmes to support entrepreneurship and civil society  education and youth  because ultimately those investments are the best antidote to violence.We recognize as well that leadership will be necessary to address the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. As bleak as the landscape appears  America will not give up on the pursuit of peace. Understand that the situation in Iraq and Syria and Libya should cure anybody of the illusion that the Arab-Israeli conflict is the main source of problems in the region. For far too long that has been used as an excuse to distract people from problems at home. The violence engulfing the region today has made too many Israelis ready to abandon the hard work of peace. And that is something worthy of reflection within Israel. Because let us be clear: the status quo in the West Bank and Gaza is not sustainable. We cannot afford to turn away from that effort — not when rockets are fired at innocent Israelis  or when the lives of so many Palestinian children are taken from us in Gaza. So long as I am President  we will stand up for the principle that Israelis  Palestinians  the region and the world will be more just and more safe with two States living side by side  in peace and security.So this is what America is prepared to do: take action against immediate threats  while pursuing a world in which the need for such action is diminished. The United States will never shy away from defending our interests  but we will also not shy away from the promise of this institution and its Universal Declaration of Human Rights — the notion that peace is not merely the absence of war  but the presence of a better life.I realize that America’s critics will be quick to point out that at times we too have failed to live up to our ideals and that America has plenty of problems within its own borders. That is true. In a summer marked by instability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe  I know the world also took notice of the small American city of Ferguson  Missouri  where a young man was killed and a community was divided. So  yes  we have our own racial and ethnic tensions. And  like every country  we continually wrestle with how to reconcile the vast changes wrought by globalization and greater diversity with the traditions that we hold dear.But we welcome the scrutiny of the world  because what you see in America is a country that has steadily worked to address our problems  to make our union more perfect  to bridge the divides that existed at the founding of this nation. America is not the same as it was 100 years ago or 50 years ago or even a decade ago. We fight for our ideals and we are willing to criticize ourselves when we fall short. We hold our leaders accountable and insist on a free press and an independent judiciary. We address our differences in the open space of democracy  with respect for the rule of law  with a place for people of every race and every religion and with an unyielding belief in the ability of individual men and women to change their communities and their circumstances and their countries for the better.After nearly six years as President  I believe that that promise can help light the world. I have seen a longing for positive change — for peace and for freedom and for opportunity and for an end to bigotry — in the eyes of young people whom I have met around the globe. They remind me that no matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like or what God you pray to or whom you love  there is something fundamental that we all share. Eleanor Roosevelt  a champion of the United Nations and America’s role in it  once asked  “Where  after all  do universal human rights begin? In small places  close to home — so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world. Yet they are the world of the individual person; the neighbourhood he lives in; the school or college he attends; the factory  farm or office where he works.”Around the world  young people are moving forward  hungry for a better world. Around the world  in small places  they are overcoming hatred and bigotry and sectarianism. And they are learning to respect each other  despite differences.The people of the world now look to us  here  to be as decent and dignified and courageous as they are trying to be in their daily lives. And at this crossroads  I can promise the Assembly that the United States of America will not be distracted or deterred from what must be done. We are heirs to a proud legacy of freedom  and we are prepared to do what is necessary to secure that legacy for generations to come. I ask that the Assembly join us in this common mission  for today’s children and tomorrow’s."
"182",7287,"UZB",69,2014,"Today I would like to address some of the most important issues on the General Assembly’s agenda.First are the growing regional and international security challenges and threats  escalating conflicts and wars  and the aggravation of geopolitical confrontations between large centres of power  which could produce new areas of tension in the world and make it more difficult to address the continuing global financial and economic crisis. All those elements are cause for serious alarm and deep concern. Uzbekistan firmly believes that such acute contradictions and confrontations can be tackled only through a political path and peaceful means  in strict observance of the fundamental principles of international law enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.The persisting instability in Afghanistan  which is exhibiting a tendency to escalate further  poses a serious threat to stability and security in Central Asia and the greater region. In the situation currently unfolding  the accelerated drawdown of the International Security Assistance Force may turn out to be counterproductive  and that could further complicate the state of affairs in Afghanistan.Today we can say with confidence that all the parties interested in resolving the Afghan problem are unanimous about one thing  which is that there is no military way to achieve peace in Afghanistan. The President of Uzbekistan  Islam Karimov  said so as long ago as 2008 at a NATO Summit in Bucharest  and at the General Assembly’s 2010 High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (see A/65/PV.3). The presidential elections in Afghanistan this year demonstrated vividly that the Afghan people are tired of bloodshed and violence  long-standing misery and devastation. Today they want peace and stability and the right to define their fate on their own.The only reasonable way to tackle the Afghan problem is to search for a political settlement of the conflict through peaceful negotiations and achieve consensus to establish a coalition Government in which all of Afghanistan’s parties in conflict and its national and religious groups would be represented.Uzbekistan adheres to a policy of non-interference in Afghanistan’s internal affairs. We are building and will continue to develop stable  friendly relations with Afghanistan that proceed from the national interests of both countries  and  on an exclusively bilateral basis  we will support the Government elected by the Afghan people.Secondly  in view of the ongoing global financial and economic crisis  transport and communications development and strengthened regional economic cooperation are key factors for ensuring Central Asia’s stability and sustainable development. Implementing large transport and communications infrastructure projects that can connect our region with global markets will promote interregional trade and economic cooperation  attract investment and help develop social and industrial infrastructure  as well as promote steady progress in neighbouring regions. I refer in particular to such projects as the international Uzbekistan-Turkmenistan-Iran-Oman Transport Corridor  which will link Central Asian countries to the Middle East by the shortest and most reliable and secure route. Uzbekistan’s completion of the Hairatan to Mazar-i-Sharif railway  the first and so far the only functioning railroad linking Afghanistan to the outside world  was a historic landmark event.Thirdly  as the States of Central Asia  like many other countries  are experiencing growing water shortages  the fair and reasonable use of the resources of the transboundary Amu Darya and Syr Darya Rivers becomes extremely important to the life support and well-being of the population of Central Asia. Uzbekistan adheres firmly to the principled position that the issue of the reasonable use of Central Asia’s transboundary river resources must be resolved according to the universally recognized norms of international law and within the framework of the relevant United Nations conventions on the use of international watercourses  which clearly define the principles of preventing damage to the environment and interests of neighbouring countries.We believe it is unacceptable that certain countries in the region are promoting the construction of large hydropower stations with gigantic dams without conducting an international  truly independent  unprejudiced and professional expert study. Implementing such projects without thorough analysis could exacerbate tensions and the potential for conflict in the region. Building such grandiose hydropower facilities in a mountainous  highly seismic area with a potential for earthquakes of magnitude of 9 points or highter could carry a high risk of devastating man-made catastrophes. I wish to underscore that owing to the potential for making ecological problems worse  a growing number of countries around the world are rejecting the construction of gigantic dams and opting for small and medium-size hydropower stations that do not damage the environment  safety or socioeconomic well-being of their populations.Fourthly  the dynamic development of our economy and modernization of all spheres of the country’s life have enabled Uzbekistan to ensure the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ahead of schedule. Since achieving independence  Uzbekistan has seen its economy grow almost five-fold and per capita income increase 8.7 times  testifying to the growth in our standards and quality of life. In the past 10 years  Uzbekistan’s annual rate of growth of its gross domestic product (GDP) has exceeded 8 per cent. By 2030 we intend to increase the per capita GDP to $9 300.About 60 per cent of State expenditures are channelled to fund social development  with more than 34.3 per cent of that spent on education. Almost 100 per cent of school-age children attend secondary schools. Women now represent 45.4 per cent of employed persons. We have achieved tangible successes in improving maternal and child health  with the mortality rate among children under the age of 5 reduced by a factor of 1.8 and maternal mortality rates by 1.6.Furthermore  Uzbekistan will do its utmost to achieve all its intended plans for the implementation of the MDGs as soon as possible. We will also continue to undertake large-scale programmes in terms of the post-2015 development agenda."
"183",7300,"VAT",69,2014,"In extending the Holy See’s congratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session  I wish to convey the cordial greetings of His Holiness Pope Francis to him and to all participating delegations. He assures the President of his closeness and prayers for the Assembly’s work during this session with the hope that it will be carried out in an atmosphere of productive collaboration  working for a more fraternal and united world by identifying ways to resolve the serious problems that beset the whole human family today.In continuity with his predecessors  Pope Francis recently reiterated the Holy See’s esteem and appreciation for the United Nations as an indispensable means of building an authentic family of peoples. The Holy See values the efforts of this institution to ensure world peace  respect for human dignity  the protection of persons  especially the poorest and most vulnerable  and harmonious economic and social development.Although mindful of the human person’s gifts and abilities  Pope Francis observes that today there is the danger of widespread indifference. To the extent that indifference concerns the field of politics  it also affects economic and social sectors  since an important part of humanity does not share in the benefits of progress and is in fact relegated to the status of second-class citizens. At times  such apathy is synonymous with irresponsibility.I also recall the words of His Holiness to the Secretary-General at the beginning of August: “It is with a heavy and anguished heart that I have been following the dramatic events in northern Iraq”. He was thinking of the tears  the suffering and the heartfelt cries of despair of Christians and other religious minorities of that beloved land. In that same letter the Pope renewed his urgent appeal to the international community to take action to end the humanitarian tragedy now under way. He further encouraged all the competent organs of the United Nations  in particular those responsible for security  peace  humanitarian law and assistance to refugees  to continue their efforts in accordance with the Preamble and relevant Articles of the Charter of the United Nations.Today  I am compelled to repeat the heartfelt appeal of His Holiness and to propose to the General Assembly and to the other competent organs of the United Nations that they deepen their understanding of the difficult and complex time in which we are now living.With the dramatic situation in northern Iraq and some parts of Syria  we are seeing a totally new phenomenon — the existence of a terrorist organization that threatens all States  vowing to dissolve them and to replace them with a pseudo-religious world government. Unfortunately  as the Holy Father recently said  even today there are those who would presume to wield power by coercing consciences and taking lives  persecuting and murdering in the name of God. Those actions bring injury to entire ethnic groups  populations and ancient cultures. It must be remembered that such violence is borne out of a disregard for God and falsifies religion itself  since religion aims instead at reconciling men and women with God  at illuminating and purifying consciences and at making it clear that each human being is the image of the Creator.In a world of global communications  that new phenomenon has found followers in numerous places and has succeeded in attracting from around the world young people who are often disillusioned by widespread indifference and a dearth of values in wealthier societies. That challenge  in all its tragic aspects  should compel the international community to promote a unified response  based on solid juridical criteria and a collective willingness to cooperate for the common good.To that end  the Holy See considers it useful to focus attention on two major areas. The first is to address the cultural and political origins of contemporary challenges  acknowledging the need for innovative strategies to confront those international problems in which cultural factors play a fundamental role. The second area for consideration is further study of the effectiveness of international law today  namely  its successful implementation by those mechanisms used by the United Nations to prevent war  stop aggressors  protect populations and help victims.Following the attacks of 9/11  when the world woke up to the reality of a new form of terrorism  some media and think tanks oversimplified the tragic moment by interpreting all subsequent and problematic situations in terms of a clash of civilizations. That view ignored long-standing and profound experiences of good relations between cultures  ethnic groups and religions and interpreted other complex situations through that lens  situations such as the Middle East question and civil conflicts occurring elsewhere.What  then  are the paths open to us?First and foremost  there is the path of promoting dialogue and understanding among cultures  which is implicit in the Preamble and Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations. That path must become an ever more explicit objective of the international community and of Governments if we are truly committed to peace in the world. The natural growth and enrichment of culture is the fruit of all components of civil society working together. International organizations and States have the task of promoting and supporting  in a decisive way and with the necessary financial means  those initiatives and movements that promote dialogue and understanding among cultures  religions and peoples. Peace  after all  is not the fruit of a balance of powers  but rather the result of justice at every level and  most importantly  is the shared responsibility of individuals  civil institutions and Governments.And yet  we do not face the challenges of terrorism and violence with cultural openness alone. The important path of international law is also available to us. The situation today requires a more incisive understanding of international law  with particular attention to the responsibility to protect. One of the characteristics of the recent terrorist phenomenon is that it disregards the existence of the State and  in fact  the entire international order. Terrorism aims not only to bring change to Governments  to damage economic structures or simply to commit common crimes  it seeks also to directly control areas within one or more States and to impose its own laws  which are distinct and opposed to those of the sovereign State. It also undermines and rejects all existing juridical systems  in an attempt to impose dominion over consciences and complete control over persons.The global nature of this phenomenon  which knows no borders  is precisely why the framework of international law offers the only viable way of dealing with this urgent challenge. This reality requires a renewed United Nations that undertakes to foster and preserve peace.Given that the new forms of terrorism are transnational  they no longer fall under the competence of the security forces of any one State. The territories of several States are involved. Therefore  the combined forces of a number of nations will be required to guarantee the defence of unarmed citizens. Since there is no juridical norm justifying unilateral policing actions beyond one’s own borders  there is no doubt that that area of competence lies with the Security Council.My delegation wishes to recall that it is both licit and urgent to stop aggression through multilateral action and a proportionate use of force. As the representative body of a worldwide religious community that embraces different nations  cultures and ethnicities  the Holy See earnestly hopes that the international community will assume responsibility in considering the best means to stop all aggression and prevent the perpetration of new and even graver injustices.It is paramount that there be a unity of action for the common good  while avoiding the crossfire of vetoes. As His Holiness wrote to the Secretary-General on 9 August “the most basic understanding of human dignity compels the international community  particularly through the norms and mechanisms of international law  to do all that it can to stop and to prevent further systematic violence against ethnic and religious minorities”.While the concept of the responsibility to protect is implicit in the constitutional principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of humanitarian law  it does not specifically favour a recourse to arms; it asserts  rather  the responsibility of the entire international community  in a spirit of solidarity  to confront heinous crimes such as genocide  ethnic cleansing and religiously motivated persecution. Today  I cannot fail to mention the many Christians and ethnic minorities who in recent months have endured atrocious persecution and suffering in Iraq and Syria.In its resolution 68/6  the General Assembly decided that it would at the present session discuss the post-2015 development agenda  which would then be formally adopted at its seventieth session  in September 2015. The President aptly chose the main theme of the present session to be “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”. In a communication to the recent meeting of the Chief Executives of the agencies  funds and programmes of the United Nations  His Holiness requested that future objectives for sustainable development be formulated“with generosity and courage  so that they can have a real impact on the structural causes of poverty and hunger  attain more substantial results in protecting the environment  ensure dignified and productive labour for all and provide appropriate protection for the family  which is an essential element in sustainable human and social development. Specifically  this involves challenging all forms of injustice and resisting the economy of exclusion  the throwaway culture and the culture of death”.In that regard  the Holy See welcomes the 17 sustainable development goals proposed by the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable Development Goals  which seek to address the structural causes of poverty by promoting dignified labour for everyone. Equally  the Holy See appreciates that the goals and targets do not  for the most part  echo wealthy populations’ fears regarding population growth in poorer countries. It also welcomes the fact that the goals and targets do not impose on poorer States lifestyles that are typically associated with advanced economies and which tend to show a disregard for human dignity.As stated earlier  the responsibility to protect is relevant to cases of extreme aggressions against human rights and cases of serious contempt of humanitarian law or grave natural catastrophes. In a similar way  there is a need to make legal provision for protecting people against other forms of aggression that are less evident but just as serious and real. For example  a financial system governed only by speculation and the maximization of profits  or one in which individual persons are regarded as disposable items in a culture of waste  could be tantamount  in certain circumstances  to an offence against human dignity. It follows  therefore  that the United Nations and its Member States have an urgent and grave responsibility for the poor and the excluded  mindful always that social and economic justice is an essential condition for peace.Each day of the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly  and indeed of its next four sessions  until November 2018  will bear the sad and painful memory of the futile and inhumane tragedy of the First World War — a senseless slaughter  as Pope Benedict XV referred to it  with its millions of victims and untold destruction. Marking the centenary of the start of the conflict  His Holiness Pope Francis expressed his desire that“the mistakes of the past are not repeated  that the lessons of history are acknowledged  and that the cause of peace may always prevail through patient and courageous dialogue”.In making my own the sentiments of the Holy Father  I fervently hope that they may be shared by all present here. I offer to all members of the Assembly my best wishes in their work. I trust that this session will spare no effort to put to an end the clamour of weapons that marks existing conflicts and that it will continue to foster the development of the entire human race  in particular the poorest among us."
"184",7335,"VCT",69,2014,"We gather this week to reaffirm our commitment to peace  justice and development. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines proudly recognizes Mr. John Ashe  son of our Caribbean soil and President of the General Assembly at the sixty-eighth session  and commends him for his invaluable contribution in advancing the international agenda during his superlative tenure. We joyously welcome the current President as our new standard-bearer. As part of the African diaspora  we celebrate with the continent of Africa in claiming him as one of our own  and in investing the same faith and confidence in him in this role as do the people of his native Uganda.Fifteen years into the twenty-first century  the challenges of our times have caused some nations to question the value or role of sovereignty in an increasingly borderless world. Globalization and modernity have unleashed a number of forces that operate independently of national Governments or borders. They include the ills of climate change; communicable diseases such as Ebola; and economic contagion that spreads like wildfire as external shocks that pose serious developmental and existential threats beyond the scope of individual States to address. Groups have emerged — from terrorists to drug cartels to certain rapacious multinationals — that span the globe and exploit systemic weaknesses to further their own nefarious self-interest.The pressures of keeping pace in an interconnected world have prompted suggestions that we can no longer rely on a traditional rulebook that does not specifically contemplate our modern challenges. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines emphatically rejects this suggestion. The rulebook that governs our international cooperation is the Charter of the United Nations  and its principal golden rule is that of respect for the sovereign equality of all States.To be sure  certain administrative aspects of our rulebook — for example  the composition and working methods of our fossilized and increasingly irrelevant Security Council — are clearly long overdue for meaningful reform. However  the principles that inform our Charter and undergird the Assembly are timeless. Any attempt to deviate from the Charter in word  deed or spirit would constitute an assault on sovereignty  a departure from diplomacy  and the improvisation of international law on the fly.The loss of sovereignty has never benefited the weak or powerless. The erosion of sovereignty has never restrained the interests of the powerful. The list of nations whose sovereignty has been violated in the interest of great Power convenience grows inexorably longer  while the tally of those whose populations are demonstrably better off for such violations remains tragically short. Accordingly  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines rejects the choice between modern interconnectivity and traditional sovereignty as false and intended to accelerate a global slide into lawless unilateralism.As upholders of and adherents to international law  we continue to struggle in search of common themes to help us understand which coup d’état is legal and which is not; which foreign intervention is just and which is criminal; which particular sovereignty or territorial integrity is worth fighting for  and which should be conveniently disregarded and swept under the rug of endless  impotent debate; which national border constitutes a barrier  and which represents an invitation; which World Trade Organization decision will be enforced to the detriment of the weak  and which  as in the case of our Caribbean Community (CARICOM) neighbour Antigua and Barbuda  will be ignored by the guilty but powerful party. As a small  open  vulnerable State  we cannot accept the suggestion that our existence rests on the whim  generosity or benign neglect of powerful States. International law and sovereign equality are the bulwarks against the type of naked aggression and unilateralism that have too often led our nations to the precipice of war.The cancer of terrorism continues to spread. The world has witnessed the celebration of savagery and the multiplication of misery by those who sow death and hatred in the name of religion. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  like every other civilized nation  is outraged at the global rise of militant groups that commit unspeakable acts of mass violence in their quest to enforce a brutal and indefensible social order.However  the fact that terrorists disregard national borders and sovereignty is no excuse for us to do the same. We must not stoop to their level by neglecting the bedrock principles of the peaceful coexistence of nations. Nor must we ever repeat the mistake of believing that terrorism is a force that can be harnessed or supported to further some greater political objective. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines cannot accept that the difference between noble rebel and evil terrorist can hinge on something as arbitrary as on which side of a border they decide to perform their rapes  beheadings and bombings. We unequivocally support genuine efforts targeted at eliminating this scourge  and we call for global solidarity and international cooperation in this urgent cause. Politics may make for strange bedfellows  but in a civilized world  humanity must always trump ideology in the fight against murderous barbarism.The political manipulation of the term “terrorist” threatens our shared resolve to eliminate its growing menace. Nowhere is this manipulation more glaringly objectionable than in the false designation by the United States of the Republic of Cuba as a State sponsor of terrorism. Cuba has been a victim of State terrorism  a condemner of State terrorism and a collaborator in the fight against State terrorism. Meanwhile  other actors nakedly support and lavishly fund the most despicable terrorist groups  without so much as a hint of public reproach. It is hard to imagine why the United States  a firm  honourable and unquestioned global leader in the fight against terrorism  and the target of the most heinous attacks  would want to distract itself  or its allies  from the fight at hand by maintaining its unfounded characterization of Cuba.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines reiterates the call of the overwhelming majority of States for an immediate end to the illegal economic  commercial and financial embargo against Cuba. The external projection of political self-interest is not a sovereign exercise  but a retrograde and anachronistic attack on the very principles that undergird the Organization. The United States is a far greater nation than this petty  punitive and illegal embargo suggests. We encourage it to demonstrate the courage to cast aside this Cold War relic.We are one month removed from the disastrous consequences of yet another violent conflict between combatants in Israel and the State of Palestine. Thousands are dead and thousands more were wounded — the overwhelming majority of whom were Palestinian civilians. Whatever the motivations for that particular conflict  no one can doubt that the underlying problem remains unaddressed and unresolved. At its root is the invasion  occupation and economic strangulation of Palestine  and the steady  illegal erosion of its internationally established borders.Despite regrettable actions on both sides of this dispute  no amount of political relativism can apportion blame equally between occupier and occupied. The unquestionable right of Israel to exist in peace and defend itself does not and cannot give it unfettered licence to occupy  oppress and suppress the sovereign rights of the Palestinian people. Israel is a powerful  accomplished  democratic nation with powerful friends. It diminishes itself and the status of its allies by its unchallenged actions in Palestine. Once again  the absence of borders and the disregard of sovereignty threaten to make the concept of a two-State solution nothing more than feel-good rhetoric with limited applicability on the ground.A great Caribbean artist  Peter Tosh  once lamented in song that while “everyone is crying out for peace  none are crying out for justice”. Peace cannot be assumed in the absence of war  nor can it be established in the absence of justice. This Assembly owes the people of Palestine its attention and action in the long- overdue quest for real peace and statehood.Climate change does not respect national borders — a fact known all too well in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Despite a tiny carbon footprint and minuscule emissions  our country has nonetheless been repeatedly victimized by weather anomalies partially caused by the historical and continued environmental abuse of major emitters. In the past four years  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has experienced a hurricane  a drought and two floods. The loss and damage caused by each of those events has resulted in annual double-digit hits to our gross domestic product (GDP). Last December  in a mere three hours of unseasonal rainfall  17 per cent of our GDP was washed away in flash flooding. Our sister islands of Grenada and Dominica were similarly affected. Lives and livelihoods were lost  homes and infrastructure were destroyed  and a developmental hole was dug from which it will take years to emerge.Yet  despite the gathering and intensifying global threat of climate change  with its real and ruinous present-day impacts  historical and major emitters continue to act as if the planet had time on its side. The excuses offered for continued inaction  whether political  historical  scientific or economic  grow increasingly indefensible. The prospects of genuine progress against climate change become increasingly remote with each passing day of diplomatic dithering  buck-passing and finger-pointing.Last week  the Secretary-General convened a high-level Climate Summit here at United Nations Headquarters in an admirable attempt to galvanize political will for an ambitious and legally binding climate treaty by 2015. However  the tangible results were less than encouraging. Despite some welcome new pledges  the numbers simply do not add up to anything close to what is required to cap global warming at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Furthermore  the new resources raised and pledged for the financing of adaptation to climate change were a drop in the bucket — akin to having a bake sale to settle the national debt.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is fearful that the legally binding agreement  which we are scheduled to enact next year  will be insufficiently ambitious to solve our looming climate crisis  and that adaptation financing will be woefully short of what is truly required. If narrow interests and local electoral cowardice force us to retreat behind our national borders and bury our heads in the sand  we may squander a decade of effort and our only real chance to save the planet on which we live. The stakes are that high. We cannot afford to fail.It is appropriate that the President of the General Assembly will preside over the launch of the International Decade of People of African Descent  which runs from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2024. The theme of that Decade will be “People of African descent: recognition  justice and development”. The meaningful and action-oriented implementation of this theme can have far-reaching positive effects on the African continent and among its far-flung diaspora alike.One element of recognition  justice and development that will be of central importance to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the wider Caribbean Community is the advancement of our claims for reparatory justice from the European colonizing Powers that engaged in native genocide  the transatlantic slave trade and the prolonged system of chattel slavery itself. Over the past year  CARICOM Heads of State and Government have unanimously approved a series of policies  structures and initiatives aimed at educating our populations and engaging former slave-holding and slave-trading nations in a conversation about reparatory justice. The level of priority that CARICOM Governments accord to the issue of reparatory justice cannot be overstated. At the historical root of our region’s many developmental impediments is an enduring legacy of slavery  which is the unchanging millstone that we have been forced to carry uphill for generations. We seek the support of the international community in furthering our just and timely cause.Similarly  in a region still grappling with the aftereffects of systematic discrimination  victimization and human rights violations under the cover of unjust law  we cannot countenance the re-emergence of judicially sanctioned bigotry within our Caribbean civilization. The application of the year-old decision of the Constitutional Court of the Dominican Republic continues to retroactively deny thousands of Dominican-born citizens of their rights to nationality  identity and equal protection. The unanimous international condemnation of the decision has led to welcome and increased political interaction between Haiti and the Dominican Republic on a host of bilateral issues. We hold out every hope that those discussions between neighbours will benefit both countries.However  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the wider CARICOM remain outraged at the core human rights violations that have not been corrected and cannot be resolved by bilateral tête-à-tête. We are beyond the point where continuing human rights violations can be masked behind seemingly benign bureaucracy. We call on the international community to assist our brothers in the Dominican Republic in reinstating the constitutional and human rights of those Dominicans who have been so wrongly stripped of their citizenship and dignity.Last year  from this rostrum  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines called on the United Nations to accept its role and offer recompense to the victims of the cholera outbreak in Haiti  it having been established that United Nations peacekeepers brought the cholera with them to Haiti (see A/68/PV.16). A year later  the United Nations continues to dodge its moral and ethical responsibility. The legitimacy of the Organization to conduct future peacekeeping missions and the legacy of its leadership at the highest levels will be irreparably damaged by any failure to immediately redress this glaring wrong.The prestige and legitimacy of the United Nations can be further enhanced through further acceptance of the reasonable calls for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the specialized agencies of the United Nations. Taiwan already participates actively and constructively in many critical international bodies. My country and several others in the Caribbean and Central America bear testimony to Taiwan’s principled conduct of its intergovernmental relations. Surely the time has now come for this exemplar of the magnificent Chinese civilization to be permitted to participate in the work of various agencies of this world body.The chosen theme for this general debate — “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda” — reflects a wise focus on a central priority and core strength of this institution. The exercise and advancement of the right to development is an overarching priority for the overwhelming majority of the world’s peoples  and it is the absence of sufficient developmental progress that is often the root cause of a great deal of global violence and unrest.The post-2015 development agenda must coalesce around a series of goals and targets that offer a people-centred path of progress for developing countries. In elaborating that agenda  and in this  the International Year of Small Island Developing States (SIDS)  it is critical that the vulnerabilities and unique characteristics of SIDS inform that document. The recently agreed Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action (A/CONF.223/3  annex)  which emerged from the historic Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  must constitute a foundational input in shaping the development agenda in areas such as concessional financing for development  inequality  poverty alleviation  debt relief  disaster-risk reduction  oceans management and education.In that regard  we consider it vital that the post-2015 goals and indicators focus equally on targets within developing countries and measurable  timely commitments from development partners. A major shortcoming of the Millennium Development Goals has been the nebulous nature of the so-called global partnership for development. Let us anchor our shared future ambitions in concrete  measurable and predictable action.Civilized Governments and peoples must respect borders and sovereignty even if some of the forces unleashed by globalization and modernity do not. Let us build on what is right  good and proper in our new interconnected world and cast away not the rulebook but the excuses for disregarding its time-honoured rules.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines celebrates the good of a world in which every student of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines can browse the stacks of an American library using his or her own Taiwanese computer that was assembled in China. It welcomes a business environment where we can rely on the support of an American non-governmental organization in engaging an Icelandic company and its Canadian counterpart in harnessing our national geothermal resources and propelling us towards 100 per cent renewable energy. We celebrate an international solidarity in which brotherly nations offer support in our time of need after a natural disaster  and engineers and architects convene on our shores to help us rebuild. We welcome technology that allows us the opportunity to communicate  celebrate or commiserate with our migrant diaspora in real time and affords them the opportunity to send remittances to their families at home from every corner of the globe. We value an international order that allows a tiny State to disagree respectfully with a large one without fear of unjust repercussions. We revel in regional integration arrangements  like the Caribbean Community  the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  where sovereignty is respected and often pooled  in furthering a cooperative  people-centred vision for growth and development.Those are not dreams but modern realities in our country today. They demonstrate the paths of peaceful coexistence and development that are possible when sovereignty is enhanced  not eroded. Any nation can like or dislike another nation  approve or disapprove of its decisions  admonish or praise its actions  befriend or avoid its Governments. Those are sovereign rights. But every nation is obliged to respect its counterpart’s equal and unfettered right to exist  act and determine its own political destiny and development path.The challenge of the twenty-first century is the obsolescence  not of the rulebook  but of the outmoded playbook of cynical strategies  tactics and inconsistent application of international law by those who see it as a tool to further their goals  rather than a restraint on hegemonic geopolitical ambition. Sovereignty is not the right to erect a wall of repression or injustice around national borders. Nor is it the right to protect and project national interests to the detriment of another. It is neither sword nor shield. It is  instead  a responsibility to adhere to an ethic of reciprocity — to do unto other nations only what one’s own nation would accept being done unto itself."
"185",7382,"VEN",69,2014,"At the outset  as this is the first time that I am attending in my capacity as the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  I wish to thank the General Assembly  all its representative Governments and the various bodies of the United Nations system for the heartfelt tribute that was paid simultaneously at United Nations Headquarters in New York  in Geneva and other places in the world to an extraordinary human being  Commander Hugo Chávez  who always carried the banners of peace  equality and respect for our peoples. That is the first thing I wish to convey from my heart on behalf of the people of Venezuela and to recall and invoke his spirit of tackling imperialism and injustice.We have had debates for several decades now on the need to reform the Organization  and various Presidents that have presided over the Assembly. This morning  I strongly reminded Presidents Dilma Rousseff  Cristina Fernández  Evo Morales Ayma and other Presidents of the Americas of the need to reorient  readjust and tweak the entire United Nations system. This system has been in place for 70 years since the end of the so-called Second World War  which took place in Europe and other parts of the world between 1939 and 1945.The United Nations Charter is one of the most beautiful poems that we could ever read. It has well and truly become an instrument that has been set aside  overlooked and consistently flouted in terms of its fundamental objectives are concerned. The United Nations is an historic human experiment that has become a landmark because never before has humankind had a forum to meet to address issues of peace  affecting life and death  and to negotiate solutions to conflicts. After 7 000 years of civilization as we know it — a review of which reveals a history of empires and the ongoing battle to distribute the wealth and territory of the world — only with the establishment of this system in 1945 did we begin to get a glimpse of future light at the end of a long tunnel of battles  wars and global conflicts.We call for the renewed relevance of the United Nations  above and beyond any criticism that may be levelled against it. Given the human importance of this institution  we insist on the need for an in-depth transformation  as Commander Hugo Chávez said on many occasions right here in this Hall. In his famous statements in defence of the causes of humankind  he stressed the need for a far-reaching democratic overhaul of the United Nations system. As President Jacob Zuma of our sister country South Africa said  we must democratize and overhaul the Security Council.The role of the regions today is different from what it was in 1945. This is another world. The United Nations was born to deal with post-war reconstruction and the issues that had given rise to conflicts. The United Nations has to deal today with a multicentric  multipolar world of numerous actors  with emerging countries and regions that have their own thoughts  aspirations and desire to be respected in this world. The United Nations has to adapt and submit to the broader sovereignty of the peoples of this world  who are crying out for their voices to be heard  heeded and respected.We have heard speeches today at the start of this sixty-ninth session. We also believe in strengthening the role of the Secretary-General. As we have said so many times we must have a Secretary-General who represents all of us and who has the political and institutional clout to find solutions to the world’s conflicts. We must reconfigure the system and functions of the General Assembly. We must democratize it and give it a leading role to ensure that the great debates that take place here can always successfully address the major issues facing the world. That is why we believe that we must build a new United Nations in a bid for a new multipolar world of peace where there no empire can impose its will on a unipolar world. This is urgent for the entire world.Above and beyond what officials of the various Governments represented in this Hall may believe  we already have another world where we all wish to speak  think and decide our own fate and to achieve peace for our peoples. A new regionalism has come to the fore. In the late 1940s and the 1950s  we saw the birth of the European Union as an experiment in the new regionalism that is admired and emulated by many throughout the world. In the 1970s and 1980s  we saw the emergence of the Organization of African Unity  an extraordinary system to organize the brotherly African continent to address the issues of development and life. Our mother Africa was one of the most suffering regions the world.Now as we embark on the twenty-first century  Latin America is taking its place. We have seen new organizations arise in Latin America. On 14 December  we will commemorate in Havana  Cuba  a heroic island and great homeland  the tenth anniversary of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. We have assumed an important role in building a new social and economic order in defence of such major causes as climate change. In existence for 10 years now  that youthful organization  partnership or alliance is now looking forward to the rest of the twenty-first century.I would also mention Petrocaribe and its 18 brotherly member States. I hope I may be forgiven if I seem immodest  but PetroCaribe is a model that best shows how we can have a new world of peace  justice  solidarity  cooperation and complementarity among nations. To the powerful of the world  those who wield all the capital and all the economic power  I say that we can have another world. We are starting to build it in the Americas.Also emerging is the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR)  representing a new southern regionalism that was founded on 16 April 2007 with the participation of new leaders in Latin America and our Commander Hugo Chávez. It is a most interesting and important bloc that is now starting to forge ties with the rest of the emerging world.We recently held a very interesting and important meeting for the remainder of the decade between the BRICS countries — Brazil  Russia  India  China and South Africa  who represent the hope for development through new mechanisms — and UNASUR in Brasilia  and we decided to share our experiences. The BRICS Bank and the Banco del Sur would be a new financial architecture for the world that must emerge from this new regionalism. The Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) was established on 3 December 2011 in Caracas  and is already growing strong. We have held summits in Santiago de Chile and Havana and will hold another in San José in January. All of Latin America is coming together optimistically in this new regionalism.Based on this experience  we are seeing new structures arise towards the establishment of a road map for overhauling the United Nations system. Let the call for reform of the Organization not fall through the cracks here in this Hall. We must find the way. We must try to come up with a common road map for humankding because we need it if we are to tackle the major issues before us.For 22 years  the United Nations has customarily voted with record insistence for a cause that is not just a cause of the Americas but one espoused by the peoples and Governments of this world. I speak of the rejection of the economic embargo against our brother Republic of Cuba — an anachronistic vestige of the Cold War. The President of Estonia spoke earlier about the anachronisms of the Cold War and the systems of economic persecution used to impose political regimes and subjugate peoples. We are here on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to confirm our support for the 50-year struggle of the people and Government of Cuba against the criminal blockade. I ask President Obama: When will you seize the opportunity to go down in history by putting an end once and for all to the criminal economic and trade embargo and persecution of our brother country of Cuba?We also see new causes arise in the current struggles facing our region. We have taken them on in unison. I wish here to recognize as a great step forward the decision taken by the General Assembly two weeks ago in support of the Argentine Republic and President Cristina Fernández in her struggle against the financial plundering of the vulture funds. We want to support her in every way we can to ensure that the General Assembly  in accordance with the proposal of the Group of 77 and China and in as timely and efficient a manner as possible  drafts a high-quality document mandating the defence of the nations represented by the Organization  especially the poor countries of the developing world  against vulture funds that seek to plunder our economies and impose detrimental economic  institutional and political systems. We confirm the full solidarity of the people of Venezuela with the people of Argentina  and indeed the solidarity of the CELAC countries. Let us move towards this historic decision. We received 124 votes in favour last week.As we did at the CELAC summit in Havana  Venezuela also calls on the United Nations to support as closely and warmly as it can and enforce the decisions calling on the United States of America to enforce and execute a decolonization plan for Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico was invited to join CELAC because it is Caribbean and it is ours. We raise our voice to make it heard in this Hall to call for the release of a man whose name many here will hear for the first time. President Jacob Zuma of South Africa spoke of the great Madiba  Nelson Mandela  who was forgotten for many years  despite the fact that many now claim him as a representative of their causes. That is fine. Nelson Mandela represents the human capacity of resilience and resistance enjoyed by people as they seek to achieve the objectives of justice and peace.That is why I raise the name of a man who almost 35 years ago was imprisoned and has been subjected to torture — a man with a family  a man from Latin America and the Caribbean  a man like us. We are talking about the Puerto Rican Oscar López Rivera  the longest-held political prisoner who remains in a United States prison to this day. We demand his immediate release. His only sin was to fight for independence and to defend the beautiful flag and star of the dignity of our sister country of Puerto Rico. These are the causes of this historic moment.Venezuela is in the midst of a people’s democratic revolution that began with an unimpeachable constitutional event. For the first time in the history of our country  the Constitution of the Republic was debated by the people and approved by a referendum with the participation of the sovereign vote of the people of Venezuela in 1999. Since then  we have been developing and carrying out a process of political and social liberation.We are trying to overcome poverty. In 2015  we will have the post-2015 development agenda and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will be over. Through great effort  the Bolivarian Venezuela led by our Commander Hugo Chávez  was fortunately able achieve practically all the MDGs. We have an enrolment rate of more than 90 per cent in almost all schools  and we offer free  quality education from basic schools through to universities. We have lowered the unemployment rate from 20 per cent five years ago to 5.5 per cent at the end of last year. We have changed the curves. We had vulnerable employment to the tune of 60 per cent; now  60 per cent of those jobs are protected by social security  and are remunerated at a fair  regulated rate.I could spend hours here talking of the progress we have made towards the MDGs. We have been able to salvage our oil wealth. I am sure Members will know that we have the largest oil reserves on the planet in the beautiful Orinoco basin  and we have the largest oil fields there. For the first time in 90 years  we recovered full control over our own petroleum resources as the anchor for our economic and social development. Venezuela has had to suffer ongoing harassment and persecution at the hands of the imperial forces and the allies of the United States empire  who have sought again and again to undermine our democracy. One such attempt was the attempted coup against Hugo Chávez. Following his death on 5 March 2013  those forces resumed their activities to undermine our country. I thank the Governments of the world for their solidarity with Venezuela  which has been struggling and resisting. They could not prevail against Hugo Chávez and they cannot prevail against us. We are still on the path towards revolution  democracy  independence and dignity  with our own voice speaking to the world.There are major problems that we now have to address at this point. As members well know  one such problem — perhaps the greatest threat of all — is the virus that causes Ebola haemorrhagic fever. If this world and our United Nations system had been somewhat more humane  we would have focused on lending our support to tackling this real threat instead of sending drones  missiles and bombs to destroy the people of Gaza or to bomb the people of Iraq and Syria. The President of Chad announced that his country had decided to donate $2 million to the Ebola fund. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is going to be giving $5 million to the fund to support Africa and the needy people of the world.Let us be clear. We should be discussing the scientific reports here and taking decisions based on those reports. We should be focused on another important issue affecting the survival of humankind on this Earth — climate change. A poem of the indigenous peoples of the Americas  which was read out yesterday  says that after they can no longer poison the rivers  after they have poisoned our lakes  once there is not even one fish left to eat  then the powerful of the world will have to eat each other. They want to create extraneous formulas when all they need to do is to make an extraordinary effort and recognize climate change as a climatic emergency. We should not just make speeches and vague offers; we must restore sanity to the Organization if we are to strengthen it  and place at the forefront of our agenda the real common problems facing us.Today in the Security Council  they adopted a series of decisions in a bid to combat terrorism. Let us be clear: we must combat terrorism. The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America has been condemning terrorism for more than a year and a half. We are deeply pained by the murder of Western journalists and the dastardly acts of these terrorists  but a year and a half ago when boys and girls were captured by these terrorist and other groups in Syria  we were not that pained at that time. They were beheading women in mosques. The pain should be the same.Should our pain be greater depending on the colour or origin of the skin of a person or the origin of that person? The loss of human lives should pain us all  and we therefore condemn the terrorist attack perpetrated by NATO and its allies to change the regime in Syria. I am here to say  with force of truth  on behalf of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America and my Government  that if the Government of Syria had been overthrown by those imperial attacks  today in that entire region of Syria  Lebanon  Iraq and Jordan we would see the power of those terrorists take root.As painful as it may be  we have to say that President Bashar Al-Assad and the democratic and constitutional Government of Syria has always combated terrorism and has suffered thousands of deaths. We believe that instead of the continual  demented bombing  must strike a great alliance of peace against terrorism  respecting the sovereignty of countries and sovereign Governments throughout that region. I would ask the delegation of the United States take note of this message and convey it to President Obama.Only an alliance that respects the sovereignty of those nations  along with the cooperation of their Governments  peoples and armed forces  will overthrow the Islamic State and the terrorist forces advancing like monster against the West. There is no other way to overthrow them — certainly not with bombs that kill mostly the innocent. They never kill the armed forces; they always kill the innocent. After so much death and bombing of the brotherly Arab people of Iraq  we have to invite the sovereign Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran  Iraq  Syria  Lebanon  Jordan and Egypt and indeed the entire region to come up with a comprehensive political  military  cultural and communication strategy that can be supported by the Security Council. Anything else is crazy.Let us consider what happened in Libya  as noted by the President of Chad. It only fomented hatred and an anti-Al-Qadhafi front. What is happening in Libya? It has become a territory for trafficking in arms and explosives by terrorist groups fighting for scraps of territory. We have seen the end of the beautiful history of the people of our brother country of Libya. It is a crazy race towards more violence and terrorism. A more dangerous world has emerged from the demented work of those who lead and make decisions in the Organization.We humbly lend our voice and our proposal to the table  and we do so with genuine love. That is how we show our solidarity with the people of Palestine. We in the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America will continue to show our solidarity with them. Venezuela  as Members know  has opened a modest air-bridge to provide logistical support  food  blankets and medicines in support of the people of Palestine who recently suffered a brutal attack. We want peace  total peace. Our Organization needs to be overhauled so that everyone can enjoy total peace. It is not through the threat of the use of force  or the use of force  or internal competition to overthrow Governments such as the one that I lead  that we will have stable peace. No  it is respect for international law that will lead to stable peace and full security.Lastly  I wish to thank the General Assembly for its support. Next year  2015  Venezuela  with members’ support  will assume leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement for the next three years. We humbly aspire to play a genuine role in mobilizing and revitalizing the entire process of United Nations reform. The process must include the elaboration of an agenda of world priorities in which we will all have a voice and a vote  and no one can impose their will on the others. Next year  delegations from throughout the world will be welcome at the historic Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Caracas."
"186",7421,"VNM",69,2014,"At the outset  I should like to extend my warmest congratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I am confident that under his able leadership this session will enjoy great success. My appreciation also goes to Mr. John William Ashe  President at the sixty-eighth session  and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for their important contributions to the work of our Organization over the past year.This session of the General Assembly takes place as we approach the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. It gives us the opportunity to look back on the past almost 70 years of the United Nations implementing its mandate to assist nations to build a world of peace  security and sustainable development  a world where fundamental rights and freedoms are respected and promoted. It is also an opportunity for in-depth discussions on the formulation and implementation of the post-2015 development agenda.This year’s Assembly session is also convened against the backdrop of a world landscape that features numerous turning points and contrasts. On the bright side  increasingly the United Nations is playing better its central role in the promotion of the system of rules and norms of international law  thus facilitating solutions to global challenges  and of the interests of peace and development for all nations. Globalization and multilayered economic cooperation and linkages continue to evolve strongly. Our efforts to realize the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have brought encouraging results in most regions.We see also a more sombre part  one that paints the many daunting challenges the world is facing. The trend of cooperation contains risks  while global economic recovery is yet to be sustainable. International peace and security are being challenged by the negative factor of competition and intervention and especially by the potential escalation of territorial and sovereignty disputes. Ongoing crises and conflicts in the Middle East and a number of African countries have inflicted major human and material losses and threaten regional and international peace and security.Global challenges remain high on the agenda of the international community. Terrorism  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  nuclear security and safety  environmental pollution  depletion of natural resources  climate change  natural calamities  epidemics and the lack of food and water security are issues of primary concern to the international community. They require enhanced joint efforts.Peace and security are prerequisites for sustainable development. The United Nations and its Member States must live up to their responsibility to strengthen international peace and security  prevent potential conflicts and find solutions to ongoing hostilities. That is an urgent task  but it also requires long-term engagement. History has taught us that the paths that lead to wars and conflicts lie in obsolete doctrines of power politics  of ambitions of domination and imposition  and of the threat of force in settling international disputes  including territorial and sovereignty disputes.Viet Nam believes that respect for international law is the foundation of peace  security and stability for sustainable development. More than ever  Member States  big or small  rich or poor  must all respect and seriously observe the principles  rules and norms of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. All nations must renounce the use of force as an option in their international relations and instead settle all disputes by peaceful means. That is a crucial area in which the United Nations represents a powerful advance from the League of Nations  and it commands greater commitment and effort from Member States.In that spirit  Viet Nam looks forward to substantive progress in the negotiations for a comprehensive  fair and long-term solution for peace in the Middle East that will ensure the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people and the legitimate interests of all parties. We are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in Iraq. and we support the efforts of the Iraqi Government and the international community to stabilize the situation. We call for an end to unilateral economic sanctions against developing countries and support General Assembly resolutions on ending the economic embargo against Cuba.Viet Nam strongly condemns all acts of terror in any form  especially the targeting of civilians. We support all international efforts and initiatives to combat that menace in accordance with international law and the United Nations Charter. In addition  we all have a stake in economic restructuring  job creation  achieving a balanced  inclusive and sustained growth  and in maintaining a peaceful and stable environment conducive to development.It is therefore our primary task to complete the MDGs and formulate the post-2015 development agenda to create added momentum for sustainable development in each country and for international economic linkages. In that process  the United Nations should focus more actions and resources on addressing social injustices and inequalities. It should provide stronger support to regional and subregional programmes for connectivity  poverty reduction  narrowing the development gap and building the green economy. That will lay a firm and long-term foundation for peace  security and development. In so doing  and to adapt itself to a constantly changing world  the United Nations must accelerate its reform process in a comprehensive  balanced  transparent and equal manner in the interests of all Member States. The Security Council must be reformed in both membership and working methods to better respond to global challenges to peace and security.In its national socioeconomic development and in its international integration  Viet Nam has always attached importance to the roles of multilateral institutions and forums  especially that of the United Nations  in the areas of international and regional security and development. Viet Nam is proud to be an active and responsible member of important regional and global organizations  such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  the Non-Aligned Movement  the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Asia-Europe Meeting. Viet Nam is doubling its efforts to achieve all MDGs and is actively participating in the formulation of the post-2015 development agenda.It is our consistent  principled position to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States and to settle international disputes and conflicts  including the issue of the East Sea  or South China Sea  by peaceful means in accordance with international law  including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Viet Nam abides by the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and works to ensure an early adoption of the code of conduct for parties in the South China Sea.We support efforts to strengthen the multilateral trade system to create fresh momentum for the world economy in order to regain sustained growth. Viet Nam is willing to join global efforts to enhance economic linkages and reform the global economic and trade governance towards greater equality  democracy  transparency and efficiency.Viet Nam and other ASEAN member States are working hard to establish the ASEAN Community in 2015 with three pillars: political-security cooperation  economic cooperation and social-cultural cooperation. That  we believe  will help to build a South-East Asian region of peace  stability  cooperation and prosperity and to form a regional architecture with ASEAN at the centre  founded upon international law and aimed at developing common rules and norms for the region.To contribute to international efforts to enhance principles and norms for peace  sustainable development and human rights  Viet Nam is playing an active and constructive role as a member of the Human Rights Council. For the very first time  Viet Nam has dispatched its military officers to the United Nations peacekeeping mission in South Sudan. Looking forward  Viet Nam has presented its candidature for the Economic and Social Council for the 2016-2018 term and for the Security Council for the 2020-2021 term. We count on the valuable support of members.Peace and development are inseparable companions. They complement each other on the path towards a prosperous world. We are confident that with political will  mutual trust and equality based on international law and responsible joint actions  we can build stronger partnerships for peace  cooperation and sustainable development for all."
"187",7452,"VUT",69,2014,"Vanuatu is honoured to join other speakers in congratulating Mr. Sam Kutesa on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I believe that his able leadership will successfully guide the session to its conclusion. Let me also extend my gratitude to his predecessor  Ambassador John Ashe  for his exemplary leadership and the important achievements during his tenure in the past year.Since the last session of the General Assembly  many major global events have taken place which  on the one hand  have contributed to strengthening the international system and  on the other  have threatened international peace and security and directly derailed the process of development  resulting in the marginalization of the vulnerable populations of our societies. Given past efforts to address the global financial crisis  we have witnessed some recovery of the global economy. That is good news; but it is well known that the recovery is fragile and further international efforts are needed to ensure that global growth prospects in the long run will remain solid and sustainable.We are concerned about prolonged periods of conflict that have led to the displacement of the most disadvantaged members of our societies  including women  children and the disabled. It bothers us to see the increased radicalization of groups and individuals that have been targeted to create terror and impose threats against countries  Governments and citizens. Those are all problems that could be avoided  if all countries adhered strictly to the peaceful principles of dialogue enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. As members of the international community  we have a moral duty to ensure that the principles of dialogue and reasoning prevail in order to address conflict. I have no doubt that the multilateral system is best placed to address the challenges.The outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus that has claimed over 2 000 lives in West Africa has also concerned us greatly. In this regard  we highly commend the efforts of the United Nations agencies  in particular the World Health Organization  and the international community in addressing the security risks of the epidemic. Likewise  the efforts of the Secretary-General and his determination in addressing the challenges are most commendable. I would like to reiterate my Government’s support for the ongoing efforts.Concerning the political developments in the Pacific region  I wish to congratulate the people of the Republic of Fiji on successfully and peacefully electing a new democratic Government. My Government commends the people of Fiji for their resilience and steadfastness  and I congratulate the newly elected Prime Minister on fulfilling his promise to the international community to successfully lead his country to a democratic election.Vanuatu  a small island developing State  has a small economy which is open and vulnerable to internal and external shocks. Those characteristics have determined and shaped our development outcomes. For decades now  our economy has been growing and is now generating increasing per capita incomes. Vanuatu was one of the countries that called on the United Nations to allow vulnerability to become one of the three criteria used in assessing or identifying graduation cases. Vanuatu’s vulnerability was recognized as a result of the revised criteria  and our country ceased to qualify for graduation. It was not until the end of the twentieth century that Vanuatu’s eligibility for graduation from least developed country (LDC) status was raised again  after a decade of unquestionable economic progress in our island nation.After the Committee for Development Policy and the Economic and Social Council reviewed our progress in 2012  the General Assembly  in December 2013  decided that Vanuatu would graduate (see A/68/PV.59). At the same time  a grace period of four years was granted to enable a smooth transition to post-LDC life. Vanuatu’s graduation from LDC status is now scheduled to take place in December 2017. My Government accepts that as a positive signpost. However  the issue of vulnerability must be carefully addressed by the United Nations.We are examining the LDC benefits we may eventually lose  with a view to negotiating the possibility of retaining certain concessions we deem important — if not vital — in sustaining economic development. Our impression of the graduation process is that our attention is being drawn to the question of smooth transition  while the real issue — the question of vulnerability  even during the post-graduation stage — is being circumvented. Our situation could best be described using the analogy of an aircraft. Vanuatu is in the descent phase  but the focus should not be on the smooth landing; rather  we must look to what happens after the smooth landing  as that is the real issue. Our vulnerabilities as a small island developing State (SIDS) remain undiminished  with lasting disadvantages and growing challenges regardless of our graduation from LDC status.What is it  then  that the United Nations  which has been so generous in recognizing our vulnerabilities  can now offer us  as a SIDS  in support of our efforts to build resilience and productive capacity  and in support of our climate adaptation expenditure? Surely SIDS dealing with such issues deserve as much special attention as do LDCs. Is it unreasonable to expect that attention be translated into some form of special treatment for SIDS? We appreciate the focus of the United Nations on the importance of a smooth transition for graduating countries  but we also urge it not to be distracted from the real question  which is the way we SIDS will be treated after graduation.Like other  similar economies  while Vanuatu has made some headway towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  it is still finding it difficult to achieve all of the goals by 2015. The reasons for that are numerous  but one of the significant difficulties is our narrow revenue base  coupled with a geographically dispersed population scattered over our 83 islands  which makes it a challenge for the Government to deliver basic services to all of its people. We are grateful that our development partners are always there to support us. Given the challenges that SIDS and LDCs face in financing development  I appeal to the developed countries to honour their commitment to increasing their aid to 0.7 per cent of gross national product  as agreed on in the Monterrey Consensus.The current problem of terrorism threatens the security of States and the safety and well-being of innocent and vulnerable women and children. The kidnapping of innocent people  including some of our peacekeepers  is a threat to international security and peace. As a participant in various United Nations peacekeeping missions  I would like to express our gratitude to the United Nations and other countries for their assistance in negotiating the release of Fiji’s United Nations peacekeepers. The cooperation in this respect of members of the international community is a positive sign for the concept of our collective responsibility for international peace and security.We salute the Secretary-General for his leadership as a vigorous campaigner for climate action and for convening this year’s Climate Summit. Leaders made many pledges and commitments during the Summit  and we look forward to seeing the rhetoric translated into urgent action. My delegation calls on the United Nations family to stand together to find ways to address climate-change issues. We are staring at a climate-change bubble  and the longer we delay action  the costlier it will be for our future generations. We must act now and fast to ensure that we steer clear of the current dangerous carbon-pollution trajectory.The theme for the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  is timely and relevant  particularly considering the ongoing efforts to arrive at a new post-2015 development agenda for all countries. I commend the excellent progress that has been made in this area  and I recognize that it is not easy to negotiate such goals  with so many member countries and the different groups they represent  all of which want their development agendas incorporated. I believe that our draft agenda does represent a consensus on the part of every United Nations Member and that it is capable of bringing development to a new level in all of our countries.As a Pacific small island developing State  we are dealing with numerous development challenges that the United Nations system and the international community should address. I reiterate that climate change is a major global challenge for all of us. Some Pacific States are facing an existential threat  and we cannot deal with the issue of sustainable development alone if climate-change challenges are not addressed seriously by the international community. To that end  it is vital that climate change remain one of the major elements on the agenda of sustainable development goals (SDGs).We note that this is a matter for considerable debate  owing to its cross-cutting nature. However  it is not a new issue  for the climate-change agenda is prominently featured in “The future we want” outcome document of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (resolution 66/288  annex). Our current efforts to address climate change are consistent with that  and it is another reason why our climate-change targets should be more ambitious. We strongly urge that the target of holding the increase in global average temperature below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels be included in the SDGs.In addition to climate change  our support for the SDGs extends but is not limited to the inclusion of peace and effective institutions; ocean management; health and education; energy security and gender equality. We also concur with the emphasis on the means of implementation in the report of the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable Development Goals (A/68/970) and urge the United Nations and the developed countries to continue to support developing countries  especially the SIDS and LDCs  in the areas of sustainable development financing and improving institutional capacity in their efforts to promote development.Coincidentally  my country is at an important stage in its development planning process. Our current development planning framework will come to an end in the fourth quarter of 2015  and we are already consulting for the post-2015 era. The agenda and issues being discussed in the global arena will be translated into and merged with our development aspirations. I would like to take this opportunity to call on our development partners to support us by working in harmony and in a true spirit of partnership to help us to fulfil the dreams of our people  particularly our young and more vulnerable generation.My Government acknowledges the synergy of the efforts being made by the United Nations and the British Commonwealth to uphold the international principles of peace and good governance  as well as in promoting stronger partnerships for inclusive development. I would like to ask the United Nations to allow the views expressed by the Commonwealth Heads of Government on the post-development agenda to be seen as additional contributions to that process.My country has a history that evolved as the result of a long political struggle to achieve political independence  which finally came in 1980. But when most of us were young  it was governed by Britain and France  and we were stateless in our own country  neither French nor British citizens. For more than seven decades  we were exposed to foreign rule. We thus had to struggle to reconstruct our identity as a nation that could govern itself rather than be subjected to foreign rule. In 1981  after independence was achieved in 1980  I finally arrived here at the United Nations with our late former Prime Minister  Walter Lini. I clearly remember that cold autumn morning  when a small group  along with the United Nations protocol staff  gathered outside the entrance of this magnificent building to raise our flag for the first time at the United Nations. A new nation was born and was accepted by the United Nations family of nations.As a freedom fighter and as the Prime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu who took office less than six months ago  I proudly stand here today to thank the United Nations for the recognition and endorsement of our membership. But more importantly  here on this rostrum I want to underscore the unfinished business of the United Nations with regard to bringing closure to its work on decolonization. Part of my country’s sovereign territory is still being disputed by one of our former colonial Powers  which is also our dear friend and development partner.I am delighted that the United Nations once again  through the work of the former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples  Mr. James Anaya  brought the matter to the twenty-first session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. My country is delighted that in 2012 France responded to that action and expressed its openness to dialogue. We believe such openness is a necessary element for progress so that our indigenous peoples will be able to resume their rights to fully exercise their cultural and spiritual obligations on the two islands of Umaenupne/Matthew and Leka/Hunter  and to revive the traditional routes of our ancestors in Tafea province.My country’s political struggles have led to a strong position on decolonization. We share the dreams of those who are still longing for freedom so that they can achieve self-government and independence. As we near the midpoint of the United Nations Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism  I want to echo those voices  from within our region and beyond  who should one day be able to stand on this podium as free and democratic nations.My country acknowledges the message of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  reminding the 2014 Pacific regional seminar of the United Nations Decolonization Committee held in May this year that “good intentions will have to be translated into credible action to make the Third International Decade a success”. In that connection  my country supports the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the United Nations visiting mission to New Caledonia this year (A/AC.109/2014/20/Rev.1) and calls on the United Nations and the international community to pursue their efforts to provide support to the people of New Caledonia and the Government of France in their endeavour to implement a successful decolonization process under the Nouméa Accord.At the nineteenth Melanesian Spearhead Group Leaders Summit in June 2013 in New Caledonia  the Group’s leaders renewed their commitment through a declaration to support the Front de libération nationale kanak socialiste (FLNKS) in their pursuit for full emancipation under the Nouméa Accord  through the provision of technical assistance and training programmes for the Kanak peoples to assist them in their struggle to fully exercise their right to self-determination and independence. While the New Caledonian people look forward to a political transition  I call upon the United Nations  through its regional agencies  to provide assistance to New Caledonia  in particular the FLNKS and the Kanak people  in specific areas of training to enable them to fully participate in the implementation of the Nouméa Accord. I appreciate the cooperative efforts of the Government of France for facilitating the implementation of the Nouméa Accord in a very mature and responsible manner. Those efforts must not be derailed.I cannot close this section of my speech without paying tribute to the late Mr. John Ondawame  a freedom fighter from West Papua  who passed away last month while in exile in my country. He was laid to rest in my country as a hero who had fought for the rights to self-determination for the people of West Papua. He and other martyrs had a dream that one day the United Nations and all nations advocating and promoting democratic principles would hear their cries and deliver on the promise of a self-determined future. At his funeral service  I stated that his struggle for freedom and justice would continue to be our struggle until colonialism is eradicated.There are many other heroes in many countries that are still voiceless and are suffering in silence  either owing to unilateral policy choices  or because of ignorance on the part of the multilateral system. My country is encouraged by the onset of flexibility exercised by the United States of America towards the Cuban people. I believe that the willingness for dialogue and consideration is a responsible gesture that will slowly open the door for a better future for all Cubans. We must  as individual countries  be ready to be a voice for the voiceless. Bigger and richer countries must be the burden-bearers for smaller nations. In doing so  we demonstrate our willingness to live as a village  a world community of friends and not aggressors. I want to stress that the only way to address that issue is through dialogue and unity. It is our moral responsibility not to fail those who have been victims of past ignorance.My country and many others have repeatedly raised these concerns on this same podium for many years  because we subscribe to them as inalienable human rights. The concerns of vulnerability  sustainable development  fisheries  job creation  human rights and many others are reflected in the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action (Samoa Pathway) outcome document (A/CONF.223/3  annex). My country fully endorses the Samoa Pathway document as a guide that is to be used to navigate through our development challenges.The Samoa Pathway  built on the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation  has charted a decisive course going forward. The United Nations system and the international community are urged to ensure that it is integrated into a transformative post-2015 development framework and that we close the implementation gaps of the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy.Let me take this opportunity to thank the Government and the people of Samoa for ably hosting the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States held in Apia.I deeply appreciate the opportunity to present my views to this important forum. I hope that the statements and the deliberations that we make today will translate into concrete actions leading to a better future for all our peoples. Long live our aspirations to create lasting peace and a better world for our people! May God bless the United Nations!"
"188",7484,"WSM",69,2014,"Samoa congratulates the President on his election and lends its full support to the agenda that will guide our work during his tenure. In the same spirit  I applaud our Secretary-General and Samoan Prince Tupua Ban Ki-moon for his firm commitment and strong leadership in steering our Organization during this particularly turbulent and difficult period for the world.As members of the global family  our futures and interests are inextricably linked. Crises with a global reach threaten to engulf the world and affect all nations irrespective of whether they caused or contributed to the crisis.Climate change is one such crisis. It is the world’s most urgent problem and the greatest moral challenge of our time. Known crises of global dimensions pale in comparison to what climate change poses to our world as a whole and to the future security of some of our low-lying islands as sovereign States. Climate change is indifferent to the suffering of countries touched by its destructive reach. The victims can be rich or poor  large or small  resilient or vulnerable  but they hardly matter. It impacts all. For some there are already existential implications looming. Others may consider the effect on them to be minimal. Such complacency would be a grave mistake and tantamount to gross negligence. If climate change is not addressed comprehensively  the consequences for our planet will be dire indeed and will affect all countries.No country should therefore stay detached and unconcerned before the plight of the majority. All countries must work together. Apportioning blame for the present state of our environment is in itself yet another human failing. It serves no useful purpose. Being judgemental will not restore our environment. Those who exploit the traditional divide between developed and developing countries and ideological and political differences do so conveniently  to mask their own unwillingness to be part of the solution to an impending global catastrophe.There is too much at stake for the world to just sit idly by. Strong visionary leadership that rises beyond the dictates of vested national interests and political tenures and views the world as a single constituency where everyone must work together within the limits of their capacity and capability to be part of the total solution is at a premium. Governments must yield — not to vested interests and expediency of time  but because it is the ethical and just thing to do. Our timelines are slipping by fast and soon we will be playing catch-up. Yet each day lost to indecisiveness and wrangling on petty points only intensifies the challenges we face. The Lima and Paris climate conferences will provide the best openings for the world to redeem itself. States Members of the United Nations should step forward with a sense of urgency and commitment to addressing climate change today  not tomorrow. It should not just be science and real life experiences that force us to act  but also our consciences.Against this backdrop  the Climate Summit on Tuesday was timely. Its message was clear and simple. Our actions to address climate change are grossly inadequate. We are focusing more on symptoms than on the root causes  and the solemn truth is that things will only get worse if we do not act collectively now. However  a ray of hope  best captured in the following fundamental truths  is couched delicately in this ominous prediction.First  climate change is a societal problem requiring decisive political leadership and a whole-of-society approach. Every individual effort and every national action counts because in unity we succeed  but in division there is little we can do. Secondly  we need a global solution if we are to succeed. The United Nations is our last best hope. It is indispensable to a sustainable solution that we provide the necessary commitment to turning the tide against climate change. Thirdly  climate change is solvable  and the solution is firmly in our hands.Only through enlightened leadership and the concerted efforts of all countries  with the major greenhouse gas emitters at the forefront  do we stand a chance of lessening the destructive impact of climate change and of reaching a credible post-Kyoto climate agreement next year. Samoa calls upon those States Members of our Organization that are in a position of world leadership to lead the charge and to undertake the tasks that need to be implemented quickly and decisively so that the Paris conference can deliver on an ambitious climate change agreement that is effective  binding  capable of swift implementation  and universally owned and respected by the 193 States Members of the United Nations.The Ebola outbreak is a deadly pandemic causing chaos and untold suffering in parts of West Africa. Its reach is global and if it is not treated it may prove unstoppable. It has no respect for national borders or Government sovereignty  and its victims are selected indiscriminately. Born and unborn babies are robbed of their youth  girls and boys of their adulthood  and women and men of their productive lives  their dignity and worth  while countries are dispossessed and deprived of their valuable human assets.Can we win the war on Ebola? Samoa believes that we can and we should. That was why we were honoured to be among the 134 co-sponsors of Security Council resolution 2177 (2014) on peace and security in Africa  with reference to Ebola  last Thursday. The Security Council resolution was adopted with the highest-ever number of sponsors and was swiftly followed the next day by General Assembly resolution 69/1  which unanimously approved a proposal to establish the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response. Samoa welcomes the rapid  decisive and coordinated response of United Nations Member States and agencies  and in particular the proactive role the Secretary-General played in mobilizing both the political will and the material resources necessary to respond to this grave crisis.The global response to the Ebola outbreak is a powerful illustration of what is possible when States collaborate and coordinate to assist each other in achieving common and critical goals. Such unified responses have tangible results and save lives. Samoa encourages all Member States to take this spirit of cooperation forward  and to harness and follow this example when dealing with other critical global issues.As we meet here at the United Nations  the rise in extremism has a taken a turn for the worst. Radical militants are committing unspeakably brutal and barbaric atrocities across the Middle East  and threatening to spread their evil brand further afield. As a small island nation in the Pacific Ocean  these threats can seem extremely far removed from my country of Samoa. However  in the globalized age in which we live  all countries are threatened by challenges to international peace and security. Developments in one State invariably have effects in others  and this is true of my country  far away as we are.Global interconnectedness has brought innumerable benefits to all countries  but it also increasingly brings risks from distant corners of the Earth. As such  it is imperative that the United Nations and its Member States commit to tackling threats to international peace and security  especially through the Security Council. Specifically  States Members of the United Nations must increase their collaboration and cooperation to find solutions to challenges to peace and security  and work diligently to implement them.The United Nations was founded upon the values of collective security and  for small nations  remains a critical forum in which to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security  stability and prosperity. This is particularly important for small island developing States (SIDS)  which risk a reversal of the development gains they have made due to crises far from home. To cement and build upon development goals already achieved  international peace and security must be maintained  and it is the responsibility of all Member States  particularly those on the Security Council  to work in close cooperation to ensure that this happens.Samoa belongs to the group of small island developing States  a United Nations-recognized group with special needs and inherent vulnerabilities  not by choice  but by dint of factors completely outside its control. Part of the dilemma we continually face is the misconception that SIDS challenges are minuscule in comparison to the needs of other special groups and regions  and that their one and only concern is climate change. Nothing could be further from the truth.My country was honoured to host  on behalf of the Pacific region  the once-in-a decade International Conference on Small Island Developing States three weeks ago. Our primary goal in hosting the Third SIDS Conference was to have the spotlight of international attention fall on SIDS  their challenges and realities. Now that the spotlight has faded  we hope that the increased understanding and appreciation of SIDS issues and challenges gained at the Conference will not be forgotten over time or sidelined by other competing priority issues.The international community has a very full agenda. We as nations are being pulled in many directions. This general debate and the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly will show just how packed the agenda is. The follow-up to the SIDS Conference will be part of that agenda. It is our hope that  despite all the political  economic and other demands on the countries of the world  the realities of SIDS  so clearly spelled out in Apia and in the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action — the SAMOA Pathway — are able to retain the attention of the wider international community. We took seriously the commitments made to SIDS at the Conference and we will remain deeply mindful of how those commitments are turned into actions.The Conference had as its theme “The sustainable development of SIDS through genuine and durable partnerships”. We are ready to build on our existing partnerships. We may be small  but we are also able to demonstrate the impact of our people and our countries in successful  twenty-first century partnerships. We may be small and sometimes invisible to many. However  we know that united the SIDS are a strong and positive group. The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) is showing its determination in a growing range of areas and forums. Samoa  like other Pacific islands  is proud of its place within AOSIS.The SAMOA Pathway asks the Secretary-General to undertake a comprehensive review of how the United Nations system supports SIDS. This is an opportunity to ensure that the United Nations is fit for the purpose when it comes to supporting SIDS. There is ample scope for improvement  and we look forward to engaging fully in the process. The time for business as usual has long passed. Let us work for an approach to SIDS that shows the United Nations at its best.The SAMOA Pathway is a well-crafted intergovernmental agreement that has the seal and stamp of approval of the United Nations membership. Going forward  it falls on SIDS themselves to be prepared to lead and own the SAMOA Pathway if it is to be sustainable. Together with the specific entities within the Secretariat charged with advocating and championing SIDS causes  they should be more proactive and assertive. Jointly  they must reposition themselves to engage better in a more effective and visible partnership.Moreover  what we need to achieve is a human face of SIDS to every issue that comes before the United Nations  be it security  human rights  climate change  development  gender or indigenous issues. That way  SIDS issues will be at the forefront of the United Nations agenda. They will remain topical and relevant and be taken up  debated and acted upon daily  weekly or monthly — and not conveniently set aside to be discussed only when we have another SIDS conference 10 years from now.Samoa continues to support United Nations peacekeeping efforts worldwide. Small though we are  Samoan police continue to serve side by side with officers from other countries in places that require the intervention of the United Nations. Within the Pacific region  our solidarity with our neighbours in meeting challenges means a guaranteed Samoan police presence in the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands and under the umbrella of the Pacific Islands Forum.A durable peace settlement in the Middle East continues to elude us  but that is not grounds to be pessimistic. We should support every effort to create conditions conducive to the successful establishment of an independent Palestinian State alongside a secure and safe State of Israel.Finally  those bent on creating fear and panic throughout the world will stop at nothing to achieve their aims. We must not be held hostage to their devious designs. Individually and collectively  we must step up our efforts to combat the threat of international terrorism in its many manifestations. No country can succeed on its own. Only by working collaboratively can we be successful.As we approach the new post-2015 development agenda  the culmination of many years of international negotiations and agreements on sustainable development  we must ensure that while a one-framework approach is important  it does not equate to a one-size-fits-all formula for purposes of implementation  monitoring and evaluation. Indeed  the applicability of the Millennium Development Goals and their indicators to small island countries proved difficult  and much tailoring was necessary before those global targets were seen as relevant enough for us to meaningfully participate. It is important therefore in the defining and refining of the sustainable development goals and post-2015 development agenda that we account for groups like SIDS and ensure that the indicators developed are also applicable to their situations. Building on the existing processes and experiences in the SIDS countries and their respective regions and subregions is critical in that regard.Fortunately  we are on the back of a successful SIDS Conference whose theme focused on effective means of implementation through partnerships. We must ensure therefore that the means to implement the SAMOA Pathway is solidly incorporated into the post-2015 development framework. Those arrangements are well entrenched in the High-level Political Forum and the review arrangements of the Economic and Social Council. It is important that the intergovernmental architectures of our respective SIDS regions be included in the process  which means working together. We cannot afford a situation where we have intergovernmental organizations developing separate policies and implementation arrangements and partnerships for the same things. We must work together.Finally  we must break down what has been a traditional them-and-us perception on both sides of the divide between Member States and the Secretariat established to serve our collective needs. It has not served either side well; we are in fact on the same side. I would therefore encourage any coordination mechanisms established to ensure representation of both in order to promote transparency and a balance of perspectives and interests. The Inter-Agency Consultative Group for SIDS is perhaps an arrangement that could benefit from Member State representation as well  where open discussions can take place around effective implementation of the SAMOA Pathway and the post-2015 development agenda.Some of our development partners  traditional and new  have reached out to help us. What they have in common is trust and respect for our views and needs. Bilaterally  regionally and internationally  they are partnering with SIDS to overcome some of the constraints imposed by limited land and narrow natural resource bases  isolation and downward agricultural production  sustained food security for our expanding populations  and the need to provide a meaningful existence for our people and communities in the rural areas.The United Nations was established to prevent wars  bring peace and security  and protect human rights through multilateralism and intergovernmental cooperation. The architecture of the Organization we have today is very complex  and  inevitably  there are imperfections. However  the fact that we have consistently met without failure at the General Assembly each year is irrefutable proof that our Organization works at many and different levels. It is hard to imagine where the world would be without the United Nations. It is why Samoa’s support for our Organization is unwavering."
"189",7530,"YEM",69,2014,"At the outset  on behalf of the people and the Government of Yemen  I would like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly and his brotherly country  Uganda  on his election to lead the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We fully trust that  thanks to his able leadership  the work of the Assembly during this session will come to a fruitful conclusion  and we wish him every success in that endeavour. We would also like to express our appreciation for the skilful manner in which his predecessor  Mr. John Ashe  led the work of the Assembly at its previous session. In addition  I would like to welcome the tireless and mighty efforts being undertaken by the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  to manage this Organization in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  which focuses on the maintenance of international peace and security. We thank him for his commendable and special efforts to support the political process in Yemen.I would like to highlight a happy coincidence. This general debate is taking place at a time when Yemen is observing the anniversary of its two glorious revolutions of September and October. Those events were very important occasions for us  and I would like  therefore  to congratulate  from this rostrum  the valiant people of Yemen and commend them on their resolve and the sacrifices that they have made to achieve freedom and to put an end to oppression  injustice and despotism. In addition  I would commend our people on the efforts for change that they have been undertaking wisely and patiently for 50 years now.Since the beginning of 2011  Yemen has taken measures to effect change and address the successive political and economic crises that arose owing to a lack of political prospects. Those crises all but ravaged our country and led it to the brink of civil war and chaos. They have also had very negative repercussions at the political  economic  security and humanitarian levels in Yemen. The Yemeni people realized that the best way to put an end to those crises was through national dialogue.I would like  therefore  once again to thank all of those who provided their support to the people of Yemen and to a political settlement of the situation in Yemen  in particular through the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Initiative and the Implementation Mechanism. I would like to thank Saudi Arabia  in particular the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques  King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud. I thank the GCC and its Secretary General  Mr. Al Zayani. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his Special Adviser on Yemen  Mr. Benomar. In addition  I thank the members of the Security Council for their support for the righteous political process in Yemen. I thank the League of Arab States  the Organization of Islamic Cooperation  the European Union and all the countries and international organizations and institutions that have supported my country.In that regard  I would like to mention the exceptional and historic visit of the Security Council to Sana’a on 27 January 2013. That visit was a strong signal of support from the international community to Yemen and to its extraordinary peaceful transition of power through political dialogue and on the basis of the GCC Initiative  the Implementation Mechanism and the road map seeking to put an end to the crisis and steer Yemen in the safe and right direction. We must also not forget the relevant resolutions of the Security Council  namely resolutions 2014 (2011)  2051 (2012) and 2140 (2014). They have lent political weight to the work of the United Nations on the political process in Yemen.Nor should we forget the periodic reports of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General  Mr. Benomar  on the progress in the political situation and the challenges that Yemen has been facing. Those reports have played a very important role  because they have sent a message to all political parties in Yemen that are trying to stall the political process; it is a message that says that we will not let anybody threaten the unity  security and stability of Yemen  with all of the resulting implications for international peace and security.I would also like to commend President Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour  who has shown great perseverance in rebuilding a new federal Yemen on the basis of Yemen’s inclusive National Dialogue Conference. Yemen signed the Gulf Initiative for Yemen and thereby began the transition process. We were able to achieve the goals set for the first stage of transition. A Government of National Reconciliation was formed  a military affairs committee was established  and early presidential elections were organized.We then began the second stage of the transitional process. Among the most important achievements of that phase was the National Dialogue Conference  which took place on 28 January 2014. In addition  we have set up a drafting committee for a constitution. That committee is about to submit its first draft of the new constitution. After the draft’s adoption  there will be a referendum on it. Furthermore  the Supreme Commission for Elections and Referendum has created an electronic register for the purpose of registering voters.We have made notable progress in the political process. However  Yemen still faces great challenges that have nearly destroyed the country and are trying to bring it back to square one. We would cite  inter alia  the many dangerous events that occurred in Yemen as a result of the recent political and military escalation provoked by the Ansar Allah group  which besieged the capital  Sana’a  despite the decision taken by the Yemeni people at the inclusive National Dialogue Conference no longer to use weapons or violence to settle their political differences.The Government undertook to deal with the issue of escalation wisely and patiently  because our nation can no longer bear to put up with conflict. Indeed  the citizens of Yemen are buckling under the burden resulting from successive financial crises. All of our people aspire to peace and stability. A great many political efforts have been undertaken to end the crisis  which led to the signing of the Peace and National Partnership Agreement. However  the Ansar Allah group chose military means  attacking institutions of the State  looting and pillaging them as well as private homes.The militia entered our capital  Sana’a  where it remains. The success of the terrorist groups is the result of political support and logistical coordination provided by members of the former regime. But we took a political approach based on conciliation and made further political efforts leading to the signing a few days ago of a new security annex to the Agreement in order to maintain social cohesion  so that our people can devote their efforts to the political process and to implementing the final stages of a critical turning point in our national life.All political parties in Yemen need to undertake to uphold the commitments in the Agreement. In addition  the international community needs to continue to provide its political support and economic assistance to Yemen. We also need for strong and firm positions to be taken by the Security Council  condemning all parties that seek to undermine the political process. The international community has condemned the events referred to and has called on the Yemeni parties to respect the commitments and pledges made during the National Dialogue Conference.It should be noted that Yemen is also dealing with major economic challenges  including a scarcity of resources  an increase in unemployment and poverty and growing budgetary deficits. In addition  Yemen is experiencing a humanitarian crisis that cannot be overlooked  because half of our population  namely  14.7 million people  need some form of humanitarian assistance. Moreover  Yemen is currently hosting around a million refugees from countries of the Horn of Africa.We have an annual humanitarian response plan in Yemen  but the plan has not mobilized the necessary support. The international community knows  however  that  if the humanitarian situation worsens further  that will have an impact on the political process. In the face of the very difficult economic and humanitarian context that has nearly destroyed our national economy  the Government of national reconciliation took the decision to amend the price of oil derivatives  adopted a set of austerity measures and fiscal and tax reforms  and agreed to provide social security coverage to more 250 000 people. We have also put the final touches on an electronic human-resources management system for police and army personnel. We are also working progressively in the area of agriculture and fisheries.Undoubtedly  Yemen expects a great deal from its fraternal and friendly neighbouring countries at this very difficult time. We need economic support commensurate with the challenges that we are facing. That support could reduce the costs associated with the economic reforms that we will be launching in the future.Yemen has seen an improvement in the security situation in our country. We have taken steps to restructure our armed forces and police. However  the security situation in Yemen is still rather fragile and is an obstacle preventing the success of our political processes and economic growth. Yemen has been affected by the scourge of terrorism  which has spared no nationality  sect or religion. That terrorism is not only threatening Yemen currently but the region and the entire world. We have played a pioneering role in striving to thwart a scourge that has embedded itself into the lives and traditions of our people and of the people of all the countries of our region and the world. The number of non-Yemenite elements in those terrorist groups is 70 per cent.The international community needs to tighten its ranks to help Yemen to combat the scourge. We need support from the international community to combat terrorism in the Pacific region and the Arabian Gulf  which is a window open to the entire world. We are seeking to continue our efforts very actively  and we will spare no effort to ensure that our countries continue to go in the right direction and to put an end to all bastions of terrorism  to polarization and hegemony  because all peoples aspire to a safe  stable life  within a climate marked by justice and partnership  legality and freedom. In order to combat the security challenges  we need support from friendly countries as part of efforts to combat terrorism. We also need cooperation in logistics  training and capacity-building  because Yemen’s stability will have a positive impact on the region and the entire world.Despite the challenges that Yemen is facing economically and politically and in terms of security  we have not been sheltered from the other crises that the world is facing. We have closely followed all of the suffering the world over  but particularly that of the Palestinian people  who have been killed and mutilated  with the infrastructure in their country being destroyed and new lethal weapons being used to commit new  barbarous crimes that have cost the lives of thousands of martyrs and caused thousands of injuries.The international community must therefore condemn the war crimes and crimes against humanity being committed against innocent civilians. It should make the occupying Power resume the peace process with the goal of achieving a just  comprehensive and lasting peace that respects the decisions of international law and the Arab Peace Initiative. We would like to reaffirm our full solidarity with the Palestinian people in their efforts to see the restoration of the rights that have been stolen from them  including their independent State  with Jerusalem as its capital.The ongoing cycle of violence in sisterly Syria is a source of concern  since it continues to destabilize and damage the entire region. Furthermore  some armed terrorist groups are exploiting the serious situation there. That is a large-scale challenge that demands that we all work together to find solutions  as fast as possible  in order to promote the aspirations of the Syrian people in peace and stability  while maintaining Syria’s unity and territorial integrity.In Iraq  we are seeing the activities of Daesh  which is perpetrating crimes against the population irrespective of their religious and ethnic backgrounds. That is extremely worrying  because such groups and organizations are simply interested in acquiring greater power. They have nothing to do with the tolerant Islamic religion or the values of the Muslim community as a whole  which respects all the rights of others.The events and conflicts we are seeing around the world highlight the challenges facing the United Nations. We must work to reform it so that it is able to settle conflicts and maintain international peace and security. I therefore urge that the Arab States be given a permanent seat on the Security Council  since the region figures so prominently in the work of international peace and security.The issue of the control of nuclear weapons is urgent  since nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction are a huge threat to the peace and security of the whole world. We therefore deplore the fact that the conference on establishing the Middle East as a nuclear-weapon-free zone has been repeatedly delayed  despite the efforts and flexibility shown by Arab countries to convene it. We call on the great Powers to assume their responsibility to put pressure on Israel and the other parties that are preventing the convening of a conference  whereby they are creating obstacles to the restoration of peace and security in the Middle East and laying the ground for an alarming arms race  which will undoubtedly have negative effects.In conclusion  I would once again like to thank the President and the Secretary-General. We hope that the work of this session will be successful and will help to meet the hopes and aspirations of our peoples to live in peace and stability and lead a decent life."
"190",7568,"YUG",69,2014,"I congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I am convinced that his international prestige and experience will make an important contribution to the crafting of sustainable political solutions to the new global challenges that lie ahead of us. I would also like to convey Serbia’s readiness to address and provide unequivocal support to the resolution of priorities relative to climate change  an integrated global economy  international security issues and all other topics included in the agenda that we will actively pursue.I should like to express my special thanks to outgoing President  Mr. John Ashe  for his efforts and successful work during the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly  which laid down the foundations for the post-2015 sustainable development agenda  as well as for his endeavours to strengthen the purposes and principles of the United Nations.The sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when we mark an important anniversary  100 years having elapsed since the outbreak of the Great War  a war which shaped the twentieth century. The anniversary was commemorated at different places  but  regrettably  no common ceremony at the highest level was organized in the spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness.Serbia strongly supports the General Assembly agenda for the sixty-ninth session and sees itself as an active partner and participant in the implementation of United Nations development goals. The world is faced with new security  climate and socioeconomic challenges. We need to do much work together to ensure humankind’s progress in the twenty-first century. Serbia offers its experiences and ideas for global management  so that we can ensure a better future for new generations all over the world.Allow me to consider three of today’s most pressing global challenges that concern not just Serbia but all of us — climate change  global security and deadly infectious diseases of vast proportions. I believe that  if not addressed wisely and systematically  those challenges could put the survival of future generations in jeopardy.Socioeconomic interrelatedness accounts for the disappearance of the old division into “us” and “them”. All of us  all States Members of the United Nations  share the same destiny and shoulder equal responsibility for the problems that directly face humankind. One of the urgent global challenges that we are confronting is climate change. At the Climate Summit 2014  in which I participated with great interest  we discussed the historic chance that we shall have at the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015. Consensus among scientists indicates that the global temperatures in the twenty-first century will rise dramatically. Extreme weather conditions will increase  with a frequency that depends on the intensity of global warming. Inexorably  the effects of natural disasters aggravate the fragile economic situation in Serbia and the region of South-East Europe and make the struggle against poverty ever more difficult. That struggle remains the quintessential challenge facing the world today.Activities aimed at alleviating the consequences of climate change are the imperative of our age. In determining binding measures  surely we should take account of the development needs of poor and underdeveloped countries. I am convinced that the Assembly shares my opinion that there is a need to act  as soon as possible  to improve adaptation systems and to establish mechanisms for lowering the risks posed by natural disasters. I therefore view this year as an opportunity to kick off intensive activities in devising climate policy and encouraging countries to commit to reducing carbon emissions. We have a historic chance to devise an energy policy that is sustainable and provides for substantive global action on climate change policy. I am convinced that we all share the view that it is urgent and obligatory to improve the adaptation system and set up mechanisms for reducing the enormous risks of natural disasters. Serbia wishes to contribute to reaching a legally binding  general consent on climate for all the peoples of the world. I believe that the Green Climate Fund should play an important role in the process of implementing the agreed principles. By 2020  it should achieve its ambitious goal and fulfil the commitments we have made for the sake of humankind.This year  I witnessed  and my country was a victim of  extreme weather conditions in Europe. Unfortunately  Serbia and its neighbours in the region were subjected to natural disasters as a consequence of climate change. Serbia was and is vulnerable these days  all over again  to floods of biblical proportions. I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the United Nations for its extensive and efficient engagement and cooperation with the Government of Serbia in the aftermath of the floods. In particular  I would like to thank French President François Hollande for heeding my call to convene a donors conference to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. I would also like to thank the European Commission  the members of the European Union  the Russian Federation  China  Japan  Belarus  African countries and the countries of the region for their assistance and engagement. Without their generous bilateral assistance  we would not have been able to help everyone in dire need. Short of the selfless assistance of Member States  we would not have been able to help the affected people  many of whom lost everything they had acquired during their lifetime.The national priority of Serbia is to achieve a sustainable political solution on the question of Kosovo and Metohija. For Serbia  the only acceptable  fair and just solution is to reject secessionism and preserve the territorial integrity of every country  including Serbia. Serbia therefore is clearly committed to the quest for a sustainable political solution through dialogue with representatives of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government in Pristina. The political solution that Serbia advocates comprehends the interests of the Serbian  Albanian and other populations. It will be a durable political solution that is satisfactory to all parties  and we can reach it only through constructive dialogue.The normalization of relations between Belgrade and Pristina is contributing to the process of European integration. We expect the European Union to continue to encourage  through its active engagement  an open dialogue and compliance with agreed-on obligations in order to strengthen mutual trust. Serbia has complied  responsibly and on time  with all the obligations it has undertaken to date regarding the implementation of the Brussels Agreement. I would like to point out that Serbia is open to continuing constructive dialogue with Pristina at every level.In accordance with Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)  the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) is the guarantor and the basis for action by all other international missions in Kosovo and Metohija. For Serbia  a reduction in UNMIK’s mandate and competencies in Kosovo and Metohija is unacceptable. In its negotiations with the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government in Pristina  Serbia proceeds from the premise that all solutions must be in accordance with the Constitution of Serbia and resolution 1244 (1999). That concerns questions having to do with the province’s status  the position of Serbs and other non-Albanians in the province  and protection of the Serbian religious and cultural heritage.Our approach to the search for a sustainable political solution for Kosovo and Metohija has broader political implications. I believe we can all agree that the creation of conditions for the enjoyment of basic human rights and minority rights would not only promote the return of the displaced population but would also provide a model for political dialogue and toleration  the assumptions of today’s world and the policies of peace that the United Nations spearheads.Creating optimal conditions for internally displaced persons to return to their homes is the key factor in the process of normalizing relations between Belgrade and Pristina. I would like to recall that everything began with the acts of terror committed by the Albanian minority in Kosovo and Metohija aimed at achieving their secessionist ambitions. Today  15 years after the adoption of resolution 1244 (1999) — by which we ceded administration of the province of Kosovo and Metohija to the United Nations — the conditions conducive to returning internally displaced persons to Kosovo and Metohija have still not been created  something that is noted in the Secretary-General’s regular reports on UNMIK’s work and in the reports of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons.Serbia has the largest number of internally displaced persons of any country in Europe  a total of 230 000. They must not remain mere statistics. They must not be forgotten. There are 58 000 refugees living in Serbia  42 000 from Croatia and 16 000 from Bosnia and Herzegovina. I believe refugees deserve special attention from the United Nations and UNHCR. The marginalization of the serious problems that those vulnerable people face should be condemned rather than ignored. The issue of basic human rights is a universal one  respected by every State Member of the United Nations. Any hasty decision on the issue would be a mistake  since it could undermine the region’s reconciliation processes  which are not yet fully formed  as well as the fundamental right of Serbs to return to their homes in Kosovo  Croatia  and Bosnia and Herzegovina.Serbia has taken a step forward into the future  and wishes to make an active contribution to global economic progress  the suppression of crime and corruption  and the quest for a solution to all matters of international security. Membership in the European Union is our foreign policy priority. Like any other form of international association  the European Union falls short of achieving ideal solutions and is saddled with its own challenges and issues relating to its enlargement  but it is still the best community of European States. Serbia’s place is with its members so that it can fully modernize its society and State and further develop its economic capacities. The clear goal we aspire to is to build Serbia into a respected member of the family of European nations  and our progress in membership negotiations will contribute to that.Serbia is preparing to assume the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) next year. That role and task present my country with complex  multilateral challenges  but we are ready for them  and we have been preparing in collaboration with Switzerland in positive and constructive cooperation. Serbia will use the OSCE chairmanship to encourage and strengthen mutual cooperation among the countries in the region. The Balkan countries have made immense progress in recent years and have developed substantial and comprehensive mutual cooperation. Serbia will make every effort to see that the process of reconciliation and cooperation and mutual respect is fully implemented throughout the region. The chairmanship will also be used to encourage those processes.We are deeply disturbed and alarmed by the events in Ukraine and will do everything in our power to help find a peaceful solution to the problem and overcome differences peacefully. Our Slav brothers deserve peace and tranquil development  along with respect for those universal principles that should be accorded all countries and peoples and that are clearly defined in the Charter of the United Nations. Serbia respects the territorial integrity of Ukraine as a United Nations Member  and the equitable implementation of international law. I recall that some countries denied Serbia that right through their recognition and promotion of the independence of a part of the territory of Serbia — Kosovo and Metohija.The principles of safeguarding peace and security  the peaceful settlement of disputes and crises and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States are the bases on which the Republic of Serbia will cooperate in the search for solutions to the various political and security challenges in the world. At the global level  therefore  we support all efforts by the United Nations and its Member States and by regional organizations to find diplomatic solutions to the world’s most sensitive security issues. With its broad political experience and bold leadership  Serbia can contribute  through dialogue with friends  partners and Member States  to devising solutions to the disagreements that threaten to disunite the world all over again.Serbia is making a concrete contribution to maintaining international peace by participating in United Nations and European Union peacekeeping operations. Thanks to that work and to our cooperation with allies and partners  the region is more stable than it was 15 years ago. I would point out that we support every initiative aimed at modifying and adapting peace operations to new security challenges. Serbia calls for strengthening regional cooperation and harmonizing approaches to the activities of peacekeeping missions.Serbia’s new policy has fostered sincere and fully transparent relations in South-Eastern Europe. That was particularly evident during the disastrous floods that struck Serbia  Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The solidarity and magnanimity shown then set an example for the entire world. Today our region is teeming with investment opportunities  and a strong and peaceful South-Eastern Europe is synonymous with a strong and stable Europe as a whole.Serbia has experienced acts of terrorism on its territory in Kosovo and Metohija. We therefore understand very well the security problems the world is facing. We firmly condemn every form of terrorism. We are ready to discuss any initiative that can contribute to strengthening the role of the United Nations in combating that global evil. Serbia has achieved significant success in the fight against terrorism  especially at the regional level  and is ready to lend its experience and knowledge to help strengthen other States’ counter-terrorism capacities.Serbia has never supported and will never support the language of ultimatums. We honour and respect the political and economic interests of all Member States  and our approach and actions in protecting our national and international interests are predicated on those positions.Serbia most strongly condemns the crimes committed by the members of the extremist organization of the Islamic State  particularly the brutal murders. Such forms of terrorism pose one of the most serious threats to international peace and security  and Serbia is committed more than ever to supporting international efforts in the fight against terrorism.The rapid rise of the Islamic State and its ability to attract fighters from all over the world has caught the attention of the international community. One of the main questions facing the world is the problem of foreign fighters recruited by terrorist organizations such as the Islamic State and Al-Qaida. According to research conducted by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence  based in London  the most significant regions outside Western Europe and the Middle East for the recruitment of foreign fighters are the Balkans and the countries of the former Soviet Union. The data on foreign fighters for the Balkans vary: up to 140 recruits from Albania and as many as 60 from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The numbers are somewhat smaller from Macedonia — up to 20. From Serbia there have been three and from Bulgaria one  while the number from our province of Kosovo and Metohija is as high as 150. It must be stopped.We face new global challenges that call for creative responses  global partnership and flexibility. Serbia is unreservedly committed to the principles of multilateral cooperation and to strengthening the principles and system of the United Nations. In that context  we consider the process of the reform of the United Nations system a historic chance to demonstrate our consistent support for the idea of building consensus among Member States on all key issues. Serbia is ready for constructive cooperation and respect for all participants in the dialogue  which will contribute to the greater efficiency of the United Nations system. Serbia supports the reform of the Security Council.Serbia will do its utmost to help bring solutions to global security problems and sustainable development. Traditionally  Serbia has supported the multilateral approach in the field of disarmament and arms control  proceeding from the conviction that in a world of rising interdependence and complexity  common challenges call for common solutions.It is with great concern that we follow the developments related to the rapid spread of the Ebola virus in the countries of Western Africa. We extend our condolences to the Presidents and peoples of Liberia  Guinea and Sierra Leone for the great number of victims. The disease  unprecedented in the extent of its transmission and its high mortality rate  threatens to cause one of the biggest humanitarian crises of the world today and calls for immediate collective action  since it is a problem that belongs to all of us. It is very important in this situation that States Members of the United Nations have recognized the magnitude of the problem and have supported the Secretary-General’s proposal to establish the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response. Serbia is ready to join in and contribute to the collective effort with its scientific and medical capacities and in any other way.The world has changed  but for the poorest it has remained the same. The greater instability of developing countries is a clear indicator that they continue to be in need of assistance. The international community must therefore pay appropriate attention to that group of countries  primarily through financial support  the development of new technologies and the training of human resources. Those are measures meant to lead to the eradication of poverty and the strengthening of institutions.For Serbia  the top priority is poverty eradication  but the goals of inclusive education  health  gender equality  sustainable energy and  in particular  sustainable economic growth and employment are just as important. Jump-starting the economy is the mission to which we shall devote the greatest attention in the coming period  although always mindful of the issues I have mentioned  in order to ensure prosperity for all our citizens.We must acknowledge the higher degree of socioeconomic interlinkage that exists if we are to come up with fresh ideas. We must design new ways to overcome the current crises in global management and study our options for formulating and implementing political solutions.Serbia stands united with the leaders of the entire world in the endeavour aimed at bringing prosperity to humankind. That is a responsibility that we all share. Not only can we achieve much by working together  but we can achieve much more together. That is why the establishment of a united  global front around the idea of the common destiny and interests of humankind  which we all share  should be the first step that we  the States Members of the United Nations  must make as we attempt to solve new global challenges."
"191",7596,"ZAF",69,2014,"I should like to congratulate you  Mr. President  and your country  Uganda  on assuming  on behalf of the continent of Africa  the responsibilities of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. The theme that you have chosen for this general debate and the sixty-ninth session  namely  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  is timely and most appropriate.The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) galvanized and mobilized the international community and the United Nations in a manner never seen before. We have good stories to tell about the journey of the past 15 years of implementing the MDGS. In Africa  we seized the opportunity and adopted the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)  our sociodevelopment blueprint. The African Union’s Vision 2063 will  together with NEPAD and other socioeconomic development programmes  be the cornerstone and foundation of Africa’s development agenda going forward. South Africa has also made significant progress in achieving the MDGs. Reducing by half the number of people earning less than a dollar a day has been achieved  while the proportion of those experiencing hunger has also been halved. South Africa has attained Goal 2  namely  to provide access to primary education for all.By official international indicators  South Africa is also doing well on MDG 3 to promote and empower women. South Africa has recorded impressive progress through the expansion of its health infrastructure and improved access to health services for all South Africans.On the reduction of child mortality  MDG 4  and the improvement of maternal health  MDG 5  significant progress has also been recorded  but more work remains to be done. In fact. more work remains worldwide to fully achieve those goals  especially in the developing world. We have to confront the underlying root causes that continue to make it impossible for our people to have a better life.In spite of the progress that we have made thus far  reports continue to show that Africa is lagging behind in the attainment of some of the MDGs. It is for that reason that we appreciate the crafting of a post-2015 global development agenda that will carry forward the unfinished business of the MDGs. The post-2015 global development agenda will provide a frame of reference for our collective agreement on what has to be done. We reiterate that developed countries should be reliable partners and meet their commitments to development goals  such as contributing 0.7 per cent of their gross national income towards official development assistance. We say that because it does not matter what the great Organization has achieved in the past six decades if we do not deal comprehensively with the scourge of poverty  unemployment and diseases. The poor of the world will then consider everything done to have been a failure. Indeed  we would have failed in our duty if we succeed in preventing another world war but continue to have children dying of malnutrition and treatable diseases.The recent outbreak of Ebola in some West African States and the number of lives that have been unnecessarily lost provide a clear example of the challenges that developing countries continue to contend with. We believe that Ebola would have been contained within a few days had the outbreak been in the developed world. But now it has become a pandemic that threatens the economies of affected African States.The outbreak has thus exposed the challenges resulting from lack of capacity  lack of infrastructure and other limited resources in Africa. We are pleased that the United Nations  under the leadership of the Secretary-General  is deploying a mission to coordinate efforts to combat the virus. South Africa stands ready to continue to provide whatever resources we have at our disposal to assist the people and Governments of our sister countries of Liberia  Guinea and Sierra Leone. We add our voice in calling for more resources to be deployed so as to ensure that the virus is contained.The role of the United Nations in supporting the struggles of self-determination and freedom has been remarkable. South Africa is a shining example. Twenty years ago  President Nelson Mandela thanked all nations for support from this very podium when South Africa was readmitted to the United Nations as a free and democratic State. We are reminded of that fact on this important day  which is National Heritage Day in my country.Since 1994  South Africa has made significant progress in transforming the apartheid State into a democratic one  founded on the values of human dignity  non-discrimination  non-racialism and non-sexism  the rule of law and universal adult suffrage  as enshrined in the Constitution. Given our history and heritage  we are mindful of our historic and moral responsibility in the global struggle against racism  racial discrimination and other intolerances. We will  in this regard  continue to be at the forefront of efforts to eliminate all forms of racism  racial discrimination and any other intolerance  including xenophobia and anti-Semitism.The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action remain the primary framework adopted by a United Nations conference in the fight against racism. We will continue to support the struggles for freedom and self-determination  including the struggles of the peoples of Palestine and Western Sahara  who continue to experience occupation and colonialism of different forms. The people of Cuba also hold a special place in our hearts because of that country’s sacrifice for African freedom. We will therefore continue to support their struggle for economic liberation.While the United Nations has done remarkably well in supporting self-determination  when it celebrates 70 years of existence next year  this body may be found wanting by the people of Palestine. The Israeli-Palestine question is one of the oldest items on the United Nations agenda  but progress remains elusive. In the past few months in particular  the world has witnessed a devastating conflict that left a humanitarian crisis of shocking proportions. People in Palestine were left homeless  with no medical facilities  no safe drinking water  bereaved and having to care for the wounded after a trail of destructive military actions by Israel.South Africa has condemned the actions of both Israel and Hamas  and we have called for an immediate cessation of hostilities. Our strongly held view is that there can be no military solution to the Israeli-Palestinian question. We should all remain committed to the two-State solution  based on the 1967 borders  with Palestine and Israel coexisting side by side in peace.Of concern in this matter has been the helplessness displayed by the United Nations  especially the Security Council during the current conflict. The United Nations has the moral authority and legitimacy to unite the world in promoting the quest for peace  justice and self-determination for the people of Palestine  while addressing whatever security concerns Israel may have. This body must play its role without fear or favour and be a beacon for all who suffer oppression in the world.Let me reiterate that the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations next year provides an opportunity for us seriously to reflect on the need to reform this august body  moving beyond words to action. Ten years ago  world leaders celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations agreed on the need for reform of the Security Council in particular. The decision remains valid and must be implemented. When we convene here next year  in the seventieth year of the United Nations  we should be able to adopt a concrete programme that will guide us towards a strengthened United Nations and a reformed Security Council. Some contentious aspects of the United Nations system  including the power of veto and the exclusion of regions such as Africa from the Security Council  are some of the critical matters that cannot be ignored in the quest for transformation.Among the achievements of the Organization in its recent history is the cooperation between the African Union and the United Nations  particularly since the formation of the African Union Peace and Security Architecture. In this regard  the full implementation of Security Council resolutions 1809 (2008) and 2033 (2012)  on cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations  particularly the African Union  remains crucial. Progress has been made in a number of areas where this cooperation is in place  for example in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The two affected subregional organizations  the Southern African Development Community and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region  continue to take significant strides with the support of the United Nations.This body celebrated the formation of a new State of South Sudan not long ago. Recent developments and the ongoing conflict in South Sudan have resulted in loss of life and other dire humanitarian consequences. We will continue to contribute as much as we can to finding solutions working with the African Union and this body. South Sudan should not be allowed to regress.Next year marks 20 years since the the Fourth World Conference on Women adopted the Beijing Platform for Action. The anniversary provides an opportunity for the United Nations and the international community to reflect and take forward the struggle for the emancipation of women from all forms of discrimination.Last December  the world descended on South Africa to pay last respects to our beloved Madiba. Those who did not come to South Africa honoured Madiba in various ways. We will continue to work with the world to promote Madiba’s legacy and passion for justice  freedom  equality and human rights. We are grateful to the General Assembly and the President of the Assembly at the sixty-eighth session for the decision to establish the United Nations Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela Prize that will be awarded to an outstanding individual who will have demonstrated a commitment to the aims  objectives and principles of the United Nations Charter. The Prize is a great testament to the outstanding individual that Madiba was and will always be.As we recommit to the Millennium Development Goals  let me once again borrow from the words of Madiba uttered on his historic inauguration day in 1994 when he said:“We understand it still that there is no easy road to freedom. We know it well that none of us acting alone can achieve success. We must therefore act together as a united people  for national reconciliation  for nation building  for the birth of a new world. Let there be justice for all. Let there be peace for all. Let there be work  bread  water and salt for all. Let each know that for each the body  the mind and the soul have been freed to fulfil themselves.”"
"192",7638,"ZMB",69,2014,"I extend our sincere congratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We see him undertaking that onerous task at a particularly important moment in not only the forging of the future global development agenda  but the development of international peace and security. I therefore assure him of my Government’s support as he sets out to discharge that important assignment. In the same spirit  I also convey our appreciation for the contribution made by his predecessor  Mr. John Ashe  President of the Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.I wish to highlight our deep concern at the global health emergency that has resulted from the Ebola outbreak in parts of Africa. That burden is not only for the people of Liberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea; Zambia views the epidemic as a common challenge to humankind  and therefore stands ready to support all efforts required to defeat the disease and ensure a return to normalcy in the daily economic and social lives of our sister Republics that are directly facing the disease.There is growing acceptance and concern that Ebola could easily spread beyond the first four countries that have so far borne the brunt of the disease. The recent resurgence of the disease in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo is a reminder of the extent of the danger. Beyond that  we remain deeply concerned that over 5 000 people in all have been victims of the disease and 2 400 needless deaths have already been recorded across the continent. Zambia therefore supports the call for greater and wider involvement by all Member States. The World Health Organization has already warned that if the epidemic is left unchecked  we will soon be dealing with over 20 000 Ebola patients.It is equally for that reason that we continue to look at global health issues as important parameters for global development. The Ebola public health emergency and other ongoing challenges  such as malaria  tuberculosis  AIDS and other  non-communicable diseases  need a concerted global approach.In the past few months  the international community has witnessed the growing desperation of extremist terrorist organizations  notably through the abduction of innocent schoolgirls in Borno state  Nigeria  and the wider reign of terror  which includes bombing civilian trading points across that important African nation.Zambia is also concerned about the insecurity currently being experienced as a result of the instability in Ukraine. We have followed the counter-accusations  which point to the deep-seated divisions and suspicions of a bygone era. Sadly  the human losses have been heavy  as ordinary Ukrainians are caught in the middle of a crisis that is strongly influenced by foreign factors. Innocent civilians from other nations have also been drawn in through the loss of lives on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. We share in the sorrow of the families and the nations that lost loved ones in that human-caused catastrophe. Zambia believes that ordinary Ukrainian citizens are of the same view and desire nothing but peace  harmony and prosperity for their country. They should be allowed to enjoy those basic human conditions.Those and other global security concerns linger  facing a United Nations that is becoming ever more challenged in coordinating any robust or convincing global response.This session of the General Assembly is also taking place at a moment of renewed focus on the global development agenda through the negotiations on the post-2015 agenda and the work to produce the sustainable development goals (SDGs). My understanding has been that the negotiations have thus far been engaging and have included the participation of all stakeholders  including Governments  civil society  the business community and academia. It can therefore be said that we have laid a solid foundation upon which the world will articulate its development policies for the next decade and a half  in line with the three pillars of the SDGs.We look forward to the completion of those deliberations  knowing that unless the means of implementation are adequately covered with new investment inflows  we risk rendering that noble effort a futile exercise. Given the immense challenges facing our nations  it is such multilateral approaches that will address the underlying cross-border factors that affect climate change  global poverty  public health  children’s welfare  labour and migration  youth unemployment  the advancement of women and many other issues whose solutions lie in actions that may have transboundary effects.The new global development regime must therefore demonstrate a new and more robust approach to those problems. For that reason  Zambia supports the related meetings being held alongside this session of the Assembly  notably those relating to population and development  labour and decent work  and the 2014 Climate Summit. It is hoped that those discussions will  in the not-too-distant future  lead to lasting solutions to the development challenges faced by many of our countries.On another important matter  I wish to report that Zambia has increased its campaign to forestall the growing problem of child marriages and early and forced marriages. That problem is strongly rooted in the prevailing poverty levels in some poor families and in the quest by organized criminals to profit from selling off under-age girls either into marriage or to engage in exploitative vices. With that national awakening to the problem  Zambia hosted a three-day national symposium on the problem in July. We look forward to working with other nations to ensure that a global approach is developed to curb the incidences of child  early and forced marriages  which is a problem with greater consequences for the future advancement of women.Zambia is also undertaking several other initiatives aimed at reducing the gender divide. My Government is of the conviction that girls and women should be enabled and allowed to reach their full potential and be able to contribute to national growth on an equal footing with men. In that regard  the education of the girl child and the socioeconomic empowerment of women through their representation in key decision-making positions is at the top of the national agenda.Furthermore  Zambia reaffirms its commitment to gender equality and the empowerment of women made at the fourth World Conference on Women  held in Beijing in 1995  My Government has continued to stress the importance of women’s emancipation and their contribution to national development in line with the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.The question of the reform of the Security Council remains an important priority for Zambia and the rest of the African continent. We remain deeply concerned that little progress has been recorded in the negotiations on the expansion of the Council. Africa remains fully committed to all five clusters of the intergovernmental negotiations process outlined in decision 62/557  of 2008. As a member of the African Union Committee of Ten on Security Council reform  let me echo other voices in reiterating the importance that our member States attach to the realization of those long-overdue reforms.My delegation also accords due priority to the questions relating to countries in special situations  in particular landlocked developing countries (LLDCs)  for which group Zambia was nominated as Chair in March. The implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action  as adopted in 2003  has run its course  albeit with mixed results. It is coming up for review at the United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries  to be held in Vienna in just over a month’s time  from 3 to 5 November. The 32 Member States in that grouping are counting on the support of the entire United Nations membership to ensure a successful Conference  which we expect will firmly place the LLDCs on a sound path of development. I therefore look forward to the full participation of Member States at the Conference.I would like to end by informing the Assembly that our historic capital city  Lusaka  has for the past year been celebrating its centenary. That occasion was followed this year by two other important celebrations  namely  the ninetieth birthday of our founding father  the first Republican President  Mr. Kenneth Kaunda  and the fiftieth anniversary of our national independence  which falls on 24 October.The commemorations have offered a unique chance not only to celebrate  but also to reflect on our development path. I submit that within our known difficult struggle to achieve social and economic development lies a strong national spirit  eager to contribute not only to our own growth  but also to that which the growing global interdependence demands. Let me  on behalf of all Zambians  express appreciation to all those that have helped our beloved country in achieving those milestones. Zambia looks forward to a strengthened and more versatile United Nations system that will help create the conditions for the further growth and development of our youthful nation."
"193",7674,"ZWE",69,2014,"Allow me to congratulate Mr. Kutesa on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We are indeed proud of the honour that has been bestowed upon the African continent as a result of his election. The theme he has chosen for this session  that is  “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda”  is pertinent  appropriate and timely. It is relevant in our efforts to achieve a seamless transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the sustainable development goals and the broader post-2015 development agenda. We look forward to having a candid and comprehensive debate on the challenges we continue to face at the domestic and international levels in our efforts to eradicate poverty.The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) helped to focus and mobilize global development efforts in order to achieve progress in the social sectors. However  despite the significant achievements within the framework of the MDGs  progress was uneven between goals  among regions and within countries. Consequently  we cannot remain complacent when some sections of the global community are marginalized or even left behind. We are therefore gratified that the proposed sustainable development goals have taken on board the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals. Part of that unfinished business concerns the critical issue of poverty eradication  which remains the greatest global challenge. That issue should therefore be the top priority and overarching objective of the development agenda for the future.We in the Southern African Development Community share the view that the post-MDG agenda must be informed by national development priorities and that the new targets must better reflect local conditions. In that regard  Zimbabwe adopted its own economic blueprint  the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation. It is a bold and achievable development programme that has the objective of ensuring inclusive economic growth  decent jobs for all  affordable and reliable energy  food security  sustainable agriculture and the development of reliable modern infrastructure. Through the programme  we also aim to expand the industrial base  which is key to the sustained overall economic development and human development of our country. We continue to push for the leveraging of our diverse and abundant resources through beneficiation and value addition. We therefore expect that the proposals in the sustainable development goals  which complement those elements of our national aspirations  will be endorsed and integrated into the post-2015 development agenda framework.Social justice  political stability and sustainable development in African countries can best be achieved through genuine and committed support for the ownership of means of production that favour the poor  who are in the majority. In Zimbabwe  my Government has gone a long way in laying the foundation for sustained food production through our land reform programme. The majority of the rural people have been empowered to contribute to household and national food security. The possession and exploitation of land has also turned them into masters of their own destiny  thus giving true meaning to our national independence and unquestioned sovereignty.Because Zimbabwe has thus been preoccupied with the empowerment of its people economically  it has become a victim of the evil machinations of Western countries  namely  the United States and States members of the European Union  which continue to apply unilateral and illegal sanctions as a foreign-policy tool to achieve short-term political objectives  particularly regime change. Regime change is a diabolical and illegal policy of interference in the domestic affairs of my country  and no good can come from undermining our economy or depriving our citizens of the necessities of life. Why  I ask  should Zimbabweans continue to suffer under the American and European yoke of unjustified and unwarranted illegal sanctions? Those evil sanctions violate the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and should be condemned by the international community. We once again call for their immediate and unconditional removal.We are a peaceful and peace-loving nation  ready to engage in constructive dialogue for mutually beneficial relations. We call on those who continue to harbour ill will against us to cast away their hegemony-driven hostility  as we appeal to them to review their hard-line and cruel positions and open a new chapter in their relations with us based on mutual respect and friendly cooperation.To support the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda  we call for an expeditious reform of the Bretton Woods institutions  particularly their governance structures. It is high time that we addressed the democratic deficit in those institutions and improved their legitimacy. Those reforms must reflect current realities and ensure the full voice and participation of developing countries in the decision-making and norm-setting activities.Zimbabwe firmly believes that the United Nations should promote dialogue to achieve peace  the rule of law and common understanding among States. The peace  security  stability and welfare of Africa and our subregion is vital for us. In Africa  the African Union is working tirelessly to push for peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  South Sudan  the Central African Republic and Somalia. The international community must remain intensively engaged and support Africa in the maintenance of peace and stability  thereby enhancing its peacekeeping-capacity needs through training and logistical and financial support. Africa also remains seized of the issue of Western Sahara  the last colonial vestige in Africa. The United Nations should not shake off its responsibility to ensure the realization of self-determination by the people of Western Sahara.We continue to witness the suffering and persecution of the people of Palestine at the hands of Israel. We have witnessed the callous murder of women and children in shelters  where they seek refuge from Israel’s bombs. We have witnessed the brutal and random destruction of infrastructure in the Gaza Strip. While those heinous acts were being perpetrated by Israel  the so-called civilized world maintained a deafening silence. And we ask  why?Lasting peace in the Middle East can be achieved only through a two-State solution based on the 1967 borders. Any other manoeuvres to change demographic realities through settlements or the use of force will only prolong the suffering of the Palestinians.In conclusion  as we move forward  it is important to muster the necessary political will to create a development-oriented international environment that facilitates the eradication of poverty and enhances the sound management of our natural resources for economic and social development  under a renewed and real global partnership."
