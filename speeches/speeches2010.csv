"1",40,"AFG",65,2010,"I join previous speakers in congratulating you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I am confident that  under your able stewardship  our deliberations will be fruitful.  Sixty-five years ago  the creation of the United Nations heralded hope for global peace  security and   27 10-55128  respect for human dignity. Today  the United Nations remains the most effective universal body for preserving the principles upon which it was founded. As one of its earliest Member States  Afghanistan fully and consistently subscribes to the centrality of the United Nations and to the principles of multilateralism that guarantee a democratic international order in which we all have an equal voice and participation in decisions impacting our world.  Today more than ever before  our world demands a commitment to working together so that we may overcome the multifaceted challenges and threats to our survival and well-being. The United Nations is pivotal to our ability to translate our common sense of purpose and determined political will to replace desperation with hope  poverty with prosperity  injustice with justice and violence with peace.  Last week  the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) adopted an outcome document and plan of action for the full realization of the Millennium Development Goals (resolution 65/1). Fifteen years ago when the MDGs were adopted  we recognized that comprehensive and collective effort was essential to the attainment of the Goals. Last week’s summit again underscored the need for enhanced international cooperation and coordination in order to achieve human development and well-being.  Afghanistan remains fully committed to meeting its MDG targets. We have made some progress  but the scourge of international terrorism  insecurity and threats to the rule of law and governance remain enormous challenges to promoting human development in Afghanistan.  On the eve of the ninth anniversary of the declaration of the global war on terror in October 2001  the international community’s promise to the people of Afghanistan of a life free from the fear of the threat and exploitation of international terrorism remains unfulfilled. Afghans continue to suffer from horrific acts of terrorist violence on a daily basis.  On many occasions from this rostrum  the Afghan delegation has drawn the global community’s attention to the reality that terrorism and the ideologies of extremism and radicalism are spawned beyond the borders of Afghanistan. In spite of the combined efforts of our military allies  terrorists continue to infiltrate our borders with the intent of inflicting harm on our people and the brave soldiers of partner countries. As long as certain State and non-State actors provide  Al-Qaida and affiliated individuals and entities with sanctuary  arms and financing  they will remain formidable and murderous adversaries.  Terrorism in our region is a growing threat to world peace and security. The audacity and geographic scope of extremist and terrorist groups harboured in our region continue to expand. If our international partners and allies wish to win the global war on terrorism  they must look beyond villages in Afghanistan and engage in a strategy that will effectively and decisively dismantle organizations and networks that continue to support terrorist and radical militants with impunity. Terrorism remains a global challenge that can be defeated only through a concerted international effort.  In this context  Afghanistan is committed to expanding counter-terrorism cooperation with the Government of Pakistan and with other countries in our region.  The people of Afghanistan have known too much violence and too much despair. We have seen too many of our young people lose their lives as a result of war and conflict. The Afghan people crave peace  stability and security. Although our fight against those who menace the lives and well-being of our people will continue unabated  we recognize that the success of our efforts for development and prosperity will depend largely on our ability to achieve sustainable peace in our country.  With this objective in mind  the Afghan Government convened a National Consultative Peace Jirga in June of this year. The Jirga fulfilled President Karzai’s promise to consult and engage all Afghans in peacebuilding initiatives. The Jirga — which assembled tribal leaders  parliamentarians  and representatives of provincial councils  businesses and civil society  and had over 20 per cent female participation — helped to jump-start a representative peace and reconciliation process that will be pursued in conformity with our Constitution and human rights commitments.  The Consultative Peace Jirga agreed on a framework to encourage the rank and file of the Taliban to end violence and to join a reconciliation and reintegration process. It defined the conditions for a peace dialogue with Taliban leaders and endorsed the    10-55128 28  establishment of a peace commission to oversee the reintegration of armed opposition fighters who renounce violence  resume civilian life  accept our Constitution and embrace our democracy.  Over the past eight years  we and our international partners have realized substantial achievements  but also have made mistakes. Many challenges and obstacles remain to ensuring sustainable security for the people of Afghanistan and to meeting their aspirations to a better life and future. At the London and Kabul Conferences held earlier this year  the international community not only reaffirmed its commitment to safeguarding Afghanistan’s sovereignty  territorial integrity and stability  but also recognized the critical importance of Afghan ownership and leadership to consolidating our joint achievements and engaging the greater confidence of the Afghan people.  By building on the mutual commitments made at the milestone Conferences in London and Kabul to transfer security and development responsibilities to the Afghans  and by pursing comprehensive economic development  security  governance and our inclusive reconciliation strategies  we are convinced that we will successfully combat the efforts of extremists and terrorists seeking to regain hold of Afghanistan.  For our part  the Government of Afghanistan is steadfast in its commitment to pursuing the reform agenda that President Karzai outlined in his inaugural speech. We are committed to reinforcing our social compact with the people of Afghanistan by strengthening our judiciary  combating corruption  revitalizing our economy and promoting good governance at all levels of the Government. As demonstrated by the recently held parliamentary elections  the Government and the people of Afghanistan are steadfast in advancing our democracy.  With the support and collaboration of our international partners and allies  we are committed to enhancing the capacity and ability of the Afghan Security Forces to assume greater responsibility for the protection and security of our country. In this context  I wish to acknowledge the enhanced effort of our military allies to protect our civilian populations from the detrimental effects of military operations against the terrorists and militants.  The people of Afghanistan embrace the challenge of building a better future. However  the insidious dangers of extremism and terrorism and their ever-increasing link to narcotics pose a serious threat to the security and stability of our country and our region. Alongside our fight against terrorism  we are committed to working closely with our neighbours and other international partners to win the war on narcotics.  To complement our efforts to eliminate poppy production  we wish to see greater action to counter smuggling of precursors into our country and to reduce the demand for and consumption of drugs in other countries.  Recent climate-induced disasters experienced in our region  such as the catastrophic floods in Pakistan  not only pose severe challenges for local populations and national Governments  but may also have ramifications for the economies of countries in the region and for global security. We see increased urgency for effective regional collaboration on disaster mitigation and response.  At various international  regional and subregional gatherings  we have emphasized the importance of a stable  democratic and moderate Afghanistan to the economic development of our region and global security. By virtue of its location at the crossroads of four geostrategically important regions — Central Asia  South Asia  China and the Middle East — Afghanistan could play an important role in facilitating increased trade and transit and unleashing the enormous potential of our region. We will work towards further gains in trade and transit with countries in the region.  The recent conclusion of the Afghanistan-Pakistan- Transit Trade Agreement and the signing by the heads of State of Turkmenistan  Afghanistan  Pakistan and India of an agreement on a gas pipeline project are milestones for increased regional cooperation. In addition  we have concluded the feasibility study for a Central Asia-South Asia project for the transfer of electricity from Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to Afghanistan and Pakistan. These initiatives will contribute greatly to peace  security and stability in our region. Afghanistan stands ready to step up cooperation with all its neighbours on economic  political and crime-related issues.  I have spoken of the desire of the people of Afghanistan for peace and stability and of our right to them. We are  however  acutely aware that for over half a century our brothers and sisters in Palestine have   29 10-55128  been denied their right to an independent State living in peaceful coexistence with its neighbours. We are encouraged by the resumption of direct talks between the Israeli and Palestinian leadership  which give us hope that sustainable peace in the Middle East may be secured.  To conclude  I thank the States members of this Assembly for their solidarity and their support for the liberty and well-being of the people of Afghanistan. The Afghan people will never forget the generosity and great sacrifices of the United States  NATO and other international partners  whose men and women have bravely stood with us to defend our common security and ensure peace and stability for Afghanistan.  I thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts to revitalize the sense of partnership  cooperation and confidence between Afghanistan and the international community. I also thank the dedicated and committed staff of the United Nations and its specialized agencies for helping the Afghan people build a peaceful  secure and prosperous future."
"2",79,"AGO",65,2010,"First  I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session and to assure him that he can count on the support of Angola so that at the end of this session we will all be better prepared to respond to the multiple and complex challenges facing the international community. I also take this opportunity to convey  though the President  our most sincere gratitude to the outgoing President for the selfless manner in which he conducted the sixty-fourth session.  In the last decade several events have profoundly marked the world community  including natural calamities and man-made disasters  which should lead us to consider the need to work towards a more cooperative and increasingly integrated world  for no one is immune to those phenomena. The terrorist attack of 2001 on the Twin Towers of New York that killed more than 3 000 people  the tsunami of December 2004 in which more than 200 000 people perished  the recent earthquake in Haiti that caused more than 200 000 deaths  and the series of natural disasters that have occurred on every continent  added to the global financial and economic crisis  should awaken us to the fact that we live in a different world that requires broader cooperation among nations  given that those phenomena are unforeseeable.  Therefore  in today’s world  the consequences of the irresponsibility of a few can have repercussions on the lives of us all. It is thus imperative that we pursue relationships that have greater balance and equality between large and small and rich and poor  because the new reality is that we are increasingly interdependent in a global world.  Angola  has always been convinced of the important role of the United Nations and of multilateral diplomacy in general  because no country can progress and develop unilaterally  isolated from the community of nations and alienated from the common problems affecting humanity as a whole.   25 10-55276   In the President’s speech to the General Assembly on the occasion of his election (see A/64/PV.93)  among other things he set the following topics as priorities for the sixty-fifth session: climate change  the Millennium Development Goals  food security  sustainable development  rebuilding and strengthening fragile post-conflict States  and humanitarian aid and disarmament. Angola is of the opinion that the environment and other issues he mentioned must remain priorities on the national and international agendas. They are crucial for sustainable development  for the growth of our economies  for the implementation of national strategies for combating poverty  and for the attainment of the Millennium Goals.   At the Food and Agriculture Organization’s Regional Conference for Africa  held recently in Luanda  the participants expressed their concern about the impact of climate change on the world food crisis in some regions and recommended that States make an extra effort to reduce its impact on agriculture.  Angola believes in the importance of multilateralism as the best form of treatment and resolution of the multifaceted challenges that humanity faces today. In that context Angola advocates a shared commitment to find solutions to our problems at all levels.  My country gives priority to political and diplomatic coordination and to strengthening institutional relations with the organizations of the United Nations system  as well as with the regional and subregional organizations to which it belongs  namely  the African Union  the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS)  the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and the Commission on the Gulf of Guinea  the latter having its headquarters in Angola.  In the Commission on the Gulf of Guinea  member States cooperate with a view to managing potential conflicts linked to maritime borders and managing shared maritime resources  as well as coordinating policies for the prevention of maritime trafficking and piracy  thus providing security to a region that produces more than 15 per cent of the world’s oil.  With that motivation  Angola and its armed forces bravely participated in the liberation of southern Africa  having contributed to the independence of Namibia and to the end of apartheid in South Africa. With that same motivation we contributed to the stabilization of the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. With other international partners of the United Nations  we are participating in the training of the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.   Today the Angolan armed forces are a factor for stability not only for Angola  but also for the southern and central regions of Africa  where we are part of the early warning mechanisms of SADC and ECCAS. At present we are committed to finding solutions to the crisis in Guinea-Bissau  in close cooperation with other partners in West Africa  namely  the Economic Community of West African States  and in partnership with the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries.  It was therefore with great amazement that we learned of the mention of involvement by the Angolan armed forces in alleged acts of human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in a report intended to be circulated as a document of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. We stress that that document was produced at the initiative of an organ of the United Nations Secretariat with no specific mandate from the Secretary-General or from Member States.   It is important to emphasize before the Assembly that Angola intervened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the basis of a SADC mandate  at the request of the Government of the Democratic Republic. That intervention made it possible to stop the bloodbath and to save the lives of millions of people and lay the basis for the negotiations that culminated in the establishment of the transitional Government  the installation of the United Nations peacekeeping mission and the successful holding of the first democratic elections. It thus contributed to the pacification of the Great Lakes region.  Angola vehemently rejects the insinuation and considers abnormal the manner in which that so-called mapping exercise was conducted. We question the motivations behind that venture. We would like to reiterate that Angola and the Angolan armed forces will continue to act responsibly and on the basis of international standards and scrupulous respect for human rights.  The report of the Secretary-General to the sixty-fifth session contains references to peace and security  considering them essential for development and for the    10-55276 26  promotion of and respect for human rights. Angola shares the concerns of the Secretary-General. Our experience shows that only peace  the democratic rule of law and respect for human rights can guarantee the stability necessary for sustainable development and improvement of the living conditions of our people. Angola encourages the efforts by regional organizations and the United Nations in conflict resolution and peacekeeping to ensure global security and stability.  A situation that is certainly of concern to all of us is the conflict in the Middle East. Angola recognizes that it has lasted a long time  with serious consequences for the population. Therefore we support the resumption of peace talks by President Barack Obama with a view to creating a Palestinian State that coexists peacefully with the State of Israel.  Angola is also concerned at the persistence of the economic  commercial and financial blockade against Cuba  despite successive General Assembly resolutions demanding its immediate removal. That unilateral measure  particularly its extraterritorial effects  is contrary to the principles and norms of international law and contributes to the precarious humanitarian and social situation of the Cuban population. From this rostrum we reiterate our vehement appeal for the lifting of a measure whose anachronistic nature has been restated here on numerous occasions.  Regarding the question of Western Sahara  Angola notes with concern that despite various United Nations resolutions and initiatives  there has not been the type of progress that would lead to meeting the aspirations of the Saharan people. We urge the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to attain those objectives.  Mutually beneficial cooperation  the promotion of peace and respect for human rights remain the major drivers of Angolan foreign policy  based on the observance of the principles of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.   Internally  and as a result of experiences during different periods in our history  marked by three decades of war and political instability  Angola is now entering a new cycle  of which we are very proud. It is characterized by the adoption of a new constitution that marks the end of the transition period and definitively establishes democratic rule of law  given that elections will be held in June 2012.  We are aware that we still have a long way to go  especially in view of all the time lost and the delays accumulated in several areas. But it seems important to us to emphasize that the progress already achieved did not happen by chance. Rather  it resulted from the leadership efforts of the Angolan executive organs  the pragmatism of its policies and its commitment to better the human development indexes  which are reflected today in the improved welfare of the people.  After eight years of peace  Angola has implemented economic and social reform policies that have allowed for the revitalization of its economy and the rehabilitation of key infrastructure. Such policies have enabled the country’s annual growth rates to average double digits  with a direct impact on the improvement of basic indicators of the Millennium Development Goals.   Since 2002 more than 2 million children have been enrolled in primary education. The percentage of children attending school has risen sharply  to 76 per cent. The rate of infant and maternal mortality fell considerably  from 1 400 per 100 000 live births in 2001 to 660 per 100 000 live births in 2010. Moreover  in order to eradicate hunger and poverty  Angola has adopted its National Food Security Strategy (2009-2014) as a mechanism to increase agricultural production in a sustainable manner.  We are convinced that the international community is also aware of how much still has to be done  particularly in the areas of financing for development and the materialization of the commitments made at major international conferences on financing for development.  Finally  the reform of the Security Council  given its importance in the democratization of international relations  must remain a topic on the agenda of the Organization. In that connection  Angola reiterates its support for the African common position embodied in the Ezulwini Consensus. "
"3",126,"ALB",65,2010,"It is a special honour for me to address the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I would like to congratulate the President on his election to this important position. His experience and continuing commitment strengthen my conviction that he will take the achievements of his predecessor even further. Albania will fully support him as he fulfils his mandate. I take this opportunity to express our special appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continuing efforts to revitalize the global role of the United Nations  as well as to reform the Organization.  Albania is of the view that the role of the United Nations remains powerful  coherent and irreplaceable as the centre of effective global action. It must continue to be encouraged and supported in its efforts to overcome the challenges of achieving open international cooperation  sustainable peace and security  ongoing development and greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.  We live in a global world  interconnected and interdependent  where States and nations must assist and support each other in the search for a comprehensive answer to the common problems and new challenges that we face. Multilateralism remains a priority for the entire international community. In this context  a reformed United Nations — revitalized  dynamic  powerful and effective — is crucial to the complicated process of global governance. In this path of cooperation around the world  the role of the United Nations is irreplaceable  especially in regard to how we make use of our human and material resources.  Rapidly evolving issues throughout the world  each with positive and negative consequences that must inevitably influence the challenges the future will bring  must be given special priority and approached with special care. The United Nations challenging agenda must focus on strengthening peace and security  fighting terrorism  and the issues of stable development  climate change  poverty reduction  the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  natural disasters  human rights  migration  and others. Albania remains committed to contributing to this agenda.  The lead role of the Organization and its agencies in administering its budgetary and human resources should be responsive to the requests of Member States. The establishment of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women is the most recent example of tangible success in United Nations reform. Strengthening the role of women in society will not only enhance political life but also help their emancipation and harmonious development.  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are a priority in our work. Following the adoption of the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) a decade ago  Albania has advanced towards meeting the MDGs in all areas and with respect to all indicators. It has also made great efforts to incorporate the MDGs into its national development strategy.  We are fully committed to reaching the goals set forth in the acquis communautaire of the European Union (EU)  which requires increasing investment in social issues  establishing local and central governance systems  and enhancing development capacity in order to guarantee the ongoing improvement of the well-being of the Albanian people. However  as a full-fledged member of NATO and in the light of its internal democratic stability  Albania is now seeking greater standing in the world as a way to bolster its development in the long term.  Delivering as one is a crucial factor in the reform designed to assist in development around the world. United Nations efforts to establish system-wide coherence offer a real possibility to make the United   29 10-54833  Nations more effective. As a pilot country  Albania is a success story  having committed itself fully from the onset. The One United Nations concept in Albania is being developed in complete harmony with national sovereignty and national ownership of development  while responding to the specific needs of the country. The responsibility of being a pilot country further encourages us to make this initiative a success. It is also an opportunity for us to contribute to the overall reform of the United Nations.  Albania has signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations. As a NATO member  Albania is a force for peace and stability in the region. Not only does Albania follow a policy of good-neighbourly relations and strive for the preservation and strengthening of stability in its own region  it also has shown its interest in and commitment to stability and peace in other parts of the world by contributing military and civilian personnel to the peacekeeping missions of various international security organizations and of the United Nations  including the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad and missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. We are thus willing to contribute peacekeeping troops anywhere in the world under the auspices of the United Nations and regional security organizations like NATO.  Terrorism remains a major threat to peace  international security and world order. The fight against terrorism remains a priority that requires great determination resolve. This global threat may be prevented and addressed through collective action  strong responses and the mobilization of all States Members of the United Nations. We must show our nations that  as a part of our responsibility  we shall stand resolute and united against terrorism. Together  we must define a collective platform and strategy for victory in the war against terror by strengthening the international system and order.  We praise and appreciate the work of the Security Council and its committees for their engagement with and active support for Member States through their effective implementation of the Council’s counter-terrorism resolutions  in particular resolutions 1269 (1999)  1373 (2001)  1540 (2004) and 1624 (2005). Albania remains fully committed to cooperating with the Security Council in this regard.  Albania appreciates the Secretary-General’s contributions to addressing the issue of the Middle East  particularly in the discussions aimed at achieving a sustainable solution acceptable to all parties. All peoples share the desire to live in peace  and Governments have an obligation to guarantee it. We support the relaunched dialogue process and hope that  with the commitment of the international community  the Palestinians and Israelis will take the steps necessary to achieving stable peace in that important region.  Albania believes that the Alliance of Civilizations is a political means for the United Nations to promote peace and harmony among civilizations and to build an inclusive society through education  understanding and mutual knowledge. As a member of the Group of Friends  we shall take active part because we believe in dialogue and contacts among different cultures  in the need to know and respect each other  and in the necessity of defending the unique as part of the richness of the whole. Our approved national strategy for intercultural dialogue and the holding of the Inter-Religious Forum in Tirana in January have served to enrich our experience. However  our participation in the Third Global Forum of the Alliance of Civilizations led us to believe that a better job of fighting stereotypes and prejudice is still needed  as are greater efforts to make modern multicultural societies more cohesive.  Albania’s integration into and membership of the European Union is a key priority of our foreign policy  where there has rarely been a broader political and social consensus. The important steps taken by Albania towards EU membership and the phases of cooperation under the framework of the integration process have shown a great deal of potential.  The end of this year promises to be decisive as we approach two decisions of great importance: the completion of the visa liberalization process with the EU and the achievement of candidate status for EU membership. Albanians will finally be able to enjoy the real freedom for which they fought and sacrificed longer and more deeply than any other European nation. The near-unanimous decision of the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs to remove the requirement that Albanians obtain visas to enter the EU not only gives us great joy  but also confers greater responsibility on us to fulfil our commitments as we prepare for EU membership.    10-54833 30   We guarantee that the seriousness with which we completed the EU questionnaire and our responsible approach to our relations with all European Union institutions and member countries will remain the hallmarks of our efforts to earn the status of candidate country at the earliest possible date.  Albania’s membership in NATO and its integration into the European Union are important regional processes inseparable from the full integration of the region. We believe that every Western Balkan country is entitled to play a role in contributing to and assuming responsibility for the integration and emancipation of the region. I am happy to acknowledge that the high level of regional cooperation and political awareness show that the only way forward is through Euro-Atlantic integration.  These are hopeful and promising times  now that the bitter past of that part of Europe has been consigned to history. Albania and Albanians will continue to contribute to stability  security  long-term peace and economic growth by encouraging integration policies related not just to security and economic development  but also to coexistence among countries  peoples and nations  cultures  traditions and history.  A few days ago  a rare occurrence took place in this very Hall with the adoption by consensus of resolution 64/298 on the international legitimacy of the declaration of Kosovo’s independence. That was a very important event for Kosovo  Serbia  the Western Balkans  a united Europe and the United Nations. I would like to express my gratitude for the commitment and engagement of all international actors  especially the European Union  which imbued the resolution with the contemporary philosophy and openness of Europe. The European Union showed its cohesiveness and proved that the integration policies of our region are unstoppable and full of hope  and that the only way to unite with Europe is through dialogue and cooperation among neighbouring countries.  Now that the matter of the status of Kosovo and its borders has been settled definitively  it is time to begin a dialogue on practical issues. We hope that the message enshrined in the resolution will immediately be put into practice by the two independent countries. We support the immediate launch of dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia. We support sincere and constructive dialogue to resolve practical issues of interest to the daily concerns of their citizens  to help them and to facilitate and even calm the situation of the respective Albanian and Serbian minorities. It is time to resolve the problems and issues concerning representation  language and education  among others  in the spirit and vision of a common European future.  Albania considers the consensus adoption of resolution 64/298 to be an important step not only in respect of the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice and the authority of the United Nations  but also for the consolidation of the State of Kosovo and its democratic and European institutions  its independence and integrity  and its future as a Member of the United Nations.  Albania appreciates the work of the Security Council in its engagement towards the implementation of the United Nations Charter and international law  which are essential to peaceful coexistence and cooperation among Member States in addressing common challenges and contributing to international peace and security.  The advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice legally confirmed that the independence of Kosovo remains a sui generis case that does not set a precedent for situations in other countries. Now is the time to prove with concrete facts that we respect the United Nations and the values that have united us here today. Today is the day to testify that we support its authority and its independent institutions. Today is a golden opportunity to accept the truth and to declare it loudly.  Today  we have a responsibility towards a country and a people that rightly wish to be among us and have given ample evidence that they truly deserve it. I take this opportunity to appeal to my colleagues  whose countries have not yet recognized the independence of Kosovo  to recognize it now  by assuring them that this is the only way to contribute to long-term stability and peace  not just in the region but also globally.  In conclusion  I would like to confirm once again that Albania is determined to continue to support the United Nations agenda and the stronger functioning of the Organization at all levels."
"4",149,"AND",65,2010," It is certainly a great opportunity for the Principality of Andorra and the Government I represent to address the Assembly. The United Nations is the forum that  true to its origins  today represents the greatest source of hope for many people  countries and Governments.  In Andorra  we are aware of what being a small Member country of the United Nations involves — that is  a determination to engage in cooperation  hard work and honest efforts. The world is the sum of our possibilities and our efforts  and of the aspirations of each of us.  The world in the twenty-first century is neither better nor worse; it has the same defects  contrasts and virtues as in earlier centuries  but the rules of play are more dynamic. Thanks to new technology and social networks  citizens now have greater weight than in earlier times in alerting and motivating the political and economic leaders and seeing that they remain active.  Despite all that  today we live in a world of patent contrasts  where hunger continues to be one of our worst evils. More than a billion people suffer from malnutrition and poverty. The consequences of the food  environmental and economic crises have compounded the situation of the most vulnerable populations.  During the World Summit on Food Security in Rome last November  we decided to adopt measures to halve by 2015 the number of people suffering from malnutrition and hunger  combining all possible efforts to achieve the first of the Millennium Development Goals. In the Group of 20 (G20) meeting in Toronto  the Secretary-General defended the position of the most vulnerable populations and asked the 20 leading world Powers to develop new policies for combating poverty.  The struggle to combat climate change  however  is still unresolved. The natural disasters that the people of Haiti and Pakistan have had to deal with show how devastating the effects of climate change can be. It is a phenomenon that jeopardizes the poorest populations  affects access to water  compounds malnutrition and leads to violence. The economic impact on developing States is terrible.  While the threats are real  the solutions are real too. The possibility of dealing with them exists. During the Copenhagen Conference  the States parties to the Climate Change Convention initiated negotiations for an agreement. We hope that at the Conference on Climate Change to be held in Cancún in December  an effective and scientifically ambitious text will be adopted that will make it possible to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Andorra is engaging in activities aimed at combating climate change  particularly water treatment and reduction of substances that deplete the ozone layer. In the next few months our Government also plans to approve ratification of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  It is clear is that the current crisis is forcing us to rethink the structures of the global financial system to make it more equitable  more ethical and at the same time more sound  in order to ensure that world leaders’   13 10-55128  aspirations can — little by little  but more each time — converge and agree on what the most vulnerable peoples  countries and democracies truly need.  Andorra has succeeded in moving off the Grey List of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  thanks to the signing  between September 2009 and February 2010  of 17 bilateral agreements on the exchange of tax information. Our firm commitment to the recommendations of OECD and the international community as a whole  as expressed at the G20 meetings  has laid the foundations for our business structure and boosted confidence in Andorra’s financial sector.  We wish to move forward on the road to transparency and international cooperation in combating tax fraud. We therefore believe that a permanent European mechanism for financial stability should be established  as well as very strict regulation of the products known as derivatives. It would also be desirable to create a European agency to rate the solvency of the financial activities and of its administrations.  We also wish to continue to work  from a perspective of respect  in an Organization such as the United Nations  reformed and consolidated  able to help the international community to move forward at this stage of its history  avoiding any exacerbation of the inequalities that fuel violence and hatred.  We therefore need to promote an international definition of minimum social guarantees for all mankind. Andorra firmly believes that the United Nations can ensure the necessary equilibrium  respect for all States — regardless of their economic  political or military power — and the application of international law. The United Nations Charter urges Member States to apply tolerance and to combine their efforts to maintain international peace and security — in short  to ensure that the aspirations and needs of all coincide.  In the last 65 years  the United Nations has taken many actions to promote disarmament  development and the rule of law and democratic practices  and it continues to do so. The Organization and its Member States have been supported by non-governmental organizations and grass-roots movements  which have worked to ensure that the tragic experiences of the twentieth century are not repeated.  One of the features of my country is that we have no army. For more than 700 years Andorra has lived in peace  without a single armed conflict. Today  determined to show our international commitment to disarmament  Andorra intends very soon to ratify the Convention on Cluster Munitions.  Let us remember that the founding principles of our Organization are equality  the defence of human rights and the prohibition of any form of discrimination.  The Human Rights Council is the principal forum for the discussion of the defence of human rights. Thanks to the Universal Periodic Review  all Member States are subject to a unique exercise in dialogue  which encourages us to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. This process is proving to be effective  but there are still a number of challenges to overcome. Andorra will undergo this review for the first time in the coming month of November.  To mark the twentieth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child  Andorran civil society and  in particular  the Andorra National Committee for UNICEF have carried out many activities jointly with Andorran institutions to raise awareness of that text and educate the population on the importance of defending the rights of the child.  Combating violence against women is one of the priorities of the Government that I represent. On  14 April this year  we created the Secretariat for Equality and Welfare  with the objective of coordinating the range of actions aimed at promoting the status of women and establishing new policies in the area of gender. This year  we are celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration and Platform for Action at the Fourth Conference on Women  held in Beijing.  During the March 2010 session of the Commission on the Status of Women  we recognized that women have an essential role to play in promoting broad and sustainable socio-economic development. Progress has been made on improving the status of women  but  unfortunately  it is not enough. We must continue promoting the rights of women and fighting domestic violence.  According to a report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)  the most profitable illegal activity in Europe is human    10-55128 14  trafficking. Eighty-four per cent of the victims of human trafficking in Europe have been enslaved for the purposes of sexual exploitation. It is important to focus on that issue from the perspective of protecting victims  which will certainly be integrated into the development of the United Nations Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons  adopted on 30 July 2010 (resolution 64/293).  Over the coming months  Andorra will ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings  which is a compelling demonstration of our State’s international commitment to this fight and of our will to support international instruments aimed at protecting human rights and preserving the fundamental values of our democratic societies.  The Government that I represent commends the recent decision by the United Nations to create the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). I wish this new body the greatest success; it can count on the full support of my country  and we will work in solidarity with Michelle Bachelet.  At present  we are all experiencing a profound global economic crisis  which threatens the European model of society. This crisis is also cultural and affects values such as solidarity.  As we celebrate 2010 as the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures  we have the opportunity to remember the relevance of cultural diversity. Learning about others  tolerance and respect for human rights and human dignity are the ingredients needed to build a harmonious and peaceful society.  Perhaps as a result of the small size of Andorra  or of its geographical surroundings — abrupt and extremely beautiful — in the Pyrenees  we have been able to develop natural and strong human relationships  through which our attachment  commitment or disagreement with all people is shown sincerely  without filters and without doublespeak. Therefore  when large-scale natural disasters  humanitarian crises or international emergencies occur  Andorra responds  and it does so sincerely  with voluntary contributions commensurate with international norms and additional contributions when called for by the situation. Andorra  in accordance with its national budget  is always present and always does its part. Based on this solidarity  we support and promote international development cooperation  and our country has a number of non-governmental organizations that devote vigorous efforts to working in this area.  The challenges we are forced to face are numerous. We have the good fortune of being able to work together in order to overcome them. It is indeed a great responsibility  but it is also a great opportunity. It is an opportunity to come up with solutions that meet the needs of those worst off.  In conclusion  I should like to wish you  Sir  the best of luck and the greatest of success over the coming year. I am convinced that you will make great progress towards improving the individual and collective impact of our Organization."
"5",194,"ARE",65,2010,"At the outset  I congratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We are confident that your expertise in international affairs will enable you to wisely and capably guide the work of the General Assembly  and we wish you every success in your endeavours.  I would also like to thank your predecessor  Mr. Ali Treki  for his successful leadership of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  and to thank Mr. Ban Ki-moon  the Secretary-General  for his great efforts to re-energize the role of this international Organization in promoting world peace and security and development.  The international community continues to face daunting challenges that demand strengthened collective action  increased joint international efforts in the United Nations framework and a serious move towards reform of its organs in a responsible and balanced manner  in order to enable the United Nations effectively to play its primary role in addressing the major challenges facing the international community.  My Government wishes to reiterate in this forum its deep regret at the continued Iranian occupation of our three islands: Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa. It demands the return of the islands  including their regional waters  airspace  continental shelf and exclusive economic zone  to its full sovereignty as integral parts of the United Arab Emirates. All procedures and measures taken by the Iranian authorities since their occupation of the islands are null and void and have no legal effect  no matter how long the occupation may last.  We look forward to seeing the Iraqi parties form a national Government that continues to build its security  political and economic institutions  extend its authority over the entire territory of Iraq and achieve a comprehensive national reconciliation  which is the real guarantee for stabilizing the political process in Iraq and embracing all factions of Iraqi society  with no exception or discrimination.  While we note with satisfaction the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq  we express our firm condemnation of all acts of violence and bombings that have targeted the Iraqi people. In this context  we reiterate the need to respect Iraq’s territorial integrity  sovereignty and independence  and to refrain from interfering in its internal affairs  in order to safeguard its Arab and Islamic identity.  The United Arab Emirates believes that peace in the Middle East and resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict cannot be achieved without ending the Israeli occupation of the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories. Israel’s withdrawal to the line of 4 June 1967  including East Jerusalem  the Syrian Golan Heights and the remaining occupied territories in southern Lebanon  is also required in order to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy  and based on the principle of land for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative.  The United Arab Emirates stands by the Palestinian National Authority  and supports the Palestinian people in their quest to achieve their national goals and restore their inalienable legitimate rights. We commend President Mahmoud Abbas for his persistent efforts to realize the interests of the Palestinian people and restore their rights.  We affirm our support for the position adopted by the Palestinian National Authority in the direct negotiations with the Israeli. We hope that the independent Palestinian State  with its capital Al-Quds Al-Sharif  will see the light of day next year.   We welcome the statement of Mr. Barack Obama  President of the United States  to the General Assembly  and his strong commitment to the achievement of peace in the Middle East. We also welcome his emphasis on the importance of leading direct negotiations into final results within a year  and seeing Palestine take its seat   13 10-55276  in the General Assembly at the sixty-sixth session. In this context  we rely on an effective American role  and active regional and international support for the peace process in the Middle East.  Our commitment to the achievement of peace as a strategic choice means that we must condemn the Israeli practices against the Palestinian people  including the collective punishment policy and the inhumane blockade imposed on the Palestinian people in Gaza. We also condemn other flagrant Israeli violations of international law and of the principles and purposes of the Charter.   In that connection  we emphasize that the continuation of the Israeli settlement activities  confiscation and Judaization of the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories run counter to the pursuit of peace. We say to Israel: Either choose to pursue peace or insist on pressing ahead with settlements. Combining the two is incompatible with peace.  The United Arab Emirates will continue to pursue its international policy guided by the purposes of the United Nations and the principles of its Charter  especially with regard to the promotion of international peace and security  the peaceful resolution of international disputes  non-interference in the internal affairs of States and compliance with the principles of international law.  We shall continue to make our distinct contributions to regional and international partnerships aimed at building a more peaceful  stable and just world  free of all forms of terrorism  violence  extremism  crime  discrimination  human rights violations  human trafficking  and any sort of humiliation or degradation of human dignity. We look forward to a world that promotes the principles of dialogue  interaction  mutual understanding  cooperation and interactive civilized coexistence among all religions and cultures  without any form of discrimination  the use of stereotypical images  hatred or denigration of religions: a world characterized by human peace  prosperity and development.  On that basis  we condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations  wherever it exists  and stress the need to intensify regional and international efforts to combat and eliminate terrorism.  My country is an active member of regional and international partnerships and efforts designed to combat terrorism  including the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. We will continue our efforts to strengthen cooperation in the areas of intelligence exchange  capacity-building  combating and drying up sources of terrorism. We expect all other States to shoulder their responsibilities in order to get rid of this growing scourge.  In the meantime  we welcome the positive results of the West Point conference on combating terrorism  and look forward to the success of the next conference  to be held in the Republic of Korea.  As part of our efforts to strengthen international cooperation in addressing the challenges of climate change  and in order to assist States most at risk from the adverse effects of that phenomenon  we have initiated a partnership programme with the Pacific small island developing States  and we call upon the international community to support and expand the partnership at the global level. It is our hope that States parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change will achieve concrete results before the forthcoming Conference in Mexico.  We are pleased to see that the accord establishing the International Renewable Energy Agency has entered into force after ratification by the required number of States. In its capacity as host country  the United Arab Emirates continues to carry out its commitments to the Agency in order to enable it to perform its duties effectively.  My Government is moving forward with its peaceful nuclear energy programme. At the same time  it wishes to emphasize its commitment to all the requirements of nuclear non-proliferation and its compliance with the highest standards of transparency and nuclear safety. The United Arab Emirates has ratified the Additional Protocol to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In this context  we wish to express our satisfaction at the positive outcome of the recent Review Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty. We look forward to the implementation of the responsible and valid recommendations agreed in the Final Document of the Conference.  The United Arab Emirates is working on protecting the various aspects of human rights  and welcomes the establishment of a new international entity on women in the United Nations  UN Women  and the appointment of the Under-Secretary-General    10-55276 14  for Women’s Affairs. We are implementing various national programmes to empower women  enhance their participation in the decision-making process  and developing their status.  We attach great importance to the issue of human trafficking. We have therefore enacted legislation and developed national mechanisms compatible with our obligations under relevant international conventions and resolutions. We call upon the international community to develop an integrated global strategy to eliminate this scourge.   We support the activities of the Alliance of Civilizations Forum  and welcome the fact that its fourth session is to be held in the brotherly State of Qatar next year. We also commend the endeavours of Qatar to make the interfaith dialogue conference a permanent institution. We welcome the decision of the Emir of Qatar to establish a centre for interfaith dialogue in Doha.   We hope that our deliberations during this session will lead to positive results."
"6",241,"ARG",65,2010,"Most of the speeches we have heard so far today and yesterday have had three main focuses. One of them  without a doubt  is the global economic crisis  its impact and evolution and how to overcome it. Climate change has been another focus. And  finally  the third fundamental and very important topic has been the maintenance of international peace and security.    10-54959 4   I believe that emerging countries  and Argentina in particular  have a wealth of experience to share in connection with these three topics  and that we need to take a position. With respect to the global crisis  whose impact has been felt in emerging countries despite the fact that it actually originated in developed countries  it must be pointed out that it was precisely the developing countries that supported the economic growth of the past decade and that will again reignite and sustain economic growth and activity and thus provide the means to overcome what is perhaps the most significant economic crisis since 1930. And Argentina  in this sense  was somewhat of a guinea pig for the policies of the 1990s  when it was held up as a model pupil while it was in reality ratcheting up unsustainable levels of debt  producing neither goods nor services  and actually experiencing a fall in job-creation  finally collapsing in 2001 in a financial crisis very similar to that which shook the world in the third quarter of 2008.  The ground fell out from beneath Argentina in 2001. However  through the policies we pursued from 2003 onwards  we have been able to overcome that crisis  which so closely resembled that which hit the world in 2008. And we did so through our own efforts and  crucially  with an economic and political strategy that was not dictated by demands from the multilateral credit institutions but was in line with our own convictions and  crucially  our own interests.  In the eight years leading up to this bicentennial year — this year  my country marks 200 years of freedom — we have achieved the most significant economic growth ever seen in our 200 years of history. We managed to emerge from debt in a way never before seen in our history. Since that sovereign default of 2001  which was the greatest such default in history  today Argentina has renegotiated 93 per cent of its total debt with Argentine debt title-holders. And  moreover  Argentina has achieved heretofore unknown inclusive growth in the past year  following our application of counter-cyclical measures throughout all of 2009 and in late 2008. We have experienced growth in economic activity of 9 per cent over the past 12 months. We brought the unemployment rate back down to 7.9 per cent. And we managed to continue reducing the rates of poverty and extreme poverty  which are now at levels never before seen in our country.  This is due essentially to counter-cyclical economic management and to an understanding that instruments such as the central bank  reserves  foreign trade  production  employment generation and better living standards  with a robust expansion in fiscal spending  are exactly what has meant that the crisis overwhelming developing countries has not had the same impact it would have had at other times.  In this context  I wish to point out that we have also promoted the intelligent use of our reserves  which is something currently under discussion in all multilateral bodies  in the world of economics and in the context of the Group of 20. We have used our reserves rationally because we believe that  in our case  they are the result of a trade surplus — that is to say  hard currency dollars — and should be applied to paying down the debt rather than putting them into capital markets  thereby resulting in double-digit debt while we would be paid only 0.5 per cent interest for our reserves. It would really have been senseless and irrational for our country to go into double-digit debt when in reality we had more than enough reserves  for which we would be paid barely 0.5 per cent.  What I am trying to say is that our experience in Argentina  as well as that of other emerging countries — which  I wish to reiterate once again  are shoring up economic growth — makes it incumbent upon the Group of 20  as well as the Group of 77  where we will also push for this  to carry out a rigorous reform of international credit agencies  which have failed in their fundamental purpose: to ensure a stable global economy that produces jobs and well-being for the inhabitants of the planet.  In that regard  we believe that it is truly urgent for there to be global legislation in the area of vulture funds  which basically move from one area of the country to another in genuinely speculative ways and have a pitiless impact on economies. We also believe that there is a need to evaluate and legislate on risk-rating agencies  which for instance rated Argentina’s debt as highly risky when it reality the Argentine Republic had been scrupulously paying its debt since the first renegotiation  in 2005  without turning to capital markets. Nevertheless  they have given much higher rankings to countries that subsequently demonstrated that they did not have the capacity to address their debt because they had structural problems in their economies  such as fiscal deficits  commercial   5 10-54959  deficits and reserve outflows — precisely the opposite of what took place in Argentina.  We therefore believe in the need for global re-engineering of multilateral funds — essentially in a theoretical framework different from the one that the world has experienced  namely  the Washington Consensus. That Consensus has been exhausted by failure  but has not been replaced by a new theoretical framework that gives different roles to central banks  as well as to States as instruments to promote counter-cyclical fiscal measures that ensure something which  in our opinion  is a central concern: employment stability  rather than just currency stability.  We also sincerely believe that currencies should not be protected solely from a monetary perspective; on the contrary  we believe that the value of each country’s currency is directly linked to the potential for growth and wealth-generation capacity of each country’s economy. It is also linked to the equitable distribution of wealth  which should make societies sustainable through a model that is not just economic but also essentially political.  Climate change  which is very important and will soon be addressed at the Cancun meeting  has also been a central theme in all the interventions that have been made from this rostrum. While it is well and good to speak of that  we have not been able to reach an agreement because  in fact  we are not being offered a solution in this area that is just and equitable in terms of who  and to what degree  should bear primary responsibility for damage due to environmental pollution. It is not fair that developing countries — which  by paying a high price  have been able to overcome high levels of poverty and social inequality through economic growth — should be the ones that have to assume responsibility for the environmental legacy of developed countries  which for decades contaminated the world and which should therefore be the ones to shoulder this responsibility. Establishing viable targets and goals that are in line with the need to continue to grow the economy also require that we seriously realign our goals in the area of global warming.  With regard to the final focus  namely  building international peace and security  we sincerely believe that the resumption of dialogue between the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority is very good news indeed when it comes to finally achieving what I believe all of us have looked forward to for quite a long time: that the State of Palestine will be seated as a full member during the next session of the General Assembly. We believe that will make an enormous contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security. I say this by virtue of our experience as a country that has been a target and victim of international terrorist groups. As the Assembly is aware  in 1992 and 1994 my country was the victim of two terrible terrorist attacks. The first was the blowing up of the Israeli Embassy  and the second tragedy was the bombing of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA).  In that regard  in 2007  my country’s then President  Néstor Kirchner  requested the Islamic Republic of Iran to agree to the extradition of Iranian citizens whom the Argentine justice system had accused of participation in carrying out that heinous crime. I did the same as President in 2008 and 2009 — to little effect  I must confess. I did so while emphasizing that mine is a leading country in respecting human rights and bringing to justice those who commit crimes against humanity. I have also underscored that we have a system that ensures due process and the right to counsel and that does not permit anyone to be tried or convicted in absentia. It is for those reasons that we continue to make this request for extradition. We have also emphasized that for any Argentine citizens who believe that our country’s justice system is not fair enough or does not enforce the law  we are party to international conventions to which they can turn  including such international tribunals as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Despite the fact that we have guaranteed that all these principles will continue to be respected in the Argentine Republic  we have not yet achieved results.  I shall not on this occasion call for the fourth time for something that will clearly not achieve results. But I will propose to the Islamic Republic of Iran — even if it has no faith in Argentine justice  as it has said  because of prejudgement and insufficient neutrality to carry out a trial — that a third country be selected  through mutual agreement between our countries  in which there are guarantees of due process and where international observers and United Nations representatives may participate to bring to trial the terrible attack on AMIA in our country. I should also like to say that we do not consider that attack as an    10-54959 6  attack on one community or one religion. For us  it was an attack on all Argentines.  I am President of a country where we can celebrate the Jewish New Year with the Jewish community  as I did this year in my capacity as leader of the country. We also celebrated the end of Ramadan at an Islamic centre. We are a country of open-mindedness because of our immigrant heritage  which guarantees plurality and diversity for all.  There is a precedent for what we are proposing. This precedent is not a capricious or fantastical legal construction; it is the Lockerbie case. That is an international precedent of a trial held in a third neutral country that could provide guarantees for those who fear they might not be judged impartially. In this connection  I would like to clarify that the Argentine Republic is not seeking guilty parties. All the Argentine Government seeks is justice. Ultimately  anyone who has committed a crime of such magnitude should be punished.   Thus  we hope that the offer I make to the Islamic Republic of Iran today before the General Assembly will put an end to the pretext of non-neutrality and to accusations of our complicity in withholding impartial justice. I address this in particular to those who insist that there can be no impartial justice. I believe that this eloquent gesture has international precedents and will allow us to resolve this situation and to channel this dispute institutionally. We must do this if we wish to feel truly part of the international community. We must resolve this dispute in a framework of justice and legality.  Finally  again in connection with security concerns  we must once again  here in this Assembly  demand respect for our sovereign rights over the Malvinas Islands. We do not do so solely for historical reasons. Our claim is absolutely up to date. The United Kingdom has systematically refused to implement universally binding General Assembly resolutions calling for negotiations with the Argentine Republic on the question of sovereignty.   But that is not all. Unilateral decisions have been taken to exploit hydrocarbon resources on the islands. There are two aspects to this exploitation. The first is that it constitutes depredation of natural resources that belong to us. It is unthinkable that territorial  historical or legal sovereignty can be maintained over islands that are 14 000 kilometres from the United Kingdom and whose transplanted population sits on a continental shelf that unquestionably belongs to the Argentine Republic geographically  geologically and historically.   The second aspect is the risk of ecological catastrophe. British Petroleum  operating off the coast of the United States in the Gulf of Mexico  set off an unprecedented ecological catastrophe. The lack of oversight by our country or any other over what the United Kingdom is doing in the Malvinas Islands has mobilized us not only to defend the natural resources of my country  but to seek to avert an ecological catastrophe that could occur due to this total lack of oversight.   Some may say that this has nothing to with security. It has a great deal to do with security  because one of the central problems of our globalized world is the need to adapt the Security Council to our times. We need a Security Council worthy of its name. England  like other countries that have a permanent seat on the Council  has used and misused its position. Resolutions of the Council are applicable only to those countries that do not have sufficient power or the right to a permanent seat on the Council. The Council should be reformed because it has never been able to maintain international peace and security.  That is not simply because some seats are permanent or because the world context has changed since the San Francisco Charter created the Security Council. The Security Council  with its permanent members  was a Security Council where those who were seated could  by pressing a red button  cause a nuclear holocaust. That was the true reason for creating a Council that could strike a balance between the interests of a bipolar world and prevent a nuclear holocaust.  That world no longer exists. Those who were once irreconcilable enemies and rivals are now associates  allies  friends or whatever anyone might care to call them. What is certain is that those who can unleash terrible conflict situations  tragedies and international terrorism are not and never will be seated there. Thus  the Security Council has lost its effectiveness because it is not in line with today’s world or the dangers besetting it. Quite the contrary  the use and misuse of their dominant position by members of the Council in certain countries have provoked conflicts that cannot then be stifled by the Council  much less by the Organization.   7 10-54959   We believe that the case of the Malvinas Islands is very enlightening. The United Kingdom can do as it likes because no one is compelling it to implement the decisions of the Security Council  because it is a permanent member and an important member of NATO. In a world of double standards — where only the developing and extremely weak countries are compelled to abide by the international legal order while those who can systematically violate it do so — it is not possible to build peace  let alone maintain international security  because such situations end up creating the kind of insurmountable disputes and differences we see every day.  I believe it important to note that the concepts of security and peace can never be associated with military matters alone. They must be essentially associated with political values  equity  freedom and a cause for which humankind has fought from the beginning: equality."
"7",266,"ARM",65,2010,"Each year  the great family of nations comes together to assess what the Organization has achieved and to consider together ways to respond to the problems facing the world and to acknowledge what unites our nations and what still divides them.  For 65 years  the General Assembly has carried out this both difficult and noble mission. That mission was summarized very well by the first speaker at the first session of the General Assembly  on 10 January 1946  as the maintenance of peace and security and the establishment  through cooperation  of those conditions of stability and well-being which will ensure peaceful and friendly relations  based on the principle of equal rights and self-determination among the nations of the world.  Since then  the General Assembly has changed. The number of Members has almost quadrupled  major decisions have been made  historic documents have been adopted  old problems have given way to new  and the scope of responsibilities of the General Assembly has greatly increased as it has opened itself to new challenges in international security  non-proliferation  disarmament  respect for human rights  poverty  terrorism  global warming  the financial crisis and many other issues.  In short  many things have changed  including the century.  Nevertheless and despite the developments that have marked recent decades  the situation in the region where Armenia is situated prompts me to return to that day  10 January 1946  which is so distant yet so close  given the objectives that were put forward then and which continue more than ever to underpin our actions.  How is it possible to maintain peace  security and stability when we keep raising defence spending and regularly threaten to use force and to start wars? How can we promote friendly and peaceful relations between peoples when we promote intolerance and hatred and impose blockades and closed borders? How can we assure the principle of the equal rights of peoples and their right to make their own decisions when we reject the fundamental principle of international law — the right of peoples to self-determination? I would like to hereby touch upon the conflict between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. The people of Nagorno-Karabakh exercised their right to self-determination two decades ago. They fought for their right to freedom  withstanding the brutal war unleashed by Azerbaijan  which had suppressed them for 70 years and attempted to cleanse them from their ancestral home. For that purpose  it even resorted to the use of mercenaries closely linked to international terrorist organizations. The people of Nagorno-Karabakh had to pursue their right to self-determination as they were being denied their right to existence.  The right of peoples to self-determination is a fundamental and indispensable right enshrined in the   29 10-55109  Charter of the United Nations. The advisory opinion issued by the International Court of Justice in July reaffirmed the wisdom of the founders of this Organization  who made sure that one of the fundamental principles for maintaining peace and stability in the world — the right of peoples to self-determination — could not be underrated in any way compared with the other principles of international law.  Let us be realistic. One cannot say each and every time that this is the last self-determination case. No one is able to stop the progress of history; otherwise  there would not be 192 Member States in this Organization instead of 51  as there were at the time of its founding.  The Nagorno-Karabakh peace process moves forward with the internationally mandated mediation of the Co-Chairs of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group  who continue their persistent efforts aimed at the peaceful settlement of the conflict based on the fundamental principles of international law: the non-use of force or threat of force  the equal rights and self-determination of peoples and territorial integrity.  On 17 July  at the margins of the OSCE informal ministerial meeting in Almaty  the Minsk Group Co-Chairs issued a statement in which they reiterated that the proposed principles and elements have been conceived as an integrated whole and that any attempt to select some of them over others would make it impossible to achieve a balanced solution. Armenia fully shares this vision and will continue the negotiations on that basis in search of a peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.  Unfortunately  Azerbaijan rejects two of the three principles mentioned and is attempting not only to turn upside down the essence of the negotiation process  but also to distort the nature of the conflict in various international forums  including the General Assembly  as happened here about two weeks ago and again two days ago. That country is attempting to mislead the international community  presenting the consequences of the conflict as its causes.  Azerbaijan’s unabated war rhetoric  growing violations of the ceasefire regime  and unprecedented military budget increases only exacerbate the situation  raising concerns about the already fragile stability in the region. Azerbaijan continues to reject proposals to come to an agreement on the non-use of force or threat of force  as well as calls for the consolidation of the ceasefire. Azerbaijan’s attitude thus represents a threat to regional peace and security. The money it derives from oil revenues is being directed at funding new military ventures. We all know the potential results of such adventurism.  Azerbaijan should refrain from its continuing attempts to remove the settlement process from the Minsk Group format and framework and from making provocative and bellicose statements and actions  in order that the negotiation process may proceed more constructively and effectively.  In an era when the protection and promotion of human rights are considered essential in the civilized world  intolerance for the values of others and acts that intentionally  consistently and repeatedly damage or destroy the cultural or religious heritage of other civilizations must be condemned with the same resolve and determination as violence against people.  The destruction by Azerbaijanis between 1998 and 2005 in Nakhichevan of thousands of cross-stones delicately carved by Armenian masters in the ninth to the sixteenth centuries is a vivid example of such a crime. Under the Azerbaijani Government’s watchful eye  thousands of these gigantic medieval sculptures were bulldozed and the area turned into a military zone in a Government-sanctioned operation. A resolution at the sixteenth General Assembly of the International Council on Monuments and Sites stated regretfully with regard to this act of vandalism: “… this heritage that once enjoyed its worthy place among the treasures of the world’s heritage can no longer be transmitted today to future generations”.  Armenia’s initiative for the normalization of relations with Turkey without any preconditions was fully supported by the international community. Last year  after intensive negotiations  we achieved agreement and finally signed the Armenian-Turkish protocols. We made a confident investment in a durable rapprochement  while Turkey  unfortunately  backtracked from its commitments and not only refrained from ratifying the signed protocols  but returned to its initial language of preconditions. Consequently  the Armenian-Turkish border continues to remain the only closed border in Europe. Good intentions must be proved in deeds  not just words. Armenia is ready to move forward when Turkey will    10-55109 30  once again be prepared to normalize relations without preconditions.  While we are discussing all possible ways to create a more prosperous and safer world for our peoples  we would be remiss if we did not speak about the responsibility to protect. As a nation we survived the most heinous crime against humanity  genocide  95 years ago. We attach the utmost importance to furthering all international efforts aimed at the prevention of genocide and crimes against humanity. It is encouraging that further discussions of the Secretary-General’s report on early warning  assessment and the responsibility to protect (A/64/864) are being held in the General Assembly. This will enable us come up with a formula that will allow us to act in a timely and coherent manner  utilizing all the United Nations system resources and capabilities for early warning  assessment and prevention of situations that could lead to genocide  war crimes or crimes against humanity.  To bolster United Nations capacity to deal with current challenges and those ahead  we need to increase our efforts to further the process of United Nations reform  making more efficient and effective use of existing resources  making the “One United Nations” policy work  and better utilizing regional capacities to complement our global actions.  Today  the world is evolving faster than ever. To meet security  political  economic  social  environmental and other challenges we simply have to put our efforts  resources  and political determination together to deal with them and move the international development agenda forward."
"8",299,"ATG",65,2010,"Let me at the outset commend you  Sir  on your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I pledge my delegation’s support for your efforts to successfully move forward the agenda of this session. I also wish to commend your predecessor  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  for his stewardship  and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership of the Secretariat.  Your choice of theme for our general debate —”Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance” — is both appropriate and timely. After 65 years of operations  there is sufficient history to provide material for objective review and enough future to justify such a rigorous assessment.    10-55128 8   In my own view  arising from the many successes of the United Nations in a wide range of areas  one of the most enduring lessons the past 65 years have taught us as a global community is the wisdom and supremacy of multilateralism. Even where multilateralism has failed to secure lasting solutions to some of the world’s problems  it has laid unshakable foundations on which bilateral understanding can be built.  The resolution of the conflict in the Middle East  for example  has long eluded the international community. This is why we are hopeful with regard to the latest efforts at peaceful negotiations between Israel and Palestine being brokered by the current United States Administration. If there is to be lasting peace in the Middle East  there must be two States  Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace and security. There must be direct negotiations with both parties  Israel and Palestine  at the same table. Israel must heed the international community’s unanimous call to extend the moratorium on disputed settlements  which would contribute positively to the negotiations. And all the countries of that region must commit to and work towards a lasting and durable Middle East peace.  Today  global governance relates not only to concerns about peace  security and political self-determination. Importantly  global governance embraces such imperatives as the elimination of hunger  disease and ignorance; administering a stable and robust international financial system; and ensuring fair trade  adequate shelter and the preservation of our very delicate environment.  Never in the history of human existence has our planet been faced with a greater urgency to meet these objectives. The scale of poverty  conflicts  global warming  the economic and financial crisis  migration  pandemics  terrorism and international crime demands a collective global effort employing common and coordinated strategies. The extent of these problems and the enormity of their consequences are clearly beyond the resource and management capabilities of any one nation.  I believe that our United Nations  with its near universal membership  is the only global body that has the legitimacy and operational structures to undertake the task of forging the necessary political and economic consensus to effectively tackle these problems.  A mere three years ago  we heads of Government described climate change as the defining challenge of our era. Three years on it remains so  especially for those countries that are particularly vulnerable. And yet we hear from some who have a responsibility to act that they will only do so when others have taken action. While everybody waits for somebody else to act  the peoples of the world are made to suffer.  If ever a challenge requires an urgent global solution  this one does. Small island developing States such as Antigua and Barbuda face a unique set of vulnerabilities related to our small size: relative isolation  narrow resource base and high exposure to global environmental threats. To compound this  over the last five years we have suffered disproportionately from the financial  food and energy crises. Our economies have been battered and many of our productive sectors wiped out.  But the hardship that has ensued for our people from all this  will pale into insignificance  if the international community does not quickly address the looming threat of climate change  which is already having a devastating impact all over the world. We  the small island developing States  have already experienced loss of agricultural land and infrastructure — so too have many countries in Africa.  Our fishing and tourism industries are being impacted negatively. There has been considerable loss of our biodiversity  saltwater intrusion and devastation of terrestrial and wetland habitats and the destruction of human settlements. Even the once-distant threat of rising sea-level is now a reality  forcing some of our people to emigrate and rebuild their lives elsewhere.  The most notable action  so far  has been repeated promises of abundant financing to address the most urgent problems. Sadly  most of these remain just that: promises. There are too many commitments to undertake aggressive greenhouse gas emissions reductions with the caveat of “only if others do so as well”. This approach has created a dangerous stalemate that can only be to the further detriment of small island developing States  such as my own.  Not willing to allow this dangerous situation to continue forever  my own country of Antigua and Barbuda has pledged to reduce its already miniscule greenhouse gas emissions by 25 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020.   9 10-55128   This is within the range specified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  which has recommended that overall reductions should be within the range of 25 per cent to 40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020. We have also declared that we will work towards making Antigua and Barbuda a green economy by 2020.  However  much remains to be done  and we are painfully aware that we cannot do it alone. I therefore call on all countries  both developed and developing  to join us in this endeavour by announcing real  meaningful emission reductions targets  so that we can move this seemingly endless debate forward and reach a comprehensive  binding agreement in the very near future.  The year 2010 has not been without its share of catastrophes. The year began with a devastating earthquake in Haiti — one of the worst disasters in history. The death toll has been put at some 220 000 out of a population of around 9 million. The earthquake has been estimated to cost $8 to $14 billion  according to the Inter-American Development Bank. Against this backdrop  many countries pledged assistance — up to $1.5 billion. Sadly  only 10 per cent of the amount pledged has been received by Haiti. In the midst of these unfulfilled commitments  the humanitarian needs of our sister island remain dire.  Since charity begins at home  we  the member States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  of which Haiti is a member  have been contributing within our very limited capacity our fair share of assistance to Haiti  including direct budgetary support. I call on those nations that pledged assistance to Haiti  to honour their commitments. Those pledges are needed urgently  now that the rebuilding phase is getting under way in that devastated country.  In Chile  a huge earthquake moved the city of Concepción at least 10 feet  or 3 metres  to the west. Between 500 and 700 persons were killed. Total recovery costs could exceed $15 billion. In the People’s Republic of China  a series of snowstorms and freezing weather have affected the western region of the country since December 2009. The storms have affected millions and resulted in 30 deaths. This year alone  severe flooding and a major earthquake killed hundreds of people and rendered thousands more homeless.  In Pakistan  devastating floods have resulted in over 1 600 deaths and more than 6 million people have been affected. That country has sought international assistance to cope with the catastrophe. Despite mass evacuations  there are fears that the death toll will rise as flooding reaches the southern parts of the country and the risk of an outbreak of waterborne diseases increases in many areas. These disasters and their aftermaths serve to reaffirm the need to ensure that addressing the humanitarian consequences of today’s disasters and emergencies remains a United Nations priority. And those countries in a position to do so should pledge their support to assist Pakistan and to honour their pledges.  Antigua and Barbuda continues to commiserate with the Governments and people of these and other nations  who have been affected by natural and other disasters.  In my region of Latin America and the Caribbean  our Governments are taking bold steps to overcome some of our inherent economic and social vulnerabilities by forging economic partnerships designed to help lift our people out of poverty. The Single Market and Economy being developed at the level of the 15-member Caribbean Community is one such valiant initiative.  At the subregional level of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)  economic integration is proceeding at an even more rapid pace with our commitment to creating an economic union by next year.  Both the CARICOM Single Market and Economy  as well as the OECS Economic Union  are enormous undertakings by small island nations with very limited resources. We therefore invite the support of our development partners to assist us with the technical and financial resources necessary to move these economic initiatives forward. The leaders of our region see the building of strong economic alliances as being vital to the creation of wealth and prosperity for our people.  We are convinced that the capacity of our national Governments to deliver critical social services for our populations can be improved through greater economic and technical cooperation at the regional level. It is for that reason  and with the interest of our people in mind  that the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean agreed at our meeting in Mexico earlier    10-55128 10  this year to create the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  which will unite members of the Rio Group and the Caribbean Community. This Community of nations will coexist with the Organization of American States  in which we participate along with our North American partners.  The economic challenges facing all the people of our hemisphere are too many and their implications too great for us to contemplate the creation of any economic community of Latin America and the Caribbean that excludes any one country of our region. It is in that spirit that Cuba remains  and will always remain  a vibrant participant in any broad economic arrangement for Latin America and the Caribbean.  We may not all share similar political views and political systems. However  the right of all the people of Latin America and the Caribbean to an equal chance at survival  economic development and social advancement is absolute and non-negotiable. For that reason  the Governments and the people of Latin America and the Caribbean continue to regard as unjust  counterproductive and reprehensible the maintenance of the ongoing economic embargo against Cuba. As a political strategy or economic manoeuvre  that act of economic strangulation is unjustifiable. We condemn the embargo in the strongest possible terms  as its continued enforcement by the United States severely hampers the development of Cuba and its people.  Antigua and Barbuda therefore reiterates its call for the United States to immediately end its economic embargo against the Cuban people.  More than 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall  democracy has emerged as the preferred form of government all over the world. And people everywhere have strongly opposed attempts to seize Governments — any Government — through undemocratic means. Such attempts  whenever and wherever they occur  must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. We therefore condemn the undemocratic moves such as the recent coup d’état in Honduras and call for the unconditional return of former President Zelaya without harm to his physical person. That is a sine qua non for the full normalization of relations between Honduras and most of the countries of the region.  As I said in my statement during the review of the Millennium Development Goals (see )  a renewed emphasis on trade is a critical pillar on which developing countries are seeking to rescue their battered economies and lift their people out of poverty. In that respect  it is essential that all participants in the global trading system  including our partners in the developed countries  adhere to their international obligations. If that is not done  the people of our small developing countries  despite the encouragement of their leaders  will have no faith in the international system. They will have no reason to believe that the multilateral system is just and that it works for them in the same way it does for large  powerful  developed nations.  The non-resolution of the ongoing gaming matter within the World Trade Organization (WTO)  despite repeated rulings in favour of Antigua and Barbuda by the Dispute Settlement Body of WTO  is a case in point. Let us not forget that  like the United Nations  WTO and other bodies such as the Bretton Woods institutions are essential elements of the multilateral system and vital pillars of the accepted architecture of global governance. In the spirit of preserving that vital architecture of global governance  Antigua and Barbuda reiterates its call for our friend and partner  the United States  to work with us to quickly resolve the situation and reach a settlement that is fair and just to both parties.  Trade is a critical engine of economic growth. If for no other reason but that  we must complete the Doha Round of trade negotiations so as to ensure a balanced outcome. Now more than ever  after some 10 years in the making  Doha must lead to economic expansion  development in the poorest countries  and an end to distorting subsidies and protectionist barriers.  A number of the countries classified as middle- and upper-middle-income countries are in dire need of substantial amounts of debt relief in order to create fiscal space for spending targeted towards their development. Many of those countries now have debt-servicing obligations that are comparable in size to their gross national product or  in some cases  dwarf the value of their total output. For them — my own country included — the need for urgent debt relief is a top priority.  For many of those countries the debt distress has been caused by global crises not of their making. The global financial and economic tsunami  the likes of which has not been seen since 1929  has impacted negatively on every sphere of life for about 90 per cent   11 10-55128  of humankind. In some instances  entire national economies collapsed and commercial and private sectors have been decimated. For some  the downward spiral has no end in sight. Many countries are struggling to maintain a minimal level of normalcy. For others  attempting to stave off financial collapse  the social upheaval and chaos are unravelling the very fabric of modern societies and jeopardizing sanity  sovereignty  independence  and the dignity and pride of their people.  The effects of the global financial and economic crisis on the larger territories of the Caribbean Community are evident in their economic  fiscal and social statistical data. For the smaller territories of the Eastern Caribbean  the situation is even more devastating. Permit me to relate the facts pertaining to my own country  Antigua and Barbuda.  In addition to the direct and indirect impact that the global economic contagion has had on our economy  we have had to endure the collapse of two of the leading insurance companies  which not only held normal policies but also annuities and life savings for individuals  as well as large cash investments for national statutory corporations totalling approximately $150 million. At the same time  the leading private-sector employer and second largest employer in the nation after the Government has collapsed.  All that was added to a financial sector that has been suffering from a sustained campaign by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to reduce competition in taxation  an area into which we had diversified our economy  which was previously dependent almost entirely on tourism. That action by OECD resulted in the loss of hundreds of the most lucrative jobs and an estimated loss of hundreds of millions in direct revenue to our economy.  We note the recent removal of Antigua and Barbuda from the so-called Grey List. Our current listing among the countries that have substantially implemented internationally agreed taxation standards is a belated recognition of the steps taken by the current Government of Antigua and Barbuda  over several years  to be in full compliance with all international standards in this respect.  In the light of those realities of substantial revenue decline and severe economic dislocation  Antigua and Barbuda recently engaged the Paris Club in discussions on our country’s $133 million outstanding debt to that group of creditors. Our engagement with the Paris Club was assisted by a stand-by arrangement previously approved by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). We have reached an agreement by which some 90 per cent of that debt will be restructured. Our next step will be to enter bilateral negotiations with Paris Club member creditors.  With the economic challenges I have outlined  our efforts to meet human development needs are severely strained and challenged in unprecedented ways. That makes our attainment of the Millennium Development Goals  though possible  extremely difficult without a more realistic and flexible direct commitment from our development partners. I therefore call on the Group of Seven  the Group of 20  IMF and the World Bank  in their bilateral and multilateral commitments to the Caribbean  to give a more compassionate and favourable response to the New Arrangement to Borrow  with specific focus on the Group of 20 agreement of 2 April 2010. That agreement was to triple the fund’s lending capacity to $750 billion. This approach has already been taken with some other regions and nations. The institutions are being called on  too  to accord to our region consideration of broader and more comprehensive debt cancellation to spur economic revival and  in some cases  survival.  The General Assembly meets once again as the chief deliberative  policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations. We meet in this unique forum  which bestows equality on each of its 192 Members  in order to engage in multilateral discussions to advance the interests of all peoples of the world. But reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance cannot be done without due regard to the myriad challenges facing all its Members.  For us to achieve that reaffirmation — which most  if not all  of us believe is a very notable objective — I believe we must act now. I therefore call on the Assembly to develop at this session the modalities that will enable our nations to be able to resolve conflicts and promote peace and stability  foster a more prosperous world through balanced growth and prosperity among developed and developing countries  encourage all Member States to pursue a cleaner  greener  more sustainable world for our children  and create a safer world  free of nuclear weapons.    10-55128 12   The 65-year history of this noble institution establishes beyond a doubt that we can. And the future of our generation and generations of our peoples to come behoves us to embark on that mission with urgency and immediacy. "
"9",346,"AUS",65,2010,"This great body has been in existence for two thirds of a century — three times longer than its predecessor body  the League of Nations  and longer than previous attempts to fashion a continuing collective approach to the common problems of nation States. The question we must ask ourselves today is whether the United Nations remains effective in confronting the challenges of our time.  The United Nations was established in the grim aftermath of the two deadliest conflicts in human history  in which close to 80 million people were killed and entire families and almost entire generations lost for all time. The world came together out of necessity. There had to be a better way  and in the decades since we first met at San Francisco  we have managed to avoid another world war  although at times that seemed less than certain.  Today  we are faced with a different set of challenges and in different strategic  political and economic circumstances. We now live in a world that is more multipolar and more interconnected than ever before. We are confronted with the double-edged sword of globalization. The transformation of the global economy has increased living standards and lifted many hundreds of millions out of poverty.  At the same time  the increased interdependence of global financial markets ensured that no country connected to the world economy was spared the impact of the global financial crisis. Furthermore  the rapid transformation of global communications and the radical increase in global people movements have improved the well-being of all humankind. But equally  they have created or at least amplified a new set of security threats to all humankind: pandemic diseases  transnational organized crime and the continuing threat of global terrorism. There is also the global challenge of climate change. The unconstrained carbon emissions of one State impact on the long-term survival of all States. Climate change respects no national or geographic boundaries and thus simultaneously demands both national and integrated global responses.  So two thirds of a century after our formation  we the United Nations now face increasingly complex global challenges in an increasingly fragmented world and a much more contested international space. These new global realities create an imperative for responsive  representative and  most critically  effective systems of global governance.  If we fail to make the United Nations work and to make its institutions relevant to the great challenges we all now face  the uncomfortable fact is that the United Nations will become a hollow shell. Nation States may retain its form  but will increasingly seek to go around it and deploy other mechanisms to achieve real results.  And that is the question we all face today. It is a question of our collective political will to make the existing institutions work and combine the existing and unique legitimacy of the United Nations system with a new-found effectiveness on security  development and climate change.  The United Nations has most of the essential structures in place  but if the structures are to work we must harness the political will necessary to make them work. In other words  we must enable the institutions we have created to do the job for which they were created. Put even more starkly  we must do that which we say. If we have a Conference on Disarmament  it should do disarmament — not pretend. If we have a convention on climate change  it must do the job to tackle climate change — not just talk about it  and similarly with development. Otherwise  the credibility of the United Nations in the eyes of the world and our own citizens will eventually collapse. The international community can no longer tolerate the actions of a few dissenting States to roadblock the common resolve of the many.  The international community faces the continuing challenge of international terrorism. Terrorism knows no geographic or political boundaries. We are now in the tenth year since terrorists launched their murderous attack on this great city of New York. The threat of international terrorism remains alive. It continues to challenge civilized norms  to generate fear and insecurity  and to take innocent civilian lives in many parts of the world.   41 10-55103   The outlawing of terrorist organizations under the provisions of the relevant Security Council resolutions  together with the individual and cooperative measures taken by Member States  reflect the unprecedented levels of international collaboration in responding to the worldwide threat of terrorism.  As part of the effort to combat terrorism  many Member States have their armed forces and other personnel committed to Afghanistan  again sanctioned by Security Council resolutions. These brave soldiers  police officers and aid workers  representing so many of the countries represented here in the General Assembly  including Australia  remain in Afghanistan following many years of conflict.  The result is that Afghanistan no longer represents an unimpeded base for the global operations of terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaida. The result is also that we are all contributing to the security and stability of Afghanistan as a nation. This has been a difficult war  but our collective resolve is strong enough to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a base for the export of terrorism.  Beyond Afghanistan  terrorism continues to remain a threat to people of all faiths and civilizations. We must remain nationally and internationally vigilant against the possibility of further terrorist attacks. The threat remains real.  We must equally be concerned about the continued challenge of nuclear proliferation. Violations of the non-proliferation regime by States such as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran represent a potent and potential threat to us all. It is for this reason that Australia provides robust support to the United Nations sanctions regime against both the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran.  The United Nations has played a critical role in promoting the goal of a world without nuclear weapons. Non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament are mutually reinforcing processes and cannot be separated.  Australia’s activism on arms control and disarmament remains undiminished. And there remains much urgent work to be done. In 1996  Australia sponsored the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in this Assembly to ensure its adoption. Since then  182 States have signed the Treaty and 153 have ratified it. Nine more States are needed to ratify in order for the Treaty to enter into force. Australia welcomes recent statements by Indonesia and the United States concerning their intention to ratify the Treaty  and we would urge all States that to date have failed to indicate their intention to ratify the Treaty to do so in order to enable it to enter into force.  The most recent Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) Review Conference was held earlier this year. Australia and Japan worked closely together in the lead-up to the Conference  including through the jointly sponsored report of the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament (ICNND)  prepared by the former Foreign Minister of Australia  Gareth Evans  and his Japanese counterpart  Yoriko Kawaguchi. This significant report provided substantial momentum in the lead-up to the Review Conference. We believe that the Evans-Kawaguchi report of the ICNND also represents the most comprehensive  practical and contemporary blueprint for the international community to both consider and adopt a comprehensive arms control and non-proliferation agenda.  The Review Conference agreed by consensus on 64 sets of actions. And Australia and Japan took the initiative this week in New York to jointly host a cross-regional meeting of Foreign Ministers  with the aim of working towards the implementation of those 64 actions. The potential catastrophe of nuclear conflict means that the status quo is not an option. We must move ahead with the negotiation of a fissile material cut-off treaty  and we must ensure that the United Nations disarmament machinery is doing its job.  On the wider question of security  the Australian Government  under Prime Minister Gillard  warmly welcomes the statement to this Assembly by the President of the United States concerning his efforts to achieve a comprehensive  just and sustainable peace in the Middle East (see ). Australia’s position remains constant: such a settlement must allow both Israel and a future Palestinian State to live side by side in peace and security. Australia calls on all parties to put their shoulders to the wheel  to seize the historic opportunity that now presents itself to bring about a lasting peace. All States members of the General Assembly should welcome the prospect of both an Israeli and a Palestinian State being represented at the sixty-sixth session of the Assembly  to be held next year.    10-55103 42   Over the past several years  Australia has promoted the concept of an Asia-Pacific community involving the active membership in the future architecture of our region of both the United States and the Russian Federation. Australia therefore welcomes the imminent membership of the United States and Russia in the East Asia Summit. The East Asia Summit leaders will take this historic decision in Hanoi in October. Australia  as a founding member of the East Asia Summit  looks forward to contributing to the evolution of this wider sense of community across this  the most dynamic region of the world.  On questions of wider human security  Australia remains fully engaged on international and regional challenges  including irregular movements of people  organized crime and people-smuggling.  The most immediate and pressing threat to the physical security of Australia’s wider region lies in the scourge of natural disasters. The Asia-Pacific region has seen tsunamis  earthquakes  volcanoes and floods on a massive scale. Australia proposes that the international community consider afresh our capacity to respond rapidly  coherently and proportionately to large-scale natural disasters.  Within our own region  Australia argues that this would also represent an effective benefit to the peoples and countries of our region  which are particularly prone to natural disasters. It would also in time constitute a valuable confidence- and security-building measure among the armed forces  emergency services and security agencies of the various nation-States of the Asia Pacific. The magnitude of what I witnessed last week when I was in Pakistan underlines the importance of better planning  preparation and coordination to deal with natural disasters on a mass scale. We cannot afford simply to wait for another such disaster to occur before realizing that the resources of the United Nations and its agencies are simply incapable of meeting challenges of such an order of magnitude.  The challenges to global economic stability remain significant. The full impact of the global financial crisis is not yet clear. There are still systemic problems within the global financial system. These must be dealt with through the appropriate national and international institutions if we are to remove the underlying causes of the crisis that began in the United States in September 2008 and then proceeded to ravage the economies and the working people of the world.  Beyond the specific reforms necessary in the global financial system  the parallel problem of global financial imbalances must also be addressed. These have formed part of the Group of 20 (G-20) agenda  in which Australia is active. The objectives of the Framework for Strong  Sustainable and Balanced Growth agreed to by the G-20 States at their Pittsburgh summit in September 2009 remain essential and must be implemented if we are to act on the causes of the recent crisis.  Last December  the nations of the world assembled in Copenhagen for the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Australia was an active participant at Copenhagen. Together with a number of other States  Australia worked tirelessly to produce the Copenhagen Accord. The Accord did not represent all that the international community needed then in order to bring about a comprehensive response to the continuing challenge of climate change. It did  however  represented four significant advances.  For the first time  the Accord entrenched 2°C or less as the limit beyond which global temperatures could not be allowed to rise in order to avoid irretrievable climate change for the planet.  For the first time  both developed and developing countries accepted that they had responsibilities to bring about this outcome.  For the first time  developed and developing countries agreed to develop a framework for the measurement  reporting and verification of mitigation actions.  And for the first time  developed countries committed themselves to mobilizing an amount approaching $30 billion in international public financing for immediate action in developing countries to 2012  and to work towards a goal of mobilizing $100 billion annually by 2020 in funding from all sources.  Much  however  remains to be done. Australia believes the international community must urgently address the particular climate-change adaptation needs of the world’s most vulnerable States  in particular the island countries of the Pacific  the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean.   43 10-55103   One significant area of progress in the period ahead lies in the proper protection  preservation and reforestation of the world’s rainforests. Collectively  rainforest degradation and deforestation in developing countries represents about one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions. Australia stands ready to act with other States  including Norway  to build on the work already done  in order to achieve an effective outcome in this area as rapidly as possible. The international community needs to see an early sign of real success in our international efforts to combat climate change. We believe that action on rainforests  through what is called the REDD-plus set of initiatives — on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries — represents one such area of possible early advance.  Australia is now active on both the Secretary-General’s High-level Panels  on global sustainability and on climate change finance. This  added to our continued participation in the UNFCCC  means that Australia will continue to be among the most globally active States in global forums for bringing about a comprehensive and effective global response to climate change. In doing so  the Governments of the world will have to closely consider new growth models that incorporate both the concept and the reality of lower-carbon economies.  For the economies of the world  this transformation — which some have called the next industrial revolution — also represents an unprecedented opportunity for investment and employment as the global economy embraces new efficiency measures and new renewable energy strategies. The international community needs to embrace a new way of looking at climate change  which sees action on climate change providing new industries  new investment and new job opportunities for the future.  All Governments represented in the Assembly participated in the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Australia fully embraces the MDG framework.  This week  in New York  we said that our aid programme has doubled over the last five years and is projected to double again by 2015. Over time  more of our aid will go to the least developed countries  and we will continue to give high priority to assisting the world’s small island States  particularly our Pacific neighbours  in recognition of their special needs.  We expect to invest some $5 billion in education by 2015  including support for universal primary education. Australia also expects to invest at least $1.6 billion in women’s and children’s health up to 2015.  Australia applauds the initiative to create a new institution entitled UN Women  under the capable leadership of the new Under-Secretary-General  Michelle Bachelet  former President of Chile. Australia looks forward to working with UN Women on the vast array of challenges which half of humanity faces and for which our existing international frameworks have been found wanting. The education of women and girls and the security of women and girls from violence and sexual abuse and exploitation must now become a core part of our global campaign for a fairer world.  Human rights abuses and humanitarian crises in failing States continue to plague us. We must enhance the negotiations on the responsibility to protect and support the mandate of the International Criminal Court. We must also continue to speak out against flagrant abuses.  Often it is the indigenous peoples of the world who suffer most. I am proud of Australia’s apology to our own indigenous peoples and our policy of closing the gap between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. I am also proud of Australia’s support for the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Australia is making a major effort in the treatment of our indigenous peoples  although we still have a long way to go.  Australia is a founding Member of the United Nations. We have been active in this institution for the last 65 years.  We are also a candidate for the Security Council for the 2013-2014 term. Australia has contributed 65 000 of our number to 52 different peacekeeping missions across the world. We remain active in several such peace operations today  including in Cyprus  Sudan  Timor-Leste and Afghanistan.  Over the years  Australia has a led a number of significant United Nations initiatives  including the Cambodia peace settlement and the conclusion of the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention  as well as leading the force that    10-55103 44  stabilized Timor-Leste after its people voted for independence.  Australia remains intimately engaged in all the funds  programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations. We are also active in other international institutions  including the Commonwealth.  Australia is the twelfth largest source of funding for the United Nations budget. Australia pays in full and on time. We always seek to do that which we say we will do.  Australia wants to be part of the solution to the many challenges that the international community now faces  not just point to the problems. Australia believes in the power of creative ideas and active diplomacy to solve long-standing international problems. Australia values good international citizenship. It is for these reasons that Australia has been committed to the United Nations since the very beginning.  The United Nations is inevitably imperfect. As the Organization’s second Secretary-General — the great Swede  Dag Hammarskjöld — famously said  “The United Nations was not created in order to bring us to heaven  but in order to save us from hell”.  Our responsibility today is to fulfil the vision that our forebears had for this great institution 65 years ago. Our responsibility is to make the United Nations fulfil its mission — to make the United Nations work through the combined political will of all Member States."
"10",393,"AUT",65,2010,"The tragic earthquake in Haiti  the devastating floods in Pakistan and the financial crisis have reminded us that the global challenges of the twenty-first century require concerted action. The United Nations needs to be at the centre of our activities. It is the forum of today’s multilateral system that enjoys the highest degree of legitimacy. Inclusiveness is its key comparative advantage.  However  this moral authority must be matched by mechanisms and resources to ensure its effectiveness. Adherence to the rule of law is fundamental. All multilateral efforts and activities need   23 10-55109  to operate on the basis of clear and predictable rules that apply equally to all Member States. Member States  as well as men and women around the globe  must be able to trust in the United Nations capacity to turn the promises of the Charter into reality.  Cooperation with other international actors is indispensable to the United Nations efforts to deal with the complex challenges of today. Austria and the European Union (EU) stand ready as reliable partners for the United Nations in areas ranging from development cooperation and humanitarian aid to the maintenance of international peace and security and to promoting the respect for the rule of law and human rights. In this context  we hope that our initiative to obtain modalities for the EU’s participation in the General Assembly  reflecting the changes provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon  will soon be adopted. This would greatly help to reinforce the productive partnership of the United Nations with an organization that is fully committed to the principles and objectives enshrined in the Charter. Austria is proud to contribute to the work of the United Nations by hosting the United Nations Office at Vienna. We will continue to offer Vienna as a platform for dialogue and cooperation.  In our view  good governance is an inherent element of global governance. The Vienna-based United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime is central to the United Nations efforts to combat corruption and organized crime by supporting Member States in implementing international standards  including the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Corruption presents one of the major challenges with dire consequences for the international community’s efforts to reduce poverty. The recent founding of the International Anti-Corruption Academy in Austria is an important step towards addressing this challenge. That institution aims to provide a tool for research  education and training for professionals from all fields  including law enforcement officials  judges and prosecutors.  The fight against climate change is one of the central issues of the twenty-first century. Climate change has a far-reaching impact on the economic and social development of the entire international community. We need global consensus now if we want to achieve the goal to limit global warming to 2°C and to reverse the trend of rising greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. Nobody should underestimate the difficulty of this task. However  the fight against climate change is also an opportunity. We have the chance to create a framework for sustainable  qualitative growth at the global level. Austria is committed to contributing to this endeavour.  This week  leaders agreed on concrete actions to get the Millennium Development Goals back on track in the fight against world poverty. We now need to mobilize all our efforts to live up to this renewed commitment  particularly in addressing the special needs of Africa in this regard. The Governments of developing and developed countries  as well as the private sector and civil society  need to work together to achieve our ambitious goals by 2015.  Let me now turn to one of the most urgent threats to peace and security. These days  our attention is focused on the recently initiated direct talks between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas. We welcome the leadership and commitment of President Obama  who made this development possible. These talks offer the first concrete prospects for a sustainable peace in the Middle East in many years. An agreement between Israel and Palestine would not only radically improve the lives of the peoples concerned  but would also provide the key to a more stable region and a more peaceful world. We hope that both sides are aware of their enormous responsibilities.  The process is still fragile. We believe that the extension of the settlement moratorium is fundamental to keeping the talks on track and creating an environment in which the core issues can be tackled successfully. It is equally important that the efforts of the Palestinian authorities to build up functioning institutions for a future Palestinian State move forward dynamically. It is ultimately up to the parties to bring the peace process to a positive conclusion. However  international actors  in particular the members of the Quartet  have an important role to play. As a member of the European Union  Austria is ready to fully play its part.  In order to ensure that the United Nations continues to play a central role in global governance  we must continue with our efforts towards internal reform of the United Nations  including the reform of the Security Council. Both an enlargement of the Security Council that reflects today’s political  economic and social realities and a reform of the Council’s working methods will enhance the Council’s    10-55109 24  legitimacy and the acceptance of its decisions. As an elected member of the Security Council  we participate in its work with great commitment and are doing our best to promote effectiveness and transparency.  Significant efforts are under way to ensure and sustain United Nations peacekeeping as an essential tool for achieving the goals of the United Nations. Confronted with limited financial and human resources and the increasing complexity of peacekeeping operations  the United Nations has started a review of the whole United Nations peacekeeping system with a view to adjusting it to the needs of the twenty-first century. It is of vital importance for the Council to effectively monitor and oversee the implementation of peacekeeping mandates  in close cooperation with troop and police contributors  the Secretariat and United Nations missions. Austria fully supports the ongoing peacekeeping reform and stands ready to play its part in a renewed global peacekeeping partnership.  We also have to work on making peace consolidation irreversible. The United Nations Peacebuilding Commission  together with integrated peacebuilding support offices  has a key role in fostering sustainable peace. If we use the peacebuilding architecture optimally  lasting peace can be achieved with determination and the political will of the country concerned  as well as the support of the international community. Since peacekeeping and peacebuilding must be approached in an integrated manner  we strongly support the enhanced interaction of the Security Council with the Peacebuilding Commission throughout the conflict cycle  as was affirmed at the Security Council summit this week.  Due to the changing nature of conflict and an increase in the activities of non-State actors  the protection of civilians in armed conflict constitutes a core task of a large number of United Nations peacekeeping missions. The effective protection of those affected by hostilities and violence has become a yardstick for the success and credibility of United Nations missions in the field and the United Nations at large. Security Council resolution 1894 (2009)  unanimously adopted in November last year  was a major step forward in the Council’s efforts to better protect civilians from physical violence  displacement and violations of their rights.  However  resolution 1894 (2009) has not yet had its full impact on the ground. Violations of international humanitarian and human rights law and impunity for such crimes continue to pose a major threat to the rule of law and lasting peace in post-conflict situations.  Austria acknowledges the primary responsibility of States to ensure the protection of civilians  including the credible prosecution of those responsible for war crimes  genocide  crimes against humanity or other serious violations of international law. We support the use and promotion of mechanisms such as the International Criminal Court  commissions of inquiry or panels of experts. Such tools should be seen as a viable complement and reinforcement of steps taken at the national level to ensure accountability. The Security Council has a central role in this endeavour. Ensuring the implementation of resolution 1894 (2009) will be one of the key priorities of Austria during the remainder of its term on the Council.  Austria also attaches utmost importance to enhancing the role of women in conflict and post-conflict situations. Even 10 years after the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)  on women and peace and security  we can still witness major gaps. Women continue to be largely absent from peace processes and conflict-resolution efforts  and crimes against them all too often remain unpunished. The latest  shocking mass rapes in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo demonstrate more than ever that there is urgent need for action. We cannot afford to ignore those gaps. The occasion of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) will therefore provide a crucial opportunity to work towards more consistent implementation in promoting women’s issues in all aspects of international peace efforts. Those efforts are fully supported by our development cooperation.  Austria warmly welcomes the milestone decision of the General Assembly to establish UN Women  which will make the United Nations a stronger and more effective partner in the advancement of women worldwide. We look forward to working with Michelle Bachelet towards our common goals.  Children in armed conflict deserve special protection. I am very satisfied that the United Nations system has made concrete progress in combating serious child rights violations and in fighting the recruitment and enlisting of child soldiers.   25 10-55109   Austria reiterates the pivotal role of the United Nations at the centre of our counter-terrorism efforts. Respect for human rights and the rule of law is a fundamental basis of the fight against terrorism. As Chair of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) concerning Al-Qaida and the Taliban  Austria is committed to enhancing due process in the Council’s sanctions regimes. We therefore welcome the substantial improvements of the listing and de-listing procedures and the recent appointment of Ms. Kimberly Prost as Ombudsperson.  The Austrian candidature for the Human Rights Council for the period 2011-2014 is a logical continuation of our long-term work and engagement in ensuring the respect for human rights  including in the Security Council. Dialogue and partnerships are crucial for turning the promises of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights into a reality for all people around the globe. Austria has consistently worked with all actors towards narrowing the gap between standards and their implementation at the national and international levels.  To end on a positive note  this past year saw the most positive developments towards nuclear disarmament in a decade. Security Council resolution 1887 (2009)  adopted just a year ago  provided a powerful impetus. Although many issues are still unresolved and require our close attention  the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in May produced an outcome that restored confidence in the Treaty. For the first time  a comprehensive action plan dealing with all three pillars of the Treaty was agreed. Let me stress here that Austria is honoured to have contributed to that success. For the first time  a world without nuclear weapons was accepted as the goal of all parties  who pledged to ultimately eliminate all types of nuclear weapons. For the first time  the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of the use of such weapons were recognized — an important step towards the eventual legal ban of nuclear weapons by means of a nuclear weapons convention or framework of legal instruments.  Although the results of the Conference are positive  much remains to be done. The action plan needs to be implemented. The nuclear-weapon States — which promised to engage among themselves on a number of vital issues and report by 2014 — must lead by example. The international disarmament structures must be reformed. I am grateful for Secretary-General Ban’s initiative in this respect.  Finally  we must learn from successful disarmament initiatives. Let me underline that Austria is delighted that the Convention on Cluster Munitions entered into force last month. The Convention is a positive example of how committed Governments  international organizations and civil society can work together to achieve real progress. In order to promote interaction in this respect in the nuclear field as well  Austria supports the establishment of a competence centre for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in Vienna early next year. Conceived as a platform for open discussion and independent expertise  monitoring and advocacy  the centre shall facilitate understanding and cooperation among all entities involved. I hope that it will contribute to further progress in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  We  the United Nations  have shared responsibility to move forward jointly in order to reach our common goal of international peace  security and development for all. "
"11",418,"AZE",65,2010,"I have the honour to join previous speakers in congratulating you  Sir  on your election to the post of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session; I wish you every success in that highly responsible post. I would like as well to thank your predecessor  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  for his productive work. I also express my profound respect and gratitude to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his leadership and dedication in reviving the Organization.  Azerbaijan recognizes the central role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security  promoting sustainable development and advocating fundamental freedoms for the people of the world. Azerbaijan believes that the United Nations has to be stronger and more capable in engaging in a range of global issues in every part of the world  as well as in addressing the aspirations and concerns of each Member State.  As a country suffering from the devastation of war and occupation  Azerbaijan strongly believes that faithful observance of universally accepted norms and principles of international law concerning good-neighbourliness  friendly relations  cooperation among States and the fulfilment in good faith of the obligations assumed by States are of the greatest importance for the maintenance of international peace and security. The ongoing armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan still represents a major threat to international and regional peace and security. The conflict has resulted in the occupation of one fifth of the territory of Azerbaijan and has made approximately one out of every nine people in my country an internally displaced person or a refugee.  It has been internationally recognized that the Republic of Armenia bears the primary responsibility for occupying Azerbaijan’s territories  committing the most serious international crimes during the conflict  carrying out ethnic cleansing and trying to create a mono-ethnic culture in the captured Azerbaijani territories. The Security Council has adopted four resolutions and has expressed its full support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and the inadmissibility of the use of force for the acquisition of territories. It has also recognized that Nagorny Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan and has called for the immediate  full and unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan. The General Assembly and other international organizations  including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  the Council of Europe  the European Parliament and the Organization of the Islamic Conference  have adopted similar positions. Unfortunately  despite the consolidated position of the international community  Azerbaijani territories continue to remain under occupation.  Armenia so far  instead of negotiating in good faith with a view to finding a durable solution to the conflict as soon as possible  has preferred escalation  with unpredictable consequences. Despite ongoing political efforts towards the earliest possible resolution of the conflict  activities in the occupied areas of Azerbaijan are in gross violation of international law and serve to further consolidate the current status quo of the occupation  securing the results of ethnic   19 10-54833  cleansing and colonization of the captured territories  and causing serious obstruction to the peaceful resolution of the conflict.  Thus  over the period since the beginning of the conflict  significant numbers of settlers have been encouraged to move into the occupied areas depopulated of their Azerbaijani inhabitants. In 2005 OSCE dispatched a fact-finding mission to the occupied territories of Azerbaijan  which found evidence of the presence of settlers there and made a call to discourage any further settlement of the occupied territory of Azerbaijan. Measures are also being consistently undertaken by Armenia with the purpose of altering the historical and cultural features of the occupied areas in an attempt to remove any signs testifying to their original Azerbaijani cultural and historical roots. As a result  not a single Azerbaijani historic or cultural monument has been left undamaged and no sacred site has escaped vandalism in the occupied territories. Implantation of settlers as well as destruction and appropriation of the historical and cultural heritage in the occupied areas  along with various other forms of illegal activity there  directly affect the property rights of internally displaced persons.  The lack of agreement on political issues  the protracted nature of the conflict and prolonged negotiations should not be used as pretexts for not addressing other problems deriving from continued and deliberate disrespect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law in connection with the conflict.  The earliest possible resolution of the armed conflict in and around the Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan remains a primary task for us. The OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chair countries are engaged in efforts to bring peace and stability to the region. Resolution of the conflict envisages the withdrawal of Armenian forces from the occupied Azerbaijani territories within a fixed time framework  restoration of all communications  return of all refugees and internally displaced persons to their places of origin  international security guarantees  including peacekeeping forces  and interim status for Nagorny Karabakh. We are ready to continue the talks in good faith for finalizing the status of Nagorny Karabakh within the Republic of Azerbaijan.  The step-by-step approach introduced to Armenia and Azerbaijan in December 2009 by the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs is accepted by Azerbaijan in principle as a basis for achieving a lasting resolution of the Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorny Karabakh conflict. Unfortunately  Armenia is still delaying a definite answer to the Co-Chairs’ proposal.  Azerbaijan highly appreciates the principled stand of Member States on issues of vital importance for Azerbaijan pertaining to its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We rely on the continued solidarity of the international community with the just position of Azerbaijan and on valuable support for our initiatives within the United Nations  aimed at addressing the existing challenges in an impartial  open and comprehensive manner.  Despite the unresolved conflict over Nagorny Karabakh and occupied territories  the Government of Azerbaijan has succeeded in guaranteeing political stability  democratic development  economic prosperity and social welfare in the country. Today  Azerbaijan is one of the most rapidly developing economies in the world. Within the last five years alone  Azerbaijan has nearly tripled its gross domestic product. The strategic geographic location of Azerbaijan at the intersection of major trade routes along the emerging East-West and North-South transport and energy corridors provides an important asset to turn the country into an energy and infrastructure hub.  Azerbaijan possesses considerable proven oil and natural gas reserves and has good prospects for new discoveries. Modern infrastructure for transporting hydrocarbons to international markets has already been created in Azerbaijan and has been used for exporting oil and natural gas  which can diversify supply sources and strengthen international energy security. This is particularly crucial for gas supplies. With proven reserves of 2 trillion cubic metres of natural gas and a potential of up to 5 trillion cubic metres or  and perhaps even more  Azerbaijan is ready to provide its own contribution to ensure the stable development of the world natural gas market.  Another globally important project  on which Azerbaijan is working very intensively with its neighbours is building and enhancing the regional railroad infrastructure. This railroad connection will open an enormous opportunity for transporting all kinds of cargo between Asia and Europe.    10-54833 20   As a very active member of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative  Azerbaijan  in an open and transparent manner  uses its energy revenues for the development of the country  particularly in building human capital and working to eradicate reducing poverty. Thus  we were able to achieve a dramatic poverty reduction  from 49 per cent in 2003 to 11 per cent in 2009. And I strongly believe that through sustainable development Azerbaijan will attain even more in this field in upcoming years.  Azerbaijan has always been a place of coexistence and tolerance among different faiths  ethnic groups and philosophies. As an active member of the Group of Friends of the Alliance of Civilizations  Azerbaijan contributes to the promotion of inter-religious and intercultural dialogue based on mutual respect and understanding. Azerbaijan hosted the World Summit of Religious Leaders  with participants from 32 States  in the spring of this year and has put forward an initiative to host a world forum for intercultural dialogue in April 2011.  One of the most serious and long-term challenges that can affect every part of the globe is climate change. We in Azerbaijan proclaimed 2010 a year of ecology and adopted various special programmes in the field of environmental protection.  Azerbaijan demonstrates full support and undertakes ceaseless efforts for the promotion of sustainable development and global prosperity for all  paying particular attention to addressing the special needs and vulnerabilities of the developing and least developed countries  as well as of those who are recovering from natural disasters. Azerbaijan will continue to contribute to the realization of the Millennium development goals and objectives agreed within the United Nations."
"12",464,"BDI",65,2010,"Allow me first of all to convey to the Assembly the warm and fraternal greetings of His Excellency Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza  who has just been re-elected for a second term of five years. He had planned to take part in these meetings himself  but the Unity International Foundation insisted on awarding him the Rising Star of Africa prize for his role in building and promoting peace  and that led him to delegate attending the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals and the general debate of the Assembly’s sixty-fifth session to me.  We wish to congratulate the President of the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session and to reiterate the thanks of the Burundi delegation to his predecessor for his remarkable work. We also pay due tribute to our Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his involvement in the follow-up to Assembly resolutions and for the important guidance that he continues to give our Organization. His visit to Burundi on 9 June 2010 is a clear sign of his commitment to peacebuilding and to strengthening the democracy regained in our country at great cost.  Burundi is participating in the sixty-fifth session following the top-to-bottom renewal of national institutions. For the first time in Burundi’s history  the democratically elected institutions have completed their term of office. That powerfully demonstrates the political maturity and resolve of the people of Burundi to break with the turbulent past in order to invest in the peace  stability and reconciliation that are prerequisites to sustainable development.  We take this opportunity to reiterate the thanks of the Government and people of Burundi for the role of the international community  the United Nations  the European Union  the African Union  the European Parliament  the East African Community  the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly  the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa  the Economic Community of Central African States  friendly countries and various organizations in participating in the funding and observation of the aforementioned elections  which were peaceful  transparent and fair and in accordance with international standards.  For its part  the party that won the elections is aware of the absolute need to promote national reconciliation and political tolerance as much as it can. From the day after the first round of the election and then in his inaugural speech  the President of the Republic himself expressed his resolve and that of the winning party to govern Burundi for and with all the people of Burundi. Furthermore  Burundi’s Constitution also provides for political inclusion mechanisms in managing the State’s affairs.  During the new Parliament  the Government of Burundi is committed to following its peacebuilding programme and strengthening security for all  in particular by completing disarmament of the civilian population and the socio-economic reinsertion of demobilized individuals and returnees. Furthermore  the Government of Burundi will particularly emphasize regional cooperation and integration  as well as enhancing security in its geographical area  together with neighbouring countries.  Promoting good governance in its various dimensions is also one of the main concerns of Burundi’s Government. With regard to political governance  it will continue to promote the rights of political parties  including by strengthening the spirit of dialogue between political partners.  With respect to economic governance  there will be efforts to improve business conditions to encourage both national and foreign investment. The Government of Burundi reaffirms its determination and zero-tolerance commitment to combat financial corruption and fraud.  In the area of the judiciary  every possible effort will be made to combat impunity with respect to any type of crime  and transitional justice will be promoted during this Parliament.  Concerning socio-economic development  the Government of Burundi will focus every effort possible on combating poverty  in particular through development of priority production sectors  namely  agriculture and livestock  energy  social infrastructure  tourism  environmental renewal and new information and communication technologies. We will give special attention to developing public-private partnerships with a view to sustained economic growth.  In the social domain  the Government of Burundi will concentrate on the education and health sectors to combat ignorance and disease. To meet crucial needs in those areas  many schools and clinics will be built    10-55109 10  throughout the country. Furthermore  the services in these two sectors will also be improved.  Relaunching and promoting the Burundian economy depends also on consolidating regional groups and developing projects and programmes that integrate common interests. In that framework  the Government of Burundi will play a larger role in the promotion of regional organizations of which it is a member  such as the Economic Community of the Great Lake Countries  the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region  whose Executive Secretariat we host  the East African Community  the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa  and others. That ambitious programme requires consistent support for its implementation. Thus Burundi clearly requires various forms of support.  To that end  we take the opportunity of this forum to make a strong appeal to the international community  to the United Nations system and to the countries represented here and to charitable organizations to continue their tireless support to the Government of Burundi with the ultimate aim of allowing it to lay the foundations for long-term development and for solidifying the achievements made in terms of peace  democracy  stability and reconciliation.  In the context of international relations and relations between States  Burundi is convinced that the issue of global governance in general and economic governance in particular remains a major concern of most of our countries. Thus promotion of equity must become the leitmotif and the warhorse of the organizations of which our respective States are full members.  Burundi desires additional efforts to allow developing countries sufficient representation in the international financial institutions such as the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund and others. We believe that is the way to promote a fairer and more geographically balanced world.  Burundi is committed to the African Union’s position on Security Council reform  in particular that the African continent should have two permanent seats with all of the privileges held by the five permanent members.  Today the entire world is confronting a number of challenges and natural disasters  some of which are linked to climate change. Developing countries in general and African countries in particular are the most harshly affected  because of a lack of resources to deal with such challenges.  It is high time that countries agree to take more audacious measures in order to provide the financing necessary to combat the negative effects of climate change  by stimulating and promoting in particular technology transfer and without forgetting capacity-building in the poorest and thus the most vulnerable countries. By effectively combating the effects of climate change  our countries will inevitably resolve in part the problem of food insecurity  which is also a significant threat to sustainable development.  In that light  we call upon the wealthy countries to act in favour of developing countries  particularly post-conflict countries such as Burundi  through multiple  ongoing and significant support to key social and economic sectors. It is urgent that all development partners respect the promises they have made to developing countries in general and those countries in Africa in particular by increasing official development assistance.  Burundi — whose stability has benefited from the excellent attention and considerable support of United Nations entities  the international community and friendly countries — remains very concerned by the issue of the maintenance of international peace and security. It reaffirms its commitment to cooperate with the United Nations in consolidating the achievements made with regard to peace and stability and in handling the finances necessary for its socio-economic development.  Furthermore  in terms of international solidarity  all countries must combine efforts to make this world a harbour of peace. For that reason  Burundi is taking an active part in the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire to bring peace to that country  the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad  the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur and the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).  With respect to Somalia  Burundi is committed on the ground despite the many problems its troops are encountering. We reiterate our request to the United Nations with regard to improving the living and working conditions of the AMISOM forces. We take this opportunity to recall the promises made in that   11 10-55109  regard by the Secretary-General when he visited Burundi on 9 June. We also call on other countries to deploy additional troops so that AMISOM can become a truly continental mission able to fulfil its mandate.  In closing  Burundi welcomes the determination and commitment of the United Nations to make our world one of peace  democracy  tolerance and development  where individual and collective rights and freedoms are clearly protected. Therefore  we encourage everyone to go forward towards that noble mission. Our wish is that the next session of the General Assembly may take place in a context where most of the conflicts currently threatening some countries and the world as a whole will have been resolved."
"13",511,"BEL",65,2010,"History has shown us that words can change the face of the world. It has proven that the spoken word can influence the future  but only when they go beyond rhetoric. What is our global governance worth if it does not go beyond the expression of ambitions and intentions? Words remain ineffectual if they are not followed up with action. We must therefore act. I say “we”  the nations united  because no country  no matter   47 10-54833  how large  can respond alone to the great challenges facing humanity. I say “we” because no large-scale problem is limited to a single country  leaving untouched the lives of those who live elsewhere. The obligation to act is a shared  global responsibility. That is why today my message is about responsibility and increased accountability.  At the heart of any form of governance lies responsibility  be it global or local  national or international. But this is not enough. Indeed  governance is not only about behaving responsibly; it is also about being accountable. This applies not only at the level of the single State  but also at the level of our United Nations.  Human rights  security and development are at the core of the mandate of the United Nations. Former Secretary-General Kofi Annan pointed out the fact that the three are inextricably linked when he said:  “There will be no development without security and no security without development. And both development and security also depend on respect for human rights and the rule of law.” (A/59/2005  annex  para. 2) It has indeed become common knowledge that human rights are unlikely to be protected in an insecure and underdeveloped environment and that economic development cannot be durably sustained in a society where there is no rule of law.  Accountability in international affairs is about respecting international law — the rules that govern relations among States. Without a solid legal basis  international cooperation remains optional and falls short of the necessary transparency and long-term sustainability. Important steps have been taken to uphold the rule of law at the international level over the past decades.  Belgium pleads for the universal acceptance of the competence of the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court. If all countries were willing to follow up on this appeal  we would be a step closer to having an effective and accountable international system.  Meeting our responsibilities in the field of human rights means ensuring efficient means and mechanisms to ensure their protection. We need to instil more coherence to our action. Unfortunately  today we focus our attention all too often on how to react to human rights violations while we should focus more on prevention and on the root causes of those violations.  Human rights are universal. My country strongly opposes any form of relativism in this respect.  International and regional human rights instruments need to be strengthened. The evaluation within the Human Rights Council in 2011 should give important momentum to that strengthening.  There is also a need for increased accountability in the field of security  another pillar of the United Nations. Over the past year  important progress has been made. The Review Conference of the Parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty came to a substantial and balanced result. Respect for Non-Proliferation Treaty provisions and cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency are accountability in practice. Unfortunately  the non-acceptance or non-respect of these provisions by countries like North Korea and Iran threatens the international non-proliferation regime.  In particular  Belgium welcomes the entry into force earlier this year of the Convention on Cluster Munitions. The prohibition of the production and use of cluster munitions has become the international standard. I am pleased and proud to announce that Belgium has recently destroyed its entire stock of cluster munitions.  The Millennium Development Goals and climate negotiations are at the top of our twenty-first century agenda  and rightly so. We are all responsible for our planet. In fact  we are all accountable to current and future generations  especially in the field of poverty reduction and environmental protection. Let us not forget the ancient Native American saying: “We do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children”.  Creating a world that is equitable  a world that will last  is our common responsibility. Belgium is doing so by spending 0.7 per cent of its gross domestic product on development cooperation.  If we indeed accept the need to be accountable for the results we do or do not obtain  we should have the courage to evaluate and adapt the institutions and instruments at our disposal. In that respect  Belgium fully supports the efforts of the European Union to    10-54833 48  participate in a timely and effective manner in the work of the General Assembly.  If it is to contribute effectively to global governance and to take up its global responsibility  the United Nations needs to continue its efforts to become more representative and more efficient. The creation of UN Women was a welcome development  and it has my country’s full support. Of course  gender will need to remain a mainstream theme influencing the actions of each and every United Nations institution.  Important discussions on the reform of the Security Council have been ongoing for quite some time. Belgium hopes that the negotiations will soon lead to concrete results.  I have talked about institutions  and concerns about institutions are  of course  legitimate. But they should never lead us to forget that the first accountability of humankind is not created by abstractions or institutions  but by the face of a person in dire need; of the man  woman or child who is the victim of violence; of those who suffer the violence of nature  or from violence perpetrated by other men.  When it comes to humanitarian protection and aid  responsibility and accountability have never been more necessary. That is why United Nations peacekeeping missions with strong mandates  especially in the field of the protection of civilians  are important and should be given the necessary instruments  not least in the context of the fight against sexual violence. In this context  Belgium strongly supports Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and its goals of ensuring the participation  protection and promotion of women in peace and security.  The concept of sovereignty cannot be used as a justification for human rights violations against the citizens of any country. On the contrary  sovereignty implies the responsibility to protect  and we support the efforts of the Secretary-General to further put this principle into practice.  My key message of increased responsibility and accountability also applies to certain situations in the world that I would like to address briefly: the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Afghanistan and Pakistan. The fiftieth anniversary of the independence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been an opportunity to measure the unquestionable progress made over recent years. What is important as we move forward is the consolidation of peace and democracy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Belgium is pleased that the mandate of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has incorporated the element of peacebuilding alongside that of peacekeeping.  The elections in 2006 allowed the Democratic Republic of the Congo to choose the path of democratization. The Congolese authorities have expressed their determination to persevere on this path in confirming their intention to hold elections in 2011. That deserves our full support.  Despite all this progress  it is clear that many challenges remain. In spite of the rapprochement among its neighbours  the situation in the East of the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains worrisome. We were reminded of this by the shocking reports of widespread rape in Luvungi.  The fight against impunity  which is crucial to my country  hinges first and foremost on the strengthening of the rule of law. It is one of the primary responsibilities of the authorities  but here  too  the support of the United Nations and the international community is crucial. Belgium calls on the international community to continue to assume its responsibility. Like in every country  the Afghan Government is held accountable by the Afghan people. We hope that last weekend’s elections contributed to this. However  the Afghan authorities do not stand alone. The international community  with a central role for the United Nations  assists the Afghan Government in enhancing the level of accountability to its population. Gradually  the Afghan authorities need to take on more responsibility  especially in the field of security. This transfer is welcome  but rather than being calendar-driven  it should be results-driven.  The Belgian Government has decided to extend its current military and civilian presence until the end of 2011. We believe that 2011 will be of crucial importance in transferring further security   49 10-54833  responsibilities. The focus of the Belgian presence beyond 2011 will therefore likely be more and more on civilian assistance.  Nobody can remain untouched by the devastation and human suffering caused by the floods in Pakistan. As members of the international community  we have to take on our responsibility. This “slow-motion tsunami”  as the Secretary-General called it  demands a long-term and strategic answer. Belgium therefore welcomes the three-step approach — the meeting last Sunday in New York  the meeting in Brussels next month of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan  and the donor event in November — which clearly sets out the framework for reconstruction.  We have to move beyond the stage of emergency aid. In this respect  I am glad to say that the European Union last week took the firm commitment to improve market access for Pakistan as a concrete measure to reinvigorate Pakistan’s economy.  Allow me to conclude by recalling John F. Kennedy’s observation that the only reward for a politician is a good conscience. It may be true that not many other rewards should be expected for politicians. But even so  the conscience of a politician cannot free him from the obligation of being accountable to those he wants to serve  to the people he wants to represent and to the country he wants to lead."
"14",556,"BEN",65,2010,"I bring a message on behalf of the President of the Republic of Benin  His Excellency Mr. Boni Yayi  who was not able to come to New York because of scheduling conflicts. He shares the ambition of the President of the General Assembly at the sixty-fifth session to build a United Nations that is strong  inclusive and open as a guarantor of global governance. I am convinced that the productive experience of the President of the General Assembly at the head of the Swiss Government  which enabled his beautiful country to enter the United Nations  will be a valuable asset to us. From this perspective  Benin will make its contribution to the work of this session and  in so doing  will strive to promote the ideals of the Charter  to which my country reiterates here its full support.  I would also like to express to Mr. Deiss my warm congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at the sixty-fifth session. His predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Ali Treki  who brilliantly led the work of the General Assembly with respect to Africa  strove to find appropriate solutions to the great challenges facing humankind with skill and tact throughout his mandate. We pay tribute to him for his good and loyal service to the international community.  I would also like to welcome the courageous and determined action of His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  Secretary-General of the United Nations  and commend him for having taken the measure of the grave crises affecting the world and for his ongoing commitment to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Thanks to his bold initiatives to promote international cooperation  he has been able to revive the virtues of multilateralism as the optimum way to manage world affairs in an inclusive and participatory framework that stresses the uniqueness of our world and the common responsibility of human beings to maintain the fundamental balances on which human survival on Earth depends and the sustainability of the biosphere.  The trail blazed by the founding fathers of the United Nations in the areas of international peace and security  the promotion of human rights and development is that of dialogue  cooperation and a global partnership to promote the common good of humankind.  The raison d’être of the United Nations is not only to provide a framework of reference and universal convergence to coordinate national policies  but also and above all to address interests with respect to the parameters that define areas of tension between aspirations and the demands of our peoples and States in all their diversity.  If the United Nations did not exist it would have to be created  because we cannot imagine a world today without the United Nations. I would therefore like to express Benin’s commitment to the irreplaceable role of the United Nations and its funds  agencies  programmes and various specialized institutions  which provide an invaluable service to humankind as a secular extension of our collective conscience.    10-54833 50   The High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) convened by the Secretary-General defined a programme of action to achieve the Goals by 2015. In implementing these measures  it is important to take continuously into account the deadlines set for the achievement of the MDGs in the light of the additional difficulties related to the current crises of the financial and economic system and to previous crises.  It is the duty of the international community to mobilize the resources necessary to address the grave distortions that caused these crises. Vulnerable countries must make investments to relaunch sustainable agricultural production and maintain sustained growth capable of generating long-term prosperity and sustainable human development  because the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals must be guaranteed in perpetuity.  The United Nations must now  and with a sense of urgency  use its full influence to provide the means to help countries in difficulty ensure the survival of threatened populations and vulnerable groups that could be decimated by famine and disease if nothing is done to help them. The time has come to give substance to the right to food because it is unacceptable that hunger should persist among the causes of human suffering in the twenty-first century. In the short term  priority focus should be on strengthening social protection systems in low-income countries and on reactivating dormant local production capacity by promoting small and medium-sized agricultural businesses in order to avoid a drastic increase in the number of people living in extreme poverty.  In the medium and long terms  it is necessary to rethink policies to promote investments in agriculture in order to re-establish the balance between cash crops and food products and thus ensure food security in countries  taking their cultural specificities into account.  The international community must begin to evaluate the effectiveness of its strategic monitoring mechanisms in order to strengthen their ability to foresee systemic shocks. What is predictable should be predicted in order to define a long-term approach and to build  on the basis of available scientific data  a desirable future for our countries and peoples  who must cooperate to that end.  In this respect  the proposal to increase the agricultural share of official development assistance from 3 per cent to 10 per cent is a strategic approach that should be implemented with common political will commensurate to the challenge. Here  I pay tribute to countries that have already made concrete commitments to providing additional resources to that end.  Benin is an agricultural country  and agriculture must serve as a springboard for its development. In that regard  the Government of Benin is working to promote synergistic growth and the fight against poverty in order to align democracy and new-found freedoms with shared prosperity by carrying out the social transformations necessary to ensure the effective participation of all sectors in national development efforts.  The Government of Benin is working to promote agricultural mechanization  but given that the latter cannot have the desired impact without water management  we are also planning for rational management of that resource in order to maximize its use and ensure its sustainability. These investments will allow us to make the work of farmers less difficult and to limit post-harvest losses in order to ensure that agricultural production covers national needs and generates surplus for export.  In the framework of efforts to diversify agricultural production  the Government of Benin is also working to promote crops for marginal farming land to produce biofuel. The goal is to reduce dependence on and the rising cost of hydrocarbons  which have been exacerbated by the drastic drop in hydroelectric power caused by climate change  which has also seriously affected the country’s economic activity in recent years.  West Africa has been deeply affected by soil degradation  coastal erosion and the effects of frequent floods due to climate change. Here  we express our appreciation for the awareness-raising undertaken by the secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. It is important to devote more resources to implementing the Convention in the framework of fighting climate change.  Adaptation and mitigation measures should be implemented with a sense of heightened urgency in order to help regions affected. Financial and development institutions should pay special attention to programmes to revitalize soil and to promote irrigation farming and reforestation  using species that   51 10-54833  can increase food availability. We reaffirm our sympathy for countries that have been struck this year by natural disasters  in particular earthquakes  and Haiti in particular  with which we share close lineage and cultural ties.  My country  Benin  will hold presidential and legislative elections in March 2011. After 20 years of democracy during which elections have been organized on the basis of manually recorded lists  my country’s Government  in collaboration with the United Nations and its development partners  has finally decided to create a computerized permanent electoral list that will ensure transparent elections and significantly reduce complaints and other post-electoral difficulties. The political class of Benin agrees unanimously on the need for such a computerized list  but differences remain with respect to the process  the timing of its implementation and its use for the presidential and legislative elections in March 2011.  I am confident that  through dialogue and Benin’s creative genius  which ensured the outstanding success of the national conference of political stakeholders in February 1990  Benin will be able to meet this challenge and once again surprise the world. I call on the United Nations and the international community to continue to support the efforts of the Government of Benin to work successfully to address the major challenges of today and the future.  We must maintain international peace and security. This is the first of the major tasks assigned to the United Nations. In spite of the tireless efforts of the Organization alongside regional organizations  humankind continues to suffer as a result of ongoing armed conflicts  the destructiveness of which leads to unimaginable suffering for affected populations.  Terrorism  which we condemn without reservation in all its forms and manifestations  also continues to indiscriminately afflict innocent civilian populations  including humanitarian workers and United Nations personnel despite the specific international protection they enjoy.  We are concerned by these serious infringements of the humanitarian principles relevant to conflict situations. We must work to strengthen the authority of international humanitarian law and the multilateral international justice institutions in order to increase their deterrence capacity with respect to serious crimes.  Here my country reiterates the importance it assigns to the responsibility to protect  and we will spare no effort to ensure its operationalization in accordance with the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations.  We appeal to all peoples and to all citizens of the world to respect the value of human life and to work in a spirit of peaceful coexistence and good-neighbourliness to resolve their disputes through cooperation  exchange and seeking mutual understanding  promoting a culture of peace and dialogue among religions for the common good of all humankind  at peace with itself.  To this end  we must pay greater attention to efforts to eradicate the underlying causes of conflict and in particular to put an end to the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons that leads to their proliferation and thus to lawlessness and insecurity in our towns and countryside.  Respect for human rights and civil liberties means that human beings must be placed at the centre of sustainable development efforts  and it is the duty of the international community to ensure this. It is essential that respecting human rights become a way of life and the essential standard that validates human behaviour on a daily basis so as to promote mutual respect  equal opportunities in life and the full realization of the potential of every individual.  In this context  I would like to highlight the important role young people and women have to play in the development of our countries. In declaring the year that began 12 August 2010 as the International Year of Youth  the General Assembly highlighted the contribution that young people make to society. We urge all Member States to give concrete substance to the International Year of Youth  in line with the situation in their countries.  The theme of the Year  “Dialogue and Mutual Understanding”  aims  moreover  to foster alliances among the generations. The Government of Benin is determined to make its modest contribution by supporting the effective holding of the United Nations Conference on Youth  which is currently being prepared  to mark the Year.  With a view to ensuring that the potential of women  who represent more than half of the population of my country  is fully realized  the Government has set up a National Institute for the Promotion of Women. A    10-54833 52  microcredit programme for the poorest women was also launched to ensure the promotion of their economic activities. To date  this programme has helped to empower almost 600 000 women by providing income-generating activities. The programme should be expanded  which will require additional financial support from the international community and  in particular  from technical and financial partners.  Promoting the rule of law at the international level requires the effective participation of all peoples in the management of world affairs in the interest of current and future generations. In particular  the representation of developing countries should be strengthened in the decision-making bodies of the international financial institutions  as should their accountability. Their institutional mandates should be redefined so that they better help to mobilize resources in support of the development of the least developed countries  while ensuring the stability of the international financial system.  The Security Council is an essential instrument for global governance. Its long-awaited reform cannot be postponed indefinitely. Reform efforts are being held hostage by the inherent contradictions in today’s international relations and remain hopelessly at a standstill despite the crucial importance we all recognize them to have for the effectiveness of the Organization. The ongoing negotiations towards reform must be carried out in good faith and with a keen sense of responsibility in order to preserve the credibility of the Organization  which has been beset by heavy liabilities.  Let us avoid trite formulations that evade the very essence of reform  which is to ensure the equitable representation of States in both categories of membership and to guarantee that the Council’s decisions have the transparency  legitimacy and authority necessary for it more effectively to uphold its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.  In this respect  Benin reaffirms  from this rostrum  Africa’s legitimate aspirations. The democratization of the United Nations also means a stronger commitment to respect for national and international law on the part of Member States.  Here Benin renews its firm commitment to continuing to contribute to the ongoing adaptation efforts of the Organization  which is solidly anchored in its main principles of the sovereign equality of States  respect for human dignity  the promotion of development cooperation and the search for the best solutions to the world’s problems.  In this spirit  I should like to conclude by making an urgent appeal for the strengthening of international cooperation. International cooperation is neither a form of social assistance nor an organized hybrid system of begging and deception. It should be based on legitimate mutual interests — a joint effort towards a contract of solidarity  which would enable us together to attain the means to forge conditions for humanity to live in greater dignity and with ever-greater creativity. This is the thought that inspires us in this year when we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the independence of 17 African countries."
"15",602,"BFA",65,2010,"At the outset  may I  on behalf of my delegation  congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss sincerely and warmly on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this sixty-fifth session. I assure him of our support to ensure a successful session. May I also extend my deepest gratitude to his predecessor  Mr. Ali Treki  who so effectively led the work of the sixty-fourth session. I extend my thanks to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his commitment and resolve in defending the ideals of the Charter.  The sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly is taking place in a difficult international environment  characterized by multiple crises of all kinds — economic  financial  food  energy  and so forth. This is also a time when the international community is wondering whether it really will be able to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. From that standpoint  fortunately  the recent High-level Plenary Meeting on the MDGs held here gives hope that the commitments made to the poorest populations will be implemented so that the world can take on a more human face and focus on social and economic well-being  particularly of the most disadvantaged. However  that will be possible only in a healthy and calm environment.   We therefore welcome once again the Climate Change Conference held in Copenhagen in December 2009. Even if it was not able to agree on a figure for reducing greenhouse gases  it nevertheless pushed forward the debate on providing assistance to the most vulnerable countries and on measures to reduce deforestation. We only hope that the commitments made  particularly in the financial area  will be honoured  and we ardently hope that the forthcoming meeting in Cancún will yield a viable environmental agreement. Such an agreement is all the more urgent in that flooding and other climate disasters occurring throughout the world with unbridled cruelty remind us of the great fragility of the environmental balance. Turning to peace and security  conflict resolution throughout the world and particularly in Africa  which is most directly concerned  remains a major challenge for the international community. While some crises have been more or less overcome  for example in West Africa  others continue to be a matter of serious concern. In Togo  open  free and transparent elections were able to be held this year to everybody’s satisfaction. Burkina Faso welcomes the ongoing political openness and appeals to that country’s partners to continue providing it with the necessary support. In Côte d’Ivoire  major progress was made with the effective disarmament of the Forces nouvelles  the publication of the electoral list and the scheduling of the first round of presidential elections for 31 October. We trust in the ability of all the people of Côte d’Ivoire to overcome the few remaining obstacles and to take up the challenge of achieving peace and lasting development. In Guinea  we still hope that the remaining obstacles that led to the postponement of the second round of presidential elections will soon be overcome. We call on all Guinean political actors to act in moderation so as to enable their country to open up quickly to democracy and to build a prosperous economy for the benefit of all.  I take this opportunity to convey once again Burkina Faso’s gratitude to the United Nations and the regional and subregional organizations that put their    10-55276 34  confidence in the facilitation and mediation of His Excellency Mr. Blaise Compaore  President of Burkina Faso  and that continue to support his many efforts for peacebuilding  security and the rule of law in West Africa.  In Darfur  the results of the Doha negotiations are encouraging and should persuade the international community to use its influence to speed up political dialogue and strengthen the operational capacity of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur. Burkina Faso is naturally concerned over the insecurity and instability in Somalia  with ongoing insurgent attacks on the Federal Transition Government and the African Union Mission in Somalia. We urge the Security Council and donor countries to fulfil their commitment to supporting the rehabilitation process for the Somali State. The results of our efforts to put an end to the reprehensible acts of piracy on the high seas will have no effect or sustainability unless we eliminate their root causes  including extreme poverty  which provides the most fertile soil.  My country is carefully following political developments in Madagascar and Niger. We welcome the initiatives taken by the transitional authorities in the two countries to organize free and transparent elections that will ensure a return to constitutional order. Turning to Western Sahara  we welcome the impetus given to the negotiations by the Secretary-General  and we call on the protagonists to pursue political dialogue with a view to a peaceful and realistic settlement of the dispute.   One cannot speak of peace and security in Africa without mentioning drugs and narcotics trafficking and their clear link with armed conflicts  the proliferation of light weapons  money-laundering  the financing of organized transnational crime and terrorism. The need to pool our efforts to deal with all this is essential and of concern to every country. The open debate of the Security Council organized by Burkina Faso on 8 December 2009 to address this scourge (see S/PV.6233) was a contribution to that effort. We hope that there will be appropriate follow-up so as to keep the international community mobilized.  The Sahelo-Saharan region has for many years been subject to recurrent terrorist attacks. Collective and cooperative efforts must be taken quickly at all levels to ensure peace and security in that part of Africa.  The situation in the Near and Middle East is strongly marked by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Iranian nuclear question. Burkina Faso welcomes the easing of the Gaza blockade and reiterates its call for a total lifting of the embargo. We welcome the direct talks under way between the parties to the conflict. A comprehensive and lasting peace is the only way to ensure the freedom of the Palestinian people in an independent State with secure and recognized borders  the security of Israel  and regional stability.   On the Iranian nuclear question  Burkina Faso hopes that common sense will prevail by reconciling Iran’s rights to acquire civilian nuclear power and the legitimate fears of the international community over military nuclear proliferation.  United Nations reform has been on our agenda for several years and some progress has been made  including the adoption on 2 July of resolution 64/289 on system-wide coherence  which  inter alia  established UN Women. We trust that other aspects of the reform  particularly of the Security Council  will be achieved within a reasonable time frame in order to correct historic injustices — particularly vis-à-vis Africa  which is the only continent not to have a permanent seat — and to create a more democratic United Nations able to take up the challenges of the world today more effectively.  We trust that this reform dynamic will promote a new spirit that will open the way to participation by the Republic of China on Taiwan in the activities of international bodies  particularly the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.   Burkina Faso reiterates its faith in multilateralism and solidarity among peoples  and to that end we stand ready to make our modest contribution to building a world of peace and justice. "
"16",645,"BGD",65,2010,"I warmly congratulate Mr. Deiss on his well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I believe his wise and experienced leadership will bring great success to the Assembly’s proceedings. I also congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his laudable contribution as Assembly President in its sixty-fourth session. I also thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless service to the United Nations and to world peace.  Bangladesh is a secular  progressive nation fulfilling the promise of democracy  good governance  human rights and the rule of law that were made by my father — the Father of the Nation  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  the greatest Bengali of all times — from this podium 36 years ago (see A/PV.2243). That has also been in consonance with the objectives of the United Nations  which remains the last abode where the hopes and aspirations of the hapless people of the world can be fulfilled.  Bangladesh has also been supporting United Nations efforts to establish democracy  human rights  peace and security  as well as taking effective steps to combat terrorism and external threats worldwide. I  too  am committed to ensuring this continuity.  Bangladesh has established an international crimes tribunal to try persons responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity  including genocide  arson and rape  committed during our war of liberation in 1971 and immediately thereafter. That action is in accord with the rule of law as reflected in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court  which we have ratified and which is aimed at bringing perpetrators of war crimes  genocide and crimes against humanity to justice. I believe that only justice can heal the unforgivable  deadly wrongs of the past.  Here  I sadly recall the evil act of terror on 15 August 1975 that took the life of my father and the Father of the Nation  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  and 18 members of my family  including my mother  sisters-in-law and my three brothers  one of whom was only 10 years old. Even I have been a target of a series of assassination attempts ever since my return home from exile in 1981.  The most horrendous period was when our secular democratic party  the Awami League  was in opposition  from 2001 to 2006. At that time thousands of our party workers  supporters and followers of the religious minority who voted for our secular party were mercilessly killed in systematic terrorist acts of the BNP/Jamaat-e-Islami alliance Government. The most audacious act was the dastardly open grenade attack on 21 August 2004 directed against me at a public rally being held to protest those terrorist attacks and killings. By the time a dozen grenades had taken their toll  24 innocent people  including our party’s Secretary for Women’s Affairs  Mrs. Ivy Rahman — the wife of our current President — lay dead  and over 500 people were seriously injured.  There have also been attempts on members of my family  but never have we bowed before the forces of terror. As victims of repeated terrorist attacks  my family and I know this menace well. Clearly  our rejection of terrorism is total  as is our determination to eliminate it in all its forms. I want to unequivocally state that terrorism will not be allowed on the soil of Bangladesh  and that is precisely why we are a party to all terrorism-related United Nations conventions and accord them our full support.  Our firm policy against terrorism and our love for peace led me to negotiate the 1997 Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord  thus ending decades of internal conflict  and a peaceful resolution of the violent uprising of our paramilitary border forces in 2009. In the international sphere  our commitment to peace  which is essential for development  is reflected in our unflinching support for United Nations peacekeeping missions. Since 1988 Bangladesh has sent 97 000 troops to 24 countries as part of 32 such missions. In that period we have lost the precious lives of 92 valiant soldiers.  Our present troop contribution has made Bangladesh number one among countries contributing troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations. Sadly  despite that involvement  our presence in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO)   15 10-55109  remains negligible  as is our voice in planning strategies of peacekeeping missions. In all fairness  we should have proportionate representation in DPKO.  Bangladesh has been adversely affected by global warming  food insecurity  population displacement and diminished biodiversity  among other problems  and is faced with serious threats caused by climate change and global warming. Although our share of carbon gas emissions is negligible  we are their worst victim. The increasing frequency and ferocity of floods  cyclones  droughts and other natural disasters caused by that phenomenon continue to create havoc through the lives lost and the resources destroyed.  Consequently  attaining the Millennium Development Goals is becoming a more difficult challenge. Climate migrants are already overcrowding our cities  putting great stress on our limited infrastructure facilities and causing social disorder. The situation could become catastrophic with a one-metre rise in the sea level due to global warming. That would inundate one quarter of Bangladesh  impacting 11 per cent of our population and leading to mass migration.  To meet those challenges  we have adopted a 134-point adaptation and mitigation action plan. Those points include dredging major rivers to restrict flooding  recovering cultivable lands for settling displaced people and increasing capacity to produce more grain foods. Other plans include afforesting 20 per cent of the land area by 2015  creating a huge carbon sink; protecting biodiversity; strengthening coasts and river banks with green belts; modernizing disaster management with community participation; developing crop varieties attuned to climate change; changing agricultural practices; using clean coal technology; and adopting nuclear power and renewable energy. Meanwhile  over 14 000 shelters for cyclone victims have been strategically located to cope with cyclonic disasters.  Implementing the action plan requires enormous funds. An immediate measure has been the establishment of a Climate Change Trust Fund with our own resources  and a Climate Change Resilience Fund with assistance from development partners. At the international level  at the fifteenth Climate Change Conference of Parties — COP 15 — last year  we worked hard for a legally binding agreement and for an international climate fund to assist countries most vulnerable to climate change. The compromise was the Copenhagen Accord  which has so far failed to deliver its promises.  Therefore  I urge the world leaders at the sixteenth Conference — COP 16 — this year to conclude  in their wisdom  a positive agreement based on the Bali Plan of Action  with agreed cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and real contributions to the international climate fund. I also urge them to adopt  at COP 16  measures to ameliorate the adverse impacts of climate change on the most vulnerable countries  like Bangladesh  small island developing States like the Maldives  and landlocked countries like Bhutan and Nepal  among other least developed countries (LDCs).  The world is yet to recover from the world economic crisis  and LDCs as well as developed countries are suffering from reduced exports. Those crises are due to inequity and injustice resulting from an unfair international structure  which remains mostly unchanged. The Bretton Woods institutions must now accommodate a greater presence of developing countries  especially least developed countries. While the Bretton Woods institutions can deal with long-term development assistance  Bangladesh proposes the establishment of a special fund under United Nations auspices to deal exclusively with Special Drawing Rights and grants. We also propose that all stakeholders respect country-led ownership of all development projects  as enshrined in the Accra Agenda for Action.  The least developed countries surely welcome the development assistance they receive from developed countries. They would  however  benefit more through receiving liberal trade concessions such as duty and quota-free market access  trade capacity-building  et cetera. Least developed countries also seek a speedy end to the World Trade Organization’s Doha Round of the World Trade Organization trade negotiations and fulfilment of the commitments by the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to provide 0.7 per cent of gross national income to official development assistance  of which 0.2 per cent will be directed at least developed countries  as affirmed in the Brussels Programme of Action.  The least developed countries have also been affected by unemployment at home and by obstacles to migration for jobs abroad. Since remittances form a significant part of their gross domestic product     10-55109 16  economic recovery measures should assure employment opportunities and all rights of migrant workers  especially those from least developed countries.  However  amid the travails of the past years  Bangladesh has fared reasonably well in maintaining an annual GDP growth rate of 6 per cent. That was possible due to our pragmatic policies on food production  agriculture  rural development  inflation control and keeping food and essentials prices within reach of the poor. During our previous Government  from 1996 to 2001  our policies on food security made Bangladesh self-sufficient in food  which led to our winning the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Ceres Award. This time around  with the implementation of the national food policy  aimed at stable prices of fuel  fertilizer  seeds and other farm inputs  our Government has succeeded again in ensuring sustained food supply to all.  Our Government’s aim is also to use information and communications technology (ICT) to accelerate our socio-economic development. Therefore  we are implementing ICT Act 2009 and ICT Policy 2009 to build the requisite infrastructure and extend ICT to every nook and corner of Bangladesh. Already  educational institutions  local government institutions and rural communities are being connected to Internet services. The process includes an e-centre for rural communities  connecting 8 500 post offices; a high-tech park; a network of e governance; and efforts to strengthen the telecommunication network and satellite communication.  Our e-services are now focused on improving agricultural information delivery  market access  education  health care  early warning systems for disasters  law and order  and social safety net payments. Also being implemented is an aggressive e-leadership programme among members of Parliament  top policymakers  field administrators and local administrators. We had already transformed 100 Union Parishads to host e-centres in 2009  and we are now expediting the process to cover all 4 500 Union Parishads by the end of this year. In short  our Government is determined to achieve a digital Bangladesh and transform it into a middle-income country by 2021  the golden jubilee year of our nation’s independence.  Simultaneously  our Government’s aim is to attain 100 per cent primary school enrolment by 2011 and 100 per cent literacy rate by 2014. Our highest budget allocation goes to education. Tuition and books are now free for students up to grade 12. Computer and Internet facilities are being provided free of charge to schools in order to familiarize students with their use. To encourage school attendance  we have started providing lunch to students and cash incentives to parents.  Though Bangladesh has achieved the Millennium Development Goal target of gender equality at the secondary level  our plan is to provide free tuition to girls up to the undergraduate level. This is because we firmly believe that women’s equal involvement is vital for a nation’s development. Gender equity and human development are our top priority concerns.  Our Government has revived the national women’s development policy  adopted during our last tenure of office  that is  1996 to 2001. At present  besides the Prime Minister  the leader of the opposition  the deputy leader and a whip  there are five other women Cabinet ministers and 45 members of Parliament in reserved seats. Moreover  19 women members of Parliament have been directly elected. Women also occupy 30 per cent of reserved seats in all local governments. They are encouraged to participate in politics and administration  and are recruited in all professions  including the armed services. They are also serving in United Nations peacekeeping operations.  We have made arrangements to provide pensions to distressed and widowed women  as well as residential accommodation for both men and women in old peoples’ homes. Our social safety nets also include programmes for minorities  the marginalized  the disabled and the mentally challenged; ashrayan  or homes for the homeless; the “one home  one farm” policy to alleviate poverty; and cash and food transfer programmes.  A new policy provides for the employment of one member from every poor family. Another new initiative is the national services policy for providing youth and women with employment and skills development. Moreover  research opportunities have led to new discoveries  particularly with respect to climate-change-resilient crops. A recent success is genome sequencing of the jute fibre  ensuring improved quality   17 10-55109  of jute products  a biodegradable option to hazardous synthetic products.  Health is another area receiving special attention  with the implementation of the national health policy adopted during our previous term of office. This policy provides for the establishment of one community clinic for every 6 000 people. Our plan is to locate 18 000 such clinics in the first phase  to extend basic health services into people’s homes. For safe motherhood  a national strategy for maternal health has been adopted  with a programme to reduce the infant mortality rate to 15 from the current 54 per 1 000 live births.  Our target is to complete 100 per cent immunization by the end of our present tenure of Government. Since my Government assumed office  the maternal mortality rate has been reduced from 2.9 to 2.6 and infant mortality to such a significant extent that our successes have been recognized with an award by the United Nations.  Indeed  despite the recent world food  energy  economic and climate change crises  Bangladesh  with the support of United Nations agencies and bilateral and multilateral partners  has made satisfactory progress. In fact  our achievement with respect to MDG 1  on poverty alleviation  MDG 2  on universal primary education  and MDG 3  on gender equality and women’s empowerment  are encouraging and on track. Our Government  through its sincere efforts  intends to raise 12 million people out of poverty  which would halve the number of people now living in that sad state by the MDG deadline of 2015.  Our unflinching commitment to peace finds expression in our annual flagship Assembly resolution on the culture of peace (see resolution 64/80). Recent years have shown an extraordinary record of sponsorships because of the reference to the International Mother Language Day. Ever since the Day was adopted by UNESCO in recognition of the language martyrs who gave their lives in 1952 for Bangla  their mother tongue  it has been celebrated throughout the world with growing fervour every year. Since Bangla is spoken by nearly 300 million people worldwide and has a rich heritage in literature  history and other fields  our Parliament adopted a resolution requesting the United Nations to declare Bangla as one of its official languages. I fervently appeal to Member States for acceptance of our very legitimate request.  Every passing day  the peoples of the world are being drawn closer together  as one village  with quickly developing technologies and new challenges such as climate change  terrorism and economic interdependence. Indeed  our destiny is now one  as are our burdens and responsibilities. It is now obvious that only by mobilizing and optimizing our synergies will it be possible for us to create a world of shared peace and prosperity. We have no alternative but to discard our self-centred  short-sighted interests and work in unison for a world that our children  and theirs  will inherit  so that they will remember us with fondness and in gratitude.  May Bangladesh live forever. Long live the United Nations. "
"17",691,"BGR",65,2010,"Every year we come together in this great Hall of the United Nations  to    10-55264 32  reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism. Nations big and small  rich and poor  gather from the four corners of the world here at the United Nations  driven by the conviction that  if we work together  we will find solutions to the challenges of today and tomorrow. As these challenges grow and become more interconnected  so grows our conviction that only through cooperation and dialogue can we resolve them. This is the fundamental belief with which  for 55 years  the Bulgarian delegation  like many others  has come to the United Nations.  Like every day  today will be unique  because our actions on this day will forge our tomorrows. We can spend our time dwelling on the past  or we can invest our time in the future that we will all face together. Today  our world faces a complicated web of challenges  but also of opportunities. We face the challenge of addressing global climate change by creating opportunities for sustainable development. We face the challenge of reducing the conflicts and opportunities that come from providing sufficient clean water to millions of people. We face the challenge of developing an ethical market economy and the countless opportunities that will emerge from reducing the poverty gap. We face the challenge of reducing ethnic conflicts  terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the opportunities that come from good governance  democracy and freedom. We may also  perhaps  address the most paramount challenge of our time: to prove wrong all those who believe that the world is heading towards an irreversible clash of civilizations — because none of the global challenges that we face today can be understood  tackled or addressed without respect for different opinions  without dialogue between faiths and without adherence to the global values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. On behalf of the Government of Bulgaria  I congratulate Mr. Deiss on the assumption of the presidency of this Assembly at this sixty-fifth session. Our appreciation also goes to Mr. Ali Treki for his leadership during the previous session  and to Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his efforts to strengthen and promote the United Nations. Let me begin by welcoming the results of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Regardless of the fact that efforts to achieve the MDGs have not stayed on course  their attainment is still within our reach. Reaffirming the principle of solidarity between those who have and those who need is of the essence. My country faces challenges imposed by the global economic and financial crisis. We have  however  committed ourselves to develop our own donor capacity  and so we shall. We shall do so  because Bulgaria — like a number of countries that have joined the European Union (EU) since the fall of the Berlin Wall — understands that the solidarity that was extended to us now needs to be extended by us to those less fortunate. To be effective  we shall work in close coordination with our partners  avoid duplication and aim at addressing the root causes — not the symptoms — of today’s problems. Otherwise  we will not be building a better tomorrow. In this effort the role of the United Nations will always remain vitally important  particularly in helping to mitigate the development impact of the crisis on the less developed and most vulnerable countries.  As dangerous as the current global crisis is  it also gives us a chance to green our economies  particularly by putting them on a sustainable and low-carbon path. This year  2010  has been proclaimed as the International Year of Biodiversity. Economic growth and the preservation of the environment must go hand-in-hand across the globe. Today there can be no excuses — neither in developed countries  nor in developing countries — because any excuse that we find today will cost us more tomorrow. That is why Bulgaria believes that the United Nations must be given the tools to respond adequately to the increasing challenges of environmental protection.  Today  much more so than in the past  we see increased demand and pressure on international humanitarian efforts. The devastating earthquake in Haiti last year killed hundreds of thousands and left a staggering 20 per cent of the population homeless. Haiti’s call was  however  heeded throughout the globe. Allow me to praise the work of the United Nations and its agencies in responding quickly  but also pay tribute to all of the countries  non governmental organizations and individuals who came quickly to Haiti’s assistance. The Bulgarian Government and people were quick to respond by providing financial and in kind assistance  including educational opportunities to young Haitians whose universities had been destroyed.   33 10-55264   This year we have to help in the struggle of the 20 million people in Pakistan who have been affected by the terrible floods that have wrecked lives  ruined crops and destroyed economic opportunities. The Secretary-General and the United Nations were swift to react and deserve praise for their efforts  as does the rapid reaction of the European Union  the United States  India and other partners around the world. Allow me to use this forum to call on all to strengthen their efforts in assisting the people of Pakistan. However  I also call on Governments across the globe to help in removing barriers  so as to assist the Pakistani economy in its recovery. Helping today and creating opportunities tomorrow — that should be our goal in a country that is vital to global stability and security. In this  let me assure you that Bulgaria will also shoulder its share of the needed solidarity. Already the Government and the Bulgarian Red Cross have launched a nation-wide campaign to raise funds and contribute to the rebuilding efforts in Pakistan.  No matter how successful we are in our development and humanitarian efforts  the benefits cannot fully be borne in an insecure and unstable environment. Allow me to briefly look closer to home — the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean. The European Union was created to make war impossible in a continent that has seen at least a century of conflicts. In Europe  however  we have unfinished business. Europe will not be whole and complete until our neighbours in the Balkans join our Union. It falls on us — those who joined the European Union late  not by their own choice  but because of the ideological divisions of the cold war — to say it loud and clear: to make war impossible in the Balkans we must see all countries that have emerged from the former Yugoslavia become part of the European Union. This is our historic mission. It is our destiny.  Bulgaria  which has struggled with its own transition and accession to the European Union  knows the benefits and the challenges best. That is why today I am proud to stand here and commend the General Assembly for unanimously adopting resolution 64/298  approving the joint EU Serbia compromise text on the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the declaration of independence by Kosovo. Bulgaria supported it wholeheartedly  because we firmly believe that dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina is key  both to the stability of the region and to the European perspective of our neighbours. It will be a difficult process  charged with emotion and scarred by history  but it will be a process that can today lay the foundations of a better tomorrow for all. It is a process that the Bulgarian Government is not just willing  but eager to support  and will lend all necessary assistance to the efforts of the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security.  In Bosnia and Herzegovina the international community faces many challenges  but the struggle between the fears of yesterday and the opportunities of tomorrow can be resolved today by the people of Bosnia themselves. Bulgaria will  more actively than ever  contribute to this reconciliation  because we believe that our role in South-Eastern Europe and beyond is to bring people together  not divide them; to seek solutions  not to watch from the sidelines.  We must constantly reaffirm our commitment to bring our neighbours in the Western Balkans into the European Union when they meet the criteria for membership. But our neighbours also must reaffirm their own commitment to undertaking often very difficult reforms and strengthening regional cooperation and good-neighbourly relations.  There are cynics who say that the world cannot live together  that for peace to exist we must build walls of separation between peoples  religions and ethnic communities; cynics who say that civilizations must clash. I come from a country that is in a turbulent part of the world  yet we have managed to prove that people of different religions — Christians  Muslims and Jews  and of different ethnicities — Bulgarians  Turks and Armenians  can live together.  Bulgaria has seen stellar moments in its history  for example  when civil society rose during the Second World War and refused to allow its Jewish population to be sent to concentration camps  or when it integrated its Turkish population after the end of communism. But  it has also seen its dark moments — when it failed to save the Jewish populations of occupied Northern Greece and Vardar Macedonia  or when the Communist regime expelled a large part of our Muslim citizens to Turkey. Our history has taught us to be able to distinguish between good and bad. Our history proves that the cynics are wrong  that people can live together in peace.  That is why Bulgaria cannot remain uninterested in the Middle East. We believe that  just as the Jewish    10-55264 34  people have a homeland in the State of Israel  so the Palestinian people have the right to an independent State of Palestine that lives in peace with its neighbours. During the past months we have all witnessed the efforts of the United States Administration to restart the direct negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians. Many of us have made passionate speeches on the need and urgency of peace. Today  the Palestinian and Israeli leaders face the historic challenge of looking to tomorrow and not being tied down by yesterday. The Middle East cannot afford a failed peace process. The world cannot afford a peace process that does not have a comprehensive end goal in sight.  Today we must all recognize that hard decisions are called for and lend our full support to President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu to help them walk the hard road to peace. Obstacles should be overcome and preconditions should be removed. If the leaders of Palestine believe that settlement policy is an obstacle to peace  the leaders of Israel must refrain from such activities in order to give peace a chance. If the leaders of Israel believe that no preconditions to a final settlement should be put in place  then the Palestinian leaders must refrain from such actions in order to give peace a chance.  The choice today is not between peace negotiations and economic development  because peace and prosperity go hand in hand. No one should feel singled out or left behind  because the enemies of peace are many — those who feel that walls are safer than bridges and those who feel that religions cannot coexist. You can take away a man’s life  but you ultimately cannot take away his faith or dignity.  This is why I call on all Members of the United Nations to stand firmly behind the efforts of the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to achieve peace. In doing this  we must recognize the legitimate concerns of both sides — Israel’s security and the viability of a Palestinian State.  In this effort we should not forget the 1.5 million people who live in Gaza — Palestinians who have the right to a better life  just like the children of Sderot have the right to go to school without the threat of rockets. We have an obligation to help open up access to Gaza without compromising the security of Israel. History has proven that isolation and deprivation breed radicalism  and it is in the interest of peace that more opportunities be created.  Today the world faces other grave security challenges that will shape our tomorrow. We must reconfirm our commitment to halting the spread of nuclear weapons. This mission is above politics  diplomacy  national ambitions and personal egos. It is our universal obligation and a joint commitment that we undertook 40 years ago. Bulgaria believes that every nation must put a strengthened Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) at the centre of its national diplomacy. The uncovering of clandestine nuclear networks has brought the spectre of non State actors equipped with weapons of mass destruction closer. We must not allow this to happen. All nations must recognize that the nuclear non proliferation regime is undermined if violators are allowed to act with impunity. We consider all States parties  including the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  to be bound by their NPT obligations.  Leaving the NPT cannot be without consequences. Justified concerns  however  remain also about the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran. We call on Iran to deploy the necessary confidence-building measures to provide for greater transparency on its nuclear activities. Bulgaria believes that it is important to find a diplomatic solution. The recent efforts by Turkey and Brazil illustrate that there is will in the international community for dialogue. Therefore  a swift return to the negotiation table and full compliance with United Nations Security Council resolutions  as well as International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) standards and safeguards is a must.  International terrorism is one of the most serious contemporary threats to global peace and security. It cannot be justified by any political  philosophical  ideological  racial or ethnic considerations  nor by any ideology. The end goal of terrorism is to hinder our efforts to guarantee human rights  basic freedoms and democracy. Within the framework of the European Union  Bulgaria has endorsed the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. I appeal for a prompt finalization of the negotiations to reach a comprehensive convention on counter-terrorism.  An old nefarious practice has re-emerged on the high seas — piracy. Bulgaria has been directly affected by the escalating activities and audacity of the pirates   35 10-55264  in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia. The fight against piracy leaves much to be desired  however. We need a firm international legal framework for the trial  detention and imprisonment of persons suspected of having committed acts of piracy. We need coordinated actions on the high seas to protect our shipping. Perhaps most of all  we need to address the root causes of piracy — poverty  isolation and lack of opportunity.  In Afghanistan  we face a threat that demands the continued military and civilian commitment on the part of the international community  which hinges on two important factors. Firstly  the ability of the Afghan Government to pave the way for reconciliation  tackle corruption and deliver services to its people and the renewed commitment of the international community and regional neighbours to strengthen the Afghan National Security Forces  while maintaining the pressure on radicals and insurgents and limiting their scope of action.  In these tasks the coordinated efforts of all  but foremost of the United Nations  NATO and the European Union  are vital. I would like to strongly support the work of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  Staffan de Mistura  in Afghanistan. Their efforts should be appreciated and fully supported by the international community. I want to also pay tribute to the brave men and women of all International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) contributing nations  including the roughly 600 Bulgarian troops  who risk their lives to bring security to the people of Afghanistan.  Bulgaria’s commitment to the future of Afghanistan is unfaltering  because we understand that it is our joint obligation to bring security to that tortured country  whose people deserve to be able to enjoy the freedoms and opportunities that many of us have. Bulgaria has increased its input to ISAF  including through more training units  which will work to build the capacity of the Afghan security forces. We continue to support the European Union Police Mission in Afghanistan  which  jointly with NATO’s Training Mission  plays an important role. We support the Afghan Government’s peace and reintegration programme  in which the key role should be played by the Afghan State. Our commitment to Afghanistan is based on our firm belief that  if we succeed today  we will all live safer tomorrow.  A comprehensive security system can rest only on a robust partnership between the United Nations and regional organizations. This is why Bulgaria believes that the partnership between the European Union and the United Nations is a strategic one. As the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy  Catherine Ashton  put it  “Our commitment to the multilateral system of global governance through the UN and other bodies is clear” and we work “with conviction and clarity on the major challenges that face us  be they climate change  poverty  conflict or terrorism”.  The transformation of the EU into a legal subject of international relations after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has to be adequately reflected in a resolution of the General Assembly regarding the representation of the EU at the United Nations.  In closing  let me briefly touch on the reform of the United Nations. Bulgaria is convinced that if we are to effectively tackle the challenges of tomorrow  we must continuously adapt and improve the United Nations system. Therefore it is imperative that we continue the course of reforms initiated by the 2005 World Summit.  We believe that the reform of the Security Council is part of a comprehensive agenda for change at the United Nations. Bulgaria declares itself in favour of an enlargement of the Security Council capable of generating the largest possible consensus. In that context  Bulgaria has endorsed the enlargement of the Council in its two categories — permanent and non permanent members.  I started by reiterating our firm commitment to multilateralism. The agenda of the United Nations is broad and diverse  and I have attempted  on behalf of the Government of Bulgaria  to briefly touch on just some of the issues that ought to be discussed in this forum.  Our commitment to multilateralism can be equalled only by our unfaltering belief that dialogue and diplomacy can achieve more than can confrontation and war. More than half a century ago  the United Nations came together and enshrined those principles as the cornerstones of international law. Since then  with varying degrees of success  we have attempted to live by them. It is time for us to realize that the global challenges of tomorrow can be tackled only by collective action today. Nothing is impossible     10-55264 36  but only if we work together  discuss  disagree and agree  but share a goal — a peaceful and prosperous world that is safe for all. "
"18",736,"BHR",65,2010,"First of all  it gives me pleasure to convey to the Assembly the greetings of His Majesty King Hamad bin Issa Al Khalifa of Bahrain  and His Majesty’s best wishes for every success. I also congratulate Mr. Deiss on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly and thank His Excellency Ali Abdussalam Treki  President at the previous session  for his skilful management of its deliberations. I also commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon for his efforts and contributions to international issues.  We all know that since its inception the United Nations has scored many successes in promoting collective international action. It has undertaken a great many initiatives and conceived many ideas beneficial to humanity  including the innovative Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Today  we view those Goals as the principal topic on which we all agree.  As the representative of my country  I shall touch on the challenges facing humanity in various fields  whether they concern solutions to problems between nations or realization of peoples’ ambitions  highlighting some of the achievements that  taken together  can serve the common good.  The most important challenge facing our world today is achieving the MDGs by 2015. We know that many States have made huge and outstanding efforts to that end. In this context  the Kingdom of Bahrain holds a leading and positive position  particularly in the field of social welfare  free  quality basic education  health care  improvement of child and maternal health  the empowerment of women  gender equality  the    10-55122 44  expansion of the social security net for the poorest of the population  our unemployment insurance scheme  and expansion of the scope of vocational training to enhance Bahrain’s human resources.  I am honoured to stand before the Assembly as representative of a country actively pursuing its international responsibilities. When we refer to the notion of a modern State as the most important political  social  cultural and economic product of the modern history of the Kingdom of Bahrain  it is because whatever achievements have been realized can be attributed to good governance — governance that has encouraged and supported initiatives and political and organizational visions aimed at building the institutions and capacities that can enhance the principles of a modern  organized society. Such a society is faithful to its values in every area  based on State institutions that guarantee all talented citizens the opportunity to create and innovate and to be an active participant in our contemporary world.  The Economic Vision 2030 for Bahrain  launched by His Majesty King Hamad bin Issa Al Khalifa on 23 October 2008  is an historic turning point and a gateway to economic reform  and a completion of political reform. It lays down a long-term vision of the future tracks of the national economy up to 2030. It aims to ensure the transformation of the current economy from one based on oil revenues into an internationally competitive and productive system  planned by the Government but led by a vibrant private sector. The outcome will be a growing Bahraini middle class enjoying a high standard of living  due to increased productivity and well-paid jobs. This Vision aims to establish a society based on the principles of sustainability  competitiveness and justice.  The financial crisis that has affected the international economy since 2008 and the ensuing sovereign debt crisis in Europe  austerity measures  reform and restructuring of the banking system  increased State intervention in matters of banking and economy in various countries — all this has led to a prominent role for the Group of 20 (G-20) in responding to financial and economic crises  due to the fact that it represents some 90 per cent of the world economy. Consequently  the time has come for the G-20  and other blocs such as 3-G  to play a leading role in developing and enhancing a common action from within the United Nations and its various institutions and organs by setting up plans for collective action aimed at enhancing countries’ capacity to address future crises and to achieve an open and integrated economy. That is in line with the constructive thoughts of the President of the General Assembly in this regard.  The settlement of conflicts and disputes between States  conflicts that we ourselves created  is a daily concern for all of us. Those conflicts are either of an ideological or ethnic nature  or are caused by people occupying the land of other peoples and evicting them from their homes and homelands. The conflicts divert our attention from more important concerns  including addressing poverty  ignorance  epidemics and natural disasters  which take a heavy toll and impede human creativity. Limited national interests of one State or another that completely avoid considering the common global good are largely responsible for this state of affairs.  One of the most important among these issues is the Arab-Israeli conflict  which is located in our region. We have been at an impasse for decades  as failure has followed hopeful efforts and our optimism has been clouded by frustration because of the continued backtracking of the peace process. Yet we persevere and cherish the hope of achieving a just  permanent and comprehensive peace that will restore rights to legitimate owners and open doors for mutual acceptance of others as neighbours  friends and partners fully sharing the respect and commitment required.  In this connection  we value the historic commitment and tireless efforts of President Barack Obama of the United States of America and his Administration to give a strong impetus to the peace process in the Middle East and to renew hope by relaunching direct negotiations between Palestine and Israel with a view to settling this chronic conflict.  These precious efforts  however  require the continued support of all parties concerned and their unwavering commitment to take the necessary steps to achieve coexistence through enhanced communication and outreach. There should be an opportunity for each party to convince the other to coexist as a neighbour and a partner in the region  and not an ill-intentioned or treacherous enemy. Our commitment to the Arab Peace Initiative is one clear example. We are committed to that Initiative and all its provisions aimed at achieving a genuine peace.   45 10-55122   One of the basic tenets of our foreign policy is our determination to see security  stability and development prevail. In that respect we look forward to a safe and prosperous Iraq that is able to check any foreign intervention in its domestic affairs  an Iraq faithful to its Arab-Islamic identity and inclusive of all its ethnic and cultural affiliations.  As regards the Islamic Republic of Iran  we are keenly interested in its stability and its people’s prosperity. We look forward to it playing a vital role in order to eliminate the ghost of discord around its nuclear programme. We welcome its commitment to a peaceful nuclear programme and stress the need for total transparency and full compliance with the requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  On the other hand  with regard to the sisterly United Arab Emirates islands occupied by Iran  settlement of the question through direct negotiations or referral to the International Court of Justice would constitute a vital step and a foundation for regional cohesion and understanding that would generate the stability necessary for development  which would be in the interest of all the peoples of the region.  As for Yemen  its stability is a pillar for the stability of the region as a whole. The Kingdom of Bahrain therefore reaffirms its full support to the Republic of Yemen in all its efforts to combat terrorism and protect its national security. Bahrain calls on the international community to provide support and assistance to that brotherly country  either through bilateral channels or through the group of Friends of Yemen.  Regarding the situation in the Sudan  we welcome the agreement signed by the Government of the Sudan and the concerned Sudanese parties  and we commend the sisterly State of Qatar for its considerable efforts in that matter. We look forward to completion of the current negotiations on Darfur within the framework of the agreement signed to preserve the unity of brotherly Sudan.  Resolving those disputes will enable us to address the real challenges to which we should devote our common attention: challenges of security and terrorism and challenges of devastating natural disasters  such as the tragic ordeals which affected the sisterly Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Republic of Haiti — respectively  the unprecedented catastrophic floods and the devastating earthquake. We express our solidarity with those countries and hope they will overcome their adversity with assistance and support from the international community commensurate with the enormity of the disasters.  Terrorism is a multifaceted global phenomenon that affects the entire world through criminal terrorist acts perpetrated against many countries. It exploits discourse to stir up violence and to divide countries and communities  thus contradicting its original mission of providing spiritual counsel and guidance. It utilizes mass media for the same purpose. The best way to combat terrorism is to monitor and expose its funding sources. That requires global consensus on a transparent international financial system to regulate the transfer of those funds.  For the international community to address these serious challenges and threats  States must be in a position to play their role fully through strengthened concepts of political participation  democratic practices  human rights  rule of law  judicial and institutional reform  including freedom of opinion and expression  and involving society in sharing responsibilities.  In concluding  I would like to state that restructuring international relations and forming more inclusive alliances requires a higher degree of respect for the opinions and values of others. That is consistent with our commitment to pursue the noble purposes and principles embodied in the Charter: peace  security  friendly relations and international cooperation among nations and peoples. My country reaffirms before the Assembly its resolve to play its role as an effective member of the international community and to actively participate and take initiatives in efforts for the good and prosperity of all."
"19",774,"BHS",65,2010,"On behalf of the Government and people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  I congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session  and I assure him of my country’s and my delegation’s full support and cooperation. I also extend sincere congratulations to his predecessor for his stewardship of this Assembly during the sixty-fourth session.  I also take this opportunity to express condolences on behalf of the Government and the people of the Bahamas to the Government and people of Pakistan for the loss of lives and property sustained as a result of devastating floods affecting their region. The Government and the people of the Bahamas stand in solidarity with Pakistan.  One of the greatest challenges of the global economic and financial crisis has been the loss in speed towards achieving the development goals  including the Millennium Development Goals. We are encouraged by the decline in the number of people living in absolute poverty and the reported increased access to primary and secondary education for some. We are mindful that high levels of infant mortality  unsatisfactory reduction in the rate of maternal mortality  continued high incidences of sexual violence against women and a rise in the prevalence of HIV continue to persist in many countries.  The World Health Organization forecasts that between 2006 and 2015  deaths from non-communicable diseases will increase worldwide by some 17 per cent. The increasing risks and high prevalence of non-communicable diseases are exacting heavy tolls on finances and health systems of countries like the Bahamas. Hence we welcome the adoption of resolution 64/265  which calls for a high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly next September to address the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases.  The Bahamas continues to pledge the highest priority on attaining and achieving the Millennium Development Goals. We fully expect to achieve most if not all of the goals and targets identified. Still  we are not out of the woods. The fallout from the global economic and financial crisis continues to impact the chief engine and principal employer in our country  tourism  and to slow recovery and expansion in other segments of our economy. My Government has accelerated the implementation of a planned programme of national infrastructure upgrade and expansion  with a view to upgrading the country’s infrastructure in order to accommodate new growth and development when the global economy rebounds.  We believe it is critical that greater attention be given to achieving a more transparent international credit rating system that takes fully into account the needs and concerns of developing countries. Greater participation by developing countries is also required in key international norm- and standard-setting bodies in financial regulation and supervision  including the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. It is also our view that there is an important role for the United Nations in this process  particularly in the area of institutional strengthening.  We are pleased by the considerable progress made in enhancing our social safety net  expanding unemployment benefits and introducing a national prescription drug programme designed to ensure that the most vulnerable sectors of our society — infants and school-age children  and the elderly — receive prescription medication  regardless of their ability to pay. And we are also pleased that  notwithstanding forced reductions in Government expenditures across the board  every child in the Bahamas continues to be assured of a place in Government-operated schools  from primary to high school.  Overshadowing our successes is the ever-present threat posed by climate change. The Bahamas is the fifth most vulnerable country to rising sea levels. We are a country of negligible greenhouse gases and negligible gas emissions; still  we will suffer catastrophic results if emissions are not stabilized and reduced worldwide. Indeed  science demonstrates that a two degree Celsius change in temperature will result in a sea-level rise of more than two metres. Such an occurrence would submerge 80 per cent of our territory.  The Bahamas therefore joins with other small island developing States (SIDS) in reiterating the call to the international community  and particularly to developed countries  to undertake urgent and decisive action to significantly reduce emissions of all greenhouse gases  and also to implement fast action strategies. We similarly call for increased financial and technological support of SIDS  and our particularly vulnerable countries  as we struggle to adapt to the   13 10-55264  adverse impacts of climate change. As such  we look forward with considerable anticipation to the December Conference in Cancún.  The Bahamas draws attention to the importance of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States  as that programme remains the blueprint for action on sustainable development for SIDS  as was subsequently reaffirmed in the Mauritius Strategy. In the Bahamas we have an unwavering political commitment to sustainability as the cardinal principle for national development strategies. And in the area of biodiversity  significant achievements have been made in establishing and expanding marine  coastal and terrestrial protected areas. We are also well along with the development of a national energy policy  with potential for renewable energy.  It is impossible for my country to note the high incidence of catastrophic natural disasters being experienced around the world and not acknowledge the plight of our great neighbour  Haiti. Haiti and its people are a priority concern for the Bahamas and the Caribbean Community subregion  as they are for the entire international community. None of us  however  were under any illusion that the recovery and reconstruction of Haiti  in the wake of the devastating January earthquake  would be anything less than a Herculean task. In the immediate aftermath of the disaster  billions of dollars were pledged and the wider community of nations vowed to stay the course and work to ensure that Haiti gained a footing on the path to sustainable growth and development.  There has been some progress in Haiti over the past nine and a half months — but not nearly enough. Millions of internally displaced people continue to languish in makeshift tent cities  with inadequate shelter or protection  and most of the rubble from that January earthquake still lies where it fell. It is imperative  therefore  that the United Nations continue in its pivotal role of mobilizing international assistance for Haiti and assisting with the recovery and reconstruction.  International peace and security remain a concern to all of us. The recently held second review of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy underscored that we must renew our efforts to combat terrorism in an effective and integrated manner. I reiterate my Government’s commitment to full implementation of the Strategy and renew the call for completion of negotiations on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. The Bahamas is a full partner in the international fight to combat terrorism and other transnational criminal activities. We currently serve as Chair of the Inter American Committee against Terrorism. We were also pleased to host this past June a subregional workshop on counter-terrorism financing  organized by the Organization of American States in cooperation with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.  The Security Council is central to international efforts aimed at fostering peace and improving security around the globe. We believe that the Council’s efforts in this regard would be strengthened if its composition better reflected the geopolitical realities of the world. Towards that end  the Bahamas lends its voice to the call for increased urgency in efforts to make the Security Council more representative  accountable  democratic and transparent.  Crime and threats to security continue to occupy the minds of the people of the Bahamas and indeed of the Caribbean subregion. International traffic in illicit drugs and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons have for many years disrupted the lives of peace-loving citizens of the Caribbean. Governments like my own have been required to dedicate increased portions of our annual budgets to the fight against crime. The seemingly unlimited resources of the illegal cartels continue to render our efforts insufficient. Hence  we look forward with anticipation to the 2012 Conference  whose objective is the conclusion of an arms trade treaty. We fully endorse  in that regard  calls from fellow Caribbean countries for the treaty to be comprehensive in scope  with provisions for all categories of weapons.  My Government also confirms its commitment to the Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. We were pleased with the outcome document of the Fourth Biennial Meeting of States (A/CONF.192/BMS/2010/3)  which was adopted by consensus in June.  I record the appreciation of my Government for the technical assistance recently received from the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Latin America and the Caribbean in the area of firearms destruction and stockpile    10-55264 14  management. We look forward always to assistance in the future.  The Bahamas applauds the General Assembly’s proclamation of the year beginning on 12 August 2010 as the International Year of Youth  under the theme of dialogue and mutual understanding. We believe that the overwhelming majority of our young people are creative and law-abiding citizens. They will doubtless contribute and be a credit to their community and their country. Regrettably  however  a significant minority  not unlike troubled youth throughout the world  find it difficult to overcome the challenges presented by poverty  weak educational achievement  risky social behaviours  including drug and alcohol abuse  criminal activity and rising unemployment.  A recent report of the International Labour Organization found that young people aged 15 to 24 accounted for 22 per cent of the increase in the number of unemployed persons since the beginning of 2007. My Government is therefore seeking to further expand educational programmes and career-oriented training opportunities for our youth by enhancing our secondary school curriculum and by strengthening the programmes available at the Bahamas Technical and Vocational Institute.  The Bahamas welcomes efforts by the Organization to continue to bring focus to women’s issues. We applaud the adoption of resolution 64/289  which established a new gender entity — UN Women.  We also applaud the recent launch of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons. Human trafficking is a growing phenomenon in our region and is increasingly a challenge for us in the Bahamas  as we are an archipelagic nation with porous borders. My Government is therefore committed to combating that activity and to intercepting and prosecuting to the fullest extent of the law those engaged in it.  Building on its ratification in 2008 of the Protocol to Prevent  Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons  Especially Women and Children  the Bahamas enacted child protection and trafficking legislation specially designed to work on counter-trafficking. We are fortunate that financing has been made available to representatives of relevant Government agencies and key stakeholders.  The Bahamas believes that the United Nations is working diligently under its mandate to facilitate increased international dialogue  realizing the noble goals set out in its Charter. The Bahamas has taken note of the Secretary-General’s announcement of a High-level Panel on Global Sustainability as a blueprint for a liveable  prosperous and sustainable future for all.  My delegation fully endorses the Secretary-General in his assertion that the time for narrow agendas and narrow thinking is over. As an Organization  we must continue to chart a course that will enable us to meet unprecedented global challenges and translate our efforts into actions for the benefit of all. The rhetoric must become reality. We all have a contribution to make in realizing the goals and objectives of the United Nations  based on the purposes and principles outlined in the Charter."
"20",799,"BIH",65,2010,"It is an honour to address the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. Allow me to express my gratitude to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for having ably presided over this body during the past year and to congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on being elected the new President of the General Assembly.  Fifteen years ago  the Dayton Peace Agreement ended the aggression in and brought peace to Bosnia and Herzegovina. My country has come a long way since then  and I feel obliged to thank the Governments  organizations and individuals who assisted us in travelling down this road.  When we asked the General Assembly to support us in becoming a member of the Security Council  it honoured us with almost unanimous support  for which we offer our thanks. That support demonstrated that the Assembly holds Bosnia and Herzegovina in high esteem  and we are proud of that. As a member of the Security Council  we are doing our best to meet the Assembly’s expectations and honour its trust.  Thanks to the generous assistance of many Governments represented here  Bosnia and Herzegovina completed the main process of reconstruction relatively quickly  particularly in the light of the level of devastation. But the rebuilding of our devastated society has proved to be much more difficult. From 1992 to 1995  an age-old  genuinely multicultural society in Bosnia and Herzegovina was brutally and intentionally torn apart by force. Half of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina had to leave their homes in order to save their lives. Some 1 300 000 of them remain outside Bosnia and Herzegovina. Systematic obstructions were the cause of failure of return programmes  and they are still an obstacle to those who want to return. Those who made it back to their homes are often confronted with blockade walls or with outright violations of basic rights. That makes the restoration of our pluralist society the single most difficult task ahead of us.  But hope remains that the upcoming constitutional changes will lay a foundation for the new generation to be able to bridge the divides. No matter what  we will continue to revive the pluralist character and tolerant spirit of our society because we strongly believe that cultural pluralism is humankind’s most precious treasure.   A healthy economy can be a powerful tool for achieving that goal. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country rich in water and other energy-generating resources. We have undertaken studies and invited international investors to participate in developing these resources. Once completed  these projects will be the driving engine of our economy  enabling us to make progress in other areas  such as health care and social services.  We continue to develop our infrastructure and agricultural resources  but not at a desirable pace. Although generally improved  our education system remains in some aspects hostage to divisive political influences. On the other hand  our rising trade activities have resulted in improving our relations with the countries in the region  and great opportunities can be unlocked through more intensive and more confident regional cooperation.  As is the case in other societies  our greatest resource is our youth  educated in our country and abroad  and ready to take over once our economy is able to absorb their skills and talents. I am confident that  in the coming years  employment opportunities will grow in proportion to the development of the vast untapped resources of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Defence reform is commonly seen as one of our greatest post-Dayton successes because it resulted in unified  modern armed forces. Here again  we have to express our appreciation to our friends and allies whose assistance made this achievement possible. In a short amount of time  our armed forces have managed to earn the trust and respect of the United Nations through their participation in peacekeeping missions.  Like everywhere else  the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina desire peace  stability and prosperity  as well as a better future for themselves and their children. There is great potential for development  and opportunities are there to be seized. Yes  there are reasons for optimism  but there are reasons for concern too.  Our progress is hindered by the remnants of those who still believe in the completion of the political project that brought catastrophe not only to Bosnia and Herzegovina  but to the whole region. In short  they think that the world has forgotten the atrocities committed against the civilian population  the concentration camps  the rape camps and the genocide. After hundreds of thousands of non-Serb civilians were killed and expelled from one part of Bosnia and Herzegovina  they are now publicly calling for the    10-55103 22  secession of that part. They hope and dream  as they say  that the world will somehow recognize that entity as an independent State. Instead of feeling shame  these disciples of Miloševic  Karadžic and Ratko Mladic are now ready to come and ask the international community to reward the genocide in Srebrenica  Prijedor  Zvornik  Sarajevo  Mostar and other sites of horrific crimes for which Karadžic is now being tried at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Hague. What a monument to inhumanity that would be!  Of course  they will not succeed. They can no longer count on the mighty armies of Slobodan Miloševic because those armies were defeated through our heroic struggle. They do count on  as they say  favourable geopolitical circumstances. But they fail to take one thing into account  as Miloševic did. Bosnia will be defended.  They will  however  continue obstructing progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina  and they will continue destabilizing the region. They found inspiration in the inadequate response of the international community  whose patience they have been testing for the past 15 years. So  our collective resolve to prevent the escalation and opening of fresh wounds in Bosnia and Herzegovina is being tested again. We must not fail this time.  This dangerous adventurism aside  I believe and I know that the train of progress cannot and will not be stopped. There is no doubt in my mind that Bosnia and Herzegovina and our entire region will maintain stability and achieve prosperity in the coming years  thus fulfilling the dreams and desires of every one of our citizens."
"21",846,"BLR",65,2010,"The nature of the discussions and decisions taken at the High-level Plenary Meeting has clearly demonstrated that the various problems  challenges and threats we face  however difficult and dangerous they may be  can only be overcome if we work together. The world has changed significantly over the past 10 years  and our capacity to make peoples’ lives in all continents better and safer has been broadened. We have seen the change in international relations. There has been an enhancement of constructive  mutually respectful dialogue between States  and a new global partnership is forming. All the preconditions exist so that at this session we can establish a road map of international cooperation on all strategic issues referred to in the Outcome Document of the Summit. Particular attention should be given to the financial economic sphere  because it is directly linked to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. We can achieve those Goals  even in the current situation  if the necessary financial resources  skills and technologies are used to support development. What has been done so far is insufficient. If we analyse the current situation in an objective way  we see that the largest developed countries have spent trillions of dollars on supporting their economies. This has given some results  but the backdrop of this is that it has become clear that providing resources for official development assistance and international technical assistance continues to be below the real needs of developing countries and countries in transition. Developed countries have adopted protectionist measures. There has been price pressure on small and medium countries for many sensitive categories of goods. In such a context  progress towards the Millennium Development Goals cannot be smooth.  In general terms  Belarus supports the work of the Group of 20 (G-20) and the Group of Eight (G-8) to overcome the world economic crisis  but we must assume that the major countries in these clubs will first and foremost promote their own interests. The General Assembly must take the necessary measures to improve the economic toolbox of the entire United Nations system. Otherwise our Organization will not be able to play an important role in global economic management and small and medium-sized countries will have no leverage on these processes.  First of all  we must continue the process of updating the work and enhancing the potential of the Bretton Woods institutions and increase the role of developing countries and countries with transitional economies in decision-making in their governing bodies. The General Assembly  although it might not be able directly to influence this process  must raise its voice on this issue. We refer here to those bodies where all countries  without exception  can put forward their positions and submit appropriate proposals.  In 2005 and 2006  significant efforts were made to improve the work of the Economic and Social Council  converting it from a body that coordinates the work of thematic commissions and committees in the economic and social spheres to a body that adopts political decisions and recommendations in those areas. Some progress has been achieved here  of course; but it is insufficient if we want to reach by 2015 good indicators with regard to implementing the strategic tasks under the Millennium Development Goals. The Economic and Social Council is still the same: it has not become a full-fledged economic organ of the United Nations. We suggest in the remaining five years that the Council should give special attention to each of the Millennium Development Goals and make appropriate recommendations to the General Assembly and to Member States.   Belarus  which has submitted its candidature for membership of the Economic and Social Council in 2011  is ready to work actively in this regard.  We cannot attain the Millennium Development Goals unless we establish a genuine  strong structure of United Nations operational activities. Here  we welcome the increased intergovernmental dialogue on enhancing coherence in the operations of United Nations agencies and the measures that have been taken to reform the United Nations gender architecture. Besides enhancing the institutions  the financing of bodies that undertake operational activities needs to be improved. In this Hall  we have heard many addresses with regard to the work of the G-8 and the G-20 and their   23 10-55276  initiative to find innovative approaches to financing. We have heard of the intention of the European Union to monitor the Union’s respect for its commitments with regard to official development assistance. We hope that those measures will indeed be implemented.  Belarus  like many other delegations in this room  is concerned at the status of the Doha multilateral trade talks  particularly given the recent trends towards a tougher position by developed countries. Developing countries in particular suffer from this  as do medium-income countries. For more than 10 years  talks have been under way on membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO) of about 30 States. Is this a normal situation if we are talking about the need to ensure that States move forward on achieving the Millennium Development Goals and a genuinely multilateral trade system? This is genuine discrimination against certain States. Therefore we believe that the rules for WTO membership by these countries should be reviewed and simplified.  If we are now serious about United Nations management of global processes  then General Assembly resolutions on the role of international trade in stimulating development should be more targeted towards achieving long-term results. What is most important is to make recommendations on urgent collective measures to establish a multilateral trading system that meets the needs of today’s world.  The General Assembly must send an unequivocal political signal to parties to the upcoming Cancún talks on developing a new post-Kyoto international agreement on limiting emissions of greenhouse gases. This year we have seen that the measures that have been taken have been inadequate. The virtual absence of targeted collective measures by the international community could lead to irreversible consequences. If States are ready to demonstrate genuine partnership in order to avoid the worst-case scenario  then the General Assembly must adopt a resolution on the problem of climate change and offer relevant recommendations and proposals before the  29 November opening of the sixteenth Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.   It is time to end competing ambitions with regard to climate change. Belarus has direct experience of the low level of cooperation between countries and the level of their respect for each other’s interests. This has meant that our attempts to adopt the most stringent voluntary quantitative limits under the Kyoto Protocol  and thus to make our contribution to the common goal of protecting the climate  have so far been unsuccessful. Belarus’s amendment to Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol has not yet entered into force.  Closely related to protection of the climate is the issue of a reliable system of global energy security and the development of so-called green economies. Many States already have considerable experience in establishing sustainable  low-carbon economies. Many States still do not have clean technology  and this puts a brake on their development. Of course  neither the United Nations system nor any other international organization can immediately resolve this problem on its own. Establishing a promising international mechanism of cooperation in order to enhance access to cutting-edge energy technologies  including technology for new and renewable energy sources  is possible only on the basis of a genuine partnership  with leadership from the United Nations and from States that have been most successful in developing green economies.  Belarus has already made a significant contribution to establishing such partnerships. We have established an international laboratory for renewable sources of energy based at the Energy Institute at the National Academy of Sciences. This is first and foremost a platform for exchanging experiences with regard to renewable energy. This is no less important than addressing the climatic conditions in our countries; it will provide an experimental basis for developing and testing effective uses of green technologies. Without any doubt this will make a significant contribution to developing global renewable energy. We can only imagine how much progress the international community would make if each State in the world would  within its means  contribute resources to the development of renewable energy  aimed not only at its own domestic needs but also at exchanging experiences with foreign colleagues.  The MDG Summit confirmed the need for the international community to find longer-term solutions to problems. By following such an approach  States Members of the United Nations will  as the Secretary-General has said  be able to provide a better future for all. Achieving this was the aim of the declaration by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus on establishing a partnership with young people to protect    10-55276 24  them from social decline; the theme of this partnership is helping future generations prosper. The theme of young people is not new in itself  and it has often been discussed in various forums. But implementing this idea would enable us to take a qualitative step forward in establishing a reliable basis for sustainable human development. We are convinced that Member States will support the Belarus initiative to convene a thematic General Assembly debate on supporting talented young people and protecting the coming generation from social decline.  In April next year we will mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. In the varied spectrum of contemporary challenges and threats the issue of Chernobyl has unfortunately become a low priority. But the objective situation is that the consequences of that massive man-made disaster are still being felt  which means that implementing the United Nations 10-year plan for recovery and long-term development of the affected regions is still an urgent task. That is not just of concern to Belarus  Russia and Ukraine; the successful mitigation of the consequences of Chernobyl is in the interests of the entire international community.  Given that situation  Belarus  Russia and Ukraine intend to prepare a draft resolution on enhancing international cooperation and coordination of efforts in order to study  mitigate and minimize the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. That is intended to further intensify measures to implement a plan of action and draw the attention of the international community to the memorial events planned for 2011 in the capitals of the States most affected by the Chernobyl disaster. We call for support for that draft resolution on Chernobyl in the General Assembly and for the traditional solidarity with the most affected countries.  This year the Republic of Belarus for the first time became a participant in and donor to United Nations peacekeeping operations. That again demonstrates that Belarus not only shares the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter but is making a tangible contribution to strengthening international peace and security.  In conclusion  allow me to assure the Assembly that our country will continue to play its part in enhancing the authority and increasing the institutional capacity of the United Nations. Given its universal nature  the United Nations should guard and enhance its paramount role in the global management of peace processes  improve people’s lives and protect them from the threats and challenges of our unstable times. "
"22",881,"BLZ",65,2010,"Please permit me  Sir  on behalf of the Belize delegation to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the sixty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly. As much as our peoples share common values of peace and democracy  your country and my own could not be more different. Switzerland is landlocked with a land mass twice the size and a population 25 times that of my coastal country. Belize has a $1 billion economy and Switzerland has a $400 billion economy. Nominal gross domestic product per capita in Switzerland is estimated at $67 000  while in Belize that figure is roughly $4 000.   I bring up the differences between Belize and Switzerland because they are illustrative of the stark differences that epitomize today’s world. We in this Hall tout sovereign equality  but we experience social and economic disparity on a daily basis  across the globe. Inequality persists between nations and within nations. Poverty proliferates in the midst of plenty.  In my own country  although real output per capita grew over the past 10 years  so too did the proportion of Belizeans living in poverty. In other words  we experienced growth without the commensurate development of our people.  Belize accepts that development is a matter of national responsibility. However  our contemporary reality now renders questions that were hitherto matters of national concern  matters of global concern. As a consequence of globalization  the management capacity of a State has diminished. Our macroeconomic policy and fiscal capacity cannot adequately address the multiple exogenous shocks occasioned  inter alia  by the triumvirate of the financial  food and fuel crises.  Adequate and appropriate international support at this time is therefore critical if we are to avoid drifting further and further away from the attainment of our development goals. In that connection  developed nations urgently need to make good their promise to deliver 0.7 per cent of their GDP for official development assistance (ODA).  For Belize  meaningful international support is becoming increasingly harder to come by because of our designation as a middle-income country. While we continue to benefit from ODA and foreign direct investment in our quest to further integrate Belize into the global economy  for the most part expensive foreign and local commercial debt has in fact fuelled the country’s development strategy.  Thus  in the past 15 years  Belize has built up a high level of public debt  with high-cost long-term financing. The ratio of public debt to GDP grew steadily  from about 27 per cent in 1995 to 70.3 per cent in 2008  with a peak of 87 per cent in 2005. That    10-55396 2  debt-led strategy  which was the model of many other countries  will surely become an unwelcome and unwanted burden for our children.  Perennial debt-servicing obligations constrain my Government’s capacity to increase social investments  especially in those areas where they are most needed. It is therefore not surprising that Belize finds itself off track in meeting Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) on poverty  hunger  education and the empowerment of women. Considering the synergies between Goals  slippage in one threatens the achievement of others.  The terms of engagement between international financial institutions and middle-income countries must be revised if countries such as my own are to break away from the vicious cycle of debt-led development. While those terms will necessarily have to provide for suitable risk-mitigation strategies  they should not be so burdensome as to constrain our policy space. They must respect the national ownership of our development initiatives. International cooperation and support therefore must complement  rather than dictate  the way forward.  While Belize’s traditional donors have long provided valuable assistance  for which we will always be grateful  we are now benefiting from new modalities of cooperation  which are yielding more direct and immediate returns for our people. Belize’s cooperation experience with Taiwan exemplifies a model of cooperation based on partnership. With the help of the Government of Taiwan  Belize has steadily developed its capacity in agricultural research  aquaculture  education and social-sector investment.  In the Latin American and Caribbean region  cooperation has long been based on that approach. Belize has benefited immensely from partnerships with Cuba  Brazil  Mexico and Venezuela. Of special significance is the cooperation in the health sector. In fact  today the progress that we can claim on the health-related MDGs is a testament  in part  to those partnerships.  Beyond our hemispheric relations  we are forging new partnerships. We recently received two years’ worth of emergency relief materials from the United Arab Emirates  for which we are most appreciative  given the frequency of hurricane visitations to our shores in recent years. Through those partnerships  Belize is being enabled to pursue its broader national development objectives. Our experience is being replicated the world over  as we see in other examples of South-South cooperation. We need now to make those partnerships the standard for global cooperation.  At the United Nations  we have long focused on official development assistance as being synonymous with global partnerships. That myopic view needs to be broadened  and we must disabuse ourselves of the donor-driven dialectic. The United Nations has the responsibility to craft a new orientation  from a donor-recipient culture to one of true partnership with mutual respect.   As every speaker in this debate has emphasized  in order for this institution to meet that challenge  it must itself reform.  Current decision-making structures and organization tend towards a North-South polarity. That dynamic imperils cooperation and renders debate more ceremony than meaningful dialogue. Over the 65 years of the United Nations existence  our world has changed. We are dealing with new realities. The Organization is nearly universal  with 192 countries represented here. The club of nuclear-power States has expanded  and may yet continue to expand. Global integration has deepened with technology  market liberalization and the freer movement of capital. Our interdependence has generated global systemic risks.   We need a United Nations that reflects more equitable North-South representation and that can effectively deliver. That means that the organs of the United Nations must be reformed. The process of decision-making must ensure coherence and be inclusive. Above all  equity and justice must inform our mechanisms for delivery. The reform we seek goes much deeper than the changing of the guards; it is a reform that would rebuild trust among each other and confidence in the system.  Belize is crafting a twenty-first century vision for a modern  green and sustainable economy predicated on capacity-building  human dignity  human development and innovation. Our Government is working towards building domestic capital through social investments  job creation  improved access to credit and combating crime and violence.  To that end  we have launched project Restore Belize  which encompasses a comprehensive anti-crime initiative complemented by a socio-economic   3 10-55396  component aimed at restoring the social fabric of our society through the provision of skills training  continuing education for adults  infrastructure development and fostering civic pride. We have instituted school feeding programmes  subsidies for students of secondary schools  seed programmes for farmers and capitalization of our own development finance corporation for onward lending to entrepreneurs.   The Government has also undertaken a national multiparty and multisectoral consultative process to redefine our national development objectives in our Horizon 2030 project. In addition  the Prime Minister has established a council of science advisers to better inform the Horizon 2030 process on the integration of science and technology in the national development agenda.  Belize is resolutely embracing its responsibility for its national development. Our efforts are aimed towards ensuring that we achieve the type of development that genuinely affords all our people the opportunity to realize their true potential with dignity. To that end  we seek only empathy and partnership from the United Nations  not charity."
"23",928,"BOL",65,2010,"This is the first time I have participated in the general debate since the declaration of the Plurinational State of Bolivia and my fifth as President — since I took on enormous responsibilities towards my people  acting through social movements.  I would like to quickly say that in four and a half years in government  we have begun to bring profound structural and social change to Bolivia. Fortunately  two weeks ago  the United Nations recognized that extreme poverty had decreased from 41 to 32 per cent. In four and a half years  our small country of 10 million inhabitants has seen its national reserves grow from $1.7 billion to $9 billion. The rate of economic growth is currently 5 per cent  while before I arrived it was barely 3 per cent.  There has been a democratization of the national economy  with grants and subsidies that have allowed for the improvement of the economic situation of the poorest and most abandoned — in particular those of the rural and indigenous movement  but also our brothers and sisters the workers  and our brothers and sisters from the barrios of Bolivia’s big cities.  However  the improvement of our economy has basically come with the recovery of our oil and gas reserves  and with the nationalization of these natural resources. Let me say that earlier  and unfortunately  under instructions from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  our natural resources were privatized. Moreover  the IMF contracts stated that the owner  the transnational oil company  would have the rights from the wellhead. The Fund Governors were telling us that as long as the oil or gas was underground  it belonged to the Bolivian State and the Bolivian people  but that once it was taken out and reached the wellhead  it was the property of the transnationals. From these mega-fields the oil transnationals received 82 per cent of the gas and oil revenue  while the Bolivian people were left with only 18 per cent.  It is a matter of responsibility. Countries that invest have the right to recover their investment and they have the right to make profits  but not 82 per cent of all of the profits from our oil and gas resources. On 1 May 2006  the Government decreed  first  that the State would take control of all oil fields. We nationalized them. Secondly  so that the investing company  seeking to recover their investment  could do so and make a profit. We looked at the numbers   35 10-54833  carefully in order to ensure that the company would not be harmed. Our data showed that with 18 per cent of the profit  they would recover their investment and they would even have access to profits.  What I did with our supreme decree  after taking total State control of gas and oil  was to ensure that the State  the Bolivian people  received 82 per cent of the profits and the investing oil company  18 per cent. These companies continue to be present in our country and continue to invest in Bolivia. We had discovered that there was an ongoing sacking of our natural resources and this alone has brought changes to our economy. For example  since 1940  Bolivia had never had a budget surplus  only deficits. But once we had nationalized oil and gas  in 2006  the first year of my administration  we had a surplus. With this surplus  we were able to provide grants and subsidies for some of the most vulnerable sectors of the population  namely  young people and the elderly.  In February 2003  when I was a union leader and National Deputy  the International Monetary Fund instructed the then Government to institute an income tax or to increase fuel prices in order to decrease the budget deficit — not to eliminate it  but to decrease it. The Government decided to institute an income tax. There was an uprising by those affected by this tax  and in two days of confrontation there were 15 dead.  I would like to say from here at the United Nations to the world and to the Bolivian people that  without income taxes and without increasing fuel prices  we had a surplus in the first year of our administration. It was so important to have recovered our natural resources and to have recovered our companies providing basic services.  Sooner or later the International Monetary Fund has to redress the damage it has done to Bolivia and to Latin America. But it appears that the International Monetary Fund  under the pretext of structural adjustment  is continuing to impose policies on some countries — policies of pillaging natural resources. It did us great harm. I am demanding officially that the International Monetary Fund pay for the economic damage and the damage to human beings that resulted from these impositions which  in Bolivia  resulted in death  injury and hunger. So I am very pleased that we have begun to change Bolivia. Of course  it is impossible to meet all the demands that our indigenous brethren have been making for 500 years  or that other brethren or regions have been making for hundreds of years — or indeed the demands which have arisen from 20 years of neoliberal Government in our country.  We are living in times of deep and sweeping changes. We have an enormous responsibility to future generations. The fate of Planet Earth depends on what we do or do not do.  We know ourselves. We have many ideological differences. We have many differences in our programmes  our cultures and our societies. We have many differences from one continent to another. The economic asymmetries are profound. But despite these differences we at the United Nations must work together  united. Why united? We must be united so that human rights will be well and truly protected around the world. I come here to propose an alliance of all presidents and Governments so that we can save humankind and save Planet Earth — or save humankind by saving Planet Earth.  There are four main objectives  the first being the protection of human rights. I commend the many Governments that last week adopted a proposal from the Government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia that water be recognized as a human right. Next will be energy and after that communication. We must move forward and respond to the needs of the most vulnerable — the poor  the disenfranchised  the migrants. All basic services in Bolivia are a human right under the Constitution. And we are currently translating that concept into practice  so that all these basic services will truly be a human right. That is why I think it important to have an alliance now  in this new millennium  to see that human rights are guaranteed for all.  I should also like to say that it is indefensible in the twenty-first century to continue to persecute and expel migrants — whether they are migrants because of economic problems or because of climate change or a natural disaster. I would like to take this opportunity to say that I learned from the media that President Obama is rejecting the Arizona law. We must recognize the need to put an end to policies — wherever they originate  including the return policies of Europe — that have the effect of expelling migrants. When our    10-54833 36  ancestors migrated because of war or famine from Europe to Latin America there was no expulsion of migrants. Those European migrants took over thousands of hectares and pillaged natural resources  and no one said anything. But now that our brothers and sisters  driven by lack of work  emigrate in search of jobs in the United States or Europe  they suffer persecution  discrimination and expulsion. This has to stop. Our alliance must also examine the fate of these brothers and sisters.  I have also heard it said that walls or fences are being built in  for example  Mexico and Palestine. As far as I know  fences are only built to keep in cattle  sheep and cows. We cannot confuse human beings with animals and build fences to keep them in. It makes no sense. But I also want to say: how can we prevent human beings from going from one continent to another? We have heard much opinion in this debate on the subject of free-market policies. Are commodities to circulate freely around the world but not human beings? What type of discriminatory policies do we have? Those walls of shame must disappear. I listened carefully to the address by the Secretary-General. He wants the United Nations to be strong in the interests of good governance. I share that opinion but believe that we can only achieve this when we resolve the problems of the world’s most defenceless people  who are migrants in this case. And that is why it is important for us to be rid of these walls.  But there is something else that is unthinkable in the twenty-first century: the economic blockade of Cuba. Everyone calls for the lifting of this embargo  imposed because Cuba was a Communist or socialist country. I want you to know that I too preside over a Government that is anti-capitalist  which  I think  is why the United States Department of State tries to marginalize and exclude us. That is not a solution. People will continue to rebel against systems and economic models that do not resolve the problems of the majority in all our countries. I respectfully ask President Obama to put an end to the economic blockade of Cuba and the economic blockade of the Gaza Strip in Palestine. If the United States is — and we all know this to be the case — the supreme world Power  it has the authority to end this injustice and this violation of the human rights of millions around the world.  The second objective of this alliance of Governments to save humanity is its most important responsibility: determining how to save Mother Earth. What concerns me greatly is that some countries  instead of conserving Nature  are looking at how to make a business out of climate change  putting a price on Nature. We must not privatize our forests; we must not sell carbon bonds as if the forest’s only role were to absorb carbon dioxide. Any country that does so is making a grave mistake.  I want to share something from our culture and our experience in the indigenous world. We indigenous peoples live in harmony with Mother Earth  in harmony with Nature. Why do we live in harmony with Nature? We came from the Earth  we live on the Earth and to earth we will return. The Earth  Planet Earth  Nature  “Pachamama”  Mother Earth — this is our home  this is our mother. The Earth gives us life: water  natural resources  the abundance of Nature. How can we turn Mother Nature into a business?  Because of the discussion I have with social movements around the world  particularly with indigenous movements  I am convinced that the planet can exist without human beings  but human beings cannot exist without the planet. As human beings have rights  like the right to life  so too does the planet  Mother Nature  have the right to life. Just as we human beings reproduce  biodiversity has a right to regenerate. For these and many other reasons besides  we have the obligation to save Planet Earth.  Within that context  our proposal is quite simple. Here at the United Nations we must develop a project to protect the rights of Mother Earth. This morning President Obama referred to the adoption in 1948 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the United Nations. That was 62 years ago; before that we did not have rights. Later civil  economic and political rights were adopted. Three years ago the rights of indigenous peoples were adopted here. Now in this millennium we should adopt the rights of Mother Earth. And if we do not do this  we will be responsible for a world disaster.  To take an example: in a plane some people travel in first class  others in business class  while the majority travel in coach  economy class. If the plane crashes  no one survives — neither the first-class passenger nor the economy-class passenger. Is that what we want? It will be the same if we do not save Mother Earth. The transnational company with lots of money  the millionaire — all of us will be equally   37 10-54833  affected by the environmental problems that come with climate change.  That is why I want to tell you how important it is that we prepare for Cancún  where we will have a great opportunity. I will propose there that we have an alliance of all the presidents and heads of government of the world  headed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. What will the alliance be for? So that together we can determine how to cool the planet. We are talking about global warming. How can we cool the planet? We  as peoples and Governments  are responsible for humankind. The people  at a summit in Cochabamba  Bolivia  said that we must stabilize the temperature increase at 1 degree Celsius. The developed countries  which are primarily responsible for global warming  must commit to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent during the second period of the Kyoto Protocol. Let us assume our responsibilities to cool Planet Earth.  I would like to discuss the serious situation in which my country finds itself. We sometimes buy drills to deal with droughts  and yet even by drilling we cannot find water. And if we do find it  it is buried ever deeper and occurs in ever-smaller quantities. Soon  despite all our drilling to obtain water  we will not find it. So what use will the drills be then? Our mountains are losing their snow fields. This is extremely serious. I therefore find it extremely important that we stabilize the temperature increase at 1 degree Celsius  as the people of the world have said.  The third objective  so frequently mentioned in statements  is peace. We are all fighting for peace. We are all fighting for freedom  but the basis of freedom is equality and justice for all peoples. There will not be peace without social justice. Moreover  peace is not made with military bases; peace is not ensured by military interventions undertaken on the pretext of fighting against drug trafficking and terrorism but really aimed at developing geopolitical interests — aims I do not share. Yes  we must combat drug trafficking. The best way to do so  I would say  is to put an end to banking secrecy. It is not right that the United States Government should decertify countries that are not following the capitalist line. The Bolivian Government is making an effort to reduce coca crops. But while the major cocaine-producing countries are certified  the country that makes a real effort against drug trafficking  a small country  is decertified.  These are  of course  political decisions  and that is why I draw the conclusion that anti-imperialist  anti-capitalist countries will never be certified by the United States Government. In the end  this does not concern or affect my Government. We are convinced that there will be this type of scare tactic  harassment and intimidation. That has always existed. But there are contradictions here as well. The United Nations tells us that coca cultivation has increased by 1 per cent  while the United States Department of State says that coca crops have increased by 9.4 per cent. Whom are we to believe — the United States or the United Nations? Imagine the spin that is put on this to penalize a Government or a country. The reports recognize the strong efforts undertaken by the national Government in the fight against drug trafficking. For example  dried coca is down to 43 000 tons from 43 500. But even this effort is not recognized  which is why we are convinced that this is clearly a political problem.  I believe that it is important to put an end to the acts of aggression  to the interventions in such countries as Afghanistan and Iraq  and to the threats to Iran. Let us put an end to the entire nuclear arsenal  because the nuclear arsenal is a threat to life. Let us begin with the United States and then continue with all the other countries. And this is not merely an attempt to punish a country that may wish to implement other policies. Instead of spending so much money allegedly on defence and security  in the end it is for war. If we are responsible to humankind  we must change everyone’s mindset.  The last objective of this alliance would be to work together to strengthen the United Nations  but we also have to begin to democratize the United Nations. This is a very difficult task  of course. We have heard statements made by heads of government and by presidents. Some anti-capitalist presidents are accused of being authoritarian or totalitarian  of being dictators. Delegations know  and the world knows  how a coup d’état in a country such as Honduras can be ensured here. This morning President Obama talked about working with countries that fight against poverty. In Bolivia we have greatly reduced poverty  and yet investments are cut. He has said that he will work with democratic Governments. In Bolivia  in five years I have won two referendums and three elections  all with more than 50 or 60 per cent of the vote. Where is the dictatorship? Where is the authoritarianism? The authoritarianism is here at the United Nations. Some    10-54833 38  Governments  some countries have permanent seats with the right to veto. That is authoritarianism  and that is why we must begin to democratize the United Nations if we want to move ahead with a democratic mindset or focus. We must start by practising democracy here. But  above all  I want to tell you  brothers and sisters present here  that we must work together to ensure that  sooner or later  the United Nations becomes an anti-capitalist Organization  if we are to save humankind. If we do not do that  we will be held responsible. And I assume my responsibility by telling you this in a direct and straightforward way. I am not at all scared because I know what the consequences of capitalism are — in particular  with regard to the destruction of Mother Earth.  I was thinking that our United Nations — and as a President I feel part of the United Nations — should have a slogan  a war cry for the effort to save humankind. I propose to the Assembly and its President that our war cry should be “The planet or death; we shall win!” And I wish to say that  from what I have learned in my four and a half years as President of my country  if there is the political will to serve the people of the world  the people of the world can be saved."
"24",975,"BRA",65,2010,"It is a great honour for me to come to this rostrum to speak on behalf of the people and Government of Brazil. I bring the greetings of President Lula.   Within days  over 130 million Brazilians will go to the polls and will write another important chapter in the history of our democracy. During President Lula’s two terms  Brazil has changed. Sustained economic growth  financial stability  social inclusion and the full exercise of democracy have converged and reinforced each another. Over 20 million Brazilians rose out of poverty  and many others out of extreme poverty. Nearly 30 million people joined the middle class.  Strong and transparent public policies reduced inequalities in income  access and opportunities. Millions of Brazilians rose to dignity and real citizenship. The strengthened domestic market protected us from the worst effects of the global crisis set in motion by the financial casino in the richest countries in the world.  Brazil is proud to have achieved almost all of the Millennium Development Goals and to be well on the way to meeting them all by 2015. The inability of any country to achieve those Goals must be seen as a failure of the entire international community. The promotion of development is a collective responsibility. Brazil has been working to assist other countries to replicate its successful experiences. In the past years Brazil’s actions on the international stage have been driven by a sense of solidarity. We are convinced that it is possible to have a humanistic foreign policy without losing sight of national interests. That policy is supported by South-South cooperation. The IBSA Facility for Poverty and Hunger Alleviation  created by India  Brazil and South Africa  finances projects in Haiti  Guinea-Bissau  Cape Verde  Palestine  Cambodia  Burundi  Laos and Sierra Leone. Brazil has substantially increased its humanitarian aid and the number of its cooperation projects with poorer countries.   Africa occupies a very special place in Brazilian diplomacy. Since taking office  President Lula has been to Africa 11 times and visited over 20 countries in the continent. We have set up an agricultural research office in Ghana  a model cotton farm in Mali  a manufacturing plant for antiretroviral drugs in Mozambique and professional training centres in five African countries. Through trade and investment  we are helping the African continent to develop its enormous potential and reduce its dependency on a few centres of political and economic power.  Brazil is particularly concerned about Guinea-Bissau. It is not by isolating or abandoning Guinea-Bissau that the international community will help it address the challenges it still faces. We need intelligent modalities for cooperation  which can promote development and stability and encourage the necessary reforms  especially with regard to the armed forces.  This year  in which a significant number of African countries celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of their decolonization  Brazil renews its commitment to an independent  prosperous  just and democratic Africa.  There are few places where international solidarity is more needed than Haiti. We joined the United Nations in mourning the tragedy that took the lives of hundreds of thousands of Haitians. We ourselves lost great Brazilians  including Dr. Zilda Arns — a woman who dedicated her life to the poor  especially children — Mr. Luiz Carlos da Costa  Deputy Head of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti  and 18 of our peacekeepers.  We would like to express our compassion for the suffering of the Haitian people and  above all  our admiration for the stoicism and courage with which they have been facing adversity. The Haitian people know that they can count on Brazil to not only help them maintain order and defend democracy  but also assist in their development. We are keeping our promises and will keep a watchful eye on the situation to ensure that the commitments of the international community go beyond rhetorical statements.    10-54827 6   In recent years  the Brazilian Government has invested heavily in South America’s integration and peace. We have strengthened our strategic partnership with Argentina. We have reinforced MERCOSUR  including through financial mechanisms unique among developing countries.  The establishment of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) aims at consolidating a genuine zone of peace and prosperity. UNASUR has already demonstrated its value in promoting understanding and the peaceful resolution of conflicts among and within countries in South America and has made foreign interference in our region even more unwarranted. By creating the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  launched in Bahia  Brazil and confirmed in Cancún  Mexico  we have reaffirmed the region’s willingness to extend to Central America and the Caribbean the integrationist ideals that animate South Americans.  Brazil reiterates its condemnation  shared by all in Latin America and the Caribbean  of the illegitimate embargo against Cuba. Its sole result has been to hamper the efforts of millions of Cubans in their struggle for development.  We condemn anti-democratic moves  such as the coup d’état in Honduras. The return of former President Zelaya without threats to his freedom is indispensable for the full normalization of Honduras’ relations with the region as a whole.  When President Lula first spoke in this Hall  in 2003  the world lived under the shadow of the invasion of Iraq. We hope we have learned the lessons of that episode. Blind faith in intelligence reports tailored to justify political goals must be rejected. We must ban once and for all the use of force that is inconsistent with international law. Furthermore  it is fundamental to value and promote dialogue and the peaceful resolution of disputes.  In order to achieve a truly secure world  the promise of the total elimination of nuclear weapons must be fulfilled. Unilateral reductions are welcome but insufficient  especially when they occur in tandem with the modernization of nuclear arsenals.  As President Lula has often stated  multilateralism is the international face of democracy. The United Nations must be the main center of decision-making in international politics.   The changes that have occurred in the world over the past few decades and the series of crises we have faced in food security  climate change  the economic and financial sphere and peace and security make it urgent to redefine the rules that govern international relations.  The financial crisis of 2008 accelerated change in global economic governance. The Group of Twenty (G-20) replaced the Group of Eight as the primary forum for deliberation on economic issues. The G-20 was a step forward  but it must be adjusted to ensure  for instance  greater African participation. The relevance and legitimacy of the G-20 can be preserved only if it maintains frank and permanent dialogue with all the nations represented in this General Assembly.  At the height of the crisis  we succeeded in avoiding the worst-case scenario: a surge of uncontrolled protectionism  which would have thrown the world into a deep depression. But the developed countries have not demonstrated the necessary commitment to global economic stability. They continue to let themselves be guided by parochial interests. Nowhere is that more evident than in the Doha round of negotiations in the World Trade Organization. A balanced solution to that negotiating process  which has lasted for almost 10 years  would promote economic expansion and the development of the poorest countries  with the end of distorting subsidies and protectionist barriers. After all  poor countries are the greatest victims of the narrow and selfish view that still prevails in international trade.  Reforms have also been insufficient in the financial sector. Unjustified resistance is preventing the implementation of agreed-upon changes. Obstinacy in maintaining anachronistic privileges perpetuates and deepens the illegitimacy of institutions.  Another major challenge we face is achieving a global  comprehensive and ambitious agreement on climate change. In order to move forward on this matter  countries must stop hiding behind each other. Brazil  like other developing countries  has done its part. But in Copenhagen  several delegations  especially from the rich world  sought excuses to evade their moral and political obligations. They forgot that one cannot negotiate with Nature.  A positive outcome of the sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  with real progress in   7 10-54827  forests  financing for adaptation and mitigation and a reaffirmation of the Kyoto commitments  is indispensable. The Mexican presidency can count on Brazil’s engagement to achieve this objective.  In 2012  we will host  in Rio de Janeiro  Brazil  the Rio+20 Conference. On behalf of the Brazilian Government  I invite all delegations to fulfill the promise of truly sustainable development.  The reform of global governance has not yet reached the field of international peace and security. In the economic and environmental areas  the wealthiest nations have already understood that they cannot do without the cooperation of the poor and emerging countries. When it comes to war and peace  however  the traditional players are reluctant to share power.  The Security Council must be reformed and expanded to allow for greater participation by developing countries  including as permanent members. We cannot continue with working methods that lack transparency and that allow the permanent members to discuss behind closed doors and for as long as they wish issues that concern all mankind.  Brazil has sought to live up to what is expected from all Security Council members  including non-permanent ones — namely  that they contribute to peace. For this reason  we made a serious effort to find an instrument that could enable progress towards a solution of the Iranian nuclear question. In so doing  we relied on proposals that had been presented as a unique opportunity to build confidence between the parties. The Tehran Declaration of 17 May  signed by Brazil  Turkey and Iran  removed obstacles that  according to the very authors of those proposals  had previously prevented an agreement.  The Tehran Declaration does not exhaust the issue and was never intended to do so. We are convinced that  once back to the negotiating table  the parties will find ways to resolve other issues  such as 20 per cent enrichment and the stock of enriched uranium accumulated since October 2009. In spite of the sanctions  we still hope that the logic of dialogue and understanding will prevail. The world cannot run the risk of a new conflict like the one in Iraq. We have been insisting  therefore  that the Iranian Government maintain an attitude of flexibility and openness towards negotiations  but it is necessary that all those concerned also demonstrate such willingness.  We are closely following developments in the peace process in the Middle East. We hope the direct talks between Palestinians and Israelis launched earlier this month will produce concrete results that lead to the creation of a Palestinian State within the pre-1967 borders  a State that ensures for the Palestinian people a dignified life  co-existing side by side and in peace with the State of Israel.  However  it is not the format of the dialogue that will determine whether it will yield results. What matters is the willingness of the parties to reach a just and lasting peace. That will be easier with the involvement of all those concerned. Freezing the construction of settlements in the occupied territories  lifting the Gaza blockade and ending attacks against civilian populations are crucial elements in the process.  In his visit to Israel  Palestine and Jordan in March  President Lula spoke with government leaders and representatives of civil society about those issues. We frequently receive in Brasilia the leaders of various countries of the region  who seek support in resolving problems that have afflicted them for decades and have not been solved through the traditional means and actors. Brazil  which has about 10 million people of Arab descent and a sizeable Jewish community living together in harmony  will not shy away from making its contribution to the peace that we all yearn for.  Brazil’s commitment to the promotion of human rights is also unwavering. We favour a non-selective  objective and multilateral treatment of human rights  without politicization or bias  in which everyone — the rich and the poor  the powerful and the weak — is subject to the same scrutiny. In our view  the exercise of human rights is more effectively ensured by dialogue and cooperation than by arrogant attitudes derived from self-declared moral superiority.  During his eight years in office  President Lula has developed a foreign policy that is independent  free of any sort of submission  and respectful of Brazil’s neighbours and partners. It is an innovative foreign policy  which does not distance itself from the fundamental values of the Brazilian nation: peace  pluralism  tolerance and solidarity.  Just as Brazil has changed and will continue to change  the world is also changing. We must deepen and accelerate this process. With the technology and wealth at our disposal  there is no longer any justification for hunger  poverty and epidemics of    10-54827 8  preventable diseases. We can no longer live with discrimination  injustice and authoritarianism. We must face the challenges of nuclear disarmament  sustainable development and freer and fairer trade. Rest assured  Brazil will continue to fight to make these ideals a reality."
"25",1019,"BRB",65,2010," I am honoured to address the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados.  The theme of this year’s session  concerning the role of the United Nations  multilateralism and global governance  is timely  and it permits an examination of the complex issues facing the global community today. Moreover  it lends itself to an exploration of solutions to those issues as well as to restoration of the centrality of the United Nations and its organs.  A week ago leaders from every corner of the world met and confirmed that the global consensus on the United Nations Development Agenda remained intact. They pledged to spare no effort to ensure the fulfilment of our collective promise to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable.  Barbados shares the view of the Secretary-General that the Millennium Development Goals must serve as “a blueprint for ending extreme poverty” (A/65/PV.3). The Goals are at the core of the global development agenda. They represent our common vision of a more peaceful  prosperous and just world  in which all human beings can enjoy better and safer lives. For the past decade these globally shared and endorsed set of priorities have inspired extraordinary efforts by Governments and non-State actors alike.  Now is not the time for complacency. Progress towards achievement of the Goals remains mixed  and  while success is still within our grasp  it is by no means certain. Our common task is therefore to convert this unprecedented consensus into collective action on all fronts and immediately implement what has been agreed in order to guarantee success by 2015. Failing this  the many words of the Outcome Document that we adopted a few days ago will simply serve as yet   17 10-55276  another solemn reminder of human needs neglected and promises unfulfilled.  This display of global solidarity in the face of unparalleled economic uncertainty reminds us that the United Nations is an invaluable and indispensable instrument for its Member States and for the world’s peoples  as we seek to respond to the challenges of our times. While we may not have the same degree of consensus on every pressing global problem  Barbados cannot contemplate the prospect of a world without an Organization such as this. No other entity can mobilize global political will and coordinated action around common causes  and provide a voice for the voiceless  like the United Nations.  Scarred by the bitter experience of two world wars and a great depression  the founders of this Organization had the foresight and wisdom to recognize that only through multilateralism and a strong and effective system of global governance  with the United Nations at its core  could lasting peace be maintained and international law upheld.  Today we bear witness to a world which is more interconnected and intertwined  yet in a real sense more deeply divided  than ever. Barbados is of the view that an enhanced and renewed system of global governance must be at the top of the global agenda. In this regard  Mr. President  Barbados fully supports your initiative to address this issue during the course of this sixty-fifth session. We must take stock and reflect in a holistic and comprehensive manner on the system of global governance  including the United Nations and its organs  to ensure that it truly delivers on the vision of our predecessors and serves the interests of all mankind  particularly the poor and the vulnerable.  Delivering global public goods such as global economic and financial stability; ensuring the promotion and protection of human rights; maintaining international peace and security; and ensuring environmental sustainability: those matters cannot be successfully addressed by States acting on their own  or even by coalitions of the willing. Finding effective solutions to those challenges and mobilizing collective action provides the most immediate and obvious reason for enhancing global governance and strengthening multilateral cooperation.  As United States President Harry Truman stated on 25 April 1945 at the birth of this Organization  in his address to the opening session of the United Nations Conference on International Organization  held in San Francisco:  “Differences between men  and between nations  will always remain. In fact  if held within reasonable limits  such disagreements are actually wholesome. All progress begins with differences of opinion and moves onward as the differences are adjusted through reason and mutual understanding.”  Renewing the vision of our predecessors must start with the United Nations and extend outwards to all organizations with a role in dispensing global governance.  During this session we must finalize the decades-long project of Security Council reform. If the Council is to retain its unique legitimacy it should be made more broadly representative of the international community as a whole  as well as of the geopolitical realities of today.  The Council’s working methods must also be made to adhere to the highest standards of transparency  accountability and efficiency. Its outreach to  non-members must be significantly improved.   Barbados continues to believe that the number of permanent and non-permanent seats on the Council should be increased  and that Brazil  Germany  India and Japan should join the ranks of the permanent members. Membership from the African Group must also be assured.  Sustained and widespread future prosperity will require major reforms in global economic governance as well as new approaches to global economic development. The global financial and economic crisis has made clear the extent of the interconnectivity of financial markets  as well as their inherent vulnerabilities. While there is no precedent for the current level of global financial and economic integration  the policies  rules and institutions established to govern those processes are predominately national in scope  and global mechanisms highly compartmentalized.  We can no longer postpone the task of reforming the institutions responsible for global economic and financial governance. They must be better equipped to address the challenge of a globalized and highly interdependent world. In this regard  Barbados welcomes the broadening of the Group of 8 to include    10-55276 18  the participation of developing and emerging economies and the designation of the Group of 20 (G-20) as the premier forum for international economic cooperation.  We also recognize the important role played by the G-20 in stabilizing the global economy. We acknowledge its ambitious agenda to restore global growth and achieve needed reforms in the world’s financial systems. However  the Group must significantly enhance its outreach to non-members  including the smallest members of the international community  particularly when issues affecting their economic viability and survival are under discussion. Furthermore  it must also demonstrate real leadership in breaking the impasse in the World Trade Organization and ensure a successful conclusion to the Doha Development Round. It must also ensure that reforms in the Bretton Woods institutions are accelerated.  Small States have traditionally played a crucial role in shaping global governance  and our voice should not be diminished in efforts to reform the current system. Barbados will play its part. It is against the background of articulating the role and importance of multilateralism and a strong and effective United Nations that I will explore the response of my country to these global challenges. I will also address the strategies to be pursued by this small nation intent on playing its part in this family of nations. Barbados is a small island developing State classified as a middle-income developing country. It faces significant vulnerabilities made real by the spectre of climate change and the associated natural disasters  the consequences of the recent financial and economic crises  and the threat posed by transnational criminal networks. My country has sought to take its place in a world characterized by increasing economic  environmental and social complexities. We take our place in a world in which the United Nations family continues to witness increasing economic interdependence and globalization  both posing challenges to national sovereignty.  Barbados shares the United Nations vision for a world able to achieve and surpass the Millennium Development Goals. We are committed to the fight against the ravages of HIV and AIDS and other infectious diseases. As a natural-resources-poor small island developing State  we have achieved much on the basis of our investment in human development  primarily in the areas of education and health. We have thus prioritized our responses to those global challenges in a manner that puts our people first. Our successes to date have been due to our investment in our key resource — our people. Given the emphasis on our people’s development and the dangers posed to our population  we supported the resolution entitled “Prevention and control of non-communicable diseases” (resolution 64/265)  introduced by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) at the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly in 2009. Our responses can be seen in our efforts to achieve our ultimate goal of crafting a green economy. We see the green economy as a tool for transforming our economy to achieve sustainable development. At the heart of this economic and social model is a commitment to people-centred development. Aligning our development strategy along this particular trajectory ensures a consistency not only with our global obligations but also  and more importantly  with our national values and in the best interests of all our citizens.  Even as the international community searches for a definition of the green economy  Barbados has simply defined this model as an integrated production  distribution  consumption and waste assimilation system that  at its core  reflects the fragility of our small island ecosystems as the basis for policy interventions for natural resource protection  business and investment choice  human development programming  and the facilitation of export market development strategies.  In pursuit of the green economy the Government of Barbados has undertaken an assessment of the opportunities and challenges of a green economy transition. Our focus is on the priority sectors of tourism  agriculture  transport and housing  along with cross-sectoral issues of water resources  energy and waste. In addition  we have partnered with the United Nations Environment Programme to promote a transition to a green economy  building on existing Barbados initiatives in the area of resource efficiency and the promotion of sustainable consumption and production. We believe that our experience in transitioning to a green economy will serve as a useful model for other small island developing States and small economies  and we intend to share our unique perspective with the international community in the preparatory process for the Rio+20 Summit in 2012.  The efforts of Barbados to transform its economy into a green economy and achieve sustainable   19 10-55276  development will be undermined without ambitious and urgent global action to address climate change. The challenge of climate change remains one of the great threats to the survival and viability of Barbados and other small island developing States. Even as science points to a worsening situation  global emissions continue to rise and the prospects seem dim of arriving at an agreement to provide legal certainty in the fight against climate change. It is clear that the objective of an ambitious and comprehensive legally binding outcome will not be achieved in Cancún  Mexico  in December this year. Barbados nevertheless believes that the substantive outcomes at the sixteenth session of the Conference of Parties (COP-16) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change must demonstrate that the international community remains committed to addressing the defining challenge of our time. In this regard COP-16 should deliver outcomes that: prioritize the needs of the most vulnerable  particularly in the areas of adaptation and finance; finalize issues on which there is a broad agreement and provide guidance and clarity on the difficult issues; and demonstrate progress on the delivery of the $30 billion fast-start financing pledged at Copenhagen. Critical to the success at Cancún is arriving at a common understanding of how  when and where an ambitious and legally binding international climate agreement will be finalized.  In 1994 Barbados had the distinct honour of hosting the first Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. The Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation (MSI) remain the essential blueprints for the sustainable development of small island developing States. Barbados welcomes the recently adopted outcome of the five-year review of the MSI and hopes that this will result in a renewal of the commitment of the international community to support the sustainable development of small island developing States. It is of great concern to Barbados that  18 years after the international recognition of the special case of small island developing States at Rio  our unique and particular vulnerability is being challenged. Barbados is not prepared to renegotiate the special case of small island developing States but urges the international community to focus on the delivery of tangible and concrete actions to build resilience and promote sustainable development in small island developing States.  The January 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti serves as a grim reminder of the fragility of island States to natural disasters. In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake  the Government of Barbados provided financial assistance  relief supplies and deployed a contingent of medical and security personnel as part of a CARICOM relief team. If Haiti is to realize its full potential  the international community must remain fully engaged in Haiti  and the many pledges of financial and technical support must be delivered on time. The Government and people of Haiti can be assured that Barbados will continue to be a partner in this rebuilding and reconstruction phase. Our commitment remains strong  and we will play our part in Haiti’s long-term development. We call on all who have mobilized resources for the benefit of Haiti to work with countries like Barbados and in collaboration with the Government and people of Haiti to rebuild that country.  There is a very definite role for a reformed United Nations to assist countries like Barbados. The model economy being pursued by Barbados cannot be achieved by unilateral action.  As stated previously  the role of the United Nations is clear. It must generate the templates to be adopted and serve as a catalyst for action: it must seek to mediate where conflicts arise; it must work to ensure that there are reforms of the global economic and financial system to make it inclusive  transparent and supportive of the development aspirations of least developed countries and more developed countries; it must also facilitate South-South cooperation  supporting the efforts of these countries to share appropriate experiences and indigenous solutions.  Barbados shares your vision  Sir  for a strong  inclusive and open United Nations as the guarantor of global governance. Barbados maintains the strong position that responsibility for the setting of rules and the making of core decisions on matters of a global nature rightfully belongs within the ambit of the United Nations  given its primacy as the only legitimate forum for global action."
"26",1051,"BRN",65,2010,"I would like to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election. I also thank Mr. Treki  the outgoing President  for his strong leadership in support of United Nations reform.  I would also like to express our great sympathy to the Government and people of Pakistan and to our fellow United Nations Members whose people have suffered the terrible effects of natural disasters over the past year. I also thank the Secretary-General and his staff for coordinating international relief efforts.  We have had a long week of formal meetings and sideline discussions  and there is still much more to be done before we all go home. So  at this time  I would like to be brief and offer a statement of support for what our people regard as the most important aspect of the work of the United Nations. By this I mean the work of our United Nations agencies  their experts     10-55128 48  their advisers and above all their volunteers in the field.  I think the theme for this year’s debate underlines the importance of their work. It asks us to recognize the central role of the United Nations in global governance and I have no difficulty in doing this. Achieving security  progress and development is  of course  our own individual responsibility. But as last week’s high-level discussions on the Millennium Development Goals made extremely clear  many of the challenges we face reach beyond single nations and even single regions. They are international in the full sense of the word.  So we need help  experience and expertise and for me  this is what the United Nations agencies offer. As we all know  their support continues all year  every year. In my own country it is taking place right now as we speak  through the United Nations Development Programme  the United Nations Environment Programme  UNESCO  UNICEF and the World Health Organization and we are most grateful for their help. They work in vital areas of national development  education  health  agriculture  communications and infrastructure. They meet with people directly  they listen  they discuss  and they teach  train and encourage. They work closely with our local authorities and sometimes they do even more than that.  I think that we learned this during last year’s influenza A (H1N1) health crisis. As the Assembly can imagine  for a small nation like ours this was very serious indeed. It could have almost closed us down and could have certainly caused widespread panic. But it did not. I think this was very largely due to one fact: our people knew that they were not alone. They had the guidelines given to us by the World Health Organization and this gave them the confidence they needed during that extremely worrying time; we could not have made it without them.  Returning to our theme this year: it invites us to reaffirm and  as I have said  I am happy to do this and I do it without reservation. I reaffirm our respect and deep appreciation for the work of all United Nations agencies. We are delighted to be working with them and we warmly congratulate the Secretary-General on their work.  In the words of our theme  the United Nations does indeed play a central role. In my view  without its agencies the concept of global governance can only be  at best  an idea and  most of the time  only words. It is the agencies that help us turn ideas into real substance and to change words into actions that our people understand  respect and welcome.  In fact  I would like to end by saying that they are much more than agencies. For countries such as ours  they can help us to become far more than small developing nations. I think this can be summed up simply: they make us part of a United Nations that is truly united."
"27",1092,"BTN",65,2010,"I would like to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We are confident that with your vast academic and political experience  you will provide the Assembly with the necessary leadership in the year ahead. Allow me to also commend your predecessor  His Excellency  Mr. Ali Treki  for his many initiatives and guidance in steering the sixty-fourth session to a successful conclusion.  My delegation welcomes your proposal on “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance” as the theme for the general debate of this session. That theme is most appropriate  as it comes at a time when the world looks to the United Nations for its stewardship in addressing the multiple global crises  the devastating effects of climate change and the issue of the maintenance of global peace and security. The United Nations has long been recognized as an indispensable global Organization due to its mandate  and must continuously adapt itself to deal with the challenges confronting the world so that its pivotal role in global governance is maintained. No other multilateral organization or intergovernmental grouping  without the legitimacy of universal membership  can hope to replace the centrality of the United Nations in global affairs.  The vast majority of Members of the United Nations are small States. The principle of sovereign equality enshrined in the United Nations Charter establishes that all States  regardless of size  wealth  relative power  population or level of development  are accorded equal opportunity to participate and contribute to the work of the United Nations  its principal organs and its high-level posts. That  in fact  is the bedrock upon which this House was founded 64 years ago. It is a principle that must remain in the forefront and help chart our course further as our dialogue on United Nations reform continues.   How can we  as Members of the United Nations  credibly espouse equity among nations and peoples if we fail to practise it among ourselves? After 39 years of membership  Bhutan continues to believe that the United Nations still has room and a role for smaller States  as equal partners in global affairs  including in the maintenance of international peace and security. For that reason  Bhutan is seeking membership in the Security Council in a non-permanent seat for the term 2013 and 2014.  Last week at the High-level Plenary Meeting  our heads of State and Government acknowledged the plight of millions of people living in poverty and agreed to recommit themselves to keeping their pledge on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The successful achievement of the MDGs by all Member States will serve as a measure of the effectiveness of the United Nations. The United Nations must therefore continue to provide the necessary leadership to foster renewed global partnership to enable the realization of all the MDGs by 2015.  On 20 September  Bhutan’s Prime Minister highlighted to this gathering the need to move beyond conventional development practices (see A/65/PV.3). He therefore proposed the inclusion of happiness as the ninth Millennium Development Goal. My delegation is hopeful that that proposal of my Prime Minister will receive the support of the United Nations membership.    10-55396 26   My delegation is pleased to note that the reform agenda initiated following the World Summit in 2005 is beginning to yield results. In that regard  we welcome the Assembly’s unanimous adoption of the resolution on system-wide coherence (resolution 64/289) early in July 2010  which  inter alia  established UN Women. The creation of UN Women effectively consolidates all the existing mandates and functions relating to women and constitutes an important step in fulfilling the commitments undertaken in the Fourth World Conference on Women  held in Beijing. We are confident that that entity will address the global issues of gender equality and women’s empowerment with great vigour.  Bhutan has long been convinced that no society can be a happy one if it is not inclusive. Promoting the conditions that will enable the pursuit of national happiness by all our citizens  so that  regardless of race  sex  language  religion  politics or other status  they may enjoy a good quality of life in a progressive and prosperous country is not only one of the objectives of government  it is our moral obligation. This spirit is further reaffirmed by our Constitution  which guarantees the fundamental rights of all Bhutanese  thus demonstrating that Bhutan is committed to building an inclusive society  one that enables all Bhutanese  including those with disabilities  to lead fulfilling lives  to contribute and to participate as full members of society. My Government was therefore particularly pleased to sign the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on 21 September 2010.  We are also pleased to note that resolution 64/289 on system-wide coherence will contribute to the enhancement of the operational activities of the United Nations  making the funding system more systematic and harmonizing the overall governance structure. This would improve the capacity of the United Nations to more effectively deliver assistance to countries  thus strengthening its development pillar.  My delegation recognizes the important role of the General Assembly in setting the global agenda and dealing with many of the important issues confronting the international community today. With each passing year  the responsibilities entrusted to the General Assembly  as the chief deliberative and policy-making body of the United Nations  continue to grow  and we believe that the authority of the General Assembly must be simultaneously enhanced to assume the growing mandate entrusted to it. We therefore appreciate the progress made by the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the General Assembly  where a number of key issues have been highlighted  especially the strengthening of the Office of the President of the General Assembly. We are confident that  with the political determination of Member States  those deliberations will result in a stronger United Nations.  We are encouraged that  in the past year  the five rounds of intergovernmental negotiations on the question of equitable representation in and larger membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the Council  held under the chairmanship of Ambassador Zahir Tanin of Afghanistan  is making good progress. My delegation supports the expansion of both the permanent and the non-permanent membership of the Security Council to reflect the contemporary realities and make it a more representative body. We believe that India  Japan  Germany and Brazil plus two countries from the African continent  which have the capacity and resources to shoulder the onerous responsibilities with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security  should be granted permanent membership.  Given the renewed commitment of the international community to the MDGs with a view to improving the lives of the people in the poorest countries  it is most timely that the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries should take place in 2011 in Turkey. We thank the Government of Turkey for its generous offer and assistance in hosting this important Conference. We also appreciate the efforts of the United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries  Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States in coordinating preparations for the Conference.  As we undertake preparations for this event  we will look to you  Mr. President  for your support and direction  so that the least developed countries (LDCs) together with all our development partners cannot only ensure a successful outcome  but also  more importantly  give their people a chance for a better life. We are confident that the Conference will build on the successes of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010 and adopt new measures and strategies for the development of the LDCs in the next decade.   27 10-55396   As most fittingly described  the other defining challenge of our time  namely  climate change  requires the collective and coordinated effort of all nations  as its devastating effects know no bounds. My country has full faith in the leadership of the United Nations and believes in the centrality of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in addressing climate change. We are confident that the ongoing negotiations will lead to a concrete  comprehensive and equitable agreement at the sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Cancún later this year  as envisaged under the Bali Action Plan. Success will be essential in Cancún for small and vulnerable countries such as my own  which bears a heavier burden as the result of climate change. We must have the necessary resources for mitigation and adaptation.  With the severe threats and damaging effects caused by climate change in South Asia  as recently occurred in Pakistan  it was no coincidence that the sixteenth Summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)  which Bhutan was honoured to host in April this year  appropriately chose climate change as its theme. In addition to adopting the Thimphu Silver Jubilee Declaration  entitled “Towards a Green and Happy South Asia”  the Summit also adopted the Thimphu Statement on Climate Change. The Statement outlines important initiatives to further strengthen and intensify regional cooperation to address the adverse impacts of climate change in South Asia. One of the important outcomes of the Thimphu Summit is the formulation of a common SAARC statement on climate change  which Bhutan  as the current SAARC Chair  will present at the forthcoming Conference of the Parties in December in Cancún.  We are pleased to report that  as Bhutan progresses into its third year as a democratic constitutional monarchy  the foundations for a sustainable and vibrant democracy are growing stronger. The institutional arrangements for the three branches of Government  as required under our Constitution  are now complete and functioning with the establishment of the Supreme Court earlier this year. Likewise  all the constitutional bodies with oversight functions have been firmly established  and the media is performing its role as the fourth estate in an atmosphere of freedom.  There is no doubt that  given the challenges confronting our increasingly interdependent world  the role of the United Nations is vital in addressing those issues. In order to do so  the United Nations requires the full support and commitment of the entire membership. Only then will it be able to truly reaffirm its central role in global governance. I therefore conclude by assuring you  Mr. President  of my delegation’s full support and cooperation  as you embark on a year-long journey of further strengthening this Organization. "
"28",1133,"BWA",65,2010,"It is my singular honour to extend my congratulations to you  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly. I wish to assure you of the full support and cooperation of my delegation in the discharge of your onerous responsibilities. My commendation also goes to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  and his    10-55122 4  staff for their commitment to the advancement of the work of this noble Organization.  As Member States  we continue to find refuge in the provisions of the United Nations Charter and the full assurance that  when we are individually faced with insurmountable challenges and difficulties  we draw from the collective strength of the international community.  Working together for a common purpose  for the common good is actually the sacredness of this  our grand institution. In this regard  we must all remain steadfast in our partnership on the agenda for poverty eradication  the pursuit of international peace and security  the combating of disease  the promotion of youth empowerment and gender equality  the promotion and protection of democracy  the rule of law and human rights  personal advancement through education  better health for all and harnessing technology for sustainable development. It is on account of this abiding faith and belief in the viability and primacy of the United Nations that  in spite of our resource limitations  we have over the years faithfully fulfilled our obligations to this Organization.  The deliberations of the recently concluded High-level Plenary Meeting on the review of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  our global blueprint for monitoring universal progress towards shared development goals  clearly cast light on our strengths  weaknesses and vulnerabilities  individually and collectively. For this reason we need to redouble our efforts to accelerate the implementation of the MDGs in the remaining five years.  Botswana is classified as an upper-middle-income country. However  despite having enjoyed stability and steady economic growth over a sustained period of time  the country still has to contend with a plethora of development challenges — ironically  in an environment of diminished international development assistance and support. The vulnerability of economies such as that of my country became evident during the triple global crises of food  energy and  most recently  the world economic and financial meltdown. To this end  we call for continued development assistance for middle-income countries  lest their hard-earned gains be reversed.  In this era of growing and complex global challenges  the need for a more dynamic and proactive global financial  economic and political architecture is far more apparent than ever before. More specifically  the recent crises point to an international monetary and financial architecture that needs profound reform in order to enhance its early-warning capabilities and resistance to external shocks  as well as to facilitate the integration of poorer countries into the global economy.  Botswana welcomes the important milestones achieved in strengthening United Nations operational activities for development and improvements in funding for development-related activities  as well as in strengthening the institutional framework for the gender architecture through the creation of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women — UN Women. The creation of the Entity constitutes an important step in fulfilling the commitments undertaken at the 1995 Beijing World Conference on Women  whose main objective was the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women.  Botswana fully supports the strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Peacebuilding Commission. We believe that the role of the Commission should be properly defined by a robust mandate  through the amendment of the founding resolutions and the provision of adequate resources in order to enable it to effectively discharge its mandate.  On a related subject  we fully concur that disarmament and non-proliferation are essential for the promotion of international peace and security. To this end  my delegation welcomes the progress made in some areas but remains deeply concerned that the Conference on Disarmament continues to be deadlocked.  I wish to seize this opportunity to reaffirm Botswana’s commitment to the objectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  which we continue to demonstrate through effective implementation of its provisions as well as compliance with the decisions of the successive Review Conferences. Consequently  Botswana associates itself with the outcome of the 2010 Review Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We fully support the call by developing countries for the peaceful use of nuclear technology in areas such as agriculture  the environment  water management and medicine. However  countries that intend to embark on such use   5 10-55122  of nuclear technology should do so in a transparent fashion and in full cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We therefore call for increased financial support for the IAEA Technical Cooperation Programme as well as for the Agency’s capacity-building  in order to share technology utilization in the relevant areas.  Botswana continues to be deeply concerned about increasing threats to international peace and security. As a peace-loving nation  we believe in the peaceful resolution of conflicts. It is because of this strong belief that we condemn  without reservation  all acts of terrorism  including the 9/11 terrorist attacks  on which our well-known position remains unchanged. My delegation does not believe that the 9/11 attack was orchestrated by the United States of America.  One issue of deep concern to my delegation is the erosion of democracy  respect for human rights and the rule of law in some parts of the world. There is therefore an urgent need for us to reverse this trend  especially because it undermines all the efforts we have made to date to launch our countries on a path of peace  stability and sustainable development. To this end  we commend the various civil society organizations that have consistently sounded alarm bells regarding incidents of human rights violations whenever and wherever they occur.  My country is of the view that the International Criminal Court needs to be supported in its efforts to resolve outstanding cases of arrest warrants that have been issued against persons indicted for the commission of serious crimes. It is in this context that Botswana remains resolute and steadfast in its support for the work of the International Criminal Court. We welcome the landmark decision of the Rome Statute Review Conference held recently in Kampala  Uganda  to extend the jurisdiction of the Court to cover the crime of aggression.  Nowhere is our shared responsibility as members of the international community more critical than in protecting and nurturing our shared environment and our planet  Earth. To this end  it is pertinent to point out that climate change has increasingly become one of humanity’s most daunting challenges. The devastating natural disasters recently experienced in certain quarters of our globe amply demonstrate our vulnerability as inhabitants of the Earth.  I wish to seize this opportunity  on behalf of the Government and the people of Botswana  and indeed on my own account  to express our sympathy and solidarity with all the countries that have been victims of such disasters. We would like to extend our condolences to all the families who lost their loved ones and those whose property and livelihoods were destroyed. We extend our profound appreciation to the Governments as well as private sector and civil society organizations that responded positively to the international humanitarian appeal launched by the United Nations on behalf of the affected countries. In particular  we would like to recognize the countries that led humanitarian interventions. We remain optimistic that the next Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will achieve a successful outcome  one that fully addresses the interests and concerns of both developing and developed countries.  In conclusion  we pray that this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly will go down in history as marking a milestone in efforts aimed at addressing the most pressing global challenges of our time  as well as bringing hope and inspiration to the billions in despair throughout the world. "
"29",1176,"CAF",65,2010,"The Central African Republic would like  through me  to commend Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We congratulate him and offer him our support in fulfilling his great responsibility. His predecessor  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  also deserves our heartfelt commendation and gratitude for the outstanding contribution he made during his term of office in revitalizing the General Assembly. Lastly  on behalf of His Excellency Army General François Bozizé  President and Head of State of our country  allow me to convey our sincere congratulations to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  who has been tireless in carrying out his extremely important role to promote the ideals of the Organization.  The sixty-fifth session is taking place at a time when the world faces many challenges. In addition to the armed conflicts that affect almost every continent  there are also the food  energy and financial crises  which have made the lives of the most vulnerable people increasingly precarious. There are also challenges when it comes to respect for human rights  the rule of law and good governance  which are the foundations of lasting peace and security and a healthy environment. Today  we are aware that systematic violations of human rights and the glaring absence of the rule of law are often the root causes of conflicts and other social crises. States and non-State actors confront each other. Warlords  terrorists and criminal gangs dictate their own rules. Civilians  rather than soldiers  become the first targets. Security policy can no longer be confined to the traditional framework of the State; it must be focused first and foremost on the security of individuals.  As the President rightly said in his opening speech to this session of the General Assembly by way of referring to the special theme for the sixty-fifth session  “we must reinstate the United Nations and the General Assembly at the centre of global governance. The challenges we face today have acquired a global dimension and require global solutions.” (A/65/PV.1)   The Central African Republic continues to believe that preventing and peacefully resolving conflicts are the best way to maintain international peace and security. Many other challenges also require the attention of the international community. We should provide responses tailored to those challenges in order that together we can build a better world  starting with the issue of climate change.  Today more than ever before  the survival of the planet is threatened by changes to the climate that have a serious impact on living conditions in developing countries — owing mainly to desertification  the silting    10-55128 46  up of rivers  ecosystem deterioration  shortened winters and floods. Faced with that danger  it is not a matter of raising questions about respective responsibilities; we must rather  first and foremost  put in place suitable emergency measures to confront the challenge.  In that connection  the outcomes of the Bali Conference are as relevant as ever and they should be implemented. Although  unfortunately  the Copenhagen summit was the scene of selfishness and inconsistency on the part of States vis-à-vis international cooperation and climate policy  we hope that the upcoming meeting at Cancún  Mexico  will find appropriate answers to those worrying issues.  The HIV/AIDS and malaria pandemics are another challenge to which we must give particular attention  as they pose a serious threat to the survival of humankind  in particular on the African continent. With regard to HIV/AIDS  we must truly redouble our efforts and determination to implement the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS and the outcomes of the high-level meetings on AIDS. Child and maternal mortality rates in Africa  whose increase is yet another cause for concern  should also enjoy the same attention as the other issues. All of those meetings have emphasized the gravity of the situation  underscoring the importance of acting and the need to mobilize resources accordingly to fight those health threats.  Achieving Millennium Development Goal 1 on time — namely  reducing by half the number of people who suffer from hunger by 2015 — compels us to put in place a new approach and policy towards international cooperation that is based on support for agriculture  rather than on providing food assistance  which should only be provided in exceptional circumstances  and then in a timely manner.  Developing agriculture in Africa so that it provides for lasting food security also necessarily entails controlling water  the availability of equipment  access to raw materials for producers and proper organization of the means of producing  storing  transforming and marketing agricultural products. The Central African Republic  a country endowed with abundant natural resources  would easily be able to take its place as an agricultural country  were it not for the handicaps it faces owing to its landlocked status and the scarcity of means at its disposal.  Agriculture in my country is essentially a subsistence affair that performs poorly despite the country’s enormous potential. That includes 15 million arable hectares  of which only 600 000 are cultivated annually  as well as 16 million hectares of range land for a herd of 2 million animals. We also have at our disposal a vast network of rivers and streams  as well as abundant rainfall amounting to 1 200 to 1 800 millimetres per year. Agriculture employs more than 75 per cent of working people in our country  contributing about 53 per cent of our gross domestic product.  In the Central African Republic  about 72 per cent of the poor and hungry live in rural areas  where agriculture plays a crucial role  feeding communities but providing employment that offers only meagre incomes. Nevertheless  in spite of the enormity of the need and the growing food insecurity  assistance to agriculture continues to decrease  having dropped significantly in the past 20 years.  The Central African Republic has maintained the strengthening of human capital as one of its priorities under the fourth pillar of its national poverty-reduction strategy. Under that pillar  education  health and employment are considered priority sectors  in line with the Millennium Development Goals. Assessments of the programmes that have been launched seem to reveal shortcomings in the results. For instance  adult literacy rates are poor  at 57 per cent  while the overall primary school attendance rate is also low  at 55 per cent.  The Central African Republic is among the countries of the world most affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic  even though we are continuing efforts to bring its prevalence under control.  Given those outcomes  it is clear that  if our country is to pursue the implementation of the priorities of our development plan  we need significant support from our development partners.  With regard to nuclear disarmament  the proliferation crisis we are experiencing constitutes the greatest threat to international peace and security today. Nuclear disarmament and nuclear proliferation in all their aspects should be at the centre of our debate. We should resolve to prioritize the use of nuclear energy for peaceful civilian purposes.  Today more than ever before  the interconnectedness of the crises faced by the   47 10-55128  international community underscores the need to inject new impetus into efforts to achieve international peace and security  including collective efforts at the international level.  With regard to reforming the United Nations system  the Central African Republic shares the view that the current system no longer reflects the ambitions of the founders. Our country therefore once again calls for full representation for Africa in the system’s decision-making bodies  in particular the Security Council. Whatever the outcome of the ongoing negotiations on this matter  my delegation continues to believe that any viable reform of the Security Council must take into account Africa’s numerical and political significance in the General Assembly  especially given the two types of situations considered by the Council.  The Central African Republic held elections in 2005  which were heralded by the international community for having met all the necessary standards. It should be pointed out that those held in 2010 experienced various difficulties that need to be examined. Therefore  on the basis of a political consensus  the National Assembly adopted a law based on a constitutional court opinion. This constitutional arrangement extends the term of office of our country’s President  as well as those of members of the Assembly  until the holding of elections  now set for  23 January 2011.  In another area  the programme for the disarmament  demobilization and reintegration of former combatants has made considerable progress in the central and north-western parts of our country. Nevertheless  the Central African Republic continues to face security problems in the north-east of the country  as a result of the consequences of the conflict in Darfur  as well as in the south-east  owing to the raging Ugandan rebellion by the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA).  This alarming situation has resulted in a growing number of refugees and internally displaced persons from various areas  who have fled to the cities from the fighting. Having been pushed out of Uganda  LRA rebels have regrouped in the south-east of our country  where they carry out all sorts of violence and spread terror among the people. It is important to point out that the Central African Republic does not have any borders with Uganda.  The Central African Republic therefore welcomes the decision by the United States Government with regard to disarming the LRA. Nevertheless  we hope that the United States Administration will focus in particular on the case of the Central African Republic  which is a post-conflict country that still needs United States assistance  given the danger posed by the LRA on the ground in our country and the disastrous social consequences it has already had. The United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad  whose mandate will expire on 31 December 2010  requires particular attention. The Central African Republic’s defence and security forces will take over from international forces in order to ensure the continuity of operations. However  they are in desperate need of military equipment and supplies. The Government of the Central African Republic therefore appeals to the international community for assistance in strengthening the operational capacities of our armed forces.  I cannot conclude without once again thanking all those whose commitment  courage and determination continue to be of assistance in helping my country to emerge from crisis to lasting peace and development.  "
"30",1223,"CAN",65,2010,"It has now been more than 65 years since the nations of the world  exhausted  and in some cases devastated  by years of war  established the United Nations. Canada was one of those nations — one of the many  in fact  whose fresh experience of conflict had persuaded their peoples that the possibility of a better world  one in which nations resolved their differences peacefully  was an objective worthy of their every effort.  Today  the Canadian people continue to believe in that purpose and will continue to strive to live by the principles that would make it possible. Such principles are enshrined in the Charter of this Organization; that same United Nations Charter endorsed with happiness and hope by a former Canadian Government on that auspicious June day in San Francisco in 1945.  Those foundational beliefs recognize the sovereign equality of countries. They remind us of the obligation to settle disputes peacefully  and they demand we seek justice and uphold the human rights of all people. Those are values that Canadians hold dear  and  as the universal membership of this body implies  so do peoples the world over. That widespread consensus continues to convince the idealist in all of us that so much more is possible in this world of ours.  At the same time  it makes the gap between aspiration and achievement so disappointing. It calls us onward to do more  as successive Canadian Governments have worked diligently to do for almost a lifetime.  Those ideals  as well as an acute awareness of the broad concerns of the international community  especially those of the developing countries  continue to animate the Government of Canada  the Government that I lead today. Those ideals have the enthusiastic support of the Canadian people  and I do not foresee any day or motivation that would lead us to cease in our endeavours in this regard.   The question  as always  is how this is to be done. Our preference is to take meaningful action  action that produces real results  action that helps people in their struggle with oppression  disaster and poverty. Let me just run through some of those actions. As a founding member of the United Nations and the seventh-largest contributor to its finances  Canada has been a consistently reliable and responsible participant in United Nations initiatives around the world. This was so in the earliest days of the United Nations. It was so during the difficult days of the cold war  decolonization and the struggle against apartheid  and it remains so today. Canada continues to pay  for instance  a heavy price to fulfil our United Nations obligation to support the lawful Government of Afghanistan. We pay it with the resources of Canadian taxpayers  but more profoundly in sorrow for the priceless lives of our young men and women who serve there in the Canadian forces  as well as  sadly  civilians who have also given their sweat and their lives in the service of both our country and the people of Afghanistan.  In Afghanistan  our military efforts have gone hand in hand with our reconstruction and development programmes. In particular  Canada supports those such as the Dahla Dam  which will have enduring economic benefit. We have also invested heavily in other programmes which will improve the lives of that country’s most vulnerable citizens  and we will continue to do so.  Our international engagement is by no means restricted to Afghanistan. In fact  elsewhere in the world  we have also expanded our efforts. We pledge to   45 10-54827  double our aid to Africa thereby making Canada a leader in the Group of Eight (G-8). And we are on track to double our overall development assistance by March of next year. Furthermore  we have untied food aid  and all Canadian aid will be untied by 2013. Such measures significantly extend the purchasing power of Canadian aid funds.  Canada was also among the first last year at the G-8 Summit at L’Aquila to double support for agricultural development. During the economic crisis as well  we acted  in concert with our Group of Twenty (G-20) partners  to increase the lending capacity of development organizations like the Inter-American Development Bank and the African Development Bank. In particular  we have made a significant contribution to peace and security in Africa  including to peace initiatives  humanitarian assistance and reconstruction in the Sudan  since taking office in January 2006. We have also provided leadership in peacebuilding in Sierra Leone.   Canada welcomes the resumption of direct talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. We sincerely hope that the discussions will be successful  and we will continue to assist the Palestinian Authority in building its institutions.   As members know  we have also engaged very extensively in Haiti  both before and since the terrible earthquake earlier this year. Canada was among the first nations to provide tangible relief in various forms  and it has made a long-term commitment to assist the people of Haiti in rebuilding their severely damaged country.  Most recently  Pakistan has faced devastating floods  and Canada has again responded swiftly. All these actions are born from Canadian ideals.  So allow me to say one thing. This Assembly should know that Canada is eligible to serve on the Security Council. And if we are elected  we will be ready to serve. And if called upon to serve on the Security Council  we shall be informed by these ideals and strive to further them  just as we have striven to implement Security Council resolutions.  I should also mention Canada’s role this year as Chair of the G-8 and host of the most recent meeting of the G-20. We have tried to ensure that these gatherings serve the broader interests of the entire global community. In preparation for the G-20  we conducted wide-ranging outreach sessions  including with the Secretaries-General of the Commonwealth  la Francophonie and  of course  this Organization. We used our chairmanship of the G-8 to reach out to leaders from Africa and the Americas and to secure an agreement to enact the Muskoka Initiative for maternal  newborn and child health.  Such progress is literally vital in meeting the most achievable of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals — to reduce the appalling mortality among mothers and children in developing countries.  We are mobilizing support from donor nations and private foundations. Together  we should be able to mobilize more than $10 billion over five years. This will contribute in a major way to the Secretary-General’s Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health. Likewise  we announced here two day ago that Canadian taxpayers would make an enhanced replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria. We did these things for one simple reason: to alleviate the suffering and  indeed  save the lives of people all over the world who are among the millions afflicted with these grave and debilitating diseases. Actions such as these are a moral imperative. It is essential that we strive to make a significant  actual difference in the lives of the world’s most disadvantaged people. Who  seeing his neighbour distressed  will pass by on the other side of the road?  That is why we have also used our chairmanship of the G-8 to further the essential ethic of accountability. We published the first accountability report to ensure that  as donor countries  we fulfil the pledges that we make. Our words must be translated into action and we must make a real difference to those who need our help. And to that end  as many of you also know  Canadian taxpayers have forgiven debts    10-54827 46  totalling $1 billion owed by the world’s poorest countries.  However  let us not limit our horizons by looking just at the least we can do. Much higher goals are within our capacity if we will but reach for them. In the short time that I have here today  there is one thought above all others that I wish to share. It is the pressing need in the twenty-first century for all the States of the world to adopt an enlightened view of sovereignty. As I said earlier  respect for sovereignty is a fundamental principle of the United Nations. However  the global recession of the past two years has taught us  we hope  a painful lesson. We have been forcefully reminded that  in this shrinking world  we all travel together in a single boat  not as solo voyagers  and that how we travel together matters. This is because our interests are all interconnected: from climate change to health and pandemic threats and to  of course  the economy. For example  nations that do not consider the effects of their economic choices on others may hurt not only their trading partners  but themselves as well. Those who succumb to the lure of protectionism soon find that trading partners denied a market also lack the means to be a customer. To recognize that is to understand the need for enlightened sovereignty  the idea that what is good for others may well be the best way to pursue one’s own interests. In business  it is called win-win  and it is good for business. In international affairs  it is good for development and for justice  and it is in the spirit of the United Nations Charter. It is therefore of the highest importance  in a passionate world of competing interests and principles  where every person left to himself does what is right in his own sight. In such a world  the need for an enlightened  expansive view of sovereignty is as great now as it ever was.  At the outset of these remarks  I referred to the origins of the United Nations. It was founded at the end of the greatest and most destructive war that had ever disturbed the ocean of humanity. That war was certainly attributable in part to an extreme and pernicious nationalism. But we should never forget that appeasement and expediency also allowed fascism to gather such strength that it required the whole and undivided effort of the world’s free peoples to subdue it.  The United Nations mission has grown over time  but its core job remains the same: through peace and development  to build a better world  to prevent war and conflict  yet at the same time  to uphold what is right and to protect the weak and the poor from those who prey upon them. The Government of Canada has always been deeply committed to these objectives and to the Organization that nurtures them. It remains so today. As we attend to our own affairs  in  for example  the protection of Canada’s Arctic or the promotion of our trade or the pursuit of our values  Canada will be guided by the same advice we prescribe for others. We will listen to their concerns  we will speak the truth  and we will act with vigour. We will do all these things ever mindful that peace and opportunity for all remain  always  our ultimate purpose.   I know it has been a long meeting this morning  and I thank members for their attention."
"31",1238,"CHE",65,2010,"It is a great honour for me to address  on behalf of Switzerland  the General Assembly  which this year is presided over by my compatriot  Mr. Joseph Deiss. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the President on his election. His election is a great honour for Switzerland and is not only a personal recognition of President Deiss and his work but also of our country’s commitment to the United Nations as a member of the Organization and a defender of multilateralism.  We find ourselves today in a building that is undergoing renovations. The architectural makeover of the United Nations prompts me to ask: what kind of United Nations are we building for the next 10  20 or 30 years? We need a United Nations that can face the challenges of the future for the good of all. We need a United Nations that will contribute effectively to solving the world’s problems. We need Member States that are ready to take full responsibility for building a better world.  The future of the United Nations must reflect the world of tomorrow. Today  nearly one billion people are still malnourished. There will be many more people sharing this planet in the future  and no doubt we will have to make do with fewer resources. Thanks to new developments in technology and information  our citizens participate more directly in the challenges facing our societies. They are increasingly better informed and feel that at least some of the legitimacy of this universal Organization depends on its ability to respond effectively to those challenges. They demand accountability.  In a more globalized world  we must treasure and defend the principles of the United Nations Charter. We must take care to ensure the proper functioning of this common structure in a spirit of solidarity  respect and responsibility.  A strong international community requires solidarity. That means more than providing assistance to countries when they are unable to help their own citizens. It also means reminding States of the responsibilities they have towards their own people in areas such as security  the rule of law  human rights and democracy  and all that in respect for the United Nations Charter. Every woman  every man  every citizen must make his and her contribution to the structure we are building together. At the same time every Member State must be able to place its national interests second to the common good. That is the only way we will be able to find solutions that are in everyone’s interest.   Every day we are reminded of the growing and increasingly complex global challenges confronting us: the economic and financial crisis  climate change  energy and food security  development and poverty  and peace and security. The search for sustainable solutions to those challenges calls for real governance  governance  moreover  that must reflect the new realities in the world. The new-found prosperity of some must go hand in hand with new responsibilities. States whose economic success enables them to play a more active role in the governance of the world must accept the new responsibilities that go with that active role.  The United Nations enjoys a unique legitimacy because of its universal membership. Its legitimacy also derives from the issues it addresses  which concern us all. This week’s agenda is the best possible   9 10-54827  proof. But the legitimacy of an organization also depends on its performance and its ability to respond to the expectations placed on it.   By that standard the United Nations sometimes delivers mixed results. At times it seems ill-equipped and hesitant to act. The power derived from universal membership becomes a burden when we Member States are divided. Our debates should not be limited to the lowest common denominator. They must lead to action and to results in the interest of the common good of humanity.  If the United Nations fails to act  other groups representing only a fraction of the countries of the world will step in  zealous for effective action  and play a central role in global governance. As far as Switzerland is concerned  such groups lack legitimacy by virtue of their limited composition. It is therefore crucial for the United Nations and its principal organs to remain at the centre of world governance. That is why we must take care to ensure that the legitimacy of this universal body does not suffer from a lack of efficiency. To make progress in building a better world  it is our collective responsibility to meet a global challenge with a global response. Switzerland wants to contribute to this joint effort.  Concerted global action is required in the following areas.   The Millennium Development Goals must be implemented rapidly and fully. We know that dropping a sack of rice from a helicopter is not enough. We must instead teach people how to grow rice. Still today  1.4 billion people around the world are living in extreme poverty. Every day too many mothers and children die of malnutrition and lack of care. We know that huge financial means are needed after a disaster. Money flows in emergency situations  but who is still concerned three years later? Who is involved in the reconstruction?  Binding objectives must be defined as quickly as possible for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Nowadays  we have knowledge and we have clean and green technology. We must take action  each nation with measures aimed at its own targets. Waiting for the industrialized countries to invest in the South will not lead anywhere. Here too  all must fulfil their own responsibilities. This year in Mexico we still have an opportunity to make progress. The recent natural disasters are unmistakable signs. Switzerland will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2020.   Thirty years after the Cold War  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remains a grave threat to peace and security. But for civilian populations  the real devastation is caused by small arms and light weapons. Terrorists benefit from that situation by easily supplying themselves in the arms market. Switzerland  together with other countries  is supporting the full implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. That initiative provides for the involvement of specialists in humanitarian aid and education.  Gender equality must at last become a reality. Access to education and health for women and girls has been restricted for decades. More than others  they have been victims of poverty. They have also been the targets of systematic violence in armed conflicts. It is high time to make full use of their potential in mediation and reconstruction in countries affected by conflict. In that context  Switzerland welcomes the creation of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women — UN Women — which brings us closer to the fulfilment of this vision.  We must avoid making the United Nations an immutable historic monument  but rather turn it into a dynamic organization. The United Nations is the only organization in the world with the legitimacy to represent all nations and all peoples. It is the only legitimate organization in the world capable of narrowing differences and restoring a balance between regions.   For that to happen  however  every Member State must accept its responsibilities and start with the task of putting its own house in order. Discussion and preparing reports are not enough  however; we need to act. Each Member State must commit itself clearly within the Organization to respond to the urgent questions facing the world of today and of tomorrow. Such commitments will strengthen confidence in the United Nations and its credibility.   Switzerland remains firmly convinced of the aptness of a multilateral approach  with the United Nations at its centre. With the contributions of everyone in this Hall today we will be able to create a more just  peaceful and prosperous world. I thank all who are gathered here for their collective commitment."
"32",1284,"CHL",65,2010,"I wish to begin by conveying our heartfelt congratulations to you  Mr. President  on your election to guide the work of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. Your human and professional qualities are a guarantee of success in the Assembly’s important tasks.  I come to this rostrum as the representative of Chile  a country that is far away on the map but that is inhabited by a people that is close and that is in solidarity and brotherhood; a country geographically narrow but with a big and generous heart; a country physically surrounded by an arid desert to the north  majestic mountains to the east  a huge sea to the west and the magnificent Antarctica to the south. Despite that  it is a people with a permanent and steadfast commitment and calling to integration in the world. It is a country that like many others has experienced division and discord among its children but that is today fully united and reconciled; a country with a fearless and earthy character but possessing indomitable determination and valour; a country of warriors and heroes but that has enjoyed uninterrupted peace for 130 years. It is a young country but with age-old institutions  and it views the present with confidence and the future with optimism.  Chile is a country that today is living through times that are historic and dramatic and offer enormous opportunities. I say historic times because only five days ago we commemorated our two-hundredth anniversary of independence and opened the doors to our third century of republican life. We did so as one big family saluting the same flag  honouring the same heroes and singing the same national anthem irrespective of our political ideas  religious beliefs  ethnic origin or economic situation.  But Chile is also living through dramatic times of adversity and sadness. A few months ago our country suffered one of the five worst earthquakes in human history  followed by tidal waves on our coastlines. Five hundred and twenty-one of our fellow citizens lost their lives and many are still missing. More than 2 million Chileans were affected. Entire cities and villages were demolished. Hundreds of hospitals  clinics  bridges and ports are still unusable. One of every three children — 1.25 million — were unable to return to school because the schools had been destroyed or badly damaged. Total losses amounted to about $30 billion  equivalent to about 18 per cent of our national product. Without doubt  it was the largest catastrophe with the biggest damage ever suffered by our country in the history of its 200 years of independence.  But from those ruins rose a people united in solidarity. After a mere 45 days all children and young people had returned to school. In only 60 days we were able to restore proper health-care services in the affected areas. In only 90 days we had built more emergency housing than we had built throughout our country’s prior history. In 100 days we had entirely restored connections  providing full or partial services to airports  ports  roads  bridges — everything the earthquake had destroyed. In 120 days our economy had recovered the capacity to grow and create employment with greater strength than ever.  Certainly  reconstruction has only just begun and will require years of effort. But to that end we will continue to work tirelessly until we have rebuilt the last school  the last hospital or the last home that had been destroyed. Because for a country such as Chile  which has been shaped by adversity  determination and hard work  however difficult a crisis may be or how painful its consequences  it always represents an opportunity — the opportunity to build a better country together.  In addition to being historic and dramatic  these are times of enormous opportunities. That is because this generation of Chileans — the bicentennial generation — is in position to fulfil the dream our parents and grandparents had always cherished but never achieved. That dream is to succeed in making Chile  before the end of this decade  a country able to    10-54833 26  defeat poverty  to defeat underdevelopment and to create opportunities for material and spiritual development for all of its children  which Chile has never before known.  How will we do this? First  by strengthening the three basic pillars so that development germinates and opportunities flourish. At the political level that requires a stable  participatory  transparent and vital democracy; at the economic level  a social market economy open to the world and trusting unreservedly in the economic entrepreneurship and creativity of its citizens; and at the social level  a State that is strong and effective in the fight against poverty and in promoting greater equality of opportunities.  But we will build upon rock  and not upon sand. What was done before is insufficient. We must strengthen the pillars of society  knowledge and information. I am thinking about the development of our human capital  which is the greatest wealth we possess. We must encourage innovation and entrepreneurship  which are the only truly renewable and inexhaustible natural resources that we have. We must invest in science and technology  which will create unimaginable opportunities for the future we all face  and we must promote more dynamic and flexible markets and institutions in order to confront the changes and opportunities that have become the challenges of the modern world.  For those reasons  almost 65 years ago  Chile  together with 50 other countries  attended the formation of this United Nations  whose goal was to maintain peace  security and international cooperation. That was the post-war period  when our planet was crossed and divided by two walls. One was the iron curtain running from north to south  dividing the world for a long time into two irreconcilable blocs  each with sufficient war-making capacity to annihilate our planet several times over. But there was another wall  the one running from east to west  which separated the rich and prosperous countries of the North from the poor and underdeveloped nations of the South.  Both walls fell before our eyes as the sun set on the twentieth century. The first wall was in Berlin  in Central Europe  and the second one in Silicon Valley  Bangalore  Singapore  New Zealand and in the main technological centres throughout the world. But the fall of these walls uncovered a third wall  less visible than the previous ones but equally or more harmful and damaging. That wall has existed in our countries and peoples forever  separating the older souls who live in nostalgia and fear the future from the young souls who are creative and entrepreneurial and embrace the future fearlessly and always believe that the best is still to come.  That wall prevented many of our nations from joining the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century. That explains why there are still underdeveloped countries while others  fewer in number  managed to demolish that wall in time and to join that revolution.  But today we are confronted by a new revolution  more powerful and more significant than the Industrial Revolution: the revolution of knowledge  technology and the information society. It has been knocking at our doors for several years. It will be very generous to the countries that want to embrace it  but tremendously indifferent and even cruel to those that ignore it or simply let it pass. And in order to deepen our integration and to govern globalization better — lest globalization should end up governing us — the crisis must be addressed differently.  The financial crisis has ceased to be a national problem and has acquired regional and often global implications. The evils of modern society such as terrorism  drug trafficking and organized crime know no frontiers or territories or jurisdictions. And any attempts to effectively tackle global warming  natural disasters  health emergencies  hunger or extreme poverty are going to require action that is much more attentive  concerted and effective on the part of the community of nations.  So the United Nations and other institutions deriving from the Bretton Woods consensus  such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  urgently need to modernize and adapt to the new times if they want to play a leading role and not be mere spectators of events to which we will be witnesses and principal actors. Those new times are the changes already taking place in this new century.  As in 1945  when Chile participated in the creation of this Organization  and with the authority conferred on us by the fact of having actively participated in each one of its forums — peacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions — today we also want to participate in encouraging and promoting the great reform and modernization that the United Nations   27 10-54833  and the international order require. That must be done by creating a much more demanding and efficient institution in terms of goals and expectations  one more flexible and effective in structure and more determined and committed in the defence of the ideals for which it was created.  In other words  we need a United Nations able to meet the challenges and needs of the twenty-first century  which we all know are genuine peace  sustainable progress and respect for the dignity of all those who inhabit our planet. Such reforms require modernizing the Security Council so that it is more pluralistic and representative of the new global reality. In this regard  we reiterate our appeal for the incorporation of other emerging countries  such as Brazil  on our own continent.  I should also like to take this opportunity to offer my very sincere congratulations to my predecessor as President of Chile  Michelle Bachelet  on her recent appointment as Under-Secretary-General for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women  and to express my pride and that of my whole nation at the fact that a compatriot will be head of a global effort to achieve greater equality between men and women. I am sure that  given her human and professional qualities  she will lead the new gender entity brilliantly and effectively.  I also wish to reaffirm our commitment to the principles that have always governed and guided our foreign policy  including full respect for international law  the inviolability of treaties  the juridical equality of States  the peaceful settlement of disputes and the self-determination of peoples  which are unquestionably essential foundations of international stability and peaceful coexistence among nations.  I also stress the importance of the promotion of democracy and respect for human rights at all times  in all places and in all circumstances  and our lasting commitment to multilateralism and open regionalism that promote constructive and more cooperative economic practices among the countries of the world and of our region. Chile will never cease to raise its voice in all international gatherings and forums to defend these principles.  Here at the United Nations today  I also wish to sincerely recognize the aboriginal peoples who inhabited our lands thousands of years before the European explorers and conquistadors arrived. We are very proud to be a multicultural nation  but we recognize that we failed for centuries to give our aboriginal peoples the opportunities they deserved and needed. That is why we in Chile are promoting the constitutional recognition of all our aboriginal peoples  abandoning the strategy of assimilation and moving towards that of integration. Such a strategy respects  values and protects their languages  culture and traditions  which are part of our deepest national wealth. Along with this constitutional recognition  we have established a dialogue involving the Government  civil society and our aboriginal peoples  in particular the Mapuche  to strengthen the agenda for historic rediscovery with the most powerful initiative ever launched in Chile on this subject — the Araucanía Plan.  I would also like to recall that only weeks ago my country was shaken by an event heard around the world. A rockslide of more than 100 million tons left 33 miners trapped deep under a mountain in the Atacama desert. From that moment  our Government and country committed themselves body and soul and made their very best efforts to launch a search-and-rescue operation. Seventeen anguishing days later  we were able to reach the trapped miners. They sent up a  message that filled all my compatriots’ hearts with joy: “We are okay  we are safe  the 33”. This represents the whole paradox of our country. We have struggled so hard to save the lives of the 33 miners  and yet at the same time we have 34 Mapuche herders who are on a hunger strike that is killing them.  I wish to conclude by telling those assembled here that the example of courage and perseverance set by our 33 miners will light the path to the future. The future is always an adventure. For pessimists  it means fear; for sceptics  it means doubt; but for all men and women of good will  it always means challenges and opportunities that we must meet together in order to build a better world than the one we inherited from our parents  and which we have a duty to bequeath to our children. That challenge  my friends  is for us  and it is now  because if it is not now  when  and if not for us  then for whom? "
"33",1330,"CHN",65,2010,"China is a member of the big family of the United Nations  and China’s development and changes have attracted worldwide attention. I wish to take this opportunity to share with the Assembly my observations on how one should get to know the real China.  Since the founding of the People’s Republic  and especially since the start of reform and opening up more than 30 years ago  profound changes have taken place in China  a big  ancient country in the East. Its economic and overall national strength has substantially increased. The lives of its people have markedly improved. Its social and cultural programmes have made considerable progress  and its exchanges and cooperation with the outside world have continued to expand. In sum  my country has made an historic leap from mere subsistence to moderate prosperity.    10-54827 42   We in China are proud of our achievements  which were made through strenuous efforts. At the same time  we are clear-headed about our place and role in today’s world.  China’s gross domestic product is the third largest in the world  but in per capita terms it is only one tenth of that of developed countries. China has enjoyed more than 30 years of rapid growth  but its further development faces energy  resources and environmental constraints. It is a leading producer of many important products  but it remains at the lower end of the global industrial chain. China is a big trading nation  but its exports are low in technology content and value added. In many cases  we have to rely on imports to meet the demand for core technologies.   China’s coastal areas and some of the large and medium-sized cities are thriving after modernizing  but many places in the central and western regions and the vast rural areas are still rather backward. Moreover  we have 150 million people living below the poverty line set by the United Nations.   The life of the Chinese people has improved significantly  but we do not yet have a full-fledged social security system. Moreover  we are confronted with high employment pressure. Our people are more and more actively engaged in the country’s social and political development  and citizens’ basic rights and interests are better protected  yet our democracy and legal system still have room for improvement and such social ills as inequity and corruption still exist.  China has come a long way in modernization. It is fairly advanced in some areas of development but remains backward in others. And it faces unprecedented challenges brought by problems both old and new.   Taken as a whole  China is still in the primary stage of socialism and remains a developing country. Those are our basic national conditions. That is the real China.  China has set the strategic goal of achieving modernization by the middle of this century. As they look to the coming decades  the Chinese people will continue to advance along the path of reform  opening up and peaceful development. That path has changed China’s destiny and has benefited people throughout the country. We must stay on that path and make further improvements. There is no reason whatsoever for us to deviate from it.  China will continue to focus on developing the economy. Development is our top priority  as it constitutes the basis for addressing all issues. We will rely mainly on our own efforts in pursuing development.  As China’s industrialization and urbanization progress  hundreds of millions of farmers will move to towns and cities  which will create more domestic demand than ever  open up broad market and development space and serve as a powerful engine for sustaining the growth of the Chinese economy as well as the world economy at large. We will work hard to transform the economic development pattern  restructure the economy and set out on a path of balanced and sustainable development.  China will continue to deepen institutional reform. We will make consistent efforts to improve the socialist market economy. We will unswervingly strengthen and develop the public sector side of the economy and also unswervingly encourage  support and guide the development of the non-public sector. We will pay greater attention to ensuring and improving people’s well-being. We will further reform the income distribution system and improve the social security system  including old-age support  medical care and unemployment benefit programmes. We will endeavour to narrow the gap between urban and rural areas  between different regions and between the rich and the poor. We want to ensure that each and every citizen shares the benefit of China’s reform  opening up and development.   While deepening economic restructuring  we will also push forward with political restructuring. Otherwise  we cannot achieve the ultimate goal of economic reform and we will lose what we have gained from our modernization drive. We respect and protect human rights  uphold social equity and justice and strive to achieve free and all-around development for our people. That is the important hallmark of a democratic country under the rule of law and a basic guarantee for any country’s lasting peace and stability.  China will be even more open to the world. Mutually beneficial cooperation for win-win progress is a long-term strategy that we will stick to in opening up to the world. We will follow established international rules in expanding business ties with   43 10-54827  other countries. We will continue to improve the environment for foreign investors  optimize the structure of foreign capital utilization and explore new ways for overseas investment and cooperation.   We are committed to promoting the establishment of a fair  equitable  inclusive and well-managed new international financial order and an open and free international trading regime. We are against protectionism in all its manifestations. In the course of modernization  we will not only continue to bring in and utilize advanced achievements from the rest of the world in the economic  scientific and technological fields  but also boldly draw upon the achievements of human civilization in the fields of social management and cultural development.  China will continue to develop education  science and technology. How can China narrow the development gap with the advanced countries and enhance the sustainability of its strong growth? I believe two things are of fundamental importance: first is education  and second is science and technology. China has formulated medium- and long-term development programmes on education and on science and technology. Going forward  we will focus our efforts on implementing those two programmes and building China into a country strong in human resources and innovation by 2020.  China will continue to carry forward its fine culture. The development of a country and rejuvenation of a nation require not only great economic strength  but  more importantly  great cultural strength. The moral values and wisdom drawn from the 5 000-year-old Chinese civilization do not belong to China alone but also to the world. We will vigorously develop cultural programmes and accelerate the development of a moral and ethical code that is commensurate with our socialist modernization drive and consistent with the traditional virtues of our nation.   We respect the diversity of civilizations and will increase dialogue and exchanges with other civilizations to forge a common cultural bond for humanity. The Chinese nation  which has created an economic miracle  will create a new cultural splendor as well.  The world of the twenty-first century is far from tranquil  but gone are the days when problems were ultimately settled by war. Peace and development remain the defining features of our time.   China will stay firmly committed to peaceful development. One may ask what the essence of peaceful development is. It is to foster a peaceful international environment for our development and  at the same time  contribute to world peace through our development. That is something inherent in the concept of socialism with Chinese characteristics.  In the course of development  China will continue to take upon itself the duty of promoting the common progress and prosperity of mankind. We will seek and expand converging interests with other countries. China’s development will not harm anyone or pose a threat to anyone. There have been Powers who sought hegemony once they grew strong. China will never follow in their footsteps.  China values friendship and also adheres to its principles. It firmly upholds its core interests. When it comes to sovereignty  national unity and territorial integrity  China will not yield or compromise.  China will continue to firmly support the leading role of the United Nations in international affairs. We will  as always  abide by the United Nations Charter and fulfil in good faith our obligations under international conventions. We will intensify cooperation with fellow developing countries and support their having a greater say in international affairs. We will remain forever a good partner of and brother to developing countries.  China’s stability and development is conducive to a more peaceful international environment  a more democratic international order  a more prosperous global economy and a more harmonious and civilized world. China’s development is an opportunity for the world  and the world stands to gain from a China that is better off. History will continue to prove that.  A China that develops peacefully  a China that is full of vigour and vitality and a China that is willing and ready to fulfil its responsibilities will always move forward together with the world. Let us join hands to work for a world of enduring peace and prosperity."
"34",1364,"CIV",65,2010,"I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on your brilliant election to the presidency of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. That election is a sign of the unanimous recognition of your personal commitment to promote the role of this Organization and to defend its ideals. It is also the crowning moment in a talented diplomatic career that you have led with skill and tact. It is therefore to you as a skilled diplomat that I would like to pay warm homage.   It is also my pleasure to express to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  my delegation’s appreciation for the quality of the work he undertook and the results achieved under his presidency. Finally  allow me to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his personal commitment and tireless efforts to support peace and development throughout the world. Furthermore  I wish to convey my deep gratitude to him as well as the gratitude of His Excellency Mr. Laurent Gbagbo  President of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire  as well as that of the people and Government of Côte d’Ivoire for his commitment to reach a settlement of the crisis in Côte d’Ivoire.   By proposing the theme of reaffirming the United Nations central role in global governance for this session  Mr. President  you celebrate the primacy of multilateralism over unilateralism as a method for managing global affairs in the best possible manner. Moreover  you are transforming our Organization into the forum of choice for dealing with issues of global concern. That vision is  without any doubt  in line with that of developing countries in general and my country  Côte d’Ivoire  in particular and can only take shape if the United Nations retains its credibility by adapting to an international context that has considerably changed since its founding in 1945. This requires urgent and thorough reform  because we believe that our Organization has resisted the widespread changes in the world that it was established to serve.   Because the United Nations is at the crossroads of all of the world’s problems  it is here that we can fully assess what has happened since it was founded. This is the appropriate place to assess the progress achieved as well as the failings. It is also here that we can envisage solutions to problems that now confront the world. Those issues include poverty  which is the source of all evils  and which remains an open wound on humanity  which continues to make progress to the point where it is already considering human settlements on the moon. But unfortunately  at the same time  humanity is forgetting that more than a billion men and women across the planet Earth suffer from hunger. Women’s lives are lost as they give life. Millions of children die before reaching the age of 5  and access to drinking water is limited in Africa. The AIDS epidemic and the malaria epidemic kill more people than all the wars combined. If the world is powerless  the United Nations must be adapted to provide proper responses to those imbalances  because there are not two worlds  there is just one world  which is our common heritage. Managing that world must be done in a joint manner  and it must be shared equitably. The United Nations must demonstrate the example and show the path forward.  In that regard  my country’s position has remained unchanged. For Côte d’Ivoire  that long-sought reform must aim for balance in the main bodies of the United Nations  including in particular a larger Security Council and improvement in its working methods. That is why my delegation places much hope in the successful outcome of the intergovernmental negotiations that were launched by the General Assembly on reform of the Organization in general and the Security Council in particular.  This session of the Assembly is taking place at a moment when the global economy is beginning a fragile recovery  following the most serious economic crisis the world has faced since the Great Depression of the 1930s. That crisis has shown  and indeed has exacerbated  the vulnerability of integrated world economies  ruined development efforts and threatened collective security. Many countries  mainly developing countries  are continuing to suffer the effects of the   9 10-55396  crisis through a drop in the purchasing power of their people  the growing shortage of official development assistance  falling foreign direct investment and growth in unemployment.   If  as the experts tell us  the global economy has begun to recover this year  it nevertheless continues to be fragile  with a growth rate of a mere 2.2 per cent. In such a situation  we must seek  in solidarity and by combining our efforts  the most appropriate solutions to consolidate that tendency to growth. Meeting that fundamental requirement will allow us to establish throughout the world societies that are safer  more equitable  more inclusive and more stable.   My delegation therefore calls on the industrialized countries to make a reality of their commitments with regard to developing countries  especially in terms of official development assistance  if the developing countries are to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.  Côte d’Ivoire also hopes to see the diligent implementation of the conclusions of the United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development  which was held here from 24 to 26 June 2009  particularly those calling for reform and strengthening of the financial and economic system and of the international financial architecture in order to adapt them to current difficulties.  It also desires that that reform should not only allow developing countries in general and those of Africa in particular to have more adequate representation in international financial institutions  but should also promote economic and financial policies that are better adapted to their needs.   Along those lines  I would like to pay tribute to the summit of the Group of Eight (G-8) held in June 2010 in Muskoka  Canada  which reaffirmed  inter alia  the commitments of the G-8 with regard to official development assistance and the guarantee of aid effectiveness. It called for the effective mobilization of all public and private resources for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. It also emphasized the urgent need for collective action to achieve the MDGs  particularly improvement in maternal health and reduction of infant mortality.   On that specific point  my delegation would like to welcome the creation within the United Nations system of UN Women  a special body responsible for gender issues and the advancement of women. That new body and the establishment of a trust fund to support initiatives for women is a real cause for hope for developing countries  particularly those in Africa  in their struggle against poverty  discrimination and social inequalities.  In that connection  I wish to warmly congratulate Ms. Michelle Bachelet on her appointment to head UN Women and assure her of the full cooperation of the authorities of Côte d’Ivoire in fulfilling her mandate.  Food insecurity  which now affects more than  1 billion people  mainly in developing countries  is a major and immediate obstacle to development and a threat to world peace and security.   In the face of that situation  for which the entire international community is responsible  we need to find innovative  effective and lasting solutions in terms of financing for agriculture. My delegation welcomes the efforts being made by the World Bank  regional development banks and the specialized funds and agencies of the United Nations for financing the agricultural sector. Similarly  it welcomes the launching in 2009 of the L’Aquila Food Security Initiative  which allowed the G-8 to mobilize $22 billion to finance agriculture in developing countries over a period of three years.  The delegation of Côte d’Ivoire welcomes  finally  the reform under way of the Committee on World Food Security and the launching of the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme.   Similarly  I would like to recall the proposals made by President Laurent Gbagbo  at the meeting of the Group of 77 and China that was held in June 2008 at Yamoussoukro  to set up a mutual support mechanism for providing food products to importing countries by producing countries while aiming to create in the United Nations a stabilization fund for food products.  Climate change is rightly seen as a global problem and today represents a serious threat to humankind’s equilibrium. It therefore requires clear and committed responses at the international level. Thus it is important that we rapidly find solutions that can ensure that future generations will have a world that is better balanced and guarantees a better future for humankind.  In that regard  the delegation of Côte d’Ivoire welcomes the significant progress of the United    10-55396 10  Nations Conference on Climate Change  held from 7 to 18 December 2009 in Copenhagen. Although the principle of a legally binding accord to succeed the Kyoto Protocol after 2012 was not reached  the hopes promoted by that meeting largely justified its being held. Moreover  the significant progress achieved confirms us in that opinion.  Among the advances made we would mention  inter alia  the consensus on the goals for stabilizing the temperature rise at 2°C  the creation of a mechanism to mobilize financial resources for the absorption of greenhouse gas emissions by forests  and the commitment of developed countries to provide  $30 billion for the period 2010 to 2012  and $100 billion as of 2020 for measures to adapt to climate change in developing countries.   The diligent implementation of those measures should allow vulnerable States such as my own to establish plans to combat climate change  which is becoming increasingly evident throughout the world in an upsurge in natural disasters related to drought  flooding and coastal erosion. The effects of all of those events on the health of populations and on the availability of land and potable water compromise the economic and social development of many States that have already been weakened by poverty and pandemics. The United Nations  in line with its Charter  has the duty to carry out the negotiations that were begun in Copenhagen and must work resolutely to that end.  Respect for human rights is a concern for my country  which has endorsed the set of international instruments in that regard. Though it was affected by the socio-political crisis  the human rights situation in my country is today on a path to normalization  thanks especially to the valuable help of national and international non-governmental organizations involved in that area. The international community could see that on 3 December 2009 in Geneva  when the Working Group on the universal periodic review took up Côte d’Ivoire. That review led to the adoption on 18 March 2010 of a final report that earned my country the support and encouragement of the States members of the Human Rights Council for our stated will to pursue efforts to improve human rights.  The persistence of numerous armed conflicts around the world continues to threaten international peace and security. Once again  the role of the United Nations is vital to resolving those conflicts  which are hindering the harmonious development of the world. That is particularly true in Africa  a region that  shaken by hotbeds of tension  cannot ensure its peaceful economic and social development  despite its enormous potential.   In that regard  allow me to stress how happy we are that the peace so much hoped for is now a reality in Côte d’Ivoire  following the implementation of the Ouagadougou Political Agreement  which will permit the organization of free  transparent and open elections. The first round of presidential elections has been set for 31 October 2010. Besides setting that date  the signing on 9 September 2010 of a presidential decree finalizing the ballot list allows for the distribution of national identity and voting cards to the 5 725 720 Ivorians who are on the list that has been validated by the Independent Electoral Commission and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.   Those signs of progress in the peace process and the proven determination of political players and the Ivorian people to move towards free  open and transparent elections allow us to envisage  with optimism  the holding of the presidential election on the appointed date and thus of Côte d’Ivoire emerging from its crisis.  On that hopeful note  I would like to conclude by recalling that the various crises of security  food  energy and finances  compounded by the threat of climate change  demonstrate the extent to which in the existence  balance and future development of humanity are now threatened more than ever. In that context the United Nations has a crucial role to play in strengthening indispensable international solidarity and in seeking effective  collective and appropriate solutions to those crises and challenges.   However  to be fully engaged with its time and to remain true to the objectives of its founding 65 years ago  the United Nations must adapt to the realities of the contemporary world if it wants to remain the guarantor of international peace and security and of the world’s socio-economic development. To that end  we must strengthen the foundations of this Organization and — as the theme of this session invites us to do — reaffirm its central role in global governance. Côte d’Ivoire therefore calls for international solidarity so that our common Organization may find the necessary   11 10-55396  solutions to offer to coming generations the hope of a fruitful and peaceful future. "
"35",1407,"CMR",65,2010,"I would like first to extend my hearty congratulations to you  Sir  on your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. With your rich experience in international affairs  we believe you will succeed in your task. I would also like to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Ali Abdussalem Treki  for his commitment and skill in discharging his challenging functions during the previous session  and I convey to him my special thanks.  I also wish to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his aides for their untiring efforts in the service of peace and development throughout the world  particularly in the least developed countries.  As the first decade of the twenty-first century draws to a close  it is certainly worthwhile to review the ground covered since we proclaimed  some 10 years ago in this very Hall  our common resolve to cut poverty in half by 2015  worldwide. We all recall the enthusiasm engendered by that solemn commitment.  Today  we are forced to note that we are still quite far off the track. More than one billion people are still living in extreme poverty. The development gap between the countries of the North and those of the South continues to widen instead of narrowing. International assistance is stagnating and remains below the level of commitment made by developed countries to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to it. The results in the eight priority areas of the Millennium Development Goals are disappointing  even unsatisfactory  while the deadline of 2015 is just around the corner.  So what happened? The economic crisis caused by the recent upheavals in financial markets is certainly to blame. The slowdown in activity worldwide — and  in some cases  recession — monopolized the attention of the countries of the North. They gave priority to reviving their own economies and solving their own social problems. However  even though we can understand that  it does not explain everything.  In fact  the awareness shown at the turn of the century of the disastrous consequences of deepening poverty in the third world seems to have waned significantly. Yet the situation has not only failed to improve  it continues to deteriorate. On several occasions  from this rostrum and elsewhere  I have drawn the attention of the international community to the problem posed by the growth in poverty worldwide. I have pointed out that  for ethical reasons  it behooves us all to express solidarity with the most underprivileged. I have further indicated that this is  of course  in everyone’s interests  for the ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor can only exacerbate tensions and jeopardize international peace and security.  I will be pardoned  I am sure  if I dwell a little on the case of Africa. It is undeniably the continent most affected by extreme poverty  which is generally accompanied by food shortages  epidemics  population movements and insecurity. Is it any wonder  then  that such profound misery sometimes explodes  as was the case two years ago during what were dubbed the food riots? The international community cannot remain indifferent to such a threat  which could undermine our efforts to advance democracy and ensure our development.  Let me make myself clear. It is not a matter of engaging in recriminations for the sake of any ideology  of ascribing motives to this or that country or group of countries  or of sermonizing. I am the first to acknowledge that the United Nations and its agencies have provided assistance and guidance to our continent since independence; that most countries of the North have  through their cooperation  financial assistance and debt cancellation  lent and continue to lend irreplaceable support to Africa; and that emerging countries have taken over. We are  of course  grateful to all of them.    10-54833 24   However  that obviously is not enough. I am not trying to apportion blame for this state of affairs. I merely want to say that the solutions applied were perhaps not the best. I would add that from the African perspective  we have been burdened with too many historical handicaps — slavery  colonization  economic dependence and internal and external conflicts — and  of course  that we have lacked toughness and steadiness of mind.  For reasons of mutual interest mentioned earlier  I think we should review the issue thoroughly  without ulterior ideological motives or political or economic prejudices. No matter what is said  Africa has changed significantly over the past 50 years and seems to me to be ready for a wide-ranging ideological debate on the issue  provided that it is conducted in a true spirit of partnership. Through this approach we can realize the famous Marshall Plan for Africa  which is often mentioned but has yet to see the light of day.  That concern led Cameroon to organize an international conference — Africa 21 — in Yaoundé on the occasion of the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of its achieving sovereignty. At that conference the 50 years of African independence were objectively assessed and the future opportunities for our continent were evaluated. The conference was attended by several Heads of State and Government  former Prime Ministers  high-level representatives of international organizations  experts of world renown  major corporate executives and Nobel Peace Prize winners.  The final declaration of the conference  which my delegation has made available  can serve as a kind of guide for the rehabilitation of Africa  with regard to both its economic recovery and its participation in international life. That is what it is all about — ensuring that our continent does not remain forever aid-dependent and that it plays its rightful role in international affairs.  Allow me  in this Hall  to emphasize the second point. How can we today explain why Africa is the only continent without a permanent member on the Security Council? How can we explain that Africa is unable to make its voice heard when its problems are examined in global economic and financial bodies while the decisions made there will be imposed on it? At a time when emerging countries are rightly calling for a seat on the Security Council commensurate with their economic and political weight  Africa as a whole should not be forgotten.  For a long time our continent has been treated  I dare say  as an object of international relations. Yet  it is directly affected by most of the major problems confronting humanity today  be they migratory flows  global warming  economic and financial regulation  terrorism  et cetera. In short  it is sometimes the victim of phenomena for which it is not responsible. From that standpoint also  there is a need to get out of the rut in which major negotiations appear to be bogged down.  Africans seek more understanding and sympathy in the true sense of the words. The delayed development from which they suffer cannot be reduced to the Millennium Goals. Admittedly  they want to be less poor and to eat their fill  but above all  to be protected from fear and want  to be freer and to imagine a future without anxiety. In short  they want to live in a society that guarantees them those minimum conditions for existence and well-being.  Most African countries have embarked on this path. For its part  over the last decades Cameroon has set up representative institutions  established the rule of law and ensured respect for human rights. On the economic and social front  significant progress has been made in the areas of public finance  education and health. Should this trend continue  our country can expect  in the medium term  to attain the status of an emerging country.  That to me seems to be the mindset of most African countries. Certainly  the international community has a role to play in supporting them in their effort to join the global society. To that end  the international community needs to show more understanding  solidarity and  of course  more fraternity."
"36",1451,"COD",65,2010,"I begin by congratulating Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election to preside over the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly  and I also congratulate his entire Bureau on their election. I also congratulate the President’s predecessor  Mr. Ali Treki  on the devotion and skill with which he carried out his mandate  to great general satisfaction.  Finally  I pay a heartfelt tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his praiseworthy  tireless efforts to uphold and promote the purposes and principles of the Charter. The Democratic Republic of the Congo thanks him for having agreed to be present in Kinshasa during the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of our accession to independence. This is proof of his commitment and that of the United Nations  together with the Congolese people  in the search for peace  stability and development. My country reaffirms its determination to support him in his efforts to bring about a world that is safer for all of us.  This session is being held at a time of particular difficulty for all humanity  which is in crisis  marked by challenges to the basic principles of international relations  worsened by the self-interest of nations. The outcome document adopted yesterday on accelerating implementation of the Millennium Development Goals  while being a message of hope  nevertheless gives a sense of the gap separating the wealthy countries from the poor countries as we seek better living conditions for our peoples.  The food crisis and famine afflict many peoples of the planet. Endemic diseases that had almost disappeared are now resurfacing  and new scourges are appearing. In particular  we see a plethora of natural disasters in the wake of climate change  which is proving to be even more devastating.  The grim picture that I have just painted should motivate us to be more united in mobilizing our efforts in a spirit of constructive solidarity in order to find agreed  comprehensive solutions measuring up to the vast challenges that we must meet.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo makes a pressing appeal to all States to work together at long last for a better world  while tirelessly trying to bring peace wherever areas of tension persist.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo also commends all the efforts made by a number of States under the auspices of the United Nations to restore peace  security  democracy and development to certain regions of the Middle East  the Balkans  the Horn of Africa  Central Africa and other regions of the world.  My country is emerging from a multifaceted crisis worsened by the various wars that ravaged it until recently. Like many other African nations  it also suffers from the harmful consequences of the global economic and financial crisis. As I told my people on 30 June  on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of our independence  poverty and a precarious situation are neither inevitable nor irreversible.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo wants the next 50 years to be much brighter and more promising. It undertakes  to that end  to make its contribution to the forward march of humankind towards a better world.  With respect to the global challenges of preserving the planet  my country  wondrously endowed and blessed by nature  reaffirms its solemn commitment to defend its biodiversity in its policies and its national development plan.  The Government of my country  whose forests provide the world with its second set of “lungs”  believes that the issue of climate change and the environment will require the establishment of a global environment authority  which should involve both public and private institutions  civil society and scientific circles.  With respect to establishing and consolidating peace  my country welcomes the Secretary-General’s acceptance of our request to establish in Libreville in the Republic of Gabon a United Nations office for Central Africa  which clearly will help bring the United Nations closer and ensure better coordination between it and the countries of the region. Issues of peace  security  humanitarian assistance and development will be considered speedily  and implementation of measures adopted will receive the necessary urgency.  It is up to us to consolidate peace everywhere  through international and regional mechanisms and   17 10-54833  instruments for the maintenance of peace and the prevention and settlement of conflict.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo is resolved to eradicate the phenomenon of foreign armed groups in its national territory. This is the framework in which should be understood the military operations that we have carried out systematically since 2009 to force such groups to lay down their arms for good. Due to military pressures and awareness-raising and outreach campaigns  and also because the were displace far from their own borders of origin  the volunteer repatriations have intensified and will continue to do so.  The question of the Lord’s Resistance Army is no longer a matter of defence; rather  it is now a matter of public order. Nevertheless  given the crimes and atrocities that it still commits against our civilian populations  we shall remain mobilized and vigilant. The ultimate aim is to put that group in a situation in which it can no longer do any harm.  Together with our efforts to eradicate the insecurity in the eastern part of our national territory  the Democratic Republic of the Congo is working to strengthen the rule of law  democracy and good governance.  With respect to justice in particular  I should like to dwell a little on the ordeal of Congolese women in the Provinces of North and South Kivu. The lack of security is the primary cause of the tragedy. Armed groups  which benefit from the illegal exploitation of raw materials  are at the very root of the scourge. We have decided upon appropriate measures to address this unacceptable situation.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo is now addressing the causes of the violence against women and the causes of recurrent conflict. At the same time  it is enhancing its judiciary in order to address together peace  justice and security. The fight against impunity continues to be of prime importance in Government actions.  My Government is working within the framework of achieving the Millennium Development Goals to do its utmost to meet the basic needs of our people: health  education  food self-sufficiency  basic infrastructures  electricity and drinking water for all  not to mention fighting malaria  HIV/AIDS and poverty. I appreciate the commitment of our partners who are supporting us in achieving my country’s development priorities.  Because of the complex nature of the various tasks that need to be carried out on our territory of more than several million square kilometres  the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a vast building site  requiring multiple contributions for reconstruction and modernization. Such contributions are welcome  particularly in the framework of a partnership that we want to be respectful and proactive with the private sector.  Today the economic indicators are changing in a positive manner. Several key actions have been successfully taken. The credit for this success  which gives us the means for a new start  lies above all with the Congolese people. It also stems from the valuable contributions and cooperation of our partners.  With regard to political and administrative management  we plan to hold presidential and legislative elections in 2011. My Government is making it a point of honour to consolidate democracy by respecting electoral time frames  ensuring accountability of the highest order and completing the establishment of the institutions provided for by the Constitution within the framework of the decentralization process.  My country supports the process of reforming our universal Organization. The Democratic Republic of the Congo reaffirms that the Member States should work resolutely within that trend. United Nations reform  including Security Council reform  should therefore be undertaken without delay  because that would support the achievement of our dreams  given the new challenges and changes that affect our planet.  Expansion of the Security Council is a democratic requirement. This vision needs to be strengthened by affirming the authority of the General Assembly  in order to enable its President to play a key role in the quest for solutions to the problems of our time.  It is said that nature will give man only those challenges that are within the reach of his creative potential  which has produced tremendous inventions. Despite our diversity  the time has now come to put our human resources at the service of our collective creativity.  We should not leave the controls of the global economy to unbridled capitalism  which recognizes no    10-54833 18  regulation of movements of capital  and is motivated only by the profit motive. It is our duty also to globalize the universal values of justice  solidarity and altruism that contribute to international peace and security.  Together we can give humanity better times  if day after day we work to achieve the ideals of our Organization."
"37",1498,"COG",65,2010,"As we open this session of the General Assembly the world is still facing problems of peace and security  crises  conflicts  inequality among States  poverty  hunger and disease. To those recurrent problems are added new challenges  such as climate change  natural disasters  terrorism  piracy  transnational organized crime  human trafficking  nuclear proliferation and the world economic and financial crisis. All these many issues by their very nature call out to the whole of the international community and demand global  collective  coordinated solutions.  The United Nations because of its global nature offers now more than ever the best framework for finding lasting solutions. To do that  we need a strong  reformed Organization that can respond to the new demands of our time. In this connection  my delegation welcomes the new entity UN Women and the appointment at its head of the former President of Chile  Michelle Bachelet — a brilliant woman  to whom I wish every success.  We will need to work with determination to bring about the reforms necessary to restore to the United Nations its operation as a global Organization and to make it a real instrument of world governance. The process must continue with reform of the Security Council  both in its membership and its working methods. Also we should continue to deal with the matter of how to strengthen the General Assembly and its role.  The High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that ended 22 September culminated in the adoption of an outcome document (resolution 65/1) that exhorts us to keep our promises. We welcome it. Indeed  we must unite to attain these Goals. As I said at that time  just two days ago  Congo’s commitment to reaching the MDGs remains firm.  While ten years after the Goals were announced the overall results in achieving them are mixed  especially in Africa  it is nevertheless undeniable that major advances have been made in Africa during that same period in such other essential areas as peace  security and democracy. Africa as a whole is increasingly emerging from a cycle of armed conflicts that have greatly worked against its forward progress towards development and prosperity. Today  thanks to the efforts of the African Union  the backing of the international community and the involvement of African leaders themselves  many conflicts have been or are being resolved. With that in mind  2010 has been named a year of peace and security in Africa.  Despite difficulties encountered here and there in carrying out electoral processes  in a general way democracy is undeniably making a home in Africa. In Gabon and Burundi  to mention only those two countries  the popular will has expressed itself freely. We nurture the hope that the elections upcoming in the next months  notably in Côte d’Ivoire  Guinea  the Niger  Nigeria  the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  will play out in a climate of calm. That is likewise our hope for the referendum to be held in South Sudan  as called for in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. In this connection we call on the international community to continue supporting that process until it is completed.  On the subject of Central Africa  the United Nations Office about to open will provide an additional tool  besides existing mechanisms  to promote good governance and build peace  cooperation and development. In the same vein of building confidence and peace in our subregion  from 15-19 November Brazzaville will be hosting the thirty-first meeting of the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa. On that occasion the States of the subregion will seal their commitment to fight the traffic in small arms and light weapons  by signing the Kinshasa Convention.  Since the tragic events that brought such suffering to my country in the 1990s and early 2000s  the Congolese Government has invested in the quest for peace and national reconciliation  and works to preserve that precious accomplishment. Moreover  our good neighbour policy — a policy we have always advocated — is one of the pillars of our foreign policy. It is evident today in the way in which we are handling the humanitarian crisis resulting from the arrival in our territory of over 100 000 nationals from Équateur Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The signing this past 10 June of the tripartite accord among the Republic of the Congo  the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees should make possible an imminent resolution of the problem and contribute to stabilizing the situation in our brother country so in need of peace and security  especially on the eve of its elections.    10-54965 56   Here I would like to thank the all the bilateral and multilateral partners  namely France  Italy  the United States of America  the World Food Programme and the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees  for all the assistance they have graciously given us.  We have just dedicated a high-level segment to biodiversity in this year 2010  which has been proclaimed the International Year of Biodiversity. Yet another new challenge of our age  biodiversity is crucial to life on earth and holds especial interest for the Congo  since we are one of the countries that houses the Congo Basin  a major carbon sink. We have no doubt that the results of this segment will resonate into the upcoming meetings in Nagoya  Japan  in October and in Cancún  Mexico  in November and December.  The President of our Republic  Denis Sassou Nguesso  holds the question of biodiversity to be of critical global importance  because tropical forests play a vital role in regulating and stabilizing the global climate and generally in providing environmental services. In this context  the Copenhagen Agreement  which took into account the process of reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation  known as REDD-plus  represented the culmination of major efforts deployed by the three forest basins  the Amazon Basin in South and Central America  the Congo Basin in Central Africa and the Mekong Basin in South-East Asia.   With our partners in dialogue and cooperation of the Forest eleven tropical rainforest countries  the Republic of the Congo reaffirms its will and determination to meet the challenges of conservation and the promotion of biodiversity. Such an effort can bring about lasting results only if it is supported by additional financing that is sustainable and predictable.  The question of human rights is also on the agenda for this session. My Government promotes human rights because they are so closely related to peace and development. With regard to human rights  the Congo has always acted within the process of international legitimacy. That is evident in the philosophy underpinning our Constitution  in what we do on a day-to-day basis and in our extensive participation in the relevant international instruments.   Domestically  besides promulgating a law on the protection of the child in the Republic of the Congo  our Parliament will shortly adopt a bill on promoting and protecting the rights of indigenous peoples  which the Government has just submitted to it. The Republic of the Congo has undertaken a number of initiatives in this field  thus taking an important step towards recognizing  defending and protecting the rights of minorities. Next November  the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people will visit Brazzaville. That will be an opportune moment for dialogue and consultations on matters related to indigenous peoples. It should also help us speed up the implementation of recommendations of the universal periodic review  a Human Rights Council mechanism of which my country was the subject from 6 to 8 May 2009 in Geneva.   My country is a candidate for membership in the Human Rights Council for the period from 2011 to 2014  and we thus reaffirm our commitment to fulfilling our international commitments and to supporting efforts of the international community to strengthening those rights. I therefore take this opportunity to appeal for the Assembly’s support for our candidacy in the elections  which will be held in May 2011.  On 15 August 2010  my country celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of its independence. The day was devoted to the theme of remembering  but also and above all  of responsibilities and action. On that occasion  the Government announced a number of socio-economic measures to benefit our people. Those measures were made possible by the release of additional financial resources following the significant foreign debt relief because of Congo’s accession to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Those measures are part of the Government’s resolve to move towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals.   Such an enabling situation will allow my country to lay the foundations for an emerging economy. Indeed  it is President Denis Sassou Nguesso’s ambition to make Congo a modern and prosperous State that plays its part in the family of free modern nations. But that ambition  however legitimate  can be achieved only in a world that is safer  more just and with more solidarity.   More than ever before  we must return to the ideals that inspired the founding fathers of the League of Nations and the United Nations. We must place the   57 10-54965  moral values and the deep aspirations of our peoples at the heart of our work. This is the world that we all aspire to. This is the world that we should strive to build in this Hall."
"38",1545,"COL",65,2010,"With reverence and an immense sense of responsibility  I come to this historic forum for the first time to reiterate the commitment of my country and more than 45 million Colombians to the fulfilment and success of the founding principles of the United Nations. As this Organization proceeds in its reform process  we support its adoption of the criteria of good governance  efficiency and transparency in order to realize those principles and to achieve a more effective international system of cooperation.  We believe that the United Nations should focus on achieving concrete results that transform realities rather than deepen conditions of dependency or perpetuate assistance programmes that often do more harm than good in developing countries. It is in this belief and with faith in the future of the Organization that I express today before this Assembly my country’s aspiration to become a member of the Security Council for the period 2011-2012. We seek that position on the basis of respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and with the commitment to providing our fullest cooperation to the maintenance of international peace and security.  Colombia — which  along with other Latin American nations  commemorates its two-hundredth year of independence this year — has a long and successful democratic and institutional tradition. Our Republic has suffered the attacks of terrorism and the ravages of international crime  but we have always faced them within the framework of our Constitution and laws  following the most rigorous democratic procedures. We are confident that our long and painful experience can be very useful to all States Members of the Organization in matters in which we have developed a strong technical and operational capacity  such as security  the struggle against terrorism and drug trafficking  the fight against the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons  the progressive eradication of anti-personnel mines  humanitarian assistance  the disarmament  demobilization and reintegration of illegal armed groups  and — of particular importance — how to do so while always protecting human rights.  As advocates of peaceful coexistence  we Colombians are proud to participate in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations  such as the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti  the Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai  and the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone. This participation reflects our commitment to peace anywhere in the world  which we reaffirm today.  That is why we want to be the voice of Latin America and the Caribbean in the Security Council at this very special moment for our region. Latin America and the Caribbean  a region of some 600 million inhabitants  is our area of natural interaction. The region includes countries with multiple political visions and diverse positions on many specific topics. But we are united in the interest of overcoming poverty  improving the living standards of our people  integrating ourselves successfully into the global market  and protecting our environment.  Latin American nations are beginning to assume a global leadership role on economic  environmental  security and development issues. In my inaugural speech on 7 August  I said that  given the significant progress achieved by my country  the time for Colombia had come. Today  in this global forum  I wish to go further and state with absolute conviction that the time has come for Latin America.  We Latin Americans have assumed the management of our economies with responsibility. As a result  we were one of the regions least affected by the global economic crisis. Today  our countries are growing on the basis of economic  social and technological pillars that are stronger than ever and attracting investors from throughout the world. We are a subcontinent where the majority of the population is young  with immense talents and ability to work  with cities and natural wonders that attract tourists and   5 10-54965  investors from all over the world  and with unparalleled environmental wealth.  In these times  when the world demands food  water  biofuels and natural lungs for the Earth such as the tropical forests  Latin America has millions of hectares ready for cultivation without affecting the ecological balance  and all the willingness necessary to become a supplier of all the goods that humanity needs for its own survival.  More than 925 million people living with hunger and malnutrition are a challenge that cannot be postponed. Latin America can and wants to be part of the solution. Ours is the region richest in biodiversity on the planet  with the most megadiverse country in the world  namely Brazil  and the country with the greatest biodiversity per square kilometre  namely our country  Colombia. The Amazon region alone holds 20 per cent of the global supply of fresh water and 50 per cent of the planet’s biodiversity.  Colombia is not a country with high levels of polluting emissions  but we want to assume our responsibility to the planet and its future. We therefore support the international initiative known as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation  which seeks to generate and allocate the resources necessary to reduce tropical forest loss and associated emissions. We Colombians want to be a model country for the world in monitoring its forests  carbon emissions and the state of its biodiversity.  Latin America as a whole must be a key region in saving the planet. We call for a new agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol  which expires in 2012  to ensure the commitment of all — starting with the big industrial Powers  to emissions reduction. With appropriate economic compensation  we have an enormous capacity to reduce deforestation and plant new forests  changing the history not only of the region but of the world as a whole.  When the twenty-first century began  Latin America and the Caribbean were just starting their march towards integration into the global economy. Today  10 years later  in the light of our political and economic stability and agricultural  energy and environmental potential  I want to send a message to the other nations of our region. The world’s eyes are upon us. Now is the time for us to open our own eyes  to overcome any persisting differences among us  and to think big. If we do so  and given everything I have just said  we can declare with one voice  as I do today at the dawn of the second decade of the third millennium: This is Latin America’s decade. It will be a decade in which we can grow and advance  and first and foremost in which we can serve our peoples and the well-being of humankind.  Two days ago  I had the opportunity to present Colombia’s results in its progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. I am not now going to repeat our achievements — which have been many — or our remaining challenges  which are many more. I simply want to underline that  more than any other problem  poverty  with all its related consequences  is the greatest calamity in our world.   I want to call attention in particular to the twofold tragedy faced by a brother Caribbean country  which  along with its endemic poverty  is coping with the effects of a devastating natural disaster. I was in Haiti a couple of months ago and I must say  before this Assembly of the nations of the world and with a saddened heart  that its unbearable reality surpasses the worst nightmare. The pledged international aid is yet to arrive in its entirety  or at least it is not visible. Haitians are still fighting and surviving with dignity and courage  but without the due attention we must give to their situation  which can bear no delay. I call on the Security Council to consider transforming the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti into a true development operation that responds to Haiti’s needs and achieves concrete results.  In these difficult economic times  especially for industrialized nations  with high unemployment and stagnation  global solidarity tends to vanish from among our priorities. That is a mistake. Turning one’s back on international cooperation and trade helps no one  and we are convinced that selfishness harms everyone  and the industrialized world more than any. Where else are consumers going to come from if not from the millions of poor who have until now been left at the margins of progress? Who  other than societies filled with enthusiastic young people  can contribute to the dynamism  that mature nations need? What economic space  other than the developing world  is available to satisfy the needs of humankind in the coming decades? Collective prosperity has advanced the most precisely when millions have been involved in development  and the darkest moments of our planet’s economy have been those of exclusion and barriers.    10-54965 6   I cannot close without referring to two global scourges — terrorism and drug trafficking — that feed off each other  because it is often the money from illicit drugs that finances terrorists acts and groups. Perhaps more than any other country  Colombia has been a victim of these phenomena  but it has also been a model in the fight against them and a champion of the need to act together with the international community  under the principle of shared responsibility.  Our democratic security policy — a policy of security for all with respect for the law — is also a human rights policy because we have been able to dramatically reduce the crimes and behaviours that most threaten the lives and fundamental rights of our people  such as homicide  kidnapping and displacement. We were the first country to comprehensively apply the principles of truth  justice and reparation in the demobilization of illegal armed groups. The Colombian State and society are committed to defending and promoting human rights. We do so out of conviction — deep conviction — and not by imposition.  We have achieved great results in the fight against drug trafficking. There has been a substantial reduction in hectares where coca is grown  and we are committed to pursuing this task until those crops are completely eradicated. We have hit hard the mafias that control this business  including guerrilla groups that have become veritable drug cartels. We will continue to fight them relentlessly and without quarter. We will spare no effort. Just yesterday  from this very city  I announced to the world the news of the death of the highest-ranking military leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia in an operation impeccably conducted by our armed forces. This is the most important and decisive blow against that terrorist group in its history  and we hope it will bring us closer to peace.  We want to achieve peace either by reason or by force  and we will achieve it so that we can dedicate and focus all our energies on achieving development and prosperity for our people. In the fight against drug trafficking  we have lost many of our best soldiers  policemen  leaders  judges and journalists. Still  their blood has not been shed in vain. From a failed State in which violent actors  financed by drug trafficking  had distorted our democracy  today we look at the world from a thriving democracy rising towards democratic prosperity for all. We defeated the big drug cartels  but this business has not come to an end yet. That is why we will keep on fighting it  because for us it is a matter of national security.  We are concerned and distressed that our relative success has led to other countries of the region suffering the growing presence and activities of drug trafficking in their territories. The world needs to open its eyes  because to be in denial with respect to this problem could be fatal. It happened to us at a very high cost.  We Colombians are more than willing to cooperate with States that need it  and we are already doing so with several countries in Central America and the Caribbean  with Mexico and even in Afghanistan. But  it is very important that we be consistent on this issue. I say this as representative of the country with the highest moral authority to speak of this scourge  because no other nation has suffered like ours the disastrous consequences of drug trafficking.  We note with concern the contradictory stance of some countries that  on the one hand  demand a head-on fight against drug trafficking and  on the other  legalize consumption or study the possibility of legalizing the production and trade of certain illicit drugs. How can I or anyone tell a peasant in my country that he or she will be prosecuted and punished for growing crops for drug production  while in other countries such activity is being legalized? These contradictions make it urgent — and on this matter we join the call by President Leonel Fernández Reyna of the Dominican Republic — that we agree to review the global strategy against illicit drugs in order to draft a single global policy that is more effective and within which all countries will contribute equally to this effort.  Thanks to the significant security  economic and social achievements accomplished in recent years through the efforts of many Colombians and the leadership of my predecessor  President Álvaro Uribe  today Colombia finds itself at the dawn of a new morning. I came to office with the commitment to fight poverty and unemployment and to lead my country towards not only economic but also social prosperity that reaches everyone  above all the poorest. I have proposed a Government of national unity in which all Colombians are united to create jobs and greater welfare. I foresee with great optimism our future as a nation.   7 10-54965   Today  I present myself before this global forum with respect  humility  a sense of history and an awareness of our own limitations to say that we can do nothing alone  neither in my country nor in the world. Only united and only with respect  solidarity and tolerance will humankind be able to know a better tomorrow."
"39",1585,"COM",65,2010,"This year I should like to devote most of my statement once again to the important matter of the Comorian island of Mayotte. This has been a dispute between us and France for more than three decades. It is our hope that there will be greater understanding and more active solidarity on this matter on the part of this Assembly.  It is my belief that the future of my country  the Union of the Comoros  depends on peace and stability. But there can be no lasting stability in my country without a final solution to this problem. Accordingly  this year we have once again requested that an item on the Comorian island of Mayotte be included on the agenda of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly.  I also take this opportunity to express the deep gratitude of the Comorian people for the valuable and unwavering support of the African Union  the League of Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic Conference on this issue.   I would like to begin by recalling that  pursuant to recommendations of the United Nations  the highest French authorities have themselves affirmed that the Comoros should accede to independence within inviolable borders. Thus  former French President Mr. Valéry Giscard d’Estaing declared  inter alia  that the Comoros are and always have been an entity and that it is natural that they have a common destiny.   I also deem it vital and timely to recall today certain resolutions of our Organization confirming the legitimacy of the Comorian claim to the island of Mayotte. These include resolution 1514 (XV)  of 14 December 1960  on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples  which guarantees the national unity and territorial integrity of such countries on regaining their sovereignty. Resolution 3291 (XXIX)  of 13 December 1974  reaffirms the integrity and unity of the Comoro Archipelago. In addition  resolution 3385 (XXX)  of 12 November 1975  adopted a few months after the independence of the Comoros  affirms the admission of the Comoro Archipelago  composed of the islands of Mayotte  Anjouan  Mohéli and Grande-Comore  to the United Nations.  Lastly  the historic resolution 31/4  of 21 October 1976  underscores the right of the Comoros and the duties of France with regard to that independent country. Allow me to read out the provisions of that resolution that is of paramount importance to my country and which will remain forever etched in the memory of my Comorian compatriots.   19 10-54965    “Considering that the occupation by France of the Comorian island of Mayotte constitutes a flagrant encroachment on the national unity of the Comorian State  a Member of the United Nations    “Considering that such an attitude on the part of France constitutes a violation of the principles of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  in particular of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 concerning the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples  which guarantees the national unity and territorial integrity of such countries    “1. Condemns and considers null and void the referendums of 8 February and 11 April 1976 organized in the Comorian island of Mayotte by the Government of France  and rejects:   “(a) Any other form of referendum or consultation which may hereafter be organized on Comorian territory in Mayotte by France;   “(b) Any foreign legislation purporting to legalize any French colonial presence on Comorian territory in Mayotte;   “2. Strongly condemns the presence of France in Mayotte  which constitutes a violation of the national unity  territorial integrity and sovereignty of the independent Republic of the Comoros;” (resolution 31/4  third and fourth preambular paragraphs and paras. 1 and 2).  France refuses to comply with all those relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly relating to the Comorian island of Mayotte and continues to violate the principle of the inviolability of colonial borders. It must be recalled that the principle of the inviolability of borders became a rule of customary international law  codified under paragraph 6 of resolution 1514 (XV)  which stipulates that:    “Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.”  That same resolution recalls in its paragraph 7 that:    “All States shall observe faithfully and strictly the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the present Declaration on the basis of equality  non-interference in the internal affairs of all States  and respect for the sovereign rights of all peoples and their territorial integrity.”   International jurisprudence fully recognizes that principle of the indivisibility of colonial entities. In the judgment handed down on 11 September 1992 in a dispute between Honduras and El Salvador  the International Court of Justice in The Hague declared that the principle of the inviolability of colonial borders is a retroactive principle that changes administrative boundaries originally designed for other purposes into international borders.  For many years  my country has called the international community to witness and has made known its readiness to seek a fair and just solution bilaterally. The response to our position was crushing. France not only took unilateral steps in 1994 to hinder the free circulation of persons by introducing a visa for all Comorians wishing to visit Mayotte  part of Comorian territory  but also  in 2000  it began the process of making the island a department  which is illegal under international law.  I wish to stress that the imposition of a visa requirement in 1994 had truly tragic human consequences. The small slice of the sea of approximately 70 kilometres separating Anjouan from the sister island of Mayotte has now become the largest maritime cemetery in the world. To date  nearly 7 000 people have been killed.  Moreover  while we had agreed to establish a high-level working group to relaunch the dialogue in order to consider together equitable and just solutions  on 29 May 2009 France organized another referendum aimed at changing the status of the island of Mayotte into an overseas department.  We are surprised that  despite all the good will demonstrated by the Comorian side — and in particular the innovative proposal on Mayotte known as “one country  two systems” or two administrations  which I myself introduced at an earlier session of this Assembly — there has been no positive response from France to that outstretched hand. The dual system would be a compromise that would finally ensure respect for international law  while enabling France to continue to legally administer the Comorian island of Mayotte during a period to be mutually agreed. It would also enable our Mahorais brothers and sisters     10-54965 20  whom I love dearly  to preserve their social status and standard of living  and the three other islands to finally take up the many challenges of development in peace and stability.  But France wants to know nothing about this compromise. Faced with such an attitude  we find ourselves obliged to request our dear Organization to require France to respect and comply with international law  implement the various relevant United Nations resolutions on the Comorian island of Mayotte  and to reconsider its position on our offer  which clearly represents a huge sacrifice on the part of my country  which in fact is within its rights.  What is at stake is the future of the Comoros  a small sovereign country Member of the United Nations. Also at stake is the honour of France  a great country whose ideals of liberty  equality and fraternity so strongly and profoundly inspired the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the principles underpinning our Charter. Ultimately  what is at stake is the honour of our Organization  whose very credibility would be sorely challenged should international law and legality continue to be disregarded and the territorial integrity of the Comoros continue to be violated.   The United Nations is the guarantor of respect for international law. It is duty-bound to require that its Members’ legislation complies fully with the relevant resolutions. I can only endorse the statement of the President of the General Assembly  His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss  who said at the opening of this session that the United Nations is the guarantor of global governance and enjoys a global legitimacy.  I cannot end my statement without reiterating that the Comoros supports the efforts of the international community  and more specifically the personal efforts of His Excellency President Barack Hussein Obama  to establish a just and lasting peace in the Middle East enabling the Palestinian people to live freely and safely in an independent State and to enjoy fully all their legitimate rights.  My country also pays tribute to efforts to bring an end to the fratricidal conflicts that are ripping apart the Sudan  Afghanistan  Somalia  the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great Lakes region.   We also reiterate our strong support for the territorial integrity of the brotherly Kingdom of Morocco and our full backing for the Moroccan autonomy proposal as a definitive political compromise solution to the regional dispute over the Moroccan Sahara.  We also reiterate our unwavering support for the legitimate demands of the People’s Republic of China for the return of Taiwan to China’s fold.  It is through peace  stability and security and respect for international law that our nations will be able to attain the development goals they have set themselves to help our peoples. I therefore have full trust that our Organization shall continue to make these ideals its main focus. We must  as soon as possible  implement the agreements and resolutions that we have agreed in order to find peaceful and definitive solutions to all outstanding issues  because any delay in or suspension of our search for such solutions would create additional  similar issues and crises in other countries and spark the flames of extremism and terrorism throughout the world. We hope that we shall find solutions that will lead to the happiness and well-being of all our peoples."
"40",1624,"CPV",65,2010,"I would like first of all to pay tribute to you  Sir  for your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session  and wish you every success as you carry out your duties in that role. Cape Verde offers you its full support.   I also appreciate the commitment of and the very fruitful work carried out by his predecessor  Ambassador Ali Abdussalam Treki  who was able to lead the Assembly during its sixty-fourth session with remarkable dynamism.   We confirm our support for the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  as he seeks to make the United Nations system ever more effective in working for the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of the world to peace  dignity and progress.   Our theme this year is reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance. The points which I shall develop relate to that theme  which is a cross-cutting issue par excellence.   First of all  we have to save the planet. To do that would seem self-evident — here everybody would seem to agree — yet if one considers the negotiations underway with reference to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  there is a tendency towards pessimism rather than optimism. Scientists have for some time now shown that our planet seriously risks not being able to provide for life in all in its plenitude because of the consequences of global warming. We know today that time to act effectively is running out.   The participants at the Copenhagen Summit left knowing that there was no time left for quibbling. We said that last year here ourselves. Now is the time for us to take concerted  coherent and systematic action  so that we can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions  slow down global warming and avoid a rise in the sea level which could jeopardize vast coastal regions of the world  and in particular the small island developing States  which are particularly vulnerable and suffer first-hand the consequences of increasingly frequent and extreme inclement weather.  Cape Verde is a State of the Sahel. For a long time  therefore  we have faced drought  desertification and dramatic water scarcity. Those phenomena strongly influence what we do to preserve the environment and achieve human development.   We are seeking to adapt to and reduce the impact of climate change  whether it be in the specific terms of land reclamation and water conveyance or in the development of renewable energy  all of which are part of our national growth dynamics  alongside education  health  employment  infrastructure and so on.   We are in process of implementing an ambitious programme to use surface water by building dams and reservoirs to support the modernization of agriculture  the development of livestock farming and food processing — all of which will help farmers everywhere. Following the food crisis of two years ago    similar efforts were made in Africa and small island developing States to help farmers make a profit  help the economy make progress and help countries face the challenges of climate change. Financing  without which there would be many failures  projects would be abandoned and obstacles would remain insurmountable  was a key factor. So we need quickly to set up the financing announced within the fast-track framework. Time is running out.  We believe that the international community  particularly the developed countries and large emerging countries  must address the increased threat to global security and the repercussions for everybody of the devastating consequences of natural disasters and must continue to support the specific dynamics affecting the most vulnerable States with respect to climate change in the areas of mitigation and adaptation and help them minimize the risks threatening them in the present situation  knowing that some of them are already facing the problems of population shifts and forced migration.   Solidarity is not a meaningless word for people who live on islands. For some individuals  it is a question of survival; for nations  it is a question of their continued existence as peoples. Let us not offer   43 10-55276  up the weakest as sacrificial lambs  for tomorrow all of us may be in a similar situation. Let us also not forget that conflicts resulting from water scarcity on the planet are foreseeable  which should be a major concern that we must start tackling as of today.   We wish to reaffirm here that the ocean  which is for our island country our vital environment  our civilization and our inspiration  as well as our potential for the future  must be protected and preserved. Just a few days ago  with six coastal countries in West Africa and Norway  we signed an agreement that will help us collectively to better manage this huge common potential and to keep watch over the protection of our ocean interests. With the coastal States along the Atlantic Ocean  particularly those in the southern Atlantic  we confirm our resolve to make it an area for trade and active solidarity  not unfair competition. Instead of making the ocean just one more element to be gobbled up by human greed  let us try to preserve its unique value as a precious container of life and guardian of the hopes of the planet.   We must protect and empower women. We firmly believe that one of the major revolutions to be made in our time is the one enabling women to truly become full and equal partners with men in their shared quest for progress. In Cape Verde  we have made substantial gains in gender equality and equity  but there are still major challenges. For example  in our current Government consisting of 14 Ministers  eight of them are women. The report on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for 2010 shows that Cape Verde has achieved gender parity in primary and secondary education. Indeed  in some cases  there are more girls than boys in school.  Major investment in maternal and infant health means that 98 per cent of births are in a hospital environment with specialized assistants. Yet  25 per cent of women suffer from domestic abuse. In Parliament and in local authorities  there are few women participating. Poverty and unemployment affect more women than men. We continue to work on this issue  and we think we are going in the right direction.  UN Women  recently launched by Economic and Social Council  is a universal entity charged principally with overcoming the obstacles that prevented the four formerly separate bodies working in the gender area from responding more effectively to challenges in the area of gender equality and the empowerment of women.   UN Women is part of the effort to reform the United Nations begun nearly two decades ago with a view towards strengthening system-wide coherence. We would like to congratulate Ms. Michelle Bachelet and assure her of Cape Verde’s support in her new duties to defend  promote and empower women. We believe that the robustness of her mandate and her potential role of catalyst for the new entity should encourage donors to respond positively to meet its funding needs.   We must continue to work for peace. The evolving international situation with groups of States coming together to discuss major regional and global issues and to propose solutions is evidence of a trend that  despite everything  is struggling to show its efficiency and cannot seem to reduce the worry of some and the doubts of others.   We continue to believe that the United Nations  where each one of us has his or her place  can play a truly effective part by ensuring going forward so that its dynamism is maintained  its mission is clearly defined  and we all share in the responsibilities and the decision-making. It is our universal institution that brings together the essential conditions for handling the problems of the world and that has been endowed with the necessary collective responsibility. Accordingly  the huge mission of promoting and ensuring better and more effective global governance is a job that must be carried out by the United Nations.  World peace remains a distant goal  and the hotbeds of tension  far from abating  persist  ever closer. Conflicts weaken entire regions  creating refugees and displaced persons by the millions  paralysing economies  destroying infrastructure and obliterating decades of work aimed at promoting education  health and justice for the people. Sometimes the very concept of the human being seems to be vanishing  giving way to an era of modern slaves who can be moulded and exploited at will. Women suffer sexual violence  which has become a weapon of war  and child soldiers are often deployed unscrupulously as combatants by both sides.   The United Nations  in this arena as in others  is still the central element  functioning as the collective conscience of the community of nations  dedicated to managing our communal actions and finding solutions    10-55276 44  of consensus and cooperation. In this light  the revitalization of the United Nations seems a requirement of our time  inviting the participation of all.  Cape Verde has always favoured universal and total disarmament. It wishes to help create a world where fear of the other is replaced by the need to cooperate with the other and a recognition of the other as a necessary  complementary partner. We continue to believe  for instance  in the future of talks between Israel and the Palestinians  and we continue to hope that we will see a Middle East with two independent States living side by side in peace and security. But restoring credibility to the Middle East peace process requires  more than anything else  that the parties honour their own obligations  which derive from their commitments and from decisions and resolutions agreed to here in the United Nations. From this point of view  putting an end to hostilities in Gaza and on Israeli soil  halting settlement in the occupied territories  dismantling the wall and ending the blockade seem to us incontrovertible imperatives. We ardently hope that the new talks will bring us closer to peace.  Organized crime is a scourge that my country is fighting directly  with the support of many of our partners. Drug traffickers now swarm into our West African subregion  threatening the stability of our countries and destroying our efforts towards regional stability and peace for our peoples. A determined battle  uniting producing nations  nations of transit and consumer nations  must be vigorously and tirelessly waged. We must not allow drugs to turn our children into pariahs  the unfortunate victims of dirty money. Human rights are at stake in that struggle for our children to live and flourish free of the influence of drugs  so that tomorrow they may become citizens of the world.   At the beginning of the twenty-first century things are evolving in all spheres — and especially in international politics — because of circumstances and events  but also because of the political will of the most enlightened. Is it not time to put an end to situations that are now obsolete vestiges of the cold war and the Second World War  such as in the case of Cuba? The isolation and blockade are sources of tension and frustration and can hardly serve as the basis for new hope. Generations are changing  attitudes are evolving and the aspirations of the young are different now. New generations have the right to a future of peace  understanding and healthy exchange. Let us show the wisdom to offer them a world worthy of their dreams and aspirations.   We must innovate for the future. When we became one of the eight pilot countries for the Delivering as One experiment in 2006  we wanted  of course  to benefit from positive impact of such a leap forward in this way in our relations with the various United Nations agencies. We also wanted to participate in reforming the United Nations system  so that it could better meet the demands of the world today. Moreover  our Government believes that reform means simplifying the well-known United Nations bureaucracy. Today we are witnessing real progress and clear mutual benefits. The funds allotted to our country are increasing  the effectiveness of the various agencies is improving  there is a real sense of ownership  and there is also leadership by the Government and dynamic synergy among all the parties involved — pointing us ever forward on this path. The recent meeting of the eight pilot countries in Hanoi was a success  and we eagerly await new additions to the family.  Since independence 35 years ago  Cape Verde has made great strides in human development and has become a middle-income country. Between 1990 and 2007 our human development index rose from 0.589 to 0.708. Per capita income  barely $300 per year at the time of our independence  is now $3 041 per year. School enrolment stands at 96 per cent. Illiteracy has been reduced to 18.5 per cent  declining as much for women as for men. We project 6 per cent growth for the year 2010.  We have achieved much in education  health and political participation thanks to our Government’s policy aimed at eradicating poverty and achieving food security and gender equality and equity. In the last decade poverty has dropped from 49 per cent in 1989 to 36.7 per cent in 2002 to 26 per cent in 2007. Estimates predict a poverty rate in 2010 of 24 per cent.  That progress is the result of investing in people. Education and vocational training are the strategic axes of our governance and take up over half of our State budget. We have also invested in health and social security. Moreover  the Government is following a strategy of making the country an international service provider  so that it can compete in the world economy   45 10-55276  and accelerate growth and job creation  thereby increasing family income and significantly decreasing poverty.  While we know that we must act quickly and decisively to save the planet  we seem to drag our feet when it comes to matching concrete actions to our words. While we proclaim the virtues of equality between men and women and gender parity — and their positive effects on development and therefore on peace and security — we still note that substantial political will at the national level and a determined drive at the international level are still needed to push forward the fight to make women full partners in the future of the world. If peace is everywhere considered a fundamental  legitimate aspiration of peoples and nations  and indeed a universal necessity  it is no less true that it must be won every day  and that millions of human beings wake to the sound of guns and wonder every night if they will see the next morning or if their family will still be alive. Peace can no longer be a utopian dream or a fragile  always tentative reality  as in the Middle East  Central Africa or other places in the world.  In an increasingly interdependent and threatened world  we need to give our collective energies a chance and not seclude ourselves in a defeatist attitude of isolation  bereft of any future. We must be innovative in our ways of thinking  in our political ideas and in our vision of the State. We must be innovative and carry our innovation into our inter-State relations and our defence of our own interests  so as to promote equity and democracy in international relations  promote a greater awareness of fair exchange and justice in the relations of States and thereby foster security for all  in a multilateralism driven by the contributions of all members of the international community  thus preserving the hope for peace all around the world.   All the great revealed religions talk of hope and compassion. Will those universal values be condemned to remain the poor relations of international politics? Let us make of their inspired message the bedrock of our international relations. Let us make the individual human the centre of our national concerns and our global interests. That is the basis  it seems to me  of the responsibility to protect that we proclaim here in this Hall. Let us make that message a harbinger of the future for our nations and our peoples  for now more than ever our destinies are shared and tied to our Mother Earth. Humankind is humankind’s best medicine  an old African proverb tells us. We can be if we want to be."
"41",1670,"CRI",65,2010,"From this universal podium I convey a warm greeting to the Assembly and the whole of humanity. I especially commend my fellow Costa Rican citizens for their free and sovereign decision  which has given me the great honour to represent them before you all.  I begin my remarks with renewed support for the United Nations  for its contributions to human rights  peace  security  comprehensive sustainable development  tolerance  solidarity and respect for diversity and for international law. It is without doubt an organization of States  but more  it is an organization of peoples  who from their differences embrace and take shelter in the humanistic and universal values that support the United Nations.   At this moment  around the world those values and their implied commitments are flourishing  but they are also suffering.  We can congratulate ourselves on the children who are receiving a good education and on the parents who see them grow up without fear that they will be consumed by war. We are inspired by young people  workers and peasants with opportunities for a worthy life  and by the women who benefit from full equality. In that context  we welcome the appointment of Ms. Michelle Bachelet as Under-Secretary-General for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.   However  at the same time we also are concerned about those women who as heads of households can barely feed their children. We are worried about the adults who grow old in poverty and loneliness and about children whose lives lack affection and stimulation. The catastrophic effects of climate change demand our immediate and determined attention. And it offends us that even today  there are women awaiting execution by stoning  populations stifled by brutal genocide  and nuclear weapons that are being stockpiled while granaries are being depleted.  When we refer to the United Nations and global governance  we must remember that such governance starts with good national government. But at the same time  the success of our domestic administrations depends upon an international system that is fair  efficient  open and responsible and that is capable of dealing with the great challenges of our time.  As President  I am subject to the constant scrutiny of my people  from whom I came and to whom I am accountable. I am aware that the best sermon comes from example. Thus my Government strives to represent the values  promote the development and increase the integral welfare of all Costa Ricans. We are promoting economic growth  the opening of trade  solidarity  environmental responsibility and political transparency in the framework of civil liberties. That course of action is rooted in our history. It is why we introduced free compulsory primary education in 1870  abolished the death penalty in 1877  disbanded the army in 1949  preserved 25 per cent of our land in the 1960s and created universal access to health in the mid-1970s.  My Government stands on that legacy in order to act in the present and to construct the future. We strive for attention to and early stimulation of our children and for care of adults and the elderly. We fight inequality  strive to improve education and health  and foster economic development increasingly based on clean energy  a sustainable economy and creative intelligence. I mention all these things as humble national experience  not as a pretentious global lesson.  History  geography and circumstances frequently shape us — but only up to a point  because individual and collective will  responsibility  and constructive leadership can break down the obstacles and trace better paths. Thus we must pull back the curtains of prejudice that dim reality  exchange the echoes of the past for the sounds of the future  and bury recrimination of others as an excuse to avoid our duties.   Beyond the national sphere  good governance means that there are responsibilities incumbent on all world leaders with regard to the peoples of the United Nations. The starting point must be respect for international law and multilateral organizations. For an unarmed and peaceful country such as Costa Rica  those are the main instruments for our security  the indispensable requirement for living in peace and fostering development.  Last Tuesday we celebrated  with profound personal and national conviction  the International Day of Peace  in whose creation our country played a key role. It is significant that  through the initiative of    10-54827 20  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  its theme was “Youth for Peace and Development”. That triad — youth as incentive  peace as a framework  and development as a goal — is critical to building a better world. But that triad would be truncated without freedom as opportunity  human dignity as an inescapable commitment and tolerance as a habit of coexistence.   For the countries and leaders committed to those fundamental values  the main question is how to advance them in today’s world. I propose to empower even further the concepts  organisms and instruments for the promotion and protection of human rights. It is in our interest to participate constructively as members in the activities of the Human Rights Council. Here also lies our adherence to the main covenants and protocols on the subject  our insistence on the responsibility to protect civilians and our commitment to human security.  Costa Rica  besides hosting the conference that approved the American Convention on Human Rights in 1969  was the first country to ratify it. Today it is home to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. I am convinced that respect for human rights depends to a great extent upon international justice. Its most recent and innovative manifestation  thanks to the Treaty of Rome  is the International Criminal Court  for which we reaffirm our support after a decade of contributions. To use the weapons of the law actively is another unavoidable responsibility of global governance.  In the area of peace and security  Costa Rica adheres to the five points on arms control advocated by the Secretary-General. In particular  we insist on the necessity for starting negotiations for an arms transfer treaty  while at the same time progressing with the model convention for the prohibition of nuclear weapons and completing ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The accumulation and transfer of weapons  especially nuclear  chemical and bacteriological weapons  is not only a threat to humanity’s peace and survival; it is also an assault on development. Every soldier who enlists  every missile that is activated  every isotope enriched for military purposes means fewer schools and hospitals  fewer food programmes  fewer roads  fewer wireless networks  fewer seeds for farmers and fewer good judges to administer justice.  But peace must go beyond action; it should become embedded in the minds and imaginations of human beings. To educate for peace is to vaccinate against war. Thirty years ago  our country launched  and the United Nations supported  a pioneer and visionary institution for this area: the University for Peace. Today its contribution reaches every continent of the world  and our commitment to it increases day by day. For this reason we proudly celebrate its anniversary.  It is a paradox that while many countries waste resources on weapons  the international community has been incapable of dealing effectively with the scourges of drug trafficking  organized crime  terrorism  arms trafficking  and the perverted exploitation and trafficking of human beings. My country and Central America suffer increasingly from the aggressions of the drug cartels. We risk being virtually taken over by their gangs  with consequences that will go beyond our borders and become a clear threat to international security.  My Government has made its citizens’ security one of its chief goals. Our people demand it  and we will never fail them. We are fighting crime with energy and determination  as well as with full respect for human rights  intelligent policies and the supremacy of law.   But the great battle against transnational crime demands much more from us all. Today drug-related activity is endangering the improvements in development achieved in Central American countries. From being merely a transit zone  due to our geographic location between the great drug producers to the south and the great consumers to the north  our countries have  to different degrees  been becoming producers  traffickers and consumers of drugs.   Today we are free of none of the manifestations of the drug trade  which has extended its tentacles into many areas of our social life. Young people in their schools and neighbourhoods see their future menaced by the easy offer of drugs  our health-care systems are almost overwhelmed by the problem of addiction  the integrity of our institutions is menaced by corruption and coercion  and violence is reaching levels never seen before.  The battle against the drug trade can be won only with coordination  global cooperation and a major revision of the strategies pursued so far  many of them incomplete or failed. From this rostrum I call on the countries with the highest rates of drug consumption to   21 10-54827  take more effective action against this enormous problem  and to cooperate with the countries suffering from a problem we did not create. I also call urgently for global solidarity in this task  and for multilateral organizations to increase their activity by developing an agenda with more comprehensive strategies  with a better balance of resources and responsibilities  and with more focused goals. If new and good efforts are not vigorously initiated  we will soon regret our inaction.  If Costa Rica  a middle-income country  has achieved human development rates comparable to those of high-income countries  it is because  among other things  our social investment has replaced military spending. That is why we insist that international aid should not ignore the ethical dimension of development. We support preferential allocation of such aid to countries in the most precarious situations. But countries like mine that  thanks to good investments and astute political decisions  have improved our conditions of life  should benefit from innovative technical cooperation schemes  productive financing and public-private alliances. Above all  we must successfully complete the Doha Round of international trade negotiations  an essential engine for economic growth.  We must also establish peace with the environment and development. Organizing the economy in a sustainable manner in order to produce material and social well-being is a task we cannot avoid. Today we have high hopes for the next Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Cancun. We hope that all countries  but in particular the big polluters and generators of carbon emissions  will shoulder their responsibility towards humanity. In Costa Rica  we have shouldered ours by setting the goal of becoming one of the first carbon-neutral countries in the world. We are also advancing in the application and development of clean energies and the protection of our watersheds and biodiversity.   Let us not forget  however  that sustainability  above all  must be human; hence the importance of the Millennium Development Goals. Attaining them in five years’ time is an unavoidable goal for this Organization.  The challenges of global governance are many  and they are overwhelming  but the possibilities to confront them exist. Their promotion is part of our responsibility as leaders. This also requires that the United Nations improve its own governance. If it does not respond to new realities and if its Member States do not help with the task  the Organization runs the risk of sinking into irrelevance. The adaptation of the United Nations to the challenges of global governance demands greater effectiveness  efficiency and transparency in its administration  its decision-making processes and its field operations.   In this universal Organization  we must also preach through example. That is why Costa Rica has strived to collaborate in an active and constructive way in the reform process. And  like many other countries  we still need the help of the world. The world needs the help of all countries. That is the only way to advance the causes of our peoples. Costa Rica modestly offers its contribution  its effort and its voice. "
"42",1739,"CUB",65,2010,"Yesterday was exactly the fiftieth anniversary of the first speech of Commander in Chief Fidel Castro Ruz in this Hall  with that memorable sentence that if the philosophy of plunder disappears  then the philosophy of war will have disappeared (see A/PV.872).    10-55122 46   Sixty million people had to die in the Second World War so that the leaders of the time could create the United Nations with the aim of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war.  Today  the children and grandchildren of that generation realize that the human race is faced with the threat of extinction. Within a few decades  the degradation of living conditions on the planet will be irreversible. The same could happen in a few hours if only a small part of the nuclear arsenal were to be used. Those who met in San Francisco to draft the Charter of the United Nations could not have imagined the threat now posed by global warming or the nuclear winter.  While we deliberate here  as Comrade Fidel has warned  powerful and influential forces in the United States and Israel are paving the way to launch a military attack against the Islamic Republic of Iran. For its part  the Security Council  possibly under the illusion of preventing that  is going ahead with applying sanctions against that country  which  together with the unilateral sanctions illegally imposed by a group of States  seek to strangle the Iranian economy.  The recent and politically biased report issued by the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency has contributed to increasing the tensions and has provided a pretext for military escalation. Should that aggression in fact materialize  it would be a crime against the Iranian people and an assault against peace and international law that could ignite a conflict that will certainly turn nuclear. The toll would be millions of lives and the impact on the environment  the economy and world stability incalculable.  Who could assert otherwise  and on the basis of what guarantees? How could it be argued that the present course of events is distancing the planet from war in the Middle East? The threat is too serious to trust in the capacity of the Security Council  where the main actor responsible for the crisis has relied on its ability to impose its designs.  The wars against Iraq and Afghanistan demonstrate that we cannot entrust one or a few Governments with the authority to decide when all diplomatic steps to prevent a war have been exhausted  when the use of force becomes unavoidable  and when the death of hundreds of thousands or millions of people and the destabilization of a large area of the planet — or all these things together — are inevitable. Sanctions  sieges and conflict are not the way to preserve international peace and security. On the contrary  dialogue  negotiation and adherence to the principle of the sovereign equality of States are the only way to avoid war.  Cuba commends and encourages the efforts of all those countries  such as China  Russia  Brazil and Turkey  that strive to find peaceful solutions  and calls on the international community to support such initiatives. It is the duty of this General Assembly to officially support those efforts.  The United Nations must be radically reformed and the powers of this General Assembly restored. The Security Council must be recreated. It must be reiterated that the Secretary-General and all senior officials of the international agencies  including the International Atomic Energy Agency  answer to all Member States  as set out in clear mandates adopted in accordance with the Charter and the rules of procedure.  The serious threat posed by nuclear weapons will be solved only with their total elimination and prohibition. The manipulation surrounding non-proliferation — based on double standards and political interest  the existence of a club of the privileged and the denial to the countries of the South of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy — must stop. We urge the United States  the main nuclear Power  to stop opposing the negotiation of binding agreements that could rid us once and for all of this threat within a set time frame. Given the great lethal power and the ongoing development of conventional weapons  we will also have to fight for complete and general disarmament.  In order to move ahead on those tasks  the Non-Aligned Movement submitted a proposal that has gone unheeded. The proposal envisages a plan of action that includes the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones. It is urgent to establish such a zone in the Middle East  where Israel is the only country that opposes it. Success in this effort would contribute significantly to dispelling the threats of conflict and nuclear proliferation and to achieving lasting peace in that region.  The floods that have affected Pakistan  Central America and many other countries in the most diverse latitudes  as well as the droughts and extreme temperatures that have devastated Russia  are a tragic reminder of the threats of a climate out of balance. In   47 10-55122  the face of such a serious threat  no selfish interests or narrow political agendas that prevent the adoption of concrete and binding agreements at the next Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change should prevail. The developed countries  which bear the greatest responsibility for global warming  should accept more ambitious goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and refrain from destroying the framework established by the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol.  It would be very irresponsible of the Governments of the industrialized countries to ignore the legitimate claims of the non-governmental organizations and social movements that were brutally suppressed in Copenhagen and later met in Cochabamba barely five months ago to defend Mother Earth  or to again seek to deceive public opinion by blaming the emerging economies.  We call for the full support of the international community for Venezuela in its struggle. The victory in yesterday’s parliamentary elections demonstrates the broad majority support of the people for President Chávez and the Bolivarian revolution  which have suffered North American interference and the scorn and disinformation campaigns of the oligarchic groups and media empires.  Now that the television cameras have left Haiti  we call for the pledges of international assistance to be honoured. The noble Haitian people need resources for reconstruction and  above all  for development.  The United States Government is aware of Cuba’s readiness to coexist in a climate of peace  respect and sovereign equality  which we have expressly conveyed through official channels and which I reiterate here on behalf of President Raúl Castro. I am convinced that the development of relations based on international law and the purposes and principles of the United Nations would enable Cuba and the United States to address many of their differences and to resolve others. It would help to create an atmosphere conducive to trying to solve the problems of our region and  at the same time  provide significant support to the interests of our respective peoples.  The agenda for dialogue and bilateral cooperation initiatives submitted to President Obama’s Administration on 14 July 2009  which I publicly announced in this Hall exactly a year ago (see A/64/PV.11)  have yet to receive a response. The North American Government has shown no willingness to address essential matters on the bilateral agenda  so the official talks that have been held without great progress have been limited to specific issues.  Contrary to expectations  even within the United States itself  its Government does not seem willing to amend even the most irrational and universally rejected aspects of its policy against Cuba. The main element in our bilateral relations is the economic  commercial and financial blockade that the United States Government imposes against my country directly and through the extraterritorial application of its laws. The blockade has been the subject of 18 resolutions that  with the almost unanimous support of Member States  have consistently called for its end.  However  in the past two years  there has been no change in the policy of blockade and subversion against Cuba  even though all know that the President of that country is vested with sufficient authority to make real change and enjoys the broad majority support of the North American people in that respect.  For United States citizens or foreigners residing in that country  travelling to Cuba remains illegal. It is impossible to sell Cuban products or products containing Cuban components or technology to the United States. With very limited exceptions  Cuba is forbidden to acquire  here or in any other country  any product containing a fraction of American input or technology. Financial transactions in United States dollars  whether linked to Cuba or not  can be either confiscated or frozen and the banks involved may be fined. Fines worth several millions are imposed on United States and foreign companies for violating the venal blockade laws.  In addition  and in open contradiction of international norms  Cuba’s broadcasting space continues to be violated and radio and television broadcasts continue to be used for subversive purposes  while millions in federal funds are used to foment political instability in my country. Part of Cuba’s territory has been seized by the United States  which has imposed a military base in Guantánamo that has become a centre of torture beyond the jurisdiction of international humanitarian law.  United States immigration policy towards Cuba  based on the Cuban Adjustment Act  is a politically motivated exception that encourages illegal migration and costs human lives. Cuba’s inclusion on the United    10-55122 48  States’ spurious list of countries that sponsor international terrorism is deeply immoral.  Our demand  and the universal appeal concerning it  is well known. The five Cuban anti-terrorists who have been incarcerated in the United States for 12 years as political prisoners must be immediately released. Setting them free would be an act of justice that would enable President Obama to show his true commitment to combating terrorism in our own hemisphere.  The President of the United States still has the opportunity to make a historical rectification of an utterly futile 50-year genocidal policy left over from the cold war. It would be an act of resolve that could only encourage the support of those who elected him for change and of the community of nations that votes for it every year. Whatever the circumstances  the Cuban revolution will unyieldingly and tenaciously pursue the sovereign path chosen by our people and shall not cease in its endeavours  based on the precepts of Martí and Fidel  to overcome all injustice."
"43",1785,"CYP",65,2010,"I congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session.  It is commonly acknowledged that the international community faces challenges that are multiplying in scope and magnitude. This raises a question about whether our ability to respond to these challenges grows in tandem. We have recently witnessed climatic and natural disasters on a scale never experienced in recent history  such as the floods in Pakistan  the fires in Russia  the earthquake in Haiti and the landslides in China.  Environmental degradation and climate change; rising poverty  food insecurity and the lack of basic health care for so many of our fellow human beings in a world with deep social disparities; terrorism; the visible threat of nuclear proliferation  especially in the Middle East; and the continuing economic crisis of the past few years  which has primarily affected millions of working people and the poor  require effective regional and global action through the United Nations and other multilateral organizations.   21 10-54959   Turning our attention to my own neighbourhood  the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East  I would like to welcome the relaunching of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority and to express hope for a successful outcome. We all know that it is a difficult task  but there is no alternative to dialogue. We express the hope that no unilateral measure will be taken that would create more obstacles to the negotiations to reach an agreement. The solution should lead to the creation of an independent and sovereign Palestinian State living side by side with the State of Israel.  Cyprus  together with Greece  has proposed the creation of a humanitarian sea corridor to the people of Gaza  utilizing our proximity to the area and our good relations with all sides.  This year  Cyprus is celebrating the fiftieth year since the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus and its participation as a full Member of the United Nations. The Republic of Cyprus became a Member of the Organization as soon as it gained its independence in the hope and with the aspiration of contributing to the work of the Organization and playing a constructive role in international affairs through the promotion of the implementation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. With its unique geographic position at the crossroads of three continents  Cyprus held the noble goal of serving as a bridge for peace and cooperation in its neighbourhood and beyond.  Having gained its independence at a difficult period in world politics  Cyprus took a clear and conscious decision to join the Non-Aligned Movement. As a founding member of the Movement  Cyprus played an active role in the work of the United Nations and in resolving international problems. We have always held the view that problems cannot be resolved through military confrontation but must be solved through dialogue  diplomacy and respect for the territorial integrity  sovereignty and independence of all countries and peoples  whether great or small  rich or poor.  In 2004  the Republic of Cyprus joined the European Union (EU) as a full member. Proud of its traditions  Cyprus preserves its neutrality and seeks to play an active and constructive role as an EU member State.  After Cyprus won independence in 1960  the road for Cypriots has not  unfortunately  been without problems. Despite many difficulties and misfortunes  we have managed to achieve economic growth and a satisfactory standard of living for our people. In the political field  however  the first years of independence were marked by difficulties and a lack of the necessary political cooperation between the two communities of the island  which were called to govern the country together under the Constitution. Those early differences and difficulties were exacerbated by foreign interference. The culmination of these interventions was the military coup of the junta that ruled Greece at the time  and the illegal Turkish invasion of July-August 1974. The military occupation by the Turkish Army of 37 per cent of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus continues today  as does the violation of the human rights of all Cypriot citizens  Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.  The people of Cyprus have suffered enough. It is time to overcome the problems  to achieve reconciliation between the two communities and to reunite our country and our people for the sake of peace and future generations.  The General Assembly and Security Council have been addressing the Cyprus problem since the 1960s. A number of resolutions have been adopted by both the Security Council and the General Assembly aimed at safeguarding the independence  territorial integrity  sovereignty and unity of the Republic of Cyprus. I take this opportunity to express the appreciation of the people of Cyprus to the Secretary-General  the Security Council and the United Nations as a whole for their continued and unwavering interest in Cyprus.  In 1977  Archbishop Makarios  the President of Cyprus at the time  accepted the evolution of the unitary State into a bicommunal  bizonal federation. That historic compromise was a brave concession by the Greek Cypriot community towards their Turkish Cypriot compatriots. It sought to bring an end to the foreign occupation and to restore the unity of the Republic of Cyprus. The composition of the population and the human geography of Cyprus were such that conditions for a federation did not exist. The two communities lived intermingled throughout the island. It is for that reason that the acceptance of the bicommunal  bizonal federation by the Greek Cypriots constituted a historic compromise and a concession towards our Turkish Cypriot compatriots.    10-54959 22   After 1977  the Security Council through its resolutions endorsed the evolution of the Republic of Cyprus into a bicommunal  bizonal federation with political equality  defined not as numerical equality but as the effective participation of both communities in all organs of Government. The united federal State would be one  with a single sovereignty  a single citizenship and a single international personality. The federal State would respect fundamental human rights and basic freedoms in accordance with Security Council resolutions. The principles and values of the European Union would also be observed.  Since my election in 2008  I have actively engaged with the leadership of the Turkish Cypriot community in a Cypriot-owned process within the framework of the Good Offices Mission of the Secretary-General in order to reach a mutually acceptable agreed solution on the constitutional and other internal aspects of the problem. Two years into the process and despite the difficulties  some progress  although not as much as anticipated  has been achieved on certain issues. At the outset of this process  we agreed with the Secretary-General that there would be no artificial deadlines or outside intervention in the form of arbitration or the submission of ready-made solutions.  With the new leader of the Turkish Cypriot community  we worked through the summer and  in the past few weeks  have further intensified our meetings. In order to achieve results soon  I have submitted a package consisting of three proposals. First  I have suggested linking the negotiation of the chapters of property  territorial adjustments and settlers in order to give impetus to the process. I have also proposed that when we are close to reaching an agreement on the internal aspects of the problem  we could hold an international conference under the auspices of the Secretary-General and with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council  the guarantor Powers  the European Union  the Republic of Cyprus and the two communities to discuss the international aspects of the problem.   The third element of my proposal concerns Famagusta. My series of proposals would benefit all sides and could create the necessary political climate to drive the entire process forward. Unfortunately  the new Turkish Cypriot leader and the Turkish leadership have rejected these proposals.  I would like to make a special reference here to our proposal on Famagusta. In 1974  Famagusta was a city with a population of both Greek and Turkish Cypriots. As the Turkish Army advanced towards the city  the Greek Cypriot population was forced to flee. The town of Varosha has been a ghost town ever since. The Security Council considers the Government of Turkey responsible for the area  and in 1984  under resolution 550 (1984)  demanded the return of the town to the United Nations in order that it might be inhabited by its legal inhabitants. Even before the adoption of resolution 550 (1984)  the leaders of the two communities had agreed in 1979 to settle the issue of Famagusta as a matter of priority  notwithstanding any political negotiations on other issues.   My proposal  if accepted  would have benefits for all sides. In addition to the return of the fenced city to rightful inhabitants under United Nations control  my proposal includes the restoration of the medieval part of the city where our Turkish Cypriot compatriots live  as well as the opening of the port of Famagusta to external trade under EU supervision — a measure directly aimed at benefiting the Turkish Cypriots. Such a development would also benefit Turkey’s accession negotiations with the EU and provide an excellent example of harmonious coexistence and cooperation between the two communities. From this rostrum  I would also like to propose that the National Guard and the Turkish Army again cancel their annual military exercises this autumn.   Turkey’s leadership has assured the international community that it wants a solution of the problem by end of 2010. We are still waiting for its words to be transformed into action. The same expectation was repeatedly voiced by the European Council and in a recent resolution of the European Parliament. The European Union calls on Turkey to work on the basis of United Nations resolutions and to meet its obligations towards the European Union and the Republic of Cyprus  which Turkey still fails to recognize.  Turkey must respect the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and contribute to the achievement of an agreement that would reunite Cyprus and its people. Our vision is of a reunited Cyprus  common homeland of Greek and Turkish Cypriots  without any foreign troops or settlers on its territory and with full respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all its people:   23 10-54959  Greek and Turkish Cypriots  Maronites  Armenians and Latins. I would like to reiterate my commitment to doing my utmost to that end.  From this rostrum  I repeat my call on the Turkish leadership to meet with me  in parallel to the negotiating process  so that I can share with them my vision for a solution of the Cyprus problem  which would serve the interests of the Cypriots  Turkey and Greece  as well as of peace and security in the region.  The challenges faced by the international community are increasing. Climate change  poverty  malnutrition and lack of access to basic health care  terrorism  wars  the threat of further nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism  the economic crisis and political instability in many regions of the world require us to undertake a renewed and more effective effort to protect humankind’s achievements. The future is in our hands. We will succeed only if we achieve a more just distribution and better redistribution of the world’s natural resources and wealth."
"44",1809,"CZE",65,2010,"First  I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the very responsible post of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session.  I have the privilege of representing the Czech Republic  a country in the very heart of Europe that has been actively involved in United Nations activities from the very beginning and will continue to be so. We are actively involved in a number of United Nations bodies  and Czech soldiers and experts have participated in United Nations peacekeeping missions for many decades. It is in our interests for this Organization to remain a respected high-level forum  contributing to prosperity  stability and peaceful solutions to conflicts around the world.  It has been said here many times in the past few days that today’s world is very different from that of 1945  when this Organization was founded by 51 States. It now consists of 192. That is not merely a quantitative change; it is much more. My country is therefore deeply convinced that the structure of the United Nations also needs to be different  especially that of the Security Council  which should be reformed to reflect the geopolitical  economic and demographic reality of the twenty-first century. It is frustrating that discussions of such reform have gone on for the past   5 10-55109  16 years without results. It is time to come up with concrete results  and my country is ready to support them.  Changes of this kind are necessary; on the other hand  some things must continue unchanged. I do not believe that the United Nations needs to search for a new mission. Its goals should remain those defined in the original Charter: to maintain international peace and security  to develop friendly relations among nations  and to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems. The United Nations should not diverge from these principles. It should not search for alternative or substitute projects to replace those that enhance peace  freedom and democracy. It should remain an intergovernmental platform  based on the plurality of views of its Member States and on mutual respect for their sometimes differing positions.  Let me briefly touch on two issues that form part of the current United Nations agenda. The first is the worldwide economic crisis and the methods used to overcome it. I am afraid that we are moving in the wrong direction. The anti-crisis measures that have been proposed and already partly implemented follow from the assumption that the crisis was a failure of markets and that the right way out is more regulation of markets. This is a mistaken assumption. It will not be possible to prevent any future crises by implementing substantial  market-damaging macroeconomic and regulatory Government interventions  as is being done now. That will only destroy markets  and with them the chances for economic growth and prosperity in developed and developing countries alike.  The solution to this or any other crisis does not lie in increasing protectionism  and it is a positive factor that most Governments have behaved quite rationally in this respect. Nor does the solution lie in more bureaucracy  in creating new governmental or supranational agencies  or in aiming at global governance of the world’s economy. On the contrary  this is the time for international organizations  including the United Nations  to reduce their spending  slim down their administrations and leave the solutions to the Governments of the Member States  which are directly accountable to the citizens of their countries.  Developing countries should not be prevented from growing economically. They need access to foreign markets and they need free trade. It was in this forum last year that I emphasized that we must pay attention to the costs and benefits of our decisions. Developing countries must not be forced into agreements on ever more ambitious targets in the fight against climate change  particularly at a time when the developed countries themselves are far from meeting those targets. The United Nations should not have an all-encompassing agenda. It should not turn away from political topics towards scientific ones. It is here not to determine what science is  but to engage its Member States in rational and reasoned debate about political issues. The most harmful political debate we have witnessed in the past couple of years is about the climate and global warming.  We should not give up on elemental values and principles that most of us share  and this brings me to the second issue I wish to mention here today — nuclear non proliferation. In April  my country hosted an important event during which the President of Russia and the President of the United States signed the Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. We see the Treaty as an important step forward and as a visible sign of our efforts to make our complicated world safer. Let us hope that it will be taken further in the foreseeable future.  We do not dispute the right of any country to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes  but it must do so in a responsible way. It is not possible for some countries to ignore agreed and respected international standards  to threaten stability in their regions and to increase the dangers of proliferation.  The United Nations is a unique forum at which small and big countries alike are represented. They are countries with different political  economic and social systems; different neighbours; different historical experiences and geopolitical positions; and  more importantly  different levels of income  wealth and development. This is precisely what makes the United Nations unique and irreplaceable. Instead of increasingly becoming a source of funds for various  sometimes very dubious non-governmental organizations that — without any accountability or control — seek to profit from United Nations activities  the United Nations should strive to be an efficient body in which States and their peoples are represented. Its task is not to push for global governance and play the central role in it. The United Nations exists primarily to enhance friendly relations among its Members and    10-55109 6  to look for solutions to problems that cannot be confined to national boundaries.  I wish you every success in your office  Mr. President  and I would like to assure you that the Czech Republic will continue to be an active Member of the United Nations."
"45",1871,"DEU",65,2010,"It is an honour for me to speak to the General Assembly today.  The world has changed dramatically since the United Nations was founded 65 years ago. International trade and exchange are  of course  nothing new. What is new  however  is how quickly the changes affect everybody’s lives. Only if we in the United Nations are and remain able to act can we shape these global changes. We will manage to solve problems relating to security and economic  social and ecological development only if the international community stands united. Germany is ready to assume global responsibility within the framework of the United Nations.  Germany’s foreign policy is firmly embedded in the international community. In Europe  a system of cooperation has replaced the confrontation that cruelly divided our continent for centuries. The European Union is successful because  in Europe  all peoples and States meet on an equal footing. The United Nations  too  brings together nations large and small  rich and poor  those that are more powerful and those with less influence. Cooperation between equals on an equal footing is our guiding principle also for work here at the United Nations. Each and every country must respect all others.  German foreign policy is a policy of peace. This autumn  Germany will stand for election as a non-permanent member of the Security Council because the Council is the ideal forum in which to cooperate in the cause of peace and development. Peace is more than the absence of war. In today’s globalized world  people are just as vulnerable to the consequences of climate change  poverty and underdevelopment as they are to violence and oppression.  Climate change has a direct impact on each and every one of us. Countless people are already personally feeling its economic and social consequences. In their letter to the Security Council  the Pacific island States rightly warned us in no uncertain terms just how much climate change threatens everyone’s security. Everyone must play their   35 10-55103  part to protect the climate. In Germany  we have just adopted a forward-looking energy strategy. By the year 2050  80 per cent of our electricity production will come from renewable sources. Germany has also pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 per cent by the year 2020  compared to the 1990 baseline. Even now  we have reduced our carbon dioxide emissions by almost 30 per cent. We are pioneers in the field of climate protection. We are helping those who are now most adversely affected by climate change. We are particularly concerned about the fate of small island States.  Anyone who is serious about combating climate change has to build on innovation  new technologies and exchange. Developed and developing nations alike can profit from cooperation on future energies. Germany will contribute its technological expertise  for example  in the fields of renewable energy and energy efficiency. In this way  we are turning the challenge of climate change into an opportunity for fair development and enhanced cooperation. Climate policy is a cornerstone of any sustainable development policy. The recent summit on the Millennium Development Goals laid down the next steps forward in our global partnership for development.  Education is the key to development. Development needs education. Education protects people from discrimination and oppression. Education fights prejudice and thereby fosters peace. Education also creates products and markets; education is the path to prosperity. The true wealth of many nations is no longer found in their raw materials but in the minds of their people. Education is a human right. It is because education will determine whether societies succeed or fail in tomorrow’s world that Germany is one of the major international partners for learning. By building on education  we are building bridges to the future for the young people of today.  The United Nations itself must also keep up with the pace of change. Today’s world order is not properly reflected if Africa and Latin America are not permanently represented on the Security Council. Asia  too  rightly considers itself to be underrepresented. The entire continent  not just individual States  is developing at breathtaking speed. We take our partnerships seriously  both the old and the new. Germany  too  remains ready to assume greater responsibility.  Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are not issues of the past but challenges of our time. Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are two sides of the same coin. We have to do all we possibly can to ensure that weapons of mass destruction do not become the bane of globalization. Unlike the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons five years ago  this May’s Review Conference was a success. If we work together to maintain this momentum  it will be in our power to ensure that this decade does not see a build-up of arms but becomes a decade of disarmament. A world without nuclear weapons is a long-term vision  but even a marathon begins with the first step.  There is now movement in the disarmament debate. The group of States founded here in New York on Wednesday to advance disarmament and arms control does not stand alone. For over 10 years  the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva was not even able to agree on an agenda. That is not the way to live up to our shared responsibility. We met yesterday at the invitation of the Secretary-General to break the deadlock binding the Geneva Conference. Our world will be a more secure place when the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty enters into force and the production of fissile material is ended once and for all.  German peace policy stands for the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts. Germany is doing its utmost to ensure that the direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians are a success. We will continue to strengthen the forces of reason and reconciliation. During this vital period for the peace process in particular  I urge both sides to refrain from taking any action that might block the path to peace. We condemn any form of violence that has the sole aim of torpedoing the peace talks. At the same time  we call for the moratorium on settlement construction to be extended. Lasting peace will be achieved only through a two-State solution  with Israel and a Palestinian State living peacefully side by side within secure borders.  Iran  like every other country  naturally has the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. However  the Tehran leadership itself has sown doubt about the civilian nature of its nuclear programme. Iran  by demonstrating openness and transparency  can allay that doubt. Our offer of dialogue still stands. It is now up to Iran to grasp our outstretched hand.    10-55103 36   The conference aimed at establishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East  planned for 2012  will be a major opportunity to strengthen peace and security in the region. Germany is encouraging all countries in the region to take part to ensure that the conference is a success. We are committed to a nuclear-weapon-free Middle East.  Germany is one of the major supporters of a peaceful and secure Afghanistan. As we agreed in London and Kabul  we want to transfer security responsibility for the whole of Afghanistan to the Afghan Government by 2014. To make progress in that country  so long ravaged by war and civil strife  effective measures must be taken to prevent the violence. However  military means alone will not bring success. We favour a comprehensive approach and above all a political solution. All sides now need the courage and the stamina to engage in reconciliation.  The German Government assists when people anywhere in the world are struck by natural disasters and emergencies. However  a country’s conscience is to be found in the hearts of its citizens. I am proud that my fellow Germans donate so generously at times of greatest need. Humanity and solidarity are global values; humanity and solidarity make no distinction based on skin colour or religious beliefs. When the tsunami devastated coastlines around the Indian Ocean  when the Haiti earthquake destroyed the work of decades  or just recently  when the horrific floods in Pakistan left havoc in their wake  we Germans shared the victims’ pain and helped in the most heartfelt way possible. We will stand by Pakistan over the coming months and years to ensure that the country has a promising economic future.  We are working towards a peaceful order in the Sudan  now and after the referendum early next year. We are looking for ways of achieving stable conditions in Yemen and are particularly active in the Friends of Yemen group. We are working hard to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa and to bring peace and stability to Somalia.  Reconstruction efforts in devastated regions cannot bring success overnight. Similarly  for societies torn by war and civil strife  the route to life in dignity leads through peace and reconciliation. There can be true peace only when human rights are respected. For us  such principles as the rule of law  freedom of opinion  freedom of the press and respect for inalienable human rights are essential. The protection of human rights remains a task for all societies.  It is a fundamental tenet of the United Nations that women determine their own lives and help decide the fate of their countries. Ethnic or religious minorities enrich their societies. Tolerance is one of Germany’s guiding principles. Everyone wins in the competition for the best ideas; in a clash of cultures  there can only be losers.  United Europe can make a valuable contribution on our continent and beyond. Germany is working to ensure that  in the future  the European Union shall cooperate even more closely with other regions in Latin America  Africa and Asia  and live up to its global responsibility. Germany is the third-largest development cooperation donor. We have practically recovered from the financial and economic crisis and are on the right track due to our robust economic growth. This strong economy makes Germany a strong global partner.  If all countries  small and large  work together  we will be able to master the pressing challenges of our world. They can count on Germany. They can rely on Germany. "
"46",1930,"DMA",65,2010,"I begin by congratulating you  Sir  on your well-deserved election to preside over the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Additionally  I take this opportunity to thank Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki of Libya for his effective  strong and dynamic leadership during the sixty-fourth session and to salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tremendous efforts in promoting global peace  security and development.  I address the Assembly as we confront the second decade of this millennium  which brings such tremendous opportunities for mankind. Scientific and technological innovations have made the world a truly global village characterized by continuing connectivity and unimagined possibilities for facilitating global development. These technologies  integrating as they do even the smallest and traditionally most distant countries into the day-to-day activities of the world community  have the potential to combat hunger  eradicate poverty  generate employment  and elevate the standard of living of people throughout the world  without compromising the integrity of our ecosystem and planet Earth.  However  in order to realize the full potential of these opportunities  the community of nations now needs to muster the courage to pursue with determination reforms in international and multilateral institutions such as the United Nations which will ensure equality of treatment  and bring the benefits of development to those countries which  in consequence of small size  are often the least endowed  and most vulnerable in today’s world community.  The formulation and pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has brought the world’s attention to the main issues of development  especially the challenges faced by developing countries. It also brought to the fore the nexus which exists between financial  social and economic development on the one hand and the sustainable use of natural resources on the other.  By and large  we in the developing world have lived up to the commitments which we made  by mobilizing domestic financial resources for development and making major structural changes  even in the face of an increasingly hostile economic  financial and trading system. Those efforts have been    10-55103 4  coupled with international resources for development in the form of foreign direct investment and official development assistance. The results to date have been encouraging when one considers where we were at the beginning of the millennium. There still remain  however  a number of unresolved global issues which have stymied the efforts to attain the Millennium Development Goals.  We suggest  therefore  that the next five years before the target date of the MDGs must see a reconfiguration and acceleration of efforts by all Member States. This should begin with the fulfilment of commitments already given by developed countries  and South-South cooperation must be strengthened in keeping with the kind of solidarity now being demonstrated by Venezuela  Cuba  China  Brazil and other such developing countries.  Negotiation of the Doha Development Round must be concluded within a reasonable time  and in that regard the very small States of the developing world must continue to insist  even as others resist it  on meaningful recognition by the global community of the principle of special and differential treatment  rather than a “one size fits all” approach  as a central principle permitting beneficial economic adjustment for countries like my own. This will provide developing countries with an opportunity to compete in the global trading system and place greater emphasis on trade rather than aid.  The phenomenon of climate change has been well documented by the United Nations and other institutions over the past decade. In fact  we in the Caribbean and other small island developing States can speak of our experience with the increasing intensity of hurricanes  droughts  floods  destruction to coastal areas and rising sea levels. These have had severe impacts on our agriculture  tourism  and physical infrastructure  especially along our coasts  leading to an increasingly high cost for adaptation and mitigation  resulting in the diversion of funds which otherwise would have been used for social and economic development. Climate change  therefore  has become a major threat to the ability of most developing countries to achieve the MDGs.  For almost two decades the United Nations has recognized the special economic  social and environmental vulnerabilities of small island developing States. Since the Mauritius meeting in 2005  their situation has become even more precarious. The impacts of the world food and fuel crises in 2007 and the financial and economic crisis in 2008 have clearly demonstrated the open and vulnerable nature of our economies. This  coupled with the impact of climate change  strengthens the case for a unique position for small island developing States and hence a more prominent place within the United Nations system as a recognized category  with all the attendant benefits and obligations.  Despite our many challenges  small island developing States continue to demonstrate strong leadership  particularly in the area of climate change and in the work of the United Nations in general. Significant progress has been made in the areas of the protection of biodiversity  strategies for promoting renewable energy  and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. These efforts need to be complemented both by the United Nations system and by other Member States  especially the developed countries.  It is regrettable that to date no consensus has been reached on the best way to deal with what we consider a clear and present danger to our planet. The failure at Copenhagen should be further motivation for all countries to work assiduously towards an agreement in Mexico.  We commend the efforts being made towards a consensus on climate change; however  we maintain that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change should be the primary forum for negotiating the global response to climate change. We therefore call upon all Member States to work within this framework in order to arrive expeditiously at a binding agreement which will recognize the shared but differentiated responsibilities of Member States.  Since its establishment  the United Nations has played  as it continues to play  a critical role in fostering greater understanding among nations and maintaining peace and security throughout the world. The United Nations has also been able to reduce conflict and minimize tensions between countries and peoples. These efforts have been buttressed by other significant efforts  such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.   5 10-55103   In May this year the United Nations held the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Dominica supports the outcome of the Conference  and calls upon all Member States to adhere to the obligations of the Treaty. We call for a world free of nuclear weapons  and join the calls for total disarmament.  Small arms and light weapons continue to pose a major threat to peace and security throughout the world. Dominica is very concerned over the increase in that illicit trade in the Caribbean region. We are not convinced that the larger nations of the world comprehend the extent of the inability of smaller nations like my own  which bridge the producers and consumers of narcotic substances  to cope with this new horror.  The continued demand in the North for drugs produced in the South  and the growth of the related trade in small arms and light weapons  have placed us in the crossfire of these illicit activities. Yet it appears to us that the larger nations of the world only take decisive steps to cope with this situation when it has become untenable for themselves. In that context  we do not believe that sufficient consultation now exists to ensure that the smaller States are provided  on a continuous basis  with the capabilities needed for persistent attention to the problems that arise in our jurisdictions. This is yet another aspect of the case for special and differential treatment in the security and social development spheres.  The threat of terrorism is of concern throughout the world. Radical extremism has created an environment in which cultural and religious misunderstandings and misplaced anger have claimed the lives of thousands. We extend our sympathy to all the Member States which have lost citizens at the hands of those who have sought to destabilize Governments and to instil fear in the rest of humanity. By its very nature  the fight against terrorism requires global action. This must involve the efforts of the United Nations in fostering a culture of peace  tolerance and understanding among the peoples of the world.  During last year’s general debate (see A/64/PV.7)  Dominica recognized the important role of the United Nations in the rebuilding process of our sister nation of Haiti. We also called upon those Member States that had pledged assistance to make good on their promises in order to foster Haiti’s social and economic development. Today  the challenges facing Haiti have been magnified to a degree which requires further commitments from all Member States of the United Nations. The destruction wrought in Haiti by the earthquake in January has made the need for resource mobilization a matter of extreme urgency.  In March the United Nations hosted the International Donors’ Conference towards a New Future for Haiti. Dominica wishes to commend the organizers and the contributors to this initiative. During the Conference several Member States pledged their support for the reconstruction efforts. Commitments of several billion dollars were made. Sadly  to date the Government and people of Haiti have been able to access only a fraction of those pledges. We call on all Member States to make good their promises so as to ensure that the rebuilding process can continue and to avoid further deterioration of the political  social and economic situation of that country.  The focus in rebuilding Haiti should be not solely on physical infrastructure  but also on the building and rebuilding of institutions to strengthen the governance of Haiti and to empower its people through technology transfer and capacity-building. It should also include development of the productive sectors to place Haiti on a path to economic independence.  Most important  the international community must recognize and accept that the Government and people of Haiti must be placed at the centre of the reconstruction process so as to engender a spirit of unity of purpose  ownership and meaningful partnership  even at these most challenging times.  The crisis in Haiti presents both a challenge and an opportunity  not only to the international community  but also to the Governments and financial institutions to which that country remains heavily indebted. We call on those international financial institutions and Governments to cancel the remaining debt owed by Haiti in order to provide more latitude for that country to fully realize its recovery efforts. As regards trade  we urge all Member States to liberalize trading regimes so as to allow greater access of Haitian products into their markets without barriers.  Earlier I spoke of the threats which plague mankind in the era of globalization. I also highlighted the need for multilateralism and the need for cooperation between States. Those challenges can be    10-55103 6  overcome only in a global environment where there exist respect for each other’s territorial integrity; non-interference in each other’s domestic affairs; and respect for sovereignty and the right to self-determination. It is in this context that Dominica again calls on the United States of America to discontinue its economic blockade against the people of the Republic of Cuba.  The rule of law is an important aspect of international law. Adherence to our international obligations is important to the maintenance of peace and security and to ensuring that all persons  regardless of race  nationality  creed or gender  continue to believe in the international system and to recognize that this system is for the benefit of all peoples and nations  whether large or small. That is why the situation in which our sister nation of Antigua and Barbuda has been placed vis-à-vis its dispute with the United States of America is extremely unfortunate and must be remedied as quickly as possible. We urge the parties involved to quickly seek to resolve the situation and arrive at a negotiated settlement that is fair and just.  The citizens of this planet have come to recognize that new developments in technology have brought an interdependence among peoples and States as they vigorously pursue the development of their separate countries. They have also come to realize that there must be increasing cooperation between nations in order to ensure a deliberate and planned approach to the maintenance and development of the resources of this planet. In that connection  regional processes of cooperation have increasingly come to characterize the conduct of nations.  But as the technology of communication has increased international connectiveness  it has also become apparent that regionalism often proves insufficient  and that a global approach must be taken to new issues which arise. Therefore  my country strongly supports the principle that it is the United Nations  to which all countries turn in times of crises  that must play the fundamental role in the surveillance of all developments affecting our planet. Consequently  we hereby reaffirm our commitment to the central role that the United Nations should play in global governance. "
"47",1974,"DNK",65,2010,"The world is undergoing profound changes. Globalization is progressing at an unprecedented speed. The boundaries between domestic and foreign policy are evolving. Developments in one region of the world may trigger unintended actions in other parts of the world. New actors — for good or for bad — have stepped on to the international scene. The world is now on the way to recovery from the financial and economic crises of recent years. More structural challenges  such as climate change  poverty and demographic projections  as well as new security threats  however  will increasingly impact the global agenda. If we are to respond to such challenges  we need an effective multilateral system founded on universal rules and values and on global legitimacy. Here  we turn to the United Nations.  With the Lisbon Treaty in force  the European Union has established the necessary structures to take on the challenges of the twenty-first century and has enhanced its capacity as a global player. We look forward to seeing this reflected in the future position of the European Union in the United Nations  and we regret that it has not been possible to come to an agreement on this issue (see A/64/PV.122). The European Union will retain observer status at the General Assembly. The main effect of the draft resolution will be to enable the European Union’s new permanent interlocutors to represent the European Union effectively in the General Assembly  speaking on behalf of the European Union and of its member States  as agreed by them. The European Union has a clear commitment to effective multilateralism  with the United Nations at its core.  One of the most significant global challenges today is to fulfil the promises of the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) for a better world for everyone. With last week’s Millennium Development Goals summit  a new momentum has been built — a momentum for action  for the implementation of commitments and for focusing our common efforts to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Five years is not a long time  especially when we also need to overcome the effects of the financial and economic crisis. But our task is clear. We must make the MDGs a reality for all. We need to accelerate progress and scale up our efforts where approaches have proven to be successful. We have to be innovative. Developing countries must focus their political will  administrative capacity and budgetary resources on reaching the MDGs  while we as donors must live up to and fulfil our official development assistance commitments.  We have clear evidence that fragile and conflict-affected countries are lagging behind the most with regard to the achievement of the MDGs. The comparative advantage of the United Nations system and its unique possibilities in combining humanitarian  peacekeeping  peacebuilding  recovery and development approaches are especially relevant in relation to these countries. We strongly encourage the ongoing efforts to strengthen the United Nations role in this regard. We   31 10-55276  welcome the Secretary-General’s steps to strengthen the peacebuilding architecture  but more work is needed in areas such as strengthened integrated missions  improving in-country leadership  and strengthening the Peacebuilding Support Office in order to forward the peacebuilding agenda.  Green growth is an important challenge that offers new opportunities for employment  innovation and wealth creation in developed and developing countries alike. Together  we must strive to optimize resource efficiency and apply green technologies. Renewable energy is a good example of how new technologies can contribute to development by providing secure  sustainable and affordable energy to millions of people. Green growth is not an obstacle to development but an opportunity. We must unite our efforts to take this agenda forward in the immediate future and in preparation for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in May 2012.  Climate change continues to be one of the greatest and most pressing challenges of our time  and we are already starting to experience the consequences — from melting icecaps in the Arctic  heatwaves in Russia and floods in Pakistan to droughts in Africa. It concerns all of us  and concerted and urgent action is needed. The Copenhagen Accord contains delicate political compromises  paving the way for eventually reaching a global  legally binding international agreement within the United Nations framework. More than 130 countries  covering more than 80 per cent of global emissions  have now associated themselves with the Accord reached in Copenhagen in December last year. We underline the importance of the commitments on fast-start financing  which must be fulfilled. We are looking forward to the sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Cancún  Mexico  and hoping for a successful outcome that will significantly advance negotiations on climate change.  In the ever more interdependent and ever more uncertain world we live in  it is of priority to uphold the principles  objectives  universal rights and fundamental values that are enshrined in the United Nations Charter and that form the very basis for global stability  development and global prosperity. Strengthening the mutual understanding between cultures is an important challenge and a valuable opportunity for all of us.  During the past month  we have witnessed just how important it is to maintain mutual respect and understanding. As history has taught us  there are always those who are ready to do the unthinkable in order to catch the attention of the international media. The threats to burn the Koran in Florida were a particularly repulsive example of this phenomenon. We strongly condemn such acts  but as we have learned  the more attention we give such individual acts of provocation  the more they will multiply. We must never allow such acts to steer our steps from the path of dialogue. We must stand firmly and jointly against any call to strife and violence.  States must ensure the human rights and fundamental freedoms of their citizens in order for each individual to take an active part in shaping his or her own future to the benefit and prosperity of all. Women’s rights and gender issues are an essential part of human rights. The women’s rights agenda supports and strengthens the overall effort of human rights’ implementation. International peace and security rest upon the ability and willingness of States to ensure the protection of their populations from human rights violations and atrocity crimes.  In this context  I welcome the ongoing debate among Member States on the responsibility to protect. Denmark will take an active part in the further development of this concept  which provides the framework for a comprehensive approach. It is closely linked to another key Danish priority — that of strengthening the rule of law. Be it at the global  regional or national level  the rule of law provides transparency and accountability and thereby leads to better governance. The establishment of the office of Ombudsperson in relation to the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) was a successful example of our work at the global level.  Piracy off the coast of Somalia presents a regional challenge that Denmark — through its naval efforts off Somalia and its chairmanship of the legal working group of the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia — is committed to meeting. At the national level Denmark  in close cooperation with partner countries  provides hundreds of millions of dollars to strengthen legal systems and judicial capacities throughout the world. Let me stress here that our support for the International Criminal Court in no way springs from a wish for the Court to prosecute all    10-55276 32  international crimes. National jurisdictions are almost always better placed to combat impunity  and through our rule of law programmes we seek to promote true national ownership and complementarity for those able and willing to face the hard choices.  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the most serious danger emanating from globalization. Following many years of deadlock  however  2010 has been a year of progress. We welcome the international momentum in dealing with the issue of nuclear weapons as reflected in the New START agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation  the nuclear summit and  notably  the results of the Review Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) here in New York in May. It is important that all States parties commit to implementing the measures of the NPT action plan.   The issue of non-proliferation remains high on the agenda  not least due to our deepening concerns about the allegedly peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme. With the adoption of Security Council resolution 1929 (2010)  the international community has sent a clear signal to the Iranian leadership that we do not tolerate the continuous and increasingly grave flouting of Iran’s international obligations. It is hoped that this resolution will help to convince Iran to change its current path and enter into negotiations.  I should like to take this opportunity to welcome the parliamentary elections in Afghanistan earlier this month  which represent yet another step on Afghanistan’s road towards democracy. The elections came after the successful outcome of the Kabul Conference. We look forward to the implementation of the Conference initiatives leading to the transition to full Afghan ownership in all areas.  The international community and the United Nations must continue to play a supporting role in Afghanistan in the years to come. In this context  Denmark believes there needs to be a coordinated civilian and military engagement in Afghanistan as a precondition for success. The regional aspects also need to be addressed. In this context  my thoughts go to the people and the Government of Pakistan  who have not only experienced sacrifices due to terrorism  but also heavy losses and suffering due to the unprecedented flooding of the country. Denmark has committed more than $45 million in assistance to Pakistan so far this year.  Denmark welcomes the recent relaunch of direct negotiations between the leaders of Israel and the Palestinian Authority on reaching an agreement on all the core issues within one year. We also welcome the Quartet’s statement encouraging these negotiations. They will be difficult  but we believe that an agreement is possible and that it is in the interest not only of Israelis and Palestinians  but also of the peoples in the region and beyond. We strongly support the United States efforts to facilitate the negotiations  and we call on the parties to negotiate in good faith and to live up to their obligations. The direct peace talks actualize the importance of enhanced international political and financial support for Palestinian State-building. Denmark and the European Union stand ready to assist in fulfilling the goals of two States for two peoples living side by side in peace and security.  Peace needs to be secured in all parts of the world. In this context  the implementation of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement is vital to the future of the Sudan. The international community needs to support the referendum process to secure inclusive  free and transparent elections. Without prejudging the outcome of the referendum  I should like to stress the importance of developing institutional capacity and of creating more self-sustainability in South Sudan. Likewise  we are very concerned about the humanitarian situation in many parts of the country. Focus should be on securing access to all areas for humanitarian workers and international peacekeepers. In Somalia  the focus must be on the need to support the Transitional Federal Government and improve the coordination of assistance  including within the United Nations system.  The best way to deal with these global challenges is through an effective and strong multilateral system — through a strong United Nations system. The ability of the United Nations effectively and efficiently to deal with the global challenges of the twenty-first century must be improved. Continuing the paths of system-wide coherence and delivering as one is part of that. Reforms of the intergovernmental machinery and of the workings of the Secretariat must also be pursued. We welcome the ongoing intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform aimed at changing the membership in order to reflect the world of today. Let me take this opportunity to welcome the establishment   33 10-55276  of UN Women and the appointment of Ms. Michelle Bachelet of Chile as the first Under-Secretary-General and head of that agency. We have high expectations that the new entity will contribute to streamlining in the area of gender  women’s rights and development throughout the United Nations system.  In the area of peacekeeping we commend initiatives  such as New Horizon  to readjust United Nations peacekeeping efforts in light of the experiences gathered during the last decade of immense growth in United Nations peacekeeping operations.  Let me conclude by emphasizing that today’s world is more complex than ever. But on so many issues  countries want to work together towards long-lasting solutions. More often than not  they turn to the United Nations to find answers. They turn to an international body whose strength has been and still is based on its unique global legitimacy. Hence they  and we  expect the United Nations to live up to expectations  to perform  to show leadership and to push the envelope. Global challenges call for global answers. The United Nations must live up to this call  fulfilling the aspirations of the Charter. No less will do for the twenty-first century. "
"48",2019,"DOM",65,2010,"Eight years after Switzerland became a full Member of the United Nations  we are delighted to see that the presidency of this General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session fell to the 2004 President of the Swiss Confederation  Mr. Joseph Deiss  to whom we wish the greatest success in his tenure.  In 1998  the twentieth special session of the General Assembly was held to contribute to the elimination or substantial reduction of the illegal production of drugs and drug abuse by 2008. Ten years later  at a follow-up review meeting supported by this prestigious world body  the conclusion was reached that little progress had been made regarding the proposed goals and that there were therefore plenty of reasons for the international community to be concerned about the growing threat posed by the global drug problem. It was determined that a new 10-year plan was needed to cover the period until 2019  when the General Assembly will have once again to convene Member States in order to assess the outcome of measures implemented to eliminate the most serious threat to our citizens’ safety at the dawn of the twenty-first century: transnational organized crime and illegal drug trafficking.  Today  almost 250 million people between the ages of 15 and 64 consume drugs worldwide. Although that consumption extends to many regions around the world  the highest concentration of users is found in areas with the most pronounced economic and social development  such as the United States  Western Europe and Central Asia.  Drug consumption is harmful to health  causing personality disorders that often lead to loss of will  apathy and the development of pathological behaviour. Furthermore  tens of thousands of people die every year as a direct result of drug consumption  while others  depending on the way these toxic substances are consumed  are affected by diseases such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C.  Today  illegal drug trafficking constitutes a global black market  a kind of underground or hidden economy for the growth  manufacture  distribution and sale of this merchandise in the form of marijuana  opium  heroin  cocaine  methamphetamines and other varieties of such substances and others. That market  which is ruled like any other by the laws of supply and demand  now amounts to the astronomical sum of approximately $400 billion a year. That astronomical sum means that the global drug trade is worth more than the gross domestic product of 122 of the 184 countries that appear on the annual World Bank economic index. Every year  the global drug market generates more wealth than countries such as Chile  Denmark  Egypt  Finland  Israel  South Africa and Portugal. But  at the same time  it is more economically powerful than many of the world’s leading petroleum producing countries such as Kuwait  Qatar  Iraq  the United Arab Emirates and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.  In pursuit of its goals of conquering markets and accumulating wealth  transnational organized crime has begun availing itself of a new type of unprecedented  inhumane and cruel violence. Drug trafficking uses kidnapping  contract killings  torture and beheadings both in battles between drug trafficking groups and against the people and institutions that confront them. Drug trafficking sows fear and terror. It executes public servants as well as ordinary citizens. It murders journalists  teachers  doctors  students and housewives. Drug trafficking knows no limits or borders; it knows only horror  barbarism  bloodshed and crime.  It is so powerful that it influences and interferes in vital areas of government  such as the armed forces  the police  intelligence services and the justice system  in its attempt to make State institutions serve its macabre and sinister interests.    10-54833 32   In the face of all of this  some people are right to wonder whether transnational organized crime and illegal international drug trafficking can be defeated. Is it really possible to tackle and defeat all that this form of international crime entails?  Our response is: yes  it is possible. It is possible to take it on and to defeat it. It is possible to reduce it and to mitigate its harmful effects. However  to do so  several elements need to be in place. First  we need genuine commitment at the global level and authentic and genuine political will at the level of national Government.  We also need a paradigm change or a new strategic vision that will focus our efforts to fight the problem  not only on the supply side  as has fundamentally been the case so far  but also on the demand and consumption side.   It is imperative that we curb indiscriminate gun sales and human trafficking. We need to implement exchange and cooperation policies among the narcotics producer  transit and consumer countries. We need to introduce new technologies  strengthen intelligence systems  better train and enhance the professionalism of those in charge of ensuring public safety  design prevention mechanisms  generate educational opportunities  reduce poverty and create jobs  and get communities involved in building protective networks against crime.  We hope that  in 2019  when the General Assembly convenes its member States to evaluate the outcome of its new 10-year Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem (see resolution 64/182)  we will be in a position to say  for the sake of our families  our young people  our societies and  ultimately  of humanity as a whole  “We have prevailed. We have defeated the leading threat to the security our peoples at the beginning of the twenty-first century. We have beaten drugs.”  It is important also to note that the human and material losses experienced as a result of natural disasters in 2010 are a great cause for concern. To date  we have seen 47 floods and landslides  affecting countries as far apart as India and Brazil  China and Colombia  Russia and Congo  Kazakhstan and countries of East Africa  Mexico and Central America  Pakistan  Yemen and the Sudan.  To date  there have been 12 hurricanes  cyclones and typhoons  affecting countries such as Mexico  India  the Solomon Islands and Madagascar. To date  we have suffered eight serious droughts  followed by fires  in Bolivia  California  the Caribbean  China  Spain and Russia. To date  there have been seven earthquakes  from the tragedy in Haiti to China  from Tajikistan to Chile  and from Afghanistan to Mexico.  That does not include the volcanic eruptions — these too made no distinction between rich and poor. In the case of Iceland  the volcano led to the most serious interruption of air traffic since the Second World War. In addition  we need to take into account the numerous cold snaps  avalanches and storms that have occurred and their resultant epidemics — foremost among them  cholera in Africa and dengue fever in Latin America and the Caribbean.  As we can see  vulnerability to natural disasters around the world is on the rise  and development levels are falling quickly as a result. Most of these natural disasters are caused by climate change or global warming. It is therefore imperative that this world body adopt  as soon as possible  guidelines to regulate the emission of carbon dioxide and to protect the planet’s biodiversity.  There is much work to be done around the world to draw up and adopt policies and practices that will enable us to prevent the impact of natural disasters. In this context  it is crucial to incorporate risk management into development and land-use planning. We need to design and implement early warning systems in coastal areas  cities at risk  schools and hospitals. And we need urgently to re-equip critical infrastructure to ensure that it is adequate to withstand future catastrophes and to minimize human loss. Faced with this situation  the Dominican Republic intends to participate actively in the work of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction  whose next meeting will take place in Geneva  Switzerland  in May 2011.  Likewise  with advisory assistance from the United Nations Development Programme and New York’s Columbia University  in October we will be meeting with the ministers responsible for social policy as well as the mayors of cities at greatest risk in order to review ongoing activities in the integration and planning of natural disaster risk management.  Finally  I would like to take this opportunity to suggest  as we did during a visit to L’Aquila  Italy  that   33 10-54833  the United Nations system create a world alliance of countries at risk in order to exchange experiences  knowledge and ideas  and to pass along best practices learned during catastrophes. We are convinced that this would be a major contribution to the design and implementation of measures that will help save lives and minimize material damage."
"49",2066,"DZA",65,2010,"First of all  I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. Your character  distinguished career and knowledge of current international affairs will surely contribute to the management and success of our work. I would like to convey Algeria’s full support for your efforts in the course of your term of office. I also pay tribute to your predecessor  my brother Ali Abdussalam Treki  for his efforts and commitment to the principles of multilateralism and respect for the founding values of the Charter. Additionally  I wish to express our satisfaction and gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the breadth and quality of the efforts which he has tirelessly exerted to add to the role of the Organization in our joint quest to achieve and strengthen its ideals.  Despite the recent emergence of some encouraging signs of economic recovery  the world continues to suffer from the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis. The steps taken thus far to address its most devastating effects and to relaunch the global economic engine lead us to believe even more firmly   39 10-55122  that the best way to prevent worse crises from occurring is to rethink global financial and economic governance in a rational manner that leaves no room for speculation and the vagaries of the market and that serves as a fair model for developing countries.  The main trends in the world since the last session have led us to examine the depth of the economic crisis in the poorest countries  especially in Africa. Crises such as this hamper progress in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  notably in the areas of maternal and child health and in combating poverty. It is important that the international community respect its commitments in the area of official development assistance and provide recipient countries with additional assistance so that they can achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Several options could be explored in that regard  some of which seem very promising to us. They include debt moratoriums for developing countries that have difficulty in paying their debts and easier access to the markets of developed countries.  The fact that a high-level meeting on biodiversity will take place in a few weeks’ time in Nagoya  Japan  provides us with a valuable opportunity to launch an urgent appeal requesting the international community to mobilize to preserve the biological resources of our planet  which are being threatened by unbridled economic development that does not take future generations into account. In that context  I would like to stress the need to strengthen the role of the United Nations in protecting biodiversity in developing countries and in promoting North-South cooperation that is mutually beneficial.  The issue of climate change presents another considerable challenge for the international community  given the manifold threats it poses to ecosystems and economies. The limited and modest results achieved in Copenhagen should serve to encourage all States to redouble their efforts to make progress at the next meeting of the Conference of the Parties  to be held in Cancún  towards establishing a legally binding agreement based on the Kyoto Protocol’s Framework Convention.  No doubt due to climate change  the extreme gravity of the natural phenomena that have lately plunged Pakistan  Russia  China  India and other countries into disaster means that we need to restructure international mechanisms to respond to natural disasters of this kind. On the basis of humanism and solidarity  Algeria launches an appeal for a joint international reflection on the best way to achieve genuine comprehensive natural disaster management.  Countries that do not possess nuclear weapons  such as Algeria  have the right to ask nuclear States to truly embrace nuclear disarmament. The results of the 2010 eighth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons constitute a positive step in that regard  thanks in particular to the launching of a process that should give rise to a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East.  In order to rise to the multiple challenges confronting international peace and security  the Conference on Disarmament should make the most of the favourable international circumstances and the positive momentum generated by the results of the 2010 Review Conference to restart its work and comply with its mandate. To that end  Algeria continues to be committed to the effective relaunching of the work of the Conference on Disarmament. Algeria believes that the goals and contents of the programme adopted in 2009 continue to be valid today and could be the basis for the work of future sessions.  The issue of peace and security is also linked to the exacerbation of terrorism and its links with transnational organized crime  the taking of hostages and trafficking in arms  drugs and human beings. My country welcomes the adoption of resolution 1904 (2009)  on criminalizing the payment of ransoms to armed groups based on the principle that this condemnable practice is a significant source of financing for terrorism. Nevertheless  the international community must still make considerable efforts to eradicate this transnational threat  not just in the context of comprehensive and systematic implementation but also in the light of the increase in hostage-taking by terrorists and the payment of ransoms to them. This is an issue that must be addressed with determination  strength and responsibility.  Algeria calls on the international community to act to prevent the criminal use of international satellite images via the Internet. We believe that the comprehensive treaty to combat terrorism  which Algeria fully supports  will be a main factor in checking piracy  once it has been adopted.    10-55122 40   With regard to respect for the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  Algeria fully participates in regional integration attempts as a crucial element in combating international terrorism. Algeria has launched several recent initiatives  including an initiative to strengthen bilateral and regional cooperation among States in our region in order to bolster peace  security and development. It is committed to pursuing common efforts to build the Arab Maghreb union and endow it with dynamic institutions to ensure that the project comes into being as the ideal framework for economic cooperation and complementarity in the region. It has also launched Maghreb-wide economic and social programmes and development projects to encourage regional integration.  The Palestinian people  who continue to aspire to build a viable State  are still held hostage by the indecision of certain parties. That is being aggravated by policies of aggression and unjust siege. We reiterate our call to the international community to show resolve and unity with regard to this conflict by bringing pressure to bear on the occupation forces. We believe that a definitive  comprehensive and just solution requires the implementation of the Arab Peace Initiative. In that context  on behalf of the Algerian people and Government  I should like to express our friendship and support to our Palestinian brothers.  Algeria would like to see an immediate halt to settlements  the return of Palestinian refugees  the return of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians as the capital of a Palestinian State and a return to the borders of 4 June 1967. The other occupied Arab territories in Lebanon and the Golan should also be returned.  As we mark the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1514 (XV)  which enshrined the principle of freeing oppressed people from the yoke of colonialism  we unfortunately continue to see that there still exist Non-Self-Governing Territories whose populations continue to aspire to self-determination. To that end  and in keeping with our duties and responsibilities  Algeria is willing to extend its full support to the efforts of the United Nations and of Special Envoy of the Secretary-General Christopher Ross in order to resolve the Western Sahara conflict. We express our adherence to the human rights dimension of the issue and the need for it to be taken into account by the Human Rights Council and other international mechanisms in that area  in line with the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter  so as to reach a just political solution that allows the people of Western Sahara to exercise their right to self-determination through a referendum. I reiterate my country’s belief  in line with the view of the African Union Summit held in Kampala  that there cannot be an international justice system that operates at two different speeds and focuses on a single region of the world  for this issue poses a threat to regional peace and security.  Algeria also rejects the imposition of extraterritorial laws and rules and all forms of coercive economic measures  including unilateral sanctions against developing countries. In that regard  Algeria reiterates the need to end the economic  commercial and financial embargo that has been imposed against the Cuban Government and people for more than half a century.  The African Union has proclaimed 2010 the Year of Peace and Security in Africa  as an expression of the will of its member States to make every peaceful effort to resolve all ongoing and new conflicts and crises on our continent. We encourage the African Union to integrate economically and politically so that it can become a partner to reckon with in international affairs. "
"50",2113,"ECU",65,2010,"I would like to commend the election of His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session and to welcome his excellent proposal for the main subject of the general debate  “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance”. This is also part of Ecuador’s policy of strengthening multilateralism. To that end  we have continuously encouraged regional integration as the logical response to an ancestral heritage that never kept or defended borders between friendly countries.  The wish for a united South America came to fruition with the establishment of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) as an area for genuine integration aimed  inter alia  at eliminating inequality and strengthening democracy. On 26 November  Ecuador will hand over the pro tempore presidency  which it has held since August of 2009  to our sister country of Guyana. In the same vein  Ecuador has fostered South-South cooperation as a mechanism for development  encouraging cooperation among the legitimate representatives of States parties. We believe that countries must be heard and their requirements and realities addressed  and that cooperation should be a reality over the medium term.  I should stress that one of the most important endeavours developed within this space was the solidarity extended to the sister country of Haiti and its legitimate Government for its reconstruction  to attain the development it yearns for and to strengthen its institutions as it deserves.  I wish to place special emphasis on the importance we accord to the issue of climate change. Ecuador is one of world’s 19 megadiverse countries. Its Amazon forest boasts the Yasuní Park  declared by UNESCO as a world biosphere reserve in 1989. Scientists agree on the unique value of this park  for its extraordinary biodiversity and state of conservation and for the cultural heritage it holds. The park concentrates Amazonia’s highest densities of amphibian  mammal  bird and plant species. Yasuní is also a Pleistocene reserve. There  species were not    10-55122 2  affected by glaciation  which preserved a process of differentiated evolution of new species. Moreover  the Yasuní National Park is the home of two indigenous peoples that have opted to live in voluntary isolation with respect to Western culture: the Tagaeri and the Taromenane. Both belong to the Huaorani culture  possessing age-old wisdom and cultural heritage.  The wealth of the park also extends underground. In Yasuní there are oil resources from which Ecuador could obtain 846 million barrels of heavy crude. Three years ago  the President of Ecuador  the economist Rafael Correa  launched the Yasuní-ITT Initiative before this forum (see A/62/PV.7)  which proposed keeping that oil underground  unexploited. If we fulfil this aspiration  we will prevent the emission of 407 million tons of carbon  the main cause of climate change  and we will leave intact the planet’s richest world biosphere reserve. To do this  we need to raise global awareness and gain the relevant international contribution  equivalent to at least half of the total revenue of $3.6 billion that the State of Ecuador would earn if it were to exploit the oil reserves.  Ecuador is a country that is making major efforts to achieve development. But  as an act of generosity  the people of Ecuador have decided not to receive 50 per cent of the income that this oil would generate  so long as the international community makes the same effort.  The Yasuní Initiative  as President Correa himself has said  is not just symbolic. It is the most important initiative for our country and for the entire planet. It would protect one of the areas richest in biodiversity — perhaps the richest in the world — and there is no doubt that it would contribute to mitigating climate change. The world will be able to assess the way of life of Amazon peoples  in particular that of the most vulnerable among them: the indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation.  We have already created a capital fund administered by the United Nations Development Programme with the participation of the Ecuadorian State  our civil society  and representatives of our fellow contributing countries.  I call upon our brother countries throughout the world  especially the industrialized countries  to support the Yasuní Initiative and  acknowledging the responsibility we all share for climate change  to seek original solutions to a problem that threatens the very survival of the human species. Ancestral Amerindian wisdom teaches us that the Earth was not inherited from our parents; rather  this magical creation is lent to us by our children.  Ecuador has reached its targets related to the Millennium Development Goals  and it continues to promote them  including by setting an example for the international community. However  I wish to state very firmly that the Millennium Development Goals left out a very significant segment of the population and that  soon  they will reveal deficiencies in the social policies of countries. I am speaking here of the excluded among the excluded  the forgotten among the forgotten. I am referring to people with disabilities.  Let us be clear: disability is not incapacity  but rather diversity. As there is geographical  cultural or bioclimatic diversity  there are also diverse capacities  and that is where talent  heart  dedication  perseverance and willingness lie. Ecuador has undertaken a bio-psychosocial  clinical and genetic study of all persons with disabilities in the country. We never in our wildest dreams imagined what we would find in that study: human beings left in holes in the ground  in cages  with silence as their only company and death as their only hope  human beings ashamed and shaming others.  That situation no longer exists in Ecuador. Although much remains to be done  we have already accomplished much. As of now  we can locate via satellite every person with disabilities in Ecuador who needs help and provide them with the technical assistance they need  accessible and dignified housing  medical care  rehabilitation and integration in the workforce and the education system. In addition  we have created a subsidy  equivalent to a minimal living wage  to acknowledge the work and the dedication of those who care for persons with severe physical or mental disabilities.  The expertise of the sister Republic of Cuba played a significant role in the execution of this detailed study. Cuba is perhaps the country that shows the greatest solidarity in Latin America because  when the time to help comes  they do not take into account the fact that they still suffer under the most infamous  illegal and illegitimate blockade in human memory  and which Ecuador condemns with all the energy of a grateful people.   3 10-55122   I must highlight the inescapable urgency of addressing the subject of human migration. Allow me to make an appeal to all countries  especially developed ones  to sign the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families  which was opened for signature 20 years ago: 20 years ago. What  I ask myself  are we not one single race? Have we not similar problems?  I also ask myself: do we not share the same evolution? Do we not have the same hopes for the future? Let us share the realization of the dream of universal citizenship. Let human beings travel wherever they want  whenever they want  as they do when they are at home and among family  and as should be the case around the world.  I want to reiterate the Ecuadorian position condemning all forms of colonialism and occupation of territories by foreign forces. We reaffirm that dialogue must always be the mechanism of choice for the settlement of conflicts.  We believe in the sovereign right of all countries to development and to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. We want a world without nuclear weapons. We therefore recommend preaching by example. I will repeat that: we want a world without nuclear weapons  but our approach is to preach by example  so that that which we demand from others also becomes first and foremost a requirement for ourselves. I call for a definitive decision. Let us dismantle nuclear arsenals  so that just as we criminalize the manufacturing and marketing of illegal drugs  we would also criminalize the manufacturing and marketing of weapons of mass destruction — and if only that could be done for all weapons.  There can be no world governance without peace. Nature is the best teacher of peace. I was born in the Ecuadorian Amazon basin. We call Earth our Pacha Mama. She and we are the same. The travelling poet Walt Whitman said  referring to all human beings  to all other beings on Earth and to the Earth itself  “every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you” (Song of Myself). We are made of the same atoms  which we share. We come from dust  we whirl around for some time and then we return to dust  to our Pacha Mama  to Mother Nature. But she has been abused and disrespected. Even so  in her agony  she is still generous. Rabindranath Tagore said that the Earth has been insulted and reviled  but in return offers her flowers and her fruits.  I call on Member States  our brother countries  to share this revolutionary vision  to find peace and to make it everlasting  to change the history of the invaded  the polluted  the humiliated and the forgotten of the Earth.  Let us create an army of warriors that carry no weapons on their shoulders or ammunition in their packs  but whose weapons are ecology  medicine  the defence of human rights and human solidarity  an army that fights the only disability that truly exists  which is the human disability. The only disability that exists is that of the heart. The enemy is inequality  which  although fierce  will be defeated. We will succeed  of course. Of course we will succeed."
"51",2158,"EGY",65,2010,"The beginning of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly coincides with the preparations of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)  chaired by my country  to celebrate 50 years of achievements. During those years  the Movement has greatly helped to reinforce international and multilateral action under changing regional and international circumstances. The Movement’s work over those years has demonstrated the ability of developing countries to contribute effectively to the maintenance of international peace and security  make progress in development  and promote human rights  basic freedoms and the furtherance of good governance at the international level.   37 10-55103   This week’s NAM ministerial meeting represents the point of departure for a major celebration  to be hosted by Indonesia in April or May 2011. The meeting will chart a clear and integrated future course  drawing on past achievements as an impetus for future endeavours. It will define the elements of the Movement’s future commitment to greater openness towards and interaction with the international community  in the context of fairness and mutual interest  to ensure that the aspirations and hopes of our countries and peoples are met.  Egypt appreciates the main theme that the President proposed for discussion at this session. Global governance touches on many political  economic and social issues. Egypt believes that the elected organs of the United Nations should handle the principal tasks in that area. We must all ensure that the United Nations discharges such roles effectively and wisely.  In the political field  for example  it is no longer acceptable for permanent membership of the Security Council  the main organ entrusted with maintaining international peace and security  to continue to operate under obsolete rules of an era long past. Similarly  it is unacceptable for the work of the Council or its mechanisms to continue to be characterized by a lack of transparency or balance.  A serious approach to current historic challenges requires more balanced  conscious and responsible management of this core issue. The Security Council has made numerous grave mistakes  resulting in the loss of innocent lives. Many resolutions that have been blocked by the Council would have corrected the disparities  returned rights to victims and restored the confidence of world public opinion in the Council’s performance and impartiality.  Turning to the economic sphere  we note that the United Nations  and even the key Bretton Woods international financial institutions  no longer lead in managing the top international economic issues. Other international bodies are now beginning to assume that role.  At its summit last year  the Group of 20 declared itself the forum to coordinate global economic policy. Such a development prompts us to be cautious of its repercussions  since that forum or any other assuming such a responsibility should have the geographical representation necessary to ensure the fair airing of all trends and approaches prevailing in the international community. It must also ensure fair participation in formulating policy and in providing a balanced approach to current challenges. Marginalization is no longer acceptable. Countries of the South have rights and must have a voice and participate in any forum that deals with the international situation.  Egypt will continue its tireless work to achieve the wider and more balanced participation of the developing world in international economic decision-making. Our world has experienced successive years of poor economic performance and stubborn crises. That has aggravated the current inequities and heightened the challenges faced by all countries  developing countries in particular. It requires us all to support coordinated and joint action to address the shortcomings and inequities and to achieve sustainable and balanced global growth.  In that context  we welcome the outcome of the recent High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals  at which the delegation of Egypt expressed its view on the Goals and the extent to which we will be able to achieve them. We hope that the conclusions of the summit will provide us with the necessary momentum to speed up the achievement of the Goals ahead of the final review in 2015.  The fact that Egypt is part of the Islamic world is common knowledge. We feel the pain of Muslims wherever they are. We share their joys and celebrations; we grieve with them and we feel their pain. There is no doubt that regrettable and appalling incidents against Muslims and Islam are increasingly frequent  and systematic in certain cases. They have ranged from attacks on the symbols and sanctities of the faith to the harassment of Muslims. In general  we find the West being drawn into a clash with the Muslim world. Such a clash would serve no one except extremists and those who hold perverse ideas on both sides. It would not be in the interest of security and stability in the world. It would not be in the interests of moderates. In such a clash  the winner is a loser and the victor is defeated.  Need I remind this gathering of the need for coordinated action among the influential advocates of religious  civilizational and cultural moderation in order to eliminate the threat before it becomes more ominous and destroys much of everything? We can no    10-55103 38  longer accept pretexts to condone practices against Islam and its followers — such as the right to freedom of expression — which are surprisingly naïve  excessive in essence and offensive in nature.  Egypt will continue to do its utmost at the political  cultural and religious levels to address such threats. We call on all countries  in particular Governments  to play their part in highlighting the potential horror of a terrible clash of faiths and civilizations. We call on them to spread a culture of enlightenment based on tolerance  respect for differences and the renunciation of fanaticism  hatred and zealotry. Laws must be enacted to protect minorities and their beliefs from the aggression of extremists and promoters of strife.  With regard to matters of international peace and security  disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are priorities on Egypt’s agenda. Only a few months ago  the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons successfully concluded its work. It adopted an important document on the Middle East that included an action plan and measures to implement the 1995 resolution on the Middle East. Egypt will closely follow all steps taken to implement that plan  including the serious preparations for the 2012 conference.  Once again  let me reiterate Egypt’s position that adopting double standards on the question of non-proliferation will result in a continued threat to world stability. In the Middle East particularly  we note increasing efforts to add to the commitments of non-nuclear-weapon States that are signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  while the need for the Treaty to become universal in our region and for all nuclear installations in the Middle East to be subjected to the comprehensive safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency is disregarded. This uncomfortable situation is a source of concern to us. We will work with all like-minded parties to address and redress this situation in relevant international forums.  Year after year  we return to the United Nations to debate the question of Palestine and the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict. Every year  our words swing between the hope for a complete but unrealized breakthrough  and the fear of a deterioration and an explosion that would compound the pain and suffering of the Palestinian people and aggravate the dangers of overreaching extremism  militancy and violence faced by our region.  This year is no different. It is true that there is hope in the wake of the start of direct negotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli sides; however  chances for success remain slim. Despite the agony of the road to negotiations  Egypt believes that their relaunch may represent an important opportunity that should not be squandered.  It is important for the Israeli side to realize that negotiations are not an end in themselves. They are neither a game nor a waste of time. A serious approach must be the basis and distinguishing mark of the negotiating process. Without the required seriousness and credibility  the process will soon lose the little support it enjoys from the public on both sides. Egypt believes that these negotiations should seek to end the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and the implementation of the two-State solution through the establishment of an independent Palestinian State  with East Jerusalem as its capital and its borders based on the lines of 1967  as has been confirmed by the United States  the sponsor of the negotiations  and the international Quartet on all occasions and mentioned by President Obama a few days ago.  During the first round of negotiations in Washington  D.C.  and later in Sharm el-Sheikh  we heard Israel’s assurances of its commitment to the required seriousness. Therefore  we call on the Israeli side to take the difficult and necessary decisions  as President Mubarak said two days ago  to achieve a just political settlement that would allow the peoples and countries of the region to transcend decades of conflict  victimization and wasted resources.  There is no doubt that a freeze in Israeli settlement activity in the occupied Palestinian territories has become a major factor in determining the intentions of the Israeli side and its level of commitment to the success of the negotiations. Should Israel fail in its commitment to prolong the moratorium on its settlement activities  it would expose the negotiation process to collapse and bear full responsibility before regional and world public opinion  as well as the sponsor  for wasting a valuable opportunity afforded by a major United States effort. Israel would also bear responsibility for any negative consequences. Were Israel to pass this test  we would look forward to a quick resolution by both parties of   39 10-55103  the question of borders between them. The solutions in this respect are known to all. Settling the matter of borders would enable us to take important steps towards settling the conflict as a whole.  Egypt also supports any serious effort to resume direct negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks in a way that would allow both countries to regain their occupied territories and consequently reach a comprehensive peace  implement the Arab Peace Initiative and end the Arab-Israeli conflict once and for all.  Brotherly Sudan is currently facing the most difficult juncture since its independence. In addition to developments in Darfur  the referendum on self-determination for Southern Sudan is drawing near. Egypt follows this situation with the greatest interest  given our common border with that country. Our interest is based not only on the close brotherly relations between our two peoples  but also on our anticipation of any possible consequences of the referendum. Egypt will pursue its efforts to preserve the unity of the Sudan as long as that is the choice of the majority in that country. But if the wish of the Southern Sudanese  who are also our brothers  were any different  Egypt would respect the outcome and work with all parties in the interests of development and stability.  The security of the Arab Gulf is one of Egypt’s major concerns and foreign policy priorities. Apart from our age-old relations  Egypt understands that it is of strategic importance for its Arab brethren in the Gulf. Egypt will therefore continue to work with the Gulf Cooperation Council countries for the maintenance of Arab national security in the region and to ensure that any security arrangements reached are in consonance with the requirements and concerns of Arab countries.  Egypt affirms the urgent need to reach a political settlement on the Iranian nuclear issue  especially since its dangerous escalation would threaten an eruption of the situation that could endanger peace and stability in that vital region of the world. While it is true that threats against a State member of the Organization of the Islamic Conference are not acceptable  we nevertheless ask Iran to refrain from any measure that could exacerbate the situation in the region  and specifically in the Gulf area  and lead to a confrontation with different forces in the international community. All parties must adhere to negotiations as a way to a peaceful  political settlement of this issue. Such a settlement would guarantee Iran’s legitimate right to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and enable the international community to verify that Iran is in compliance with its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. No evidence has yet been seen to suggest otherwise.  The southern strait of the Red Sea is an area of strategic importance for Egypt. It leads to the Suez Canal  a vital waterway at the centre of the world. Securing this critically important area is at the heart of Egyptian interests. On that basis  Egypt has participated extensively in all international efforts to combat piracy off the Somali coast and in the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. Egypt has also provided support to some countries of the region in areas such as the development of coast guard capacity  raising awareness about the prevention of piracy  and the implementation of a media and communications strategy to combat piracy. In the same vein  continued fratricidal fighting in Somalia has consequences for stability in the Horn of Africa and  as such  remains a source of concern to us.  Egypt is pursuing its efforts  including in outreach  to further raise international interest in Somalia with a view to achieving a ceasefire and proceeding to a comprehensive and peaceful political settlement. Such a settlement will be conditional on the existence of the political will of the Somali parties to achieve peace and on the commitment of external parties to refrain from interfering in Somali affairs while seriously participating in efforts to achieve a political settlement.  In conclusion  Egypt is a country of many civilizations  features and characteristic  from its Arab nationalist to its deep-rooted Islamic and Coptic identities  and from the genuine African to the historical Mediterranean. All have intermingled over the years and left their mark on Egypt’s foreign policy. All these influences define our overlapping interests and guide our thinking and action in addressing problems and crises.  Egypt will continue to work for the achievement of peace and stability in the Middle East and the world. It will do its utmost for the well-being of its people  nation and region. We will continue the struggle for balanced and sustainable development. We will also    10-55103 40  pursue our serious work for the benefit of the countries of the South.  Our delegation looks forward to working with Members in a spirit of openness to ensure the successful outcome of this session. We extend our hand to all countries  with an open mind and a sincere desire to achieve the international agenda before us. "
"52",2182,"ERI",65,2010,"Let me start by extending my sincere congratulations to you  Mr. President  and your country  Switzerland  for your election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I am confident that with your extensive experience and diplomatic skill  you will lead this session to a successful conclusion. I pledge the support of the Eritrean delegation in your noble efforts for the common good. I wish also to commend your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  President of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  for his excellent leadership. He indeed served us well. I would also like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki moon for his leadership and his report on the work of our United Nations at the outset of this general debate (see ).  We meet again  at this sixty-fifth session of the Assembly  to expound on the state of our individual countries and to reflect on regional  continental and global affairs. We come to this gathering year after year to share our thoughts and explain our positions on some issues of interest. Yet we realize that the outcome of our deliberations and resolutions falls far short of our own expectations  let alone the aspirations of humanity. We agree that the institutions and procedures of this Organization have long outlived their time  and yet we remain paralysed in our efforts to transform the United Nations.  While the prospects for a rapid reform of the United Nations system appear to be dim  we cannot and will not give up. We have to continue to speak out and work tirelessly for a United Nations that is fit for the twenty-first century and for a more just and equitable world. At the same time  we have to focus on our own nations and regions to ensure a peaceful and stable environment and a dignified life for our peoples. It is that perspective that informs Eritrea’s policies at the national  regional and international levels.  Internationally  Eritrea seeks  through robust and constructive engagement  to make its modest contribution to global peace  security  justice and equity and to the protection and enhancement of the environment in the face of changes that threaten the very survival of humanity.  Regionally  Eritrea’s efforts are directed at securing peace  stability  development and cooperation in the wider Horn of Africa and the Red Sea regions. We endeavour to contribute to transforming our dangerous neighbourhood  a neighbourhood mired in numerous conflicts  into a cooperative and peaceful region. In that connection  I wish to touch upon some of Eritrea’s immediate concerns.  In regard to the Sudan  Eritrea is working closely with the Sudanese parties and with regional and international actors as the country enters a critical period in its history. Eritrea believes that the international community as a whole needs to wholeheartedly support the parties to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement as they approach the momentous referendum date in January 2011  and beyond. Irrespective of the outcome of the referendum  relations of trust and cooperation between the parties are crucial for peace and stability  not only in the north and south  but throughout the region. For all those reasons  we ought to encourage the parties to reach agreement on the post referendum issues and relations as soon as is feasible. There is also a need to simultaneously help the protagonists in the Darfur conflict to finally reach an agreement within the context of the Doha talks that are set to resume in the next few days.  On Somalia  it is Eritrea’s considered view  borne out by the bitter experience and spiralling violence of the past two decades  that there can be no military solution to the problem in Somalia. While that conviction by now is widely shared in the international community  serious doubts continue to be raised as to whether the alternative — that is  a Somali-owned and Somali-driven  inclusive political process — is possible and practicable.  Eritrea does not by any means believe or suggest that that is easy or that it can lead to immediate results. It will undoubtedly be a complex and protracted process  but ultimately achievable. For  even in the past two turbulent decades  Somalis have more than once demonstrated that  given the right environment  they are capable of finding home-grown solutions to their problems. Eritrea therefore urges the United Nations and all those concerned with peace and stability in Somalia to earnestly engage all Somalis and to give the   37 10-55264  political process the serious and sustained attention it deserves.  I turn next to the matter of Eritrea and Ethiopia. While the United Nations grapples with the Sudan and Somalia  it continues to ignore the grave consequences of Ethiopia’s continued occupation of sovereign Eritrean territory  eight years after the ruling of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission and three years after the Commission ended its work by depositing with the United Nations the demarcation of the boundary between the two countries.  Ethiopia’s illegal occupation and the United Nations silence  which mean the continuation of the conflict  are exacting a heavy price on the peoples of Eritrea and Ethiopia and are complicating the regional situation. I wish to remind the United Nations that Eritrea awaits responsible and urgent action to end Ethiopia’s violation of international law and its threat to regional peace and security.  Eritrea’s constructive engagement on regional and international matters stems from its firm conviction that a conducive external environment is essential for nation-building. As Eritrea enters its twentieth year of independence  it remains focused on broad-based and people-centred political  economic  social and cultural development that will afford a life of dignity and prosperity to our people. After several years of consistent investments in health  education  agriculture and other essential infrastructure  we have created a solid basis for sustained economic growth. It is expected that trade and domestic and foreign investment will provide additional impetus for the growth of our economy. I wish to seize this opportunity to extend an invitation to all interested countries and their enterprises to become our partners in development."
"53",2228,"ESP",65,2010,"May my first words be to congratulate the newly appointed President of the Assembly  Mr. Joseph Deiss  to whom I wish great success in his conduct of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly.  September is an important month in the agenda of international politics since the middle of the last century because it marks the beginning of the new session of the United Nations General Assembly  which has the city of New York as its backdrop.  Far removed is the San Francisco Conference  which turned the page on global conflicts and opened the way for international cooperation by establishing a new Organization  the United Nations  an Organization geared towards promoting peace  justice and a better    10-55109 20  life for all humankind. Far removed  as well  are the times of the Bretton Woods Agreements  which established free trade rules for commercial and financial relations among the most industrialized nations of the world in order to achieve peace.  In the first decade of this century we witnessed events that have shaped the future of international relations and caused a new world to emerge  as we saw in New York in the month of September. On 11 September 2001  the cities of New York and Washington suffered terrorist attacks that stunned the world and were among the most traumatic in the history of the West. In September 2008  New York was the centre and focus of a panic created by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers  while just a few weeks ago  our host city experienced tensions related to intercultural coexistence and saw the relaunching of the most ambitious programme of international cooperation in history  the Millennium Development Goals.  These events mark the true beginning of the twenty-first century  which is unfolding in an environment of accelerated global and interdependent transformation. We are at a historic crossroads where we must promote awareness of the reform of the United Nations system and the establishment of new mechanisms for global governance that modernize the system of international relations  consolidate multilateralism and security  and strengthen global economic recovery  while providing accountable management of growing interculturalism.  Effective multilateralism is the method that will enable us to tackle the challenges of the twenty-first century. It is a method that stems from the efforts of the General Assembly and from the commitment and work of the leaders of the States represented here. It is a method based on respect and understanding in order to build new alliances and common strategies and policies.  On many occasions  we hear speeches that emphasize the incapacities and weaknesses of the United Nations system. But I prefer not to preach classic doom and gloom here; rather  I would acknowledge the work and success of the United Nations as well as its capacity to respond  as seen in its response to the natural disasters suffered by Haiti and Pakistan. The capacity to take action and effectively coordinate the efforts of all countries through a multilateral approach is a path that the international system should continue to follow at this time of great challenges before us.  On 11 September  the concept of security was transformed and expanded. In September 2006  the Member States approved the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  a resolution and annexed Plan of Action (resolution 60/288) which presumed for the first time to define a common strategic approach agreed by all States Members of the United Nations. This strategy was presented by Secretary-General Kofi Annan one year after the brutal and traumatic attacks of 11 March 2004 in Madrid. Since that time  the intensity and number of terrorist attacks have decreased  and we have improved security  although we are far from having won the war against international terrorism.  This year we have also seen very significant advances in the area of security  disarmament and nuclear non proliferation. The new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty makes it possible to reduce by 30 per cent of the nuclear warheads in the United States and Russia and represents the greatest nuclear agreement in 20 years. Last May  189 countries signatories of the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons approved the convening of a conference in 2012 to transform the Middle East into a zone free of weapons of mass destruction.  We are beginning to come out of the worst financial and economic crisis since the 1930s. The negative fallout of this crisis will be felt through time by millions of people  especially in terms of decent employment. Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008  the international financial system has required States and international institutions  such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  to intervene at an unprecedented level in order to maintain worldwide demand and financial markets.  The lack of international regulation helped to bring about the crisis of the financial entities and has required strengthened coordination  making the Group of 20 a new forum for economic governance. The lesson of the crisis is that  for their development  international markets need not only the invisible hand  but also a global regulatory system. That is what we have understood in Europe  where we have adopted measures to harmonize the legislation of member States  so that regulatory authorities would be able to   21 10-55109  exercise both executive and disciplinary powers. Since the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty  Europe is now on a path to cohesiveness in the area of foreign policy and should be seen as a single interlocutor with its own voice in the international community. It should therefore enjoy an appropriate status in the General Assembly.  My Government  the Government of Spain  is in the vanguard of the fight against hunger and poverty. It has proposed in the United Nations  together with other Member States  the creation of a tax on international currency transactions whose proceeds would be used for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. While the Food and Agriculture Organization has provided us with encouraging data — we have seen hunger decrease in the world for the first time — the figure of 925 million hungry people in the world is morally and politically unacceptable.  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon knows that he can count on Spain for the mobilization of efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Indeed  fighting poverty cannot be a casualty of the economic recession because  despite the crisis  it is not material conditions but political will that will be the key to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.  The time has come to take responsibility for combating climate change. To face this challenge  we need to change the way in which we perceive development and economic growth. A greater effort is required to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependency on fossil fuels  and to commit to renewable energy and efficient and responsible consumption. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has created a point of reference to provide us with a regime that defines realistic solutions and responds to our concerns and priorities.  In a few months  we will attend the Climate Change Conference and should be aware of the effort necessary to pave the way to the meeting in Cancún  where the very credibility of the multilateral system will be at stake. The Conference will be successful if we take a realistic approach demonstrating solidarity and generosity towards the most vulnerable States. It should lead us to an ambitious agreement by which States represented in the General Assembly can take ownership of the objectives and verifiable commitments contained therein.  To bring these objectives to fruition  we need the equitable integration of almost half the world’s population — women. The tenth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)  on women and peace and security  should provide us with an opportunity to enhance gender equality in the public arena  in institutions and in the economic  social and cultural spheres. We can and should move ahead with these reforms because there are positive indications that this mandate is dynamic  such as the recent creation of UN Women  led by former President of Chile Michelle Bachelet  whom I congratulate on her appointment as Director of the new entity.  With regard to human rights  Spain is firmly committed to abolishing the death penalty and introduced an initiative to the General Assembly two years ago to that end. The International Commission against the Death Penalty  proposed by Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  will soon be established and begin its work. We believe that capital punishment is an absolute violation of human rights due to its irreversibility  which also makes it the most extreme case of cruel  inhuman and degrading treatment.  My country unequivocally supports peaceful and negotiated solutions to all international conflicts  in accordance with United Nations resolutions. Achieving peace in the Middle East remains a strategic priority for Spain. That is why  on the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the Madrid Conference  we continue to work resolutely to ensure that the process of direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians will finally lead to the two-State solution. The Israeli and Palestinian peoples know they can count on all our support at this time  when various thorny issues related to the conflict are being addressed.  In this regard  I add my voice to the appeal made from this very rostrum by the President of the United States for the moratorium on building in the settlements to be maintained. In order to achieve a lasting  fair and comprehensive peace  it is vital to resolve the issues that relate to Syria and Lebanon and to work within a multilateral framework that creates a genuine global coalition for peace in the Middle East.  We all know that stability in the Western Balkans and the full integration of its countries into the    10-55109 22  European Union is a basic priority for Europe. In 2010  we commemorated the tenth anniversary of the Zagreb Conference. Spain  which held the European Union presidency at the time  convened a high-level meeting in Sarajevo in May that was attended by all actors involved and at which the European Union reaffirmed its commitment to the region’s stability and European future. Recently  the consensus adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 64/298  sponsored by the 27 members of the European Union and Serbia on one of the region’s pending issues showed the willingness of all actors in the international community to achieve the aforementioned objectives.  Spain reiterates its support for the mediation efforts undertaken by the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara  Mr. Christopher Ross. The conflict in that territory must be resolved by mutual agreement among the parties and pursuant to the United Nations resolutions calling for the self-determination of the Saharans.  In our view  Ibero-America is undergoing unprecedented social and political change. At the start of the bicentennial commemorations of the independence of these republics  Spain wishes to join the celebrations by attending the Ibero-American summits and by strengthening its bilateral relations and relations between the European Union and Latin America.  Cuba deserves special mention following the recent decisions taken by Cuban authorities. Embargos and unilateral attitudes that only disappoint new expectations are useless and make no sense.  Africa is clearly one of the most important future challenges to the international community and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Progress achieved in the areas of good governance and democratization on the continent are cause for optimism and should allow it  with international cooperation  to overcome the crises in the Sahel  Somalia or the Great Lakes region. Spain reiterates its firm commitment to Africa.  Coexistence in a globalized world should motivate us to strengthen the instruments for good governance and promote cultural and intercultural diversity  which are among the most pressing challenges of the twenty-first century. International consolidation of the Alliance of Civilizations  as a tool of preventive diplomacy  is now a fact and a resource we must use. More than 100 States  along with 23 international organizations  now belong to the Group of Friends of the Alliance of Civilizations. I take this opportunity to invite those countries that have not yet joined to do so.  In a landscape of international economic crisis  intercultural tensions run the risk of exacerbation. This should impel us to continue working for the respect and understanding of cultures and civilizations in order to counter expressions of hatred  fanaticism  division and confrontation.  The new world requires us to adapt and enlarge the international institutional architecture. As the Spanish philosopher  José Ortega y Gasset said  “men do not live together just because; they do so for the purpose of great undertakings”. Today the United Nations has a great undertaking: to complete the reform of our institutions and lay the foundations for global governance. Together  we can face the challenges and global crises of the twenty-first century and construct an international system that is fairer  more balanced and more sustainable.  Bretton Woods in 1944 and the San Francisco Conference in 1945 were the results of half a century of crises and two world wars. Believe me  we are not doomed to wait another half century to reform and establish new institutions for the twenty-first century. We have already waited a decade  but we cannot continue to wait much longer  because we can feel history breathing down our necks."
"54",2254,"EST",65,2010,"I am pleased to address the General Assembly. This year  I shall focus on three pressing global matters: the progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  promoting peace and security  and humanitarian affairs.  During the first decade of this millennium  the MDGs have triggered a level of global commitment and wide-ranging partnership that the world has never seen before. Along the way  there have been setbacks  of course. One thing  however  is certain — achieving the MDGs is an attainable reality with concrete targets and deadlines.  We have set a clear goal  but we must keep in mind that we shall reach our objective only if we share the weight of responsibility and all of us pull in the same direction. The political will expressed by a majority of stakeholders at the recent MDG summit and in its outcome document (resolution 65/1) needs to be implemented promptly  in accordance with the agreed action agenda. Only five years  after all  remain. Estonia is ready to provide continuous contributions to the success of our common endeavour.  Estonia contributes towards the achievement of the MDGs through focused development cooperation policy and respective activities in our main partner countries  one of which is Afghanistan. Alongside with providing security through the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)  we are carrying out long-term health care and education projects in Helmand province. We also offer our best practices in    10-54965 24  establishing standards of good governance  including the creation of an electronic voting system for the newly elected Parliament.  Estonia supports the transition process  including the gradual transfer of security responsibilities to the Afghan authorities. This process should be term-based and irreversible  and carried out according to the agreement reached at the ISAF meeting in Tallinn last April. Ownership of the process on the part of the Afghan Government is crucial in taking forward the pledge it made at the Kabul Conference with regard to strengthening the electoral framework. This  along with the endorsed reform agenda  demonstrates the Afghans’ desire to develop their nation.  For my country  Estonia  the development of information and communications technology has been a crucial engine of economic development and modernization throughout the past 20 years. This is why our experts advise Governments on information and communications technology solutions in many parts of the world. In cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme and the Open Society Institute  we have established a special academy to assist Governments in developing countries with advice and training in electronic governance and the use of information and communications technology in public services. I am convinced that the more successful we are in reducing the digital divide  the more accelerated and more sustainable overall economic progress will be.  I commend United Nations efforts in paving the way towards a more efficient operational system  especially the long-awaited outcome of the four-year system-wide coherence negotiations. As the implications of gender inequality affect all the Millennium Development Goals  the consensus agreement on establishing the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) will serve as an extra boost for meeting those Goals.  Estonia contributes to the achievement of the Millennium Goals through the respective United Nations agencies  funds and programmes  and we pledge our support to UN Women as well.  Ever since the United Nations Charter was signed  65 years ago  the United Nations has stood for global peace and security. The United Nations peacekeeping budget has increased more than 15-fold since 1991. It is difficult to imagine the situation in major crisis areas  such as the Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  without the active  multifaceted engagement of the United Nations. With its 15 military and 12 political operations  however  the United Nations peacekeeping force is clearly stretched thin. We need further reforms in order to enhance the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations and to encourage regional actors to assume a stronger role. Estonia contributes to the United Nations peacekeeping budget at a voluntarily enhanced rate. We have done this for 10 years now and will continue to do so.  The credibility of the United Nations in the promotion of peace and security depends on the commitment of all Member States. We all share equally the responsibility to apply the principles enshrined in the Charter  including the duty to refrain from any threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.  Estonia reiterates its firm support for the sovereignty  territorial integrity  security and stability of Georgia  on the basis of full adherence to international law. For the peaceful resolution of that drawn-out conflict  it is necessary to continue the Geneva talks in their initial format. Humanitarian issues  in particular ensuring the safe and dignified return of refugees and internally displaced persons  and the question of increased access to the conflict zone  especially for humanitarian workers and international observers  need to be seriously addressed now. Furthermore  the free movement of people living within the internationally recognized borders of Georgia must be ensured.  Without justice  efforts to ensure sustainable peace might easily be wiped out. I would like  therefore  to emphasize the importance of the adoption by consensus of a package of amendments on the crime of aggression by the Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court  held in June 2010. Estonia strongly supports an international criminal justice system in which an independent and effective International Criminal Court plays a central role.  It is also of crucial importance to support the activities of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia during its final years of existence. Estonia is doing its share with respect to the enforcement of sentences.   25 10-54965   Success in confronting the security challenges of the twenty-first century  including cyberthreats  depends on close cooperation among all States and international and regional organizations. Estonia urges broad cross-border and cross-sector capacity-building in protecting critical information infrastructure  the importance of which was highlighted in the report of the high-level panel of experts on information and communication technology (A/55/75). The necessity of closer cooperation among States  between the private sector and civil society  is critical  since during a cyber attack all traditional security measures may be rendered useless. I can assure you that all-encompassing preparedness will pay off when a real crisis strikes.  Estonia remains actively engaged in areas where our contribution can make a difference  particularly in humanitarian affairs and human rights issues. In this context  I would like to draw attention to the tenth anniversary of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women  peace and security  which must be a stepping stone towards further action at the United Nations  regional and national levels. Establishing operational guidelines for the protection of women and girls  strengthening accountability mechanisms and enhancing women’s participation in peace negotiations and post-conflict peacebuilding should be part of these efforts. To this end  Estonia is finalizing a national action plan to enhance our activities. Estonia is a strong and principled advocate of human rights and fundamental freedoms  including the freedom of expression. Estonia supports the strengthening of the Human Rights Council and its capacity to promote and protect human rights around the world. We aspire to join the Human Rights Council in 2012.  Estonia has also continuously increased its contribution to United Nations humanitarian activities  both through work in the field and financially. The United Nations coordination capability was crucial most recently in Pakistan and at the beginning of the year in Haiti  where it saved lives  and where Estonian logistics experts have been supporting United Nations activities on the ground for more than six months now. Our experience has made clear the need for more combined efforts in securing the link between relief efforts and development work.  Estonia is concerned about increasingly frequent violations of humanitarian principles in conflict zones. Alas  humanitarian emblems and flags no longer provide the shield of protection they used to. We must step up our efforts and press for increased security for humanitarian aid workers. After all  it is the responsibility of Governments to ensure the safety and security of humanitarian personnel working on their territory.  The effectiveness of humanitarian aid and upholding good humanitarian principles are other concerns of ours. Advocating these principles was one of the activities Estonia pursued during our recent co-chairmanship of the Good Humanitarian Donorship initiative.  Finally  I would like to underline one simple truth. The United Nations  like any other organization  is only as strong and effective as the political will and commitment of its members. Big or small  we all bear responsibility. As a member of the European Union  Estonia firmly believes that the Treaty of Lisbon fundamentally enhances the ability of the Union to be a significant global actor  securing peace  stability and prosperity for all. With our shared commitment  I expect the vital and prominent role of the United Nations in the global arena to be further reinforced."
"55",2300,"ETH",65,2010,"Allow me  Sir  at the outset  to extend to you my delegation’s warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I would like to assure you of my delegation’s full cooperation in the discharge of your high responsibilities. My delegation would like to register our appreciation to the outgoing President  Mr. Ali Treki  for his able leadership during the sixty-fourth session. We would also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  for his tireless efforts to ensure that the Organization lives up to the purposes and principles set out in its Charter.   Allow me to begin my statement today by reviewing some salient aspects of the political and economic transformation in Ethiopia.   Such a review should of necessity begin with the democratization process in Ethiopia  which is now almost completing its second decade. In the political transformation in Ethiopia over the past two decades  our single-minded focus has been on building institutions of democracy  good governance and the rule of law. The essence of all our endeavours in that regard has been the devolution of power to the people. Our federal democratic order  built on the basis of unity in diversity  has laid the foundation for lasting peace and security. The democratization process that Ethiopia has embarked on is irreversible and is taking deep root at the level of the State and the society at large.  Still  a democratization process in any country is not an end in itself. The whole purpose is to create an environment conducive to bringing about a better life for the people. That inevitably leads me to our economic policy and strategy. Today in our country accelerated development is in full swing  while a democratic culture and its institutional underpinnings are developing at the grass-roots level.   The successful results achieved during the last seven years and the challenges and experience gained in the process of implementing the previous five-year economic plan have helped in the formulation of the next five-year plan — officially called the Growth and Transformation Plan — covering the period of 2011 to 2015. The objective of that plan is to lay the necessary basis for nation-building by creating and strengthening a stable  democratic  developmental State and to achieve the economic and social goals in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).   At the end of the five-year period the net result of all our efforts will be that poverty in our country has been made history. We are confident that by that time our people will celebrate  together with the international community  the end of an era of food insecurity and dependency on food aid. That historic event will give us an opportunity to extend our deep gratitude to all our partners for their assistance in our difficult times. We pledge to redouble our efforts and utilize their assistance for rapid development of our country that will extricate us from food insecurity once and for all.  As regards the Millennium Development Goals  the High-level Plenary Meeting of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly  held here in New York just last week  was timely. The outcome document of that forum (resolution 65/1) should not be just an appeal but a new pact  binding on stakeholders with respect to renewed commitment to ensure that the collective promises made at the dawn of the new millennium are kept. The action agenda designed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 must ensure the mutual responsibility and accountability of all stakeholders.   We in Ethiopia have made substantial progress on all fronts towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. We have taken full charge of our destiny  devised our own strategy and maximized the mobilization of our domestic resources to achieve the MDGs. The results so far have been very encouraging. Over the past seven years  the Ethiopian economy has performed well  having achieved an annual average growth rate of 11.6 per cent. The robust economic growth we have achieved has created the basis for similarly robust growth in social indicators  and hence on progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  Assessing the state of the MDGs today would not be complete without some reflections on Africa from the perspective of economic and social development    10-55396 12  and its organic link to the MDGs. In that connection  I can do no better than to refer to what Mr. Zoellick  President of the World Bank  said at the High-level Plenary Meeting on the MDGs (see A/65/PV.3). The most important point he made was that he believed in Africa and that Africa can be a global pole of growth and attract investment on African terms. That is what we have been saying all along. He also said that one needs to work with developing countries as clients  not as development models from textbooks  and to help them to solve problems  not to test theories. We in Africa know what we can do; we want to know what the rest of the world will do to help us achieve our goals.  The issue of climate change remains among the most critical challenges facing humankind today. Much has been said  from Rio to Kyoto to Copenhagen. What has been promised has thus far resulted in far less than the urgency of the matter merits. We believe that time is running out  and we are concerned that national agendas of zero-sum preferences are overshadowing the real urgency of addressing the matter in an accelerated and coordinated manner. The upcoming Cancún meeting on climate change should be different from its predecessors. It should come up with a legally binding commitment  coupled with the political will  to allocate the necessary resources for adaptation and mitigation efforts  especially for the most vulnerable and exposed countries.  On energy and development  it has always been self-evident that access to energy is key to fighting poverty. It is central to development. Yet  1.4 billion people worldwide are without electricity  80 per cent of whom live in rural areas. Given the urgency of this dire situation  we fully support the goal of universal energy access by 2030  as set by the United Nations.  As the prevalence of conflicts around the world clearly indicates  international cooperation is of paramount importance to complement the efforts of the United Nations in the area of peace and security. In that regard  Ethiopia  as a founding Member of the United Nations  has always been at the forefront in discharging its responsibilities in the area of peace and security. Since the early 1950s  Ethiopia has been an active participant in United Nations peacekeeping operations. At the moment  Ethiopia is among the major troop-contributing countries to United Nations peacekeeping missions.  Among the challenges that the international community faces in the area of peace and security is the scourge of terrorism. Like many other countries  we have been at the receiving end of this problem. We believe that unreserved international cooperation is the only viable way to combat terrorism. Ethiopia will continue to do its level best in that regard.  Any discussion of peace and security on the international scene today will inevitably have to take up the situation in the Horn of Africa. It is regrettable that we still cannot talk about the situation in Somalia with a great deal of optimism. On one hand  the threat of extremism continues unabated in Somalia  as does the danger posed by international terrorist networks and their sponsors to Somalia  and beyond. On the other hand  it is clear that there is little chance for making progress in Somalia until there is harmony and greater seriousness of purpose at the highest level within the Transitional Federal Institutions of Somalia.  The Council of Ministers of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)  which met here in New York on 22 September preceding the mini-summit on Somalia convened by the Secretary-General on 23 September  expressed its regret with regard to differences within the leadership of the Transitional Federal Government. It called upon them to strengthen their cohesion and work together to address the multiple challenges facing the country. Furthermore  the Council of Ministers reaffirmed the Djibouti process as the sole basis for peace and reconciliation in Somalia  expressed concern about the proliferation of initiatives and urged the United Nations and other stakeholders to engage within the region and with IGAD.  With regard to the situation in the Sudan  Ethiopia is of the firm view that conceivably there is no other conflict on the continent today comparable to that of the Sudan. Hence  we believe that success in the Sudan will mean significant success for Africa as a whole. By the same token  failure may entail a serious catastrophe for Africa. That is why the African Union has given its unreserved attention to the issue  as illustrated by the effort of the High-Level Implementation Panel led by former President Thabo Mbeki. We would like to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General for holding a timely high-level meeting on the Sudan here on 24 September. The outcome of the meeting has been encouraging.   13 10-55396   It goes without saying that the referendums in Southern Sudan and Abyei should be held on time and strictly in conformity with the terms of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. However  we believe that  irrespective of the outcome of the referendums and without in any way detracting from the historic significance of that date  the parties should not fix their minds solely on 9 January 2011. The parties ought to recognize that here are several commonalities  interests  bonds and values between the peoples of the Sudan  north and south  that transcend the decision to be taken in January 2011. That is why it is of paramount importance that negotiations on post-referendum issues should be conducted in earnest and with the seriousness of purpose that the issues deserve.  When we talk of security in the Horn of Africa region and the southern Red Sea  we cannot avoid raising our concern once again about the destructive role that the Government of Eritrea has continued to play since independence. We in the IGAD region have time and time again warned the United Nations  as well as the international community  that the Eritrean regime is the principal destabilizer in our subregion  with its utter contempt for international law and the norms of international behaviour.   It is indeed regrettable that the Security Council is not taking the necessary steps to compel Eritrea to live up to what is expected of it under Council resolution 1907 (2009). Despite the sanctions  Eritrea is still the principal architect of the complicated situation in Somalia  through its training  arming and nurturing of extremist elements such as Al-Shabaab and Hizb al-Islam  who are causing havoc in that country today.   That reprehensible conduct on the part of the regime has been by no means isolated or confined to our subregion. On the contrary  it has been standard behaviour for the Eritrean regime  extending far beyond the subregion  to other parts of the continent and sometimes even outside it.  Consistent with its innate character  the regime committed acts of aggression against practically all its neighbours in the space of only a few years after its independence. That is unprecedented for any newly independent State  giving Eritrea the dubious distinction of being an international pariah in the family of nations. Therefore  if we are to achieve a breakthrough in Somalia  the time is long overdue for the Security Council to take resolute action and see to it that its decisions are complied with.   Since its founding more than six decades ago  the United Nations  as the principal global player on the international scene with multifarious responsibilities  has  under the circumstances  lived up to the vision set for it in the Charter. There is no gainsaying the fact that if the United Nations did not exist  we would have had to create it. It is an indispensable Organization  particularly for us in the developing world. However  while underscoring its importance  we should not lose sight of the need for its reform  which is an ongoing process. That is how we can ensure the Organization’s viability. Ethiopia will always be ready to give whatever support is necessary to that end.   When we talk of the United Nations as a global actor  the importance of cooperation between the United Nations and our continental organization  the African Union  need hardly be emphasized. Of particular significance is the ongoing cooperation and consultation between the United Nations Security Council and the African Union Peace and Security Council  in line with the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations. We should continue that cooperation  and Ethiopia will do whatever is necessary in that regard.  In conclusion  let me reiterate  as a founding Member  Ethiopia’s enduring commitment to the ideals of our Organization and the fulfilment of its objectives  as set out in the Charter  which remains a living document and a source of inspiration for the international community."
"56",2346,"FIN",65,2010,"Let me start by congratulating Ambassador Deiss on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I assure him of Finland’s full support for his leadership.  Climate issues and the recent financial  economic and food crises call for change. The world needs an understanding of global development that is economically  socially and environmentally sustainable. Both developing and developed countries wish for economic growth. But the growth needs to be green  equitable and inclusive. It must create jobs and promote opportunities for decent work and a better life for everyone.  Basic social protection is everyone’s right and an important element of sustainable development. But the most vulnerable need our special attention. We need to do much more to combat discrimination and exclusion.  Current consumption and production patterns need to be revised in many countries. In the words of Mahatma Gandhi  there is enough in the world for everyone’s need  but there cannot be enough for everybody’s greed. Our stocktaking of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) showed that there has been progress but that it remains uneven. We agreed to redouble our efforts. The MDGs must become part of our everyday work  and we all need to deliver on our commitments. The Millennium Development Goals are reachable by the year 2015. What we want  we can reach.  Our common work with the ecological welfare of the world has continued. Promoting biodiversity is vital for sustaining the ecosystems that our lives depend on. Preventing the loss of biodiversity is of great importance for climate change mitigation  ensuring food and water security and eradicating poverty. The high-level meeting as a contribution to the   17 10-54959  International Year of Biodiversity  confirming our commitment to that goal  was a good step forward.  The impacts of climate change are more and more visible and affect us all around the globe. Today I want to focus on the special needs and vulnerabilities of small island developing States and the implementation of the Mauritius Strategy. Climate change is a hard reality for them. Mitigating and adapting to its effects is crucial for their survival.  Finland is committed to a new  ambitious climate agreement. All of us must work hard to ensure a global deal and commit to building a sustainable future  thus responding to what the Secretary-General so pertinently calls the 50-50-50 challenge. In order to reach our goals  we must mobilize all available resources. Cooperation to tackle climate change must involve States  non-governmental organizations  the private sector and all of our fellow global citizens.   Lasting solutions to global challenges cannot be found without the active participation of women in decision-making at all levels. Women are agents of change and development. Investing in women and girls has a vital effect on the eradication of poverty and sustained economic growth. Having heard the discussions this week  I am happy to conclude that there has clearly been a breakthrough in this respect. I could even call it mainstreaming. This is a good basis to continue from. Women and men together can achieve truly sustainable development.  The United Nations has to lead global efforts to promote a new blueprint for sustainable growth and low-carbon prosperity. I am honoured to co-chair the Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Global Sustainability together with my colleague  President Jacob Zuma of South Africa. We will  I promise  work hard.  All human rights are equally important and must be enjoyed by everyone without discrimination. The protection and promotion of human rights must be an integral part of peacebuilding and crisis management.   In combating impunity  justice must always go hand in hand with peace efforts. Finland firmly supports the International Criminal Court in its work in bringing to justice those responsible for the most serious crimes. We call on all States parties to the Rome Statute to uphold their international legal obligations under the Statute.  The Human Rights Council was created in 2006 to promote the respect for human rights  and its functioning will now be reviewed. To achieve tangible results  the Human Rights Council needs effective tools. The independent thematic country-specific mandates continue to be vital in order to achieve the full implementation of human rights for all.  The commitment of all the United Nations Member States to strengthen the promotion of women’s rights  gender equality and gender mainstreaming is welcome. Finland strongly supports the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) and would like to congratulate President Michelle Bachelet on her appointment. We must ensure that UN Women becomes a strong advocate and actor for women’s rights throughout the work of the United Nations.  This year marks the tenth anniversary of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)  on women and peace and security. Concrete improvements have been made  but we must step up our efforts to further turn the objectives into practice. National action plans are valuable tools for implementing the resolution. Finland completed its own plan in 2008  and we have now started a twinning initiative with Kenya.  We need a comprehensive approach which integrates both long-term development programmes and conflict resolution. In our common efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts  the contribution of regional organizations is valuable. Civil society can also play a role. Finland supports the development of the peace mediation activities of the United Nations.  After several rounds of proximity talks in the Middle East  the parties started direct talks in September. The international community has welcomed this wise decision. We now stand ready to give our support whenever needed. Finland is greatly encouraged by the New START agreement and by the outcomes of the Nuclear Security Summit  held in Washington  and the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The world community must seize the moment. Global and bilateral efforts must be continued towards a world without nuclear weapons.    10-54959 18   The United Nations remains the only forum where we can solve our common problems together. Therefore  we must continue to reform our Organization and increase its effectiveness without forgetting our own responsibilities as Member States. This is absolutely necessary  because we need to tackle the food crisis  the financial crisis  various kinds of natural disasters  contagious diseases  terrorism and armed conflicts in different parts of the world  as well as meeting our common challenge of climate change.  Combating everyday crises and working  at the same time  for sustainable development is a huge task. But no other choice has been given to us. That is why we have to combine our efforts for a better world — and do it now."
"57",2390,"FJI",65,2010,"I extend to you  Sir  and to this august Assembly warm greetings from the Government and people of Fiji. May I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly’s sixty-fifth session and to pay tribute to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Treki.  As I highlighted last year in my address (see A/64/PV.10)  Fiji and her people  through the Strategic Framework for Change  have embarked on a path of structural reform to modernize and liberalize our economy in line with today’s global environment. As part of this agenda  the Fiji Government has revamped its foreign policy. Our new foreign policy direction stems from the philosophical basis that  while we determine our own destinies as sovereign States  we must at the same time work in collaboration with all Member States towards sustainable world peace  substantive justice  dignity and respect for all.  However  we cannot achieve these objectives or actually implement these noble principles if we simply rely on predetermined political influences or predetermined alignments. We must be prepared to expand the range of our international relationships and not simply subscribe to bloc voting. We must assess and decide each issue on its merits. We must decide each matter based on equality  substantive justice and international law. We must keep an open mind. This    10-55122 22  approach will result in the manifestation of a fairer and more just system for all Fiji’s citizens.  This significant shift in foreign policy direction heralds Fiji’s globalization and maturity and demonstrates Fiji’s intention to become a good and engaged global citizen. Accordingly  over the past year Fiji has formalized diplomatic relations with many countries with which no ties previously existed. In addition  Fiji has sought membership of the Non-Aligned Movement. The broadening of our engagement with the rest of the world was given further impetus in Abu Dhabi in June  when  at the Arab League’s invitation  a summit was held between the Pacific small island developing States and the member countries of the League which was hosted by the United Arab Emirates.  This commitment to be a good global citizen is further expressed through Fiji’s ongoing engagement with the United Nations and its associated agencies and secretariats. There is no better example of this engagement than Fiji’s long-term contribution to the cause of United Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding. Fijian servicemen and women currently serve in peacekeeping missions in Iraq  southern Sudan  Liberia  Darfur and Timor-Leste. I offer my country’s tribute to the selfless service given by United Nations peacekeepers and peacebuilders  past and present  in the troubled regions of our world. We pay special tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to the cause of peacekeeping.  On the subject of peace and security  Fiji is proud to have been among the Member States that in 2006 voted in favour of preparations for a robust and legally binding arms trade treaty in 2012. We remain committed to the work of the United Nations to curb the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. Fiji has ratified the Convention on Cluster Munitions and regards this instrument as a welcome development for humanitarianism and international disarmament. It also remains fully committed to international efforts against terrorism.  With respect to resolving the world’s territorial and sovereignty disputes  Fiji stands firm with all international efforts aimed at peaceful resolution through a process of genuine dialogue. It welcomes the recent resumption of direct negotiations between the leaders of Israel and Palestine and hopes for a successful outcome.  Fiji is an active member of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee). Following our participation in the ministerial mission of the Melanesian Spearhead Group to New Caledonia this year  Fiji sponsored the Fourth Committee’s 2010 resolution on New Caledonia. We urge all concerned parties to accelerate the progress of the provisions of the Nouméa Accord.  Over the past year  the Fiji Government has implemented a number of legal changes that have not only modernized our laws and brought about gender and social parity  but have also ensured compliance with international conventions. These changes include the Crimes Decree  which eliminated the archaic rules in respect of rape trials. We have implemented for the first time a comprehensive law against domestic violence to comply with our international obligation to protect the welfare of women and children. We now have child welfare laws which require the reporting of violence against children or suspicion of abuse of minors. These and other new laws assist in our compliance with the Rome Statute by recognizing crimes against humanity and incorporating them into our domestic laws. Fiji was also present in June at the Review Conference of the Rome Statute held in Uganda and is of course supportive of the work of the International Criminal Court. Reforms in our laws and outlook have helped us comply with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. They also support our efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  I would like to reaffirm the critical points made at last week’s MDG Summit and at the high-level review of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. I make these points as one of the United Nations Members classified as a small island developing State. In spite of their considerable domestic efforts in cooperation with the international community  the small island developing States (SIDS) have had very mixed results in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Going forward  we and our development partners must examine where gains have been made and where efforts have been unsuccessful and identify country-specific priorities in order to achieve the MDGs.   23 10-55122   The threat of climate change  particularly sea-level rise  continues to hang over us all. While some of us are more vulnerable than others  we must work in concert as a responsible international family to mitigate the adverse effects of this global phenomenon. In this context  I reiterate the common call of the small island developing States: that the promised fast-track funding from the international community to finance climate change adaptation and mitigation measures be delivered without delay.  Through the Pacific small island developing States  Fiji pledges to assist in securing increased representation of the Pacific island countries in the United Nations system. The aim is to also increase employment of Pacific Island nationals within the United Nations Secretariat and its affiliated bodies.  Here  I should add that Fiji is playing a prominent role in the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). I note that only a few days ago the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  accepted a report on digitalization  including accessibility to broadband. In this area Fiji has also embarked on its own initiative for accessibility to and improvement in  telecommunications and information technology. This includes the process of finalizing a national policy on broadband and spectrum management. We therefore appreciate the Secretary-General’s initiative in this respect and urge him to carefully consider the report and provide impetus at the global level through the United Nations. Improved technology and e-access will provide that trajectory in meeting the MDGs and improving the lives of all our peoples.  As one of the founding signatories of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  Fiji has kept its oceanic obligations at the core of its foreign policy. Fiji therefore follows  and also expects fellow Member States to adhere to  the legal regime of the exclusive economic zone that encompasses sovereign rights.  Since it is the Year of Biodiversity  we call on the International Seabed Authority to be vigilant in safeguarding the environmental integrity of the world’s seabed. Within this context  one of the great challenges for Pacific small island developing States is to be effective in conserving the Pacific Ocean’s fish stocks. They are critical to our livelihoods  our economies. Countries that overexploit these fish stocks must be informed that the practice is unsustainable. As owners  investors and harvesters  we should follow and adhere to international law and chart a path to sustain stocks for the benefit of all.  What I say today is that we must recognize that meaningful dialogue is essential — within our respective countries  within our respective regions and in the world as a whole. Seeking to achieve resolutions and solutions through dialogue is the way forward. In the true spirit of international cooperation  we must at all times  as sovereign States in our community of nations  develop and maintain relationships based on respect  dignity and equality. We must also decide on issues and matters before this august Assembly based on merit  justice and international law.  Once again  I congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election and offer my best wishes for a productive sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly."
"58",2437,"FRA",65,2010,"I come to this rostrum on behalf of France to express my sincere and fervent faith in the United Nations. France’s ambition is to be a major actor in building a system of global governance that is more just  more cohesive  more social  and a global order that is organized and regulated around a stronger  more representative and more effective United Nations — a United Nations capable of meeting the great challenges of our century.  I look out upon the Assembly. I know many of those present here today. For 25 years now — even more — I have been going up and down the corridors of the United Nations because I like the United Nations  because I believe in the United Nations  and because I know it to be indispensable.  I would like to speak to the Assembly candidly. I am going to talk about men and women  suffering and hope. I am going to talk about responsibility  because we have responsibilities as citizens  diplomats and political leaders to meet these sufferings  hopes and expectations.  Of course  all of us would have an infinite number of reasons to present a litany of generous intentions  only to go home  our conscience clear  for what we had said a little while before to the Assembly and then go back to our day-to-day problems at home. Of course  after the terrible economic crisis from which we have barely emerged  we have to live with reduced budgets and tense socio-economic situations. The times are difficult and our fellow citizens are worried. The temptation to retreat exists. Of course  to correct the large imbalances and injustices that undermine our society and to fight for the planet’s security and development  we can always count on others. But which others? There are no “others”. We are all here  the nations of the world  represented in the General Assembly  and we only have to decide together to act.  Not acting today would be to resign ourselves to disorder  injustice and chaos. That choice will never be France’s because it is not in keeping with our history  or our values  or our interests. Faced with disorder in the world  the greatest risk today would be to lapse into routine. Please do not tell me that we cannot move forward  that the situation is at an impasse. No  in the past  we have been able together  collectively  to be revolutionary on fundamental subjects  even at the expense of the national sovereignties which we all represent here.  Recall our boldness here in 1988  General Assembly resolution 43/131  and then two years later  resolution 45/100  on humanitarian assistance to victims of natural disasters and similar emergency situations. These resolutions allowed us for the first time to guarantee free access of humanitarian workers to the affected regions. Then there was Security Council 688 (1991) (5 April 1991) on the situation in Kurdistan  where  for the first time  the door was opened to a military operation to protect civilian populations against an oppressor State.  These were two historic moments which laid the first markers of the right to intervene. This became the responsibility to protect  which this Assembly adopted by consensus at the 2005 World Summit (see resolution 60/1). Who could have imagined that such an upending of international law would be possible? The fight was long and difficult; it is not over — far from it. To speak candidly to the Assembly  the results are not completely what I had expected. But we must note that  together  we were able to overcome some obstacles which were supposed to be insurmountable. Let nothing stop us from taking up subjects which we decide on together.  Our first shared responsibility is development — to make sure that all men and women  including the most impoverished  have decent living conditions. The widening gap of inequalities is not only morally unacceptable  it is politically dangerous. Of course  it is costly to act  but the cost of inaction is even greater.  The conclusions of the High-level Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that we just held place our responsibilities squarely before us. This   37 10-55122  is an urgent matter. We can no longer ask suffering populations to continue to wait.  The President of the French Republic  Nicolas Sarkozy  reminded the Assembly of this fact  that France is the second largest global donor of official development assistance — €9 billion per annum — targeted to education  health  food security  sanitation and infrastructure. France’s commitment to development will not slacken  but figures do not make a policy. Our assistance must be judged according to its results. We need to go further and move faster for children dying of malaria — one every 30 seconds — for entire families stricken by AIDS  and for all those who are hungry or cannot go to school.  I ask the Assembly: what planet do we wish to leave as a legacy to our children? Will we be able to make an ambitious decision to combat climate change and preserve our environment? This is a subject that concerns us all and requires a global partnership  one where we aspire to find an agreement on both reducing emissions and measures to be taken in order to adapt. And we must  first and foremost  ensure that the commitments undertaken will be implemented and that follow-up mechanisms and effective institutions will be put in place.  For all of this  we must find a great deal of money — several tens of billions of dollars per year — for us and our planet. Let us provide the means to realize our ambitions. The solutions are here  within reach; they have proved to be effective and await only our political will and our courage. They are called innovative financing. The tax on airline tickets was a step forward  a long time in coming. Today we should go farther by adopting an international tax on financial transactions which would permanently change matters for development. It is an idea that I have been defending for more than 20 years. It is a priority for France now. The President alluded to it here a few days ago.  Bear in mind that a minute tax of 0.005 per cent  that is five cents on a transaction of €1 000  could raise €30 billion to €40 billion per year  almost one quarter of official development assistance. Who could deny that this is a stable and predictable way of raising a massive amount for development? Even with half of that amount  it would be possible to send every child to school in the low-income countries. Everyone agrees today that it is technically and economically feasible to establish such a mechanism.  And  make no mistake; we are not talking about diminishing official development assistance or dodging our responsibilities. No  on the contrary  this amount would come as an addition. And so we must not waste time  we are together  this is what we established this institution for  this institution  unparalleled in history  called the United Nations.  It is now a universally recognized principle that development cannot occur without peace and security  which are the basic raison d’être of the United Nations. Here  the challenges remain considerable. Afghanistan  Somalia  the Sudan  the Middle East — so many conflicts continue to feed chaos throughout the world.  How many missed opportunities  how many dashed hopes  how many misunderstandings have for more than 60 years — I repeat  60 years — marked this process  peaceful in name only  in the Middle East? The Arab-Israeli conflict concerns us all. I say Arab-Israeli because  besides the Palestinian track  France considers it just as important to work on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks. Today we have before us a historic opportunity. We cannot let it slip.  The process almost stopped yesterday evening. I am not sure that it will continue in an orderly way and with unanimous support. I hope it will. We have limited time remaining. Palestine  the new State Member of the United Nations which many of us have been calling for  will be  I hope  the best guarantee of security for Israel.  All States in the region have a critical role to play. All of that is important  but what is necessary is that the Israelis and Palestinians make a strategic decision to put an end to this conflict in their own interests. I would therefore call on the sense of responsibility of President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu; together they must make the painful compromises on the road to peace.  I have said that I have faith in the United Nations. I served the United Nations  as perhaps you know  in Kosovo and in a number of other places. I know  respect and deeply love the men and women who give life to the United Nations. From this rostrum  I wish to pay tribute with emotion  affection and respect  to all those who  in serving the United Nations  take risks every day for our shared ideal of peace and    10-55122 38  development. I think of all the friends we have lost — and the friends we may still lose — year after year  and  of course  of those who take their place.  The fight is noble. Respect for the values and universal principles of human rights constitutes the indispensable foundation on which United Nations action must be built. The ambition to build a world order founded on universal respect for human dignity has been and will always be at the heart of French diplomacy.  Have we collectively progressed in our service of these values? Not enough. How long will we continue to accept — now that we live in a so-called information society  a world where people can know what is happening in other places — that  in terms of human rights  there are so many blind spots  so many forgotten tragedies and so much suffering that remain hidden? As I asked at the beginning  what has become of the responsibility to protect?  Today the success of the United Nations must first of all be assessed in terms of its contribution to the protection of civilians. That is the first area in which our requirements should be upheld. Every day massacres and rapes are committed throughout the world  in Somalia  in Darfur and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  including in regions where peacekeeping operations are deployed.  We can no longer simply count the victims when mass crimes are committed. Our courage must not be less than that of those who die from risks that we no longer know how to take.  France believes that the International Criminal Court is one of the most important advances made in the history of a humankind conscious of the dangers to which it is exposed by its own demons. France understands the criticism of those that believe that the Court is too slow or that it goes too far. Let us be clear  France will always support the idea of international criminal justice that is impartial and universal  for it is the only way of fulfilling the imperative dictated by our history  namely  combating impunity. To all who are shocked by the boldness of some of the Court’s prosecutions  I say that  on the contrary  it would be appalling if the victims were deprived of their right to justice.  Human rights  the protection of civilians  international justice — these are not hollow concepts or empty principles for us. For France  they are first and foremost principles of action  and the only valid criterion for judgement is the impact of our actions on the actual situation.  In Guinea  after the killings in the Conakry stadium  on 28 September 2009  we came together to denounce the human rights violations and to assist the victims of the atrocities committed. The Secretary-General dispatched an International Commission of Inquiry to the field one month after the fact  and I would like to once again thank him sincerely for that. The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court instituted proceedings. That pressure enabled Guinean civil society in the field to make the difference. Today the junta has been replaced by a transitional executive. Nothing has been won. There will be a second round of elections in two weeks. But I wanted to recall this success of the United Nations since at the beginning I said that the responsibility to protect was threatened. I think we can all agree that there is a movement forming in civil society throughout the world and that we can still take action."
"59",2462,"FSM",65,2010,"Allow me to congratulate Mr. Deiss on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. He has taken on that formidable task at a crucial period for our United Nations. I assure him of Micronesia’s full support. I would also like to pay tribute to his esteemed predecessor for his distinguished leadership.  Sadly  I wish to begin my statement by expressing the sincere sympathy of the people and Government of the Federated States of Micronesia for the many victims of recent natural disasters everywhere. Having been victims of natural disasters ourselves  our hearts go out to the victims of the recent hurricanes  earthquakes  mudslides and floods that are now occurring on an unprecedented scale and with increasing frequency and devastating intensity all over our planet. Overwhelming evidence points to one common denominator in all those events  and that is global climate change.  I am deeply honoured to address the General Assembly  at its sixty-fifth session  for the first time on behalf of the Federated States of Micronesia. This Assembly accords Micronesia and the small island developing States an extraordinary privilege to bring to the whole world the most pressing issues affecting us that demand our collective response.  Despite the many years of negotiations to curb its devastating effects  the climate change crisis continues to haunt us. The negotiating process has moved along very slowly  while in stark contrast the rapid increases in the incidence and severity of environmental hazards continue to take their toll  with devastating results. I cannot help but think of the needless human suffering everywhere  and what the future holds for my country and the small island developing States if business continues as usual.  As a small island developing State  Micronesia’s future is intrinsically linked to the global climate. That is why we are gravely concerned by the acute environmental problems related to the extreme vulnerability of our islands to sea-level rise and climate change. Those threats are indisputable  and delays in adopting a comprehensive and legally binding agreement to avert this global disaster are without excuse.  In Micronesia  we are deeply disappointed at the glacial progress in the negotiating sessions and climate change meetings of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. At the same time  we are growing increasingly alarmed by the prospect of shrinking ambitions for the meeting in Cancún  Mexico  later this year. That is not an acceptable response to a crisis of enormous proportions  certainly not for Micronesia and not for any of the small island developing States  who need fast action. This is an issue of survival for us.  We must find a better response — a genuine response that supports mitigation and adaptation measures that will achieve significant reductions in    10-55109 12  greenhouse gas emissions and thus preserve the integrity of our Earth’s environment and also the livelihoods of its inhabitants. My island nation and the small island developing States  for that matter  are not major contributors to the causes of climate change. All present know that. But we are nevertheless determined in our efforts to contribute to finding solutions.  For its part  Micronesia continues to take the lead to combat climate change by utilizing the opportunities under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Through the Montreal Protocol we can solve a big part of the climate change problem. That is why Micronesia has developed a proposal with the support of Mauritius  the Marshall Islands  Seychelles and the Philippines that calls for the phasing down of the production and use of hydrofluorocarbons. Under our proposal we will be able to eliminate one of the greenhouse gases listed under the Kyoto Protocol  and we are encouraged that other countries  such as Canada  the United States and Mexico  already have come forward with similar proposals.  Frankly  we have been delighted by the interest shown in our proposal so far  and I commend it to the Assembly’s attention. Today  I encourage all delegations to consider supporting it. Our collective action is imperative if we are to effectively curb and reverse global warming. That is the kind of collaboration that I encourage here.  Just as we are delighted by our Montreal Protocol proposal  we are equally proud of an initiative within our Pacific region  launched in August by the Governments of the Republics of the Marshall Islands and Palau and my own Government at the margins of the forty-first Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Vanuatu. This is the Green Energy Micronesia Initiative  which calls for a 20 per cent improvement in energy efficiency by suppliers in areas such as transportation and electric power generation  a 30 per cent improvement in energy use by end users and a 20 per cent electricity generation through renewable energy by 2020. As island countries with a total dependence on fossil fuels for our energy generation  it is no longer economically  financially and environmentally sustainable to continue down that path. We must look towards developing  utilizing and embracing our renewable sources of energy.  Our prospect for success will remain grim with our limited capacity and available financial resources. We encourage and call upon our development partners and the international community to support our efforts  including through increased financial support  transfer of technology and capacity-building.  In our seemingly idyllic settings as island nations  it may seem to many around the world that we live an easy life and demand action only from others. However  the reality is that our island nations are actively playing our part in maintaining  and promoting the protection of  our Planet Earth. We accept our responsibility for conserving the biodiversity of our islands and waters and for using resources in a sustainable manner.  That is why Micronesia and our Micronesian sister nations the Republics of the Marshall Islands and of Palau  as well as the Territory of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands  continue to promote the Micronesia Challenge to conserve at least 30 per cent of the near-shore marine resources and 20 per cent of terrestrial resources across our Micronesian region by 2020.  Given our individual limitations  we can confront these challenges only through regional collective actions. I want to express our utmost gratitude to those countries and international organizations that continue to support the Micronesia Challenge and help us achieve our goals. Being small island countries with limited resources  we see realistic success in collaborative partnership with the international community.  Micronesia will continue to address the protection of the ocean and its resources. As a Pacific island country with one of the largest exclusive economic zones in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean  we ascribe particular importance to the ocean and its resources. The ocean has a fundamental and critical bearing on our food security and economic future. However  human activities on the planet are significantly affecting our ocean and can bring about disastrous consequences for our food security and sustainable development.  Illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing in our zone remains of great concern  as that abhorrent practice continues with its sophistication and multinational criminal operations. We do maintain high expectations that through the support of the   13 10-55109  international community we can combat that illegal activity  which threatens the sustainability of our fish stocks and deprives our people of potential economic benefits.  To reverse already discernable trends towards the disappearance of key tuna species that were once thought inexhaustible  early this year the leaders of the Pacific countries that are parties to the Nauru Agreement signed the Koror Declaration  agreeing to introduce further conservation measures to protect key tuna stocks. One of the measures agreed to is to close off additional high-seas areas to purse seine fishing by vessels licensed to fish our Nauru Agreement waters.  Micronesia is fully committed and will work with its fellow parties to the Nauru Agreement and the wider international community to ensure the sustainability of our tuna resources. We will hold violators accountable through internationally agreed mechanisms to prevent  deter and eliminate illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing in our waters and the Western and Central Pacific Ocean region.  Our oceans and our exclusive economic zones are getting a great deal of international attention because of the potential for economic exploitation. We assign the highest priority to greater economic participation in all aspects of that exploitation. Increased economic participation is a major goal for all countries in the Pacific having considerable marine resources — not just Micronesia.  However  our participation in the exploitation of our own marine resources for economic development is held back by a lack of experience and because much of our basic infrastructure still needs to be supported and developed. On the overall scoreboard  the Pacific small island developing States have not claimed their rightful share of their own fisheries resources. International support has to be given to help us build our capacities not only in negotiating agreements and developing our fisheries industries but in realizing a greater share of the benefits from the catch of fish stocks from our own exclusive economic zone.  In this review year for both the Millennium Development Goals and the Mauritius Strategy for Small Island Developing States  we must take full advantage of both occasions and rise to the challenge to meet our world’s new and emerging needs.  One of the major preoccupations of the General Assembly over the last 15 years has been the reform of the United Nations. I do not need to belabour the issue  as all present are aware of Micronesia’s long-standing position  especially in regard to the reform of the Security Council. For permanent membership  we reiterate our support for Japan and India from our Asia and Pacific region. From other regions  Germany and Brazil also deserve equal consideration. We call for accelerated efforts to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion.  Peace in the Middle East remains elusive  but we have high hopes that the resumption of direct talks recently in Washington  D.C.  and elsewhere between the Israelis and the Palestinians will pave the way to a lasting peace and a final settlement with a two-State solution. The whole world has a stake in the Middle East peace process. Micronesia fully supports the peace process and urges all members of this Assembly to play a constructive role and work towards an outcome that brings permanent peace and security to the Middle East. I want to express my profound gratitude to the United States  Egypt  Jordan and the Quartet for their critical roles and leadership in finding a solution to this formidable challenge. For it to be met  we must respond with our collective action and support.  I have been most privileged to have this opportunity to address the Assembly on behalf of my small island country. As I close my statement  I want to reassure this Assembly that Micronesia will continue to do its part as a responsible Member of this Organization."
"60",2505,"GAB",65,2010,"At the outset  allow me to convey to Mr. Joseph Deiss  on behalf of my country  our heartfelt congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. His proven experience and skill will ensure that our deliberations are successful. I thank his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  for the excellent manner in which he discharged his mandate. To the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  I reiterate the support of Gabon for his tireless involvement in building a world that is more free  just and united.   I take this opportunity to express from this rostrum my gratitude to all here and the entire international community for the solidarity they extended to the people of Gabon when my predecessor  the late President Omar Bongo Ondimba  passed away. I am also grateful for the many forms of support extended to us throughout Gabon’s process of democratic transition  which has highlighted the credibility and reliability of our institutions and our people’s sense of responsibility.   For almost a year now  I have engaged Gabon in broad-ranging economic  social and political reforms centred on promoting our environmental heritage and industrial sector and on making the service sector more dynamic. When I took office  I presented the three strategic pillars of an emergent Gabon: Green Gabon  Industrial Gabon and Services Gabon.   By putting Green Gabon at the head of that list  I wanted to underscore the central role that this sector will play in Gabon’s economy. I see Green Gabon as a cross-cutting approach that underlies our overall development strategy. Industrial Gabon draws upon efforts to promote our natural resources  while respecting the basic principles of environmental preservation. Services Gabon highlights the country’s ownership of new information and communications technology  the promotion of tourism  transportation improvements and the development of human resources.  In the light of this vision  we have established a climate council to mainstream the issues of climate change into our national development policies. In the same vein  we have just entered into a partnership with Brazil and with France to establish a satellite imaging facility to monitor the forest cover of the Congo basin  which comprises more than 2 million square kilometres of equatorial rainforest.   The many initiatives in which I have engaged my country are aimed in particular at improving governance  fighting corruption  reducing State expenses and preserving the environment  all of which requires international support. We bear in mind  of course  that our future depends above all upon our own    10-54959 8  efforts to manage our resources  achieve good governance and serve the greater good.   Beyond our desire to mobilize further national and international resources  we continue to be firmly committed to the quest for peace and security  both regionally and globally. Through our membership in the Security Council  we are fully shouldering our responsibilities and making our contribution to the quest for a world that can look to the future with confidence.   The theme of our debate gives us yet another opportunity to assess the role of the United Nations in global governance. Our world still bears the scars of the terrible financial and economic crisis of 2008  which spared no country. The rapid and robust mobilization of the international community  and the United Nations in particular  in the face of this crisis demonstrated its ability to respond when it is motivated and supported by genuine political will. Such international solidarity should be made systematic  and we hope it will be renewed in efforts to deal with the emerging challenges that we face today.  Given the complexity of the new crises we face today  we need to design a new approach to conflict management. Peacekeeping has not had just successes; quite the contrary  there are many cases in which  for lack of resources and ambition  the United Nations has been unable to intervene and thus abandoned defenceless populations to rebels and other armed groups.   It is time for us to move beyond peacekeeping so that we can adopt  when circumstances require  a philosophy of imposing peace. We need to give ourselves the capacity to deploy robust peace missions commensurate with the nature of the conflicts that continue to destabilize certain States. Peacekeeping in and of itself will not be able to meet the challenges of security. I reiterate my call for a culture of conflict prevention  which has the advantage of both averting many casualties and saving the modest resources that are so necessary to our countries’ development.  The quest for peace and security remains a constant concern in Africa and elsewhere. The imminent referendum on Southern Sudan appears to be clouded with uncertainties. Indeed  the hope of a political settlement to that thorny regional issue is paralleled by the fear of the balkanization of a continent that has already suffered too many divisions. The stakes in the Sudan today perhaps foreshadow a cycle that will mark Africa’s future. I appeal to the parties and the international community  in the interests of the populations involved  to take full stock of their responsibility to ensure the success of a process leading up to the referendum.   Here  I commend the commitment of the United Nations and the African Union to supporting the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  to which my country remains committed. Specifically with respect to Darfur  I call on all parties to be further involved in the Doha political process. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the State of Qatar for its efforts to that end.   In Somalia  I commend the support of the United Nations for the efforts of the African Union Mission in Somalia to put an end to instability in that country. Yesterday’s mini-summit on the situation in that country attested to the United Nations ongoing interest in reaching a settlement on the question of Somalia.   In the Democratic Republic of the Congo  the reconfiguration of the mandate of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo — now the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo — essentially aimed at enhancing protection for civilian populations  should be highlighted. It demonstrates the willingness of the United Nations to adapt to changing situations on the ground. I call on the countries of the region and the international community to support the efforts of the Congolese Government in its determination to ensure security and stability throughout its territory.   With respect to the situation in Western Sahara  I encourage the parties to restart the Manhasset talks  under the auspices of the Secretary-General  in order to end the current stalemate and move towards a political solution acceptable to all.   Finally  with respect to Côte d’Ivoire  Guinea  Niger and Madagascar  I urge the international community to support them in holding free  democratic elections in accordance with the various arrangements reached to that end.   The search for peace in the Middle East is another area of concern to the international community. I commend the diplomatic efforts undertaken by the United States  which have brought about the resumption of direct talks between Israelis and   9 10-54959  Palestinians. I also thank the other Quartet members and Egypt for their involvement in that process. It is my hope that these consultations will continue and lead to the establishment of a Palestinian State  living side by side with Israel within secure and internationally recognized borders.   The terrorist threat  unfortunately  continues to weigh heavily on international peace and security. No nation large or small is spared. Defeating this scourge will require effective cooperation among all Member States  with the assistance of the United Nations and its specialized institutions. We will also need to give ongoing attention to other cross-cutting threats to international peace and security  such as piracy  the proliferation of weapons  drug trafficking and transnational organized crime. We commend the efforts already undertaken by the United Nations in this area  particularly the strengthening of the legal regime and mechanisms to counter those threats.   With respect to the issue of climate change  together with other heads of State and Government in Copenhagen  I undertook the quest for a consensus on the idea of a legally binding instrument. We support the negotiations undertaken in Copenhagen and continued in Bonn and hope that they will lead  in Cancún  to the reaffirmation of the commitments taken  particularly in terms of financing for the fight against climate change in developing countries and the 20 per cent reduction of greenhouse gasses in the industrialized countries by 2020.  The advancement of women is undeniably one of the areas in which the United Nations has made genuine progress. The recent establishment of a new institution called UN Women  the primary mission of which is to better coordinate all the activities related to gender issues  clearly illustrates the fact that our Organization is addressing this concern. I take this opportunity to convey my sincere congratulations to an extraordinary woman  Ms. Michelle Bachelet  for her appointment as head of this new entity.  Given the many challenges facing humanity  we owe it to ourselves to work together in a coordinated manner to provide a global response that matches the aspirations of our peoples. The universality of the United Nations symbolizes the shared destiny of the world’s people  and the Organization thus has a central role to play  both in global governance and in the emergence of a more just economic and social order. From that standpoint  I reaffirm the need to adapt our Organization to the changing international context. Revitalizing the work of the General Assembly  reforming the Security Council and ensuring the coherence of the United Nations system are areas that have to be dealt with to strengthen the central role of our Organization.   At a time when we are realigning our common efforts with the current international environment and when democratizing global governance is emerging as a necessity  I would like to reaffirm  from this rostrum  Africa’s aspiration to fully take its place among the family of nations. We fervently call for the democratization of the United Nations system in order to adapt it to today’s realities.   Indeed  we believe that it is an anachronism that Africa is under international pressure to reaffirm democratic values while those same laudable values cannot be applied within our own Organization. I believe the time has come for Africa to shoulder all its responsibilities  stop its continual reliance on assistance from its partners and take its own destiny in hand. This affirmation of Africa’s place on the international scene leads me to call for its permanent presence in the Security Council. We are prepared to meet that challenge in order to treat the wounds of a history replete with injustices done to the continent.   Beyond the democratization of the United Nations system  which we wholeheartedly call for  the credibility of our efforts also requires that we meet the development promises made to humankind.  Africa’s destiny assuredly hangs on compliance with the commitments undertaken in Monterrey  Gleneagles  Doha  Paris and  more recently  in Muskoka and Toronto. Those commitments should not be postponed indefinitely.   As humanity is one in its essence and varied in its forms  it is important that the management of the world’s affairs be done with the collaboration of all  in order to ensure that the generations to come can look to the future with confidence."
"61",2552,"GBR",65,2010,"The nations represented here know how deeply the world has changed in the six and a half decades since the United Nations was formed; since the spirit of international citizenship  of peoples and nations combining their energies to solve our shared problems  gave birth to the United Nations. Today  that spirit is needed more than ever.  All of us have to respond to a world that is profoundly altered. As a community of nations  we face three profound challenges: a redrawing of the map of power  including a big shift in economic power; the globalization of problems  not least terrorism and climate change; and increasingly fluid forms of identity and the rapid circulation and potency of new ideas. Taken together  these mean that we are in a new world. All three demand matching responses. So we must reform and renew our multilateral institutions in line with the changing map of power  strengthen our actions on international peacebuilding  climate change and development  and promote liberal values and human rights to win the conflict of ideas.  The truth is that in all three of these areas we are not doing anything like as well as we must. The effectiveness of multilateral approaches is in question in the wake of the financial crisis  the failure of the climate change talks in Copenhagen and the stalling of the Doha Trade Round. And too many nations and international institutions have been too reticent about promoting enlightened human values. We need to inject new life into our institutions and new confidence into the expression of our ideals.  Turning first to the altered geography of power  it is an often-stated fact that the old economic order is being transformed and that what were once labelled emerging economies are now  in many cases  global economic players. The distribution of military power  too  is altering  so power is being wielded in different places and in different ways. This power shift requires us to reform our international institutions  to reinforce the rule of international law  and to free up international trade.  In recent years  our multinational institutions have sometimes struggled to adapt to the new circumstances  so reform is essential. And a good place to start is right here at the United Nations. The Security Council must be reformed to reflect the new geography of power. The United Kingdom is clear and unambiguous in our support for permanent seats for Brazil  India  Germany and Japan  and for African representation. Put simply  the United Nations cannot speak for the many if it only hears the voices of the few. We welcome the priority that the President has promised to give to the Assembly’s continuing negotiations on this issue.  Closer cooperation on counter-terrorism is also vital  and we welcome the Assembly’s affirmation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We must stand shoulder to shoulder in the struggle against terrorism.  The United Kingdom will always champion the United Nations. If it did not exist  we would have to invent it. But let us be frank. Without a radical overhaul  the United Nations will not provide the leadership the world seeks from it and needs from it. It is also important that the vital role of the European Union in promoting development and prosperity be adequately represented in the Assembly.  The redrawing of the power map also makes it even more important that the writ of international law extend across the world. Laws are the solid representation of our collective values. That is why it is so important that we uphold and reinforce the instruments of international justice  including the International Criminal Court and specific tribunals  such as those for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.   I strongly welcome the comments of President Obama yesterday on the vital importance of the Middle East peace process. I can assure the Assembly that the United Kingdom is committed to helping lead to the end of hostilities that have been so profoundly damaging for all sides.  The prevention of nuclear-weapons proliferation is another huge priority for the international community. The United Kingdom welcomes the success of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons this May  and I can assure the Assembly that we will continue to play our part in making the world safer from the threat of nuclear weapons.  I was ready today to welcome the progress made in this week’s meeting of the E3+3 group on Iran. I was ready to also straightforwardly reiterate our   27 10-54959  concerns about Iran’s nuclear programme. But instead  once again  an issue of grave global concern has been overshadowed by the bizarre  offensive and attention-grabbing pronouncements by President Ahmadinejad from this rostrum yesterday. His remarks were intended to distract attention from Iran’s obligations and to generate media headlines. They deserve to do neither.  The reshaped world of power also increases the need to open our borders to free trade. A trading world is a safer world. A world trade deal  which is within reach  would be worth $170 billion annually to the world economy. Two years ago we were very close  but we failed to seal the deal. We simply cannot afford protectionism. Today  we have to recognize that we will need an even more ambitious deal than we envisaged then if we are to get an agreement. Greater access to markets  particularly for least developed countries’ exports of agriculture  supports growth and reduces poverty.  The second of the three big shifts we have to adapt to is the globalization of many of our problems and of many of the solutions to those problems. Our economies are  of course  tied ever more closely together  as recent events have dramatically proven. Prosperity and poverty in one part of the world impact on economic activity and security elsewhere.  Diseases can span the globe in a matter of days. Terrorism is conducted by international networks across the world. Environmental threats do not respect borders. We are used to thinking about stateless people. We have to get used to the idea of stateless problems  too. Conflict takes place between  across and within national boundaries  but wherever it takes place it can threaten the interests of all nations. Conflict undermines our collective prosperity and destroys development. We must work harder to prevent conflict by tackling the sources of violence. And where conflict does break out  we must be ready to help resolve it.   So let me take this opportunity to acknowledge the invaluable contribution of United Nations peacekeepers to laying the foundations for sustainable peace around the world. We owe them all  and the Governments that provide them  a great debt of gratitude. The United Kingdom  along with France and other partners  has been at the forefront of supporting and encouraging United Nations efforts to deliver more strategic and effective peacekeeping. We will continue to provide that support.   But peacekeeping alone is not the answer. We need peacebuilding  too. The United Nations is uniquely placed not only to keep the peace  but also to make it last. Effective peacebuilding can address the underlying causes of conflict and strengthen local  regional and national capacity to contribute to long-term stability in fragile States.  The coming year will see some significant challenges to the United Nations efforts to promote international peace  justice and security: in the Sudan  where we will see a referendum on the future of Southern Sudan  while continuing to look for progress on justice in Darfur and more widely; in Somalia  where the African Union peacekeeping mission is playing a brave and crucial role  and where the leadership of the United Nations could be decisive; and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  where much progress has been made but where we have seen again in recent weeks how much more remains to be done to achieve real security and stability for many of its hard-pressed people.  The United Kingdom remains fully committed to the mission to bring peace and prosperity to Afghanistan. Afghans are increasingly taking responsibility for their own affairs. This year’s Kabul Conference and  most recently  parliamentary elections have demonstrated Afghan commitment. Challenges remain  but progress is being made. The United Kingdom will continue to work with its international partners to support Afghans to build a better Afghanistan.  The United Kingdom is wholehearted in our support for international development. Like many nations  we are having to take tough action to reduce our financial deficits  but we are not budging a millimetre from our commitment to development. We are standing by our promise to devote 0.7 per cent of gross national income to international development assistance from 2013  and we will enshrine this commitment in law.  When disaster strikes  we must respond quickly and generously. Right now  Pakistan faces a humanitarian disaster of unimaginable proportions. As the Secretary-General has said  this is the largest disaster in the 65-year history of the United Nations. So we must ensure that the United Nations appeal is properly funded to cover both humanitarian relief and reconstruction  and we must ensure that there is enough    10-54959 28  support over the long term  not least in helping Pakistan to achieve the levels of economic growth that will allow the country to rebuild itself. I am very proud  as the representative of a European Union (EU) member State  that the EU has recently shown real leadership in promising to look at improving trade access for Pakistan in response to the disaster. I very much hope that others can follow suit.  So  economic power has shifted and problems have globalized  but at the same time the power of ideas has grown enormously. Identities have become more fluid. It is not possible to put people into neatly labelled national boxes any more. This means that winning the battle of ideas is as important as military prowess.  The work of international institutions must continue to be guided by the values on which those institutions were founded: the rule of law  both domestic and international; the right to freedom of expression and belief; democracy; and equality before the law. These values are sometimes described as Western values  but only by people who do not know their history. Four centuries ago  the great Mughal emperor Akbar was legislating for religious freedom and equality in what is now India  while in parts of Europe heretics were being burned at the stake. The truth is that these liberal values of equality  law and self-determination cannot be claimed by any nation or hemisphere. They are global values with global force. They are also the values at the heart of the United Nations Charter.  We should never apologize for promoting the idea that women and men are equal; never flinch from insisting that Governments chosen by their people are better; never shy away from our insistence that nobody should be silenced because of their religion or beliefs.  The United Kingdom will therefore continue to push for human rights across the world. Since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in 1948  the United Nations has developed a global legal framework of human rights standards. We want to see the Human Rights Council do more to ensure that States implement their obligations and use the 2011 review to improve the Council’s ability to respond effectively to situations of concern  such as the outrageous abuse of democracy and human rights in Burma.  United Kingdom foreign policy will be shaped by the three big challenges I have set out today: a power shift  the globalization of problems  and the rapid circulation and potency of ideas. The United Kingdom Government will fearlessly promote our ideals and interests while remaining realistic in our approach.  This is the spirit in which the United Kingdom Government is conducting a root-and-branch review of our own strategic defence and security policy. Our last review took place in 1998  but the world has changed  along with the character of the threats we face. This is not to say that we did not face grave threats before  but they were more fixed  more visible and more predictable. Today  the threats to our security are not rooted in specific States. They are more fluid and often less visible: terrorism  organized crime  or attacks from cyberspace. We must judge our security not by our ability to deal with what we know  but how able we are to respond to unpredictable threats.  The United Kingdom will also show leadership by example. As fierce advocates of the international rule of law  we will practice what we preach. No nation can insist on the law and then act as though it is above it. But our approach will also be hard-headed and realistic. In recent years we have learned — in same cases the hard way — that democracy cannot be created by diktat. Freedom cannot be commanded into existence.  The new coalition Government  now five-months old  will restore Britain’s international reputation by pursuing a hard-headed foreign policy based on liberal values.   The world has changed  but the values that should guide us have not. We have to renew our international institutions in line with the new realities of world power and influence  and fearlessly project the ideals of democracy  equality and freedom. Great things are demanded of us. Great things are necessary from us. It falls to our generation of leaders to meet these challenges together."
"62",2576,"GEO",65,2010,"It is always a great honour for me to address the annual gathering of the General Assembly.  In uncertain times such as ours  cooperation is more necessary than ever. Unless we stand together and invent new approaches to the global challenges we all face  we shall be torn apart by fear and self-destructive interests. Gatherings such as this  therefore  are valuable only if they allow us to shape a common vision for concrete action towards peace  development  solidarity and justice.  This month  thanks to the coordinated efforts of the international community and the leadership of President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton  direct peace talks have resumed between Israelis and Palestinians. This is a very important moment  because they resume precisely when many people had given up hope for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.  The road to peace  security  and justice is still a long one. The remaining obstacles are enormous. But the goal is so noble and necessary that no effort should be spared. That is why today I would like to pay tribute to all those who are taking risks for peace. Yes  risks. Because peace is never obvious  never easy. That is certainly true in the Middle East  and it is true in my region as well.  One of our common goals  then  must be to enable those risk-takers who have the courage to defy conventional wisdom and forge new paths to peace. Peace is not an easy way. But peace is the only way.  As the President of a young democracy that recently suffered from war and invasion and is still under partial occupation of an important part of its territory by a nuclear super-Power  I can say this: peace is our most precious common goal and  at the same time  our only path towards the other goals we share.  To those here and in my own country who see no way to reverse the armed occupation or reduce regional tensions  I say: peace is not only the goal  it is also the means to any goal.  Today my region is at a crossroads. For too long  it has suffered from division  injustice  conflict  colonization and violence. Today  however  change is possible. In fact  change is already taking place. I came    10-54833 2  here to speak about this change and to promote a specific vision — a vision of a free  stable and united Caucasus.  From the times of Pushkin  Lermontov or Tolstoy to the present day  the Caucasian mountains have been a symbol of wilderness and paradoxes  a region where individuals and souls were fundamentally free  but where citizens were brutally oppressed; where people and cultures were deeply tolerant  but where Governments and authorities created artificial divisions; where shepherds would cross 5 000-metres-high mountains  but where rulers erected walls nobody could cross. I have come here today to tell the Assembly that those times are vanishing  that the dream of unity and peace is possible.  When I addressed the Assembly two years ago — in the aftermath of a full-scale invasion  and when the Russian Foreign Minister was openly discussing with foreign diplomats and the international community the possibility of Georgia’s total annihilation — few people believed that our country would survive as an independent and democratic State. Few people thought that our Government would endure  that our economy would survive the war and the global crisis  that our reforms could continue with renewed vigour  or that we would make steady progress towards the European Union and Euro-Atlantic structures.  Well  I am proud to tell the Assembly  two years later  that we have succeeded against all the odds  thanks to the commitment of the Georgian people and to the support of friends and allies. Today  Georgia is back.  Georgia is back  first  as a laboratory for political reform and social transformation.  More than ever  we are committed to the promise at the heart of the Rose Revolution to turn a failed State into a modern European one. Our local elections last May were proof of that transformation and a milestone for our democracy  the result of seven years of patient  constant  tireless reform.  Our objective is clear: to create a more institutionalized system of liberal democratic governance.  My term as President ends in 2013. These changes will survive my presidency and the current Government  because we are not speaking only about changes of leadership or reforms of institutions; we are speaking about something deeper and stronger — something that The Economist of London recently branded as Georgia’s “mental revolution”.  The Georgian people have tasted freedom  the absence of corruption  the fruits of economic development  the emergence of a true meritocracy. They have changed their behaviour  their vision of the world  their dreams even  and they will mightily resist any attempts to reverse those changes — no matter whether those attempts come from inside or from abroad.  This is our great victory: we helped to create something that goes far beyond the leaders and parties that led the Rose Revolution. We helped to create a revolution of the heart and the mind.  Once one of the most corrupt countries of the post-Soviet world  Georgia has made greater gains in the fight against corruption  as witnessed by Transparency International  than any other country over the past five years. Once a place where foreign investors were kidnapped by gangs and mafias  Georgia is now ranked by the World Bank as number 11 for ease of doing business in the world — a ranking we hope to further improve this year — and the number 1 in Eastern and Central Europe. These rankings make clear why Georgia’s only interest is a peaceful resolution of conflicts: Georgia is winning the peace — Georgia is winning through peace.  Our northern neighbour expected us to change our path when it imposed on us a full embargo in 2006  invaded us in 2008  ethnically cleansed Georgian regions and illegally occupied 20 per cent of our territory  an occupation that continues to this day. All these actions had one objective: to destroy the Georgian laboratory of political  economic and social reform — to prevent the region from changing.  We answered those relentless attacks by reinvigorating our reforms  opening our economy even more  and accelerating our social transformation. This is our policy  and no provocation will ever make us change it. Thanks to this commitment to reform  Georgia is now a responsible international player.  I am proud that my nation is fighting international terrorism in Afghanistan. I pay tribute here to our nearly 1 000 soldiers who are risking their lives every day in the south of Afghanistan to help the Afghan people secure a stable  terror-free future. I pay   3 10-54833  a special tribute today to company commander First Lieutenant Mukhran Shukvani  who died earlier this month. Mukhran was killed in the cause of peace  while serving alongside NATO forces in the dangerous Helmand province of Afghanistan.  We are fighting other common scourges  now focusing especially on the terrible danger of nuclear trafficking. Many times over the past seven years we have intercepted criminals who had in their possession the essential ingredients for nuclear devices. Every step of the way  we have cooperated with our allies in the international community to ensure that Georgia is doing everything possible to confront this global danger.  Here I must pause to draw attention to a grave problem that resulted from the partial occupation of my country — a problem that everybody should worry about  even those who overlook and do not care too much about violations of international law  who forget 500 000 internally displaced persons and refugees; even those who dismiss repeated assaults on basic human rights  civil liberties and the environment.  I am speaking of the lawlessness bred by the Russian occupation. Our two occupied regions exist in a black hole of governance. Today  in those lands  criminals act with impunity. The most elemental human rights are abused. Drugs and weapons are smuggled. People are trafficked. And potential weapons of mass destruction are moved in and out of the territories  posing a threat to us all.  Three days ago  we met in this very place to discuss the Millennium Development Goals and our progress in meeting them over the past decade. I shall not tire the Assembly with a recitation of our efforts to achieve the Goals  the strides we have made in halving our poverty rate and decreasing by two thirds our extreme poverty  reforming our educational system and improving health care.  But I will tell the Assembly that all those successes remain bittersweet for me  because they cannot be savoured by all the people of Georgia — not by those who live in fear for their basic rights in the occupied territories  nor fully by the 500 000 internally displaced persons and refugees who were expelled from their homes and cannot go back and regain their property.  For the last two years the Russian Federation has been violating the ceasefire agreement brokered in August 2008 by my good friend French President Nicolas Sarkozy  who was acting at the time on behalf of the European Union. The Russian army has not withdrawn as required by the ceasefire. European Union monitors cannot enter Russian-occupied areas of Georgia  where a constant military build-up is taking place. Hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons  victims of the ethnic cleansing campaign led by the Russian forces  are still prevented from entering their homes.  How did Georgia respond to those violations of international law and human rights? We answered with patience and calm. We implemented — fully — the ceasefire agreement and went beyond our obligations  without ever using as a pretext Russia’s refusal to comply. Last month  the head of the European Union Monitoring Mission in Georgia  Ambassador Haber  publicly praised Georgian policy as “constructive unilateralism”.  What does constructive unilateralism mean? It refers  for instance  to our calm when militias supported by Russia’s federal security service (FSB) killed our policemen at the occupation line  or to our willingness to free criminals working for the occupation regime when the other side was kidnapping teenagers who wanted to visit their empty house just after their school time.  Constructive unilateralism means that we behave in a civilized and patient way  even when our enemy uses barbaric methods or implements an impulsive and irrational policy. It means that — even if peace requires both sides to come to the negotiating table — one can pave the way to peace on one’s own  without the other side’s cooperating.  This constructive unilateralism is based on the idea that peace is in the supreme interest of Georgia  that peace is the only path to the de-occupation of our country. It forms the substance of the strategy on occupied territories that my Government has put in motion to engage the populations held hostage by the Russian occupiers  on the other side of the new Iron Curtain that illegally divides our country.  Like the Berlin Wall  walls like the one dividing Georgia will be brought down not by bombs  but by the commitment of citizens to build a free  united country — and by the commitment of the world    10-54833 4  community to enforce international law and the principles of the Charter.  This commitment is expressed in the refusal of nearly the entire world to legitimize the Russian occupation and the result of ethnic cleansing by recognizing the so-called independence of Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali region  a de facto annexation of Georgian territories by the Russian Federation.  It is noticeable that  despite enormous pressure and multiple threats from Moscow  not a single former Soviet republic has recognized this dismemberment of Georgia. It shows — to the great surprise of those who describe the fall of the Soviet empire as the worst catastrophe of the twentieth century — that the old times are definitely over. It shows that the change I evoked earlier has already taken root. It shows that all the former captive nations of Soviet times are now independent States that can determine their own policies. It is noticeable — and it is noticed in Moscow.  I solemnly call today on those three  isolated Member States that recognized Russia’s de facto annexation of our territories and legitimized the Russian-led ethnic cleansing of around 500 000 citizens  to acknowledge that it is never too late to reverse a bad policy. The dismemberment of Georgia has failed categorically — and even the Russian Federation will one day need to reverse its disastrous policy. Imagine how uncomfortable those leaders from faraway countries will be when Moscow itself chooses to comply with international law and withdraw its troops. Because that day will come.  Those who claimed a military victory in 2008 now face a diplomatic and political defeat. And in Moscow the occupation and annexation will soon be debated. They are in fact already debated in the corridors of the Kremlin  because this situation is not sustainable  even for the Russian leadership.  We have now in our country Russian soldiers deserting their units and fleeing to the Georgian side through the wall erected by their superiors  just as Soviet soldiers did in Berlin during the cold war. In which direction is history moving? Certainly not in the direction of those who can deploy thousands of tanks in a very short time  but who cannot even take care of their soldiers or prevent them from fleeing.  Those who refuse to modernize their society and to open their political system may have an interest in war and instability. But in Georgia we know  and we have always known  that peace is our interest — the very precondition of our survival and our success.  I have three calls to make today.  My first call is addressed to my fellow citizens  ethnic Abkhaz and Ossetian  who live behind the new Iron Curtain that divides our common nation. I want to tell them once again: We will protect your rights  your culture  your history — we will work with you  we will work for you. You are part of a common history  a common culture and a common future. Your differences enrich our proud national tapestry. Rather than see you succumb to annexation by the emerging Russian empire  we invite you to build together with us a multicultural and multi-ethnic society that will be a regional model for tolerance and respect.  I dream about the day when — as has happened several times in our common history — an Abkhaz or Ossetian citizen of Georgia becomes President and leader of a democratic and European Georgia. And this dream will become possible in a reunited and free Georgia  a Georgia that will build positive relations and even intense cooperation with the Russian Federation  a Russian Federation acting as a rational international player and not as a revisionist or revanchist Power; a Russian Federation that will have chosen cooperation instead of confrontation and has dropped the politics of embargoes and intolerance  and instead of imposing crackdowns will be a good partner to cooperate with.  My second call is  therefore  to the Russian leadership  to whom I say: You face a choice. Either you take a major part in the ongoing transformation of our common region  accepting that other countries are your partners and not vassals  or this transformation will happen without you. We all want — I personally want — Russia as a great partner and not as an enemy. That is why the Georgian Government supports the reset policy of the United States and the European Union’s engagement with Russia. Nobody has a greater stake than we have in seeing Russia turn into a country that truly operates within the concert of nations  respects international law and — this is often connected — upholds basic human rights.  I want to tell the Russian people that they will always be welcome in Georgia  as tourists  as students    5 10-54833  as businessmen  as journalists or simply as friends  but never as occupation forces. And I want to tell the Russian leaders that they should care more about their citizens and less about our diplomatic orientation  more about developing the Northern Caucasus — a region that is exploding as I speak — than about undermining our development. They are welcome to come too if they want  in order to understand how a post-Soviet society can turn into a European one.  We invite them to come  with notebooks rather than with missiles  with iPads rather than Kalashnikovs.  I was pleased to note that some of our reforms inspired a few recent presidential speeches in Moscow. Instead of fighting each other  we should excel together in modernizing our common region. And instead of secretly copying or envying our reforms  they should cooperate with us in building a stable and free region  building stable and free countries. Because by looking over the best pupil’s shoulder one might not get the full picture of what modernization means. The complete picture is rather simple: lasting stability and prosperity cannot be achieved without respecting some basic principles.  Modernization without freedom is not sustainable. One cannot hope to diversify and develop one’s economy when one sends one’s most talented and successful businessmen to the Gulag  as happened to Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Computers are not enough without free minds to use them. So let us free our minds from our common Soviet past in order to build a common future.  My third and final call is to every member of the international community: help us to secure peace — in Georgia  but also in our broader region. We Georgians have learned tragically how a so-called frozen conflict can very quickly become a hot one.  If there is clear support from the international community  I am convinced that a lasting peace can be secured in the Caucasus. I am convinced that if the world shows the same commitment to a peaceful resolution of conflicts in my region as in other parts of the world we can accomplish wonders. It is in everybody’s interest to see this strategic region  this crossroads of civilizations  become more stable  prosperous and open.  History has taught us that wars can erupt quickly — but also that brave leaders can secure peace where nobody would ever believe that conflicts could be resolved. History has taught us that regions that were torn apart by armed conflicts and contaminated by hate — starting with Europe — can achieve lasting peace through cooperation  interdependence and unity. History has taught us that dreams are often more realistic than resignation.  I strongly believe that a common market  shared interests and political and economic interdependence will one day give birth to a united Caucasus. That is what I call for today.  We share a similar history of oppression  but we have also in common a deep  essential and undefeated aspiration for freedom. Let us capitalize on this aspiration. Our region will never be truly free if it is not united.  It will of course require a long and difficult series of efforts and gestures  from all of us  but the objective is worth every sacrifice. As happened a long time ago with the European Union — that amazing geopolitical revolution we aspire to join one day — the historic move towards Caucasian unity will start with concrete projects  in the energy sector  in the education and the cultural fields and in the civil society sphere.  We should begin with more people-to-people exchanges. It is time we got to know each other and forged links that will bring us together without changing existing inter-State borders.  My birth town and our capital  Tbilisi  is inhabited by Caucasians of every religion and every ethnicity. Together they form a living example of tolerance and cooperation. So it is possible. We leaders have to learn from this cohabitation of peoples and translate it into geopolitics.  Our unity would not be directed against anyone. Once again  we will not aspire to change any borders. That needs to be emphasized.  We may belong to different States and ethnic groups  and live on different sides of the mountains  but in terms of human and cultural space there is no North and South Caucasus; there is only one Caucasus  which belongs to world civilization and Europe and will one day join the big European family of free nations  following the Georgian path.  We  the Caucasians  driven by legitimate or imaginary threats of assimilation or attacks from other Powers  or from each other  hoped too often to be    10-54833 6  protected by neighbouring empires. This anxious search for foreign shelter led us to subjugation  assimilation  annexation and historical tragedy. It authorized foreign leaders to artificially emphasize and manipulate our divisions.  We — Caucasian people — all made the same mistake through history. It is time to change. It is time to stick together  to help each other to survive and progress. It is time to understand that our region has sufficient resources and potential for all of us. It is time to rely on ourselves  on the human potential of our citizens  on development of our own education system  and time to organize our own development.  The Caucasus is one of the birthplaces of world civilization. It is time to show that the energy of our ancestors does not belong only to an iconic past  and that we have something to give to our children and to the world. It is time to stop fighting and weakening each other and to realize that our strength consists in unity. It is time for unity and peace. It is time to stop being prisoners of the past and to move towards our common future.  In the past  Georgian citizens perceived our border with the Ottoman Empire as an absolute threat. Today  we have passport-free customs; we can enter each other’s country without passports and visas. We have a joint airport and free trade with Turkey  and very friendly relations. Tomorrow  the citizens of Armenia and Azerbaijan will be able to cross our borders without passports. Even today there is a very simplified procedure; they do not even have to leave their cars.  Recently  a foreign diplomat told me that after crossing our only legal crossing point with Russia he encountered dozens of roadblocks where dangerous-looking  unshaven local militiamen and FSB agents kept blocking the passage from one valley to another  from one village to another  aggressively preventing individuals from circulating in their own country. There is also talk about the eventuality of  and preparation for  a new war with Georgia.  It is time to replace those people  barbed wire and roadblocks by open borders and passport-free customs  to replace camps for internally displaced persons by joint schools and universities  to replace the Kalashnikov by computers  and to replace missiles by books or television sets.  In 2008  thousands and thousands of tanks  armoured vehicles  artillery platforms  troops and militias crossed the Caucasian mountains  bringing destruction  death and hatred. Now it is time for ideas — the ideas of freedom and unity that we all cherish — to cross the same mountains  bringing hope  life and even love.  As I speak  thousands of tanks  armoured vehicles and missile platforms are entrenched or moving all across the Caucasus. If we remain on our own  isolated from each other  they surely will prevail. But if everybody holds his neighbour’s hand  if tens of millions of unarmed people peacefully stand together  shoulder to shoulder  being the continuation of each other  just like the Caucasian mountains  then no brutal force will ever break through this chain of awakened human spirits and this irresistible thirst for freedom."
"63",2623,"GHA",65,2010,"Let me begin by congratulating the President of the Assembly on his election to lead the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I trust that he will  with his outstanding experience and excellent diplomatic skills  steer this Assembly to a successful conclusion. I also wish to thank his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  for the efficient and able manner with which he presided over the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session.  Ghana subscribes to the declaration by the African Union Assembly of Heads of State and Government that designated 2010 as a year of peace and security. Ghana will  therefore  continue to engage other member States in the search for peace and security in places on the African continent that have known no peace  and we will contribute to renewed global efforts to prevent conflicts through preventive diplomacy  peacekeeping and peacebuilding.  As we witness a decline in the number of the violent conflicts that afflicted many countries over the past decade or more  it is time to renew our commitment to the work of the Peacebuilding Commission in order to ensure that countries emerging from conflict do not relapse into violence. Ghana was privileged to have served on the organizational committee of the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) and will remain actively involved in the pursuit of the attainment of the strategic objectives set for the post-conflict countries on the agenda of the Commission’s country-specific configuration. In this regard  Ghana supports the steps being taken to also place Liberia on the agenda of the Commission.  As agreed by world leaders in 2005  Ghana strongly supports the principle of the responsibility to protect as the normative framework to prevent and deter the occurrence of genocide  war crimes  crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing  which have occurred in many countries that were emerging from conflict. While the fear of its abuse does not take away the intrinsic value of the principle of the responsibility to protect  caution must be exercised in order to avoid its abuse. The principle is not intended to undermine the sovereignty of States; on the contrary  it is to ensure that sovereign responsibility is exercised in a manner that will prevent a repetition of the mass atrocities that were experienced in places like Rwanda  Srebrenica  Cambodia and Sierra Leone  with devastating impacts on neighbouring countries.  Sadly  in many places  some of those conflicts persist in varying degrees of intensity. The international community must be ready and willing to assist national authorities who request such assistance with a view to developing or enhancing the capacity of countries that are manifestly unable or unwilling to uphold this responsibility to do so. To that end  we welcome the Secretary-General’s proposal to establish a joint office to coordinate United Nations system-wide efforts to strengthen early warning mechanisms aimed at ensuring timely and decisive preventive action and/or intervention in appropriate cases  in accordance with the United Nations Charter.    10-55264 22   While the reduction of extreme poverty and hunger is a major development challenge for Africa  most countries in the region are also grappling with the problems of climate change  a high disease burden  poor infrastructure  brain drain and the lack of development of productive capacity. In the last few years  African countries have had to deal with the effects of rising food and energy prices and the complications arising from the global financial and economic crisis. Those multiple crises have not only reversed impressive recent progress in economic performance  but are also jeopardizing efforts by African countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  It is gratifying to see that the interests of the international community in climate change have increased markedly in recent times  especially after the adoption of the Bali Action Plan in 2007. We need to sustain that interest and build on the common ground that was first found in Rio de Janeiro in 1992  with the establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  and was subsequently built on in Berlin  Kyoto  Marrakech  Bali  Copenhagen and  soon  Cancún.  There are issues that need to be addressed for progress in Cancún and beyond. What is missing is a demonstrable political will. Without that  countries will not see the need to raise their ambitions to cut emissions. Industrialized countries have made pledges to cut emissions by 2020. However commendable those commitments may be  they fall short of the 25 to 40 per cent cut that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says will give the world a chance of staying below the recommended two-degree average global temperature rise.  We need to preserve the Kyoto Protocol  which is currently the only existing international agreement with legal status to verify emission reductions. That is why it is critical for all parties to work together to address the divisions over a second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol and ensure its continuity after 2012.  Just as there was “aid fatigue”  developing countries may soon be experiencing “promise fatigue”. We must get the numerous pledges out of the fine print and make them work for humanity. I am simply appealing to industrialized nations to fulfil their funding pledges  including the $30 billion in fast-track financing for developing country adaptation and mitigation efforts through 2012  and the pledge to raise $100 billion a year by 2020. For developing countries  the early delivery and transparent allocation of that money will boost our confidence in the dialogue and show that industrialized countries are truly committed to progress in the broader negotiations.  We have made progress in the implementation of the MDG agenda. However  keeping the solemn promise we made in 2000 and achieving the Goals by 2015 will require intensified efforts  much more resources and effective cooperation. No one should be oblivious to the enormous challenges African and other developing countries face in their efforts to achieve the MDGs.  Ghana will not compromise under any guise in its pursuit of good governance and the promotion of the rule of law  as these are important prerequisites for achieving sustainable social and economic development. African countries themselves have come to acknowledge that part of the reason for their impoverishment could be ascribed to poor post-independence governance practices. That is why most African countries have taken steps to consolidate their governance institutions  including strengthening the electoral system.  Food security is a national priority for Ghana. For most Ghanaians  getting enough good-quality food at affordable prices is a major concern. The Government is therefore implementing a progressive agricultural policy that will ensure increased production  especially in staples and other food crops that our climate and land can efficiently support.  Ghana will soon become an important producer of oil and gas. The focus of the Government is to ensure that Ghanaians will derive the maximum benefit from oil production. Although oil revenues will start to flow around the fourth quarter of the year  the Government is taking measures to ensure accountability and transparency in the management of revenue from oil production. To that end  an oil and gas revenue management bill has been submitted to Parliament for approval. In addition  the Government is holding a series of consultations with several countries and private operators who have expertise and experience in the field so that their knowledge can be tapped and best practices adopted.   23 10-55264   In our efforts to create wealth and prosperity for our citizens  Ghana has made attracting foreign investment an important pillar in its development strategies. We will continue to pursue such policies in the belief that our efforts will be supported and rewarded with genuine partnership.  Africa is tired of the misery and poverty arising from resource-induced violent conflicts. Africa wants to use its oil and natural resources to create wealth for its citizens. We call on the United Nations and well-meaning development partners  including the international business community  to support our efforts to nip the so-called resource curse in the bud and exploit our God-given natural endowments for development.  Whereas the international environment for growth in Africa is still favourable  the risks posed by global imbalances and external shocks  such as the recent financial crisis  call for increased international policy coordination. We need a renewed spirit of solidarity and commitment for a comprehensive global response if we are to confront the challenges of our time.  It is in that light that Ghana wishes to reaffirm its commitment to the ideals of the United Nations and continue to live up to its Charter obligations  including playing an active role in international peacekeeping  in order to assist the Organization in its task of maintaining global peace and security and promoting fruitful and beneficial cooperation among Member States. We must resolve to muster the political will to strengthen the United Nations so that it can function effectively and redeem the majority of our peoples from wars  diseases and poverty by providing the financial and material resources required to discharge those onerous responsibilities.  It is only when we measure up to those responsibilities that we can give meaning to the phrase “We the peoples of the United Nations”."
"64",2669,"GIN",65,2010,"I have the honour to speak before the General Assembly to convey the warm greetings of the people and Government of Guinea  and most especially that of His Excellency General Sékouba Konaté  interim President of the Republic  President of the Transition. On this happy occasion  I would first of all like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I wish you every success and assure you in advance of my   23 10-55396  delegation’s support. Your undeniable personal qualities  in conjunction with proven ability  will certainly inspire our work at a time when our Organization faces numerous challenges involving the entire international community. I would also like to extend our gratitude to your predecessor   Mr. Abdussalam Treki  for the skill and dedication that he showed in carrying out his mandate.  Here  we would like to express our gratitude to our Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his tireless efforts to promote the noble ideals of the United Nations and  in particular  for his personal involvement in settling the crisis in my country.  On assuming power on 23 December 2008 against a background of political and economic crisis  the new Guinean authorities had to deal with many difficulties  in particular poor governance  State crimes  widespread insecurity and the proliferation and circulation of small arms and light weapons. That worrying situation led to the adoption of various measures to restore order and security  build national unity and establish a regime respectful of human rights and individual and public freedoms.   In that specific context  the agreement signed in Ouagadougou on 15 January 2010 enabled the people of Guinea  of all inclinations  to embark on a path of peace and dialogue and implement a political plan ensuring the return to constitutional order based on the rule of law and good governance. Despite pitfalls  that process of democratization led to the establishment of transitional bodies  specifically  a Government of national unity  led by a Prime Minister  a head of Government coming from the Forces vives  the National Transitional Council and the Independent National Electoral Commission  as well as a timetable setting the deadline for organizing free and transparent elections.  In a show of great commitment  following the adoption of the new Constitution  the people turned out in force on 27 June 2010 for the most free and democratic presidential election that the country had known since its independence in 1958. The second round of that important election is planned for the coming weeks.  Here  from this rostrum  I would like to launch an urgent appeal to the African and international communities to continue to support Guinea with a view to strengthening peace  stability and security in the subregion. I would also like to pay warm tribute to the Facilitator  His Excellency Mr. Blaise Compaore  President of Burkina Faso  for his tireless efforts to promote the democratic process in Guinea. I also extend that tribute to the International Contact Group on Guinea and  through it  the member States of the Economic Community of West African States and of the African Union  the international community and all friendly countries that are working with us at this critical time.  Peace and security continue to be threatened in some parts of the African continent and the world. Somalia continues to be subject to a fratricidal and painful war. In the Sudan  peace remains fragile despite the huge sacrifices and the investments granted. We urge the African Union and the international community to continue their efforts for a prompt and lasting settlement of those conflicts.  In Côte d’Ivoire  the recent political developments have made it possible for that friendly neighbouring country to move towards the presidential election planned for 31 October. That important step forward  in conjunction with the positive outcomes of the peacebuilding process in Sierra Leone and Liberia  give us real cause for encouragement and hope for the peoples of the Mano River Union.   With regard to Western Sahara  my Government supports the efforts of the United Nations and remains firmly committed to the Moroccan initiative on the negotiation of a status of autonomy for the Sahara region. It urges the stakeholders to find a lasting and mutually beneficial political solution.  The upsurge in threats and terrorist violence in Africa are a source of serious concern to Guinea. My country supports the prompt establishment of a consultative framework for action to eradicate that scourge.  In the Middle East  my delegation welcomes the direct talks between the Palestinian authorities and the Israeli Government under the auspices of the United States of America. It hopes that those talks will lead to the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian State  living side by side in peace with Israel. The Guinean Government believes that peace in that region can be achieved only in a climate of mutual trust and with a will to implement the agreements and relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. From that viewpoint  Israel must    10-55396 24  withdraw from the occupied Palestinian territories and end its settlement policy.  Only a week ago  in this Hall  the international community reiterated its commitment to the billions of people who are expecting it to make a reality of the promise of a better world expressed in the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). Guinea welcomes the holding of that summit  which allowed our heads of State and Government and our partners to reaffirm their will to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) within the agreed time frame.  My country remains convinced that achieving the Millennium Development Goals is within reach. That is borne out by the remarkable progress made in many areas by countries that are among the poorest on the planet. Barely five years from the 2015 deadline  we must step up the pace  particularly in the countries facing major challenges  in order to consolidate the achievements and make even more effective progress than we have to date.   In order to take up the many challenges of the twenty-first century  development partners and the international community have no choice but to step up efforts to work together to lend new impetus to international cooperation. My country urges all stakeholders to assume  at the national  regional and international levels  their share of responsibility in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.   The Republic of Guinea welcomes the progress made in recent years with regard to official development assistance. However  it regrets that long-standing commitments and those entered into more recently are far from being met. It is vital to reflect on all standard and supplementary sources of financing for development. Innovative financing is becoming an increasingly important means to mobilize additional  predictable and stable resources to supplement official development assistance.  Guinea  which attaches great importance to an increase in official development assistance  reiterates its proposal on organizing an African conference on innovative financing and drawing up a draft African declaration on transparency of financial governance and fighting illegal capital flows. The purpose of that conference would be to promote strategies to mobilize innovative financing as a complement to traditional aid and the domestic resources needed to fund the MDGs. The draft African declaration on transparency of financial governance and fighting illegal capital flows would seek to stem the immense capital outflows from Africa by redirecting them towards development of the continent.  Those proposals were warmly welcomed by various African bodies and the Leading Group on Innovative Financing for Development. They also received support at the twenty-fifth summit of heads of State and Government of Africa and France and the backing of the African Union at its fifteenth summit in Kampala. My delegation hopes that those initiatives will feature among the proposals for action on Africa during this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly.   Regarding international trade  we hope for a prompt conclusion of the Doha Round negotiations on the basis of an agreement that is both far-reaching and fair to all stakeholders  in particular the least developed countries. We again call for developed countries to respect their commitment to remove by 2013 all export subsidies that significantly distort trade and agricultural production in developing countries. My country welcomes the substantial progress made with respect to debt relief and urges the international community to continue its endeavours to effectively implement the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.  The subject of climate change quite rightly occupies a central place on the international agenda  given that phenomenon’s devastating effects. That reveals the emergence of a collective awareness and the real threat that that phenomenon poses to humankind.   Given that urgency  my country calls for concerted and courageous international efforts to alleviate the suffering of victims  particularly the vulnerable populations of poor countries. The commitments undertaken with regard to developing countries in terms of financial resources  technology transfer and capacity-building must be fulfilled  so that the appropriate measures can be undertaken to adapt to climate change and to mitigate its effects in those countries. In that connection  my delegation hopes that the climate conference to be held at the end of the year in Cancún  Mexico  will lead to an ambitious agreement that will commit States to concrete action.   As it is fully aware of the pressing need to act  the Guinean Government  for its part  is determined to assume its share of the responsibility  especially since   25 10-55396  Guinea plays a leading role in implementing all policies and strategies aimed at achieving sustainable development and restoring ecological balance in western African. As the source of over 20 rivers that irrigate the West African region  including the Niger  Senegal  Gambia and Makona Rivers  Guinea is a veritable water tower for Western Africa and the crucible for an incredibly rich biodiversity.  The main theme of this session  “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance”  is extremely timely. We acknowledge that most gratefully. In a highly interdependent world that is marked by the combined effects of many crises  a new culture of international solidarity is essential.   Likewise  a profound reform of our Organization is needed to make it more democratic  more representative and transparent. Sixty-five years after its creation  the United Nations does indeed need to be reformed in order to become more effective and better placed to meet the aspirations of our peoples. Let us make it an effective instrument in the service of peace  security  development and human rights. Only in that way will current and future generations in all countries and all regions of the world see their hopes of living in peace realized in a world that is free and prosperous  without fear  poverty or need."
"65",2708,"GMB",65,2010,"It is indeed a great honour and privilege for me to stand here and speak on behalf of the Gambia and the President of the Republic of the Gambia  His Excellency Al Hadji Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh.  First of all  I thank Allah  may He be glorified and exalted  for the opportunity of this moment  as we gather here to deliberate on ways to foster peaceful cooperation and development across the world. On behalf of my delegation and the Government and the people of the Gambia  I wish to thank the General Assembly for the warm welcome my delegation and I have received since our arrival. I also wish to offer deep congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  for his courage and for the outstanding and efficient leadership he demonstrated during the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We welcome His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss of Switzerland as  Mr. Treki’s successor as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We would assure Mr. Deiss of the Gambia’s support for his presidency. My delegation would also like to thank the Secretary-   10-55128 40  General for his tireless efforts in leading and managing the affairs of this highly complex Organization. Finally  I convey to all participants the good wishes of the Government and the people of the Republic of the Gambia.  It is clear that the recent upheavals and crises in the global arena have put into sharp focus what the United Nations can and must do as the springboard for coordinating global responses and solutions to global issues. For this reason  the theme that the President has chosen for the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly  namely  “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance”  is very apt and timely. Any reaffirmation of the pivotal role of the United Nations must start with respect for the purposes and principles of its Charter. In the same vein  the Organization must continue to implement the set of reforms that were introduced at the 2005 World Summit and other related United Nations summits and conferences. Without reform  the United Nations cannot be of relevance in the twenty-first century.  One of the major reforms that we all agreed on is that the size  composition and working methods of the Security Council should be improved. In the absence of action to implement the reform  the legitimacy of the actions of that body will be open to question. Africa’s demand for greater representation in all categories of Council membership is rooted in the need for justice and for an end to its marginalization. It is therefore high time to stop consigning Africa to the fate of second-class membership within the United Nations through its perpetual exclusion from the important decision-making that takes place in the Security Council.  For many years  I have called for a greater voice for developing countries in international and financial economic matters  and today I renew that call with a deep sense of urgency. As developing countries  we believe that the Economic and Social Council should be the leading platform for the discussion and formulation of global policies in the economic and social fields.  The achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) remains a major priority of my Government. Through various interventions  policies and programmes  we are poised to achieve and even surpass some of the Goals. However  as we run the last stretch before 2015  the critical need for greater international solidarity and partnership cannot be overemphasized. I am confident that the Gambia will attain all the Goals by 2015  as we are already on course to do so.  We should remind ourselves that the United Nations was created to unify the world  and not to divide it. The Organization should be seen to provide the most potent avenue for allaying fears and restoring hopes and aspirations  fighting for the rights of oppressed and desperate people the world over  and  above all  restraining bullies who seek to skew international politics  growth and development  most often using might and tyranny as weapons.  International criminal law and its institutions have a crucial role to play in global governance and hence the need to avoid selective prosecution and the politicization of court processes. In the world today  there is ample evidence to suggest the existence of the widespread abuse of power  oppression and violation of human rights through illegitimate wars and other forms of excessive intervention. There are times when strong nations attack and trample upon the sovereignty of the weak  while the United Nations and the world watch helplessly  doing nothing  except for a few who raise their voices in isolation.  This will not deter us or discourage us from highlighting the injustices that the International Criminal Court is supposed to set right. If that institution gives way to undue pressure or demonstrates weakness  its cracks may undermine the credibility of the international judicial system.  We know that there are leaders  past and present  who deserve to be dragged into the International Criminal Court for prosecution but they go about their business as if they were above the law. I ask whether this is acceptable.  As a consequence of all this  global governance  from the perspective of the United Nations  has to go beyond political systems aimed at exposing and neutralizing the strategies employed to subdue fragile States. Good governance  as the West prefers to refer to it  needs to permeate the finance structures — of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  for example — in order to render them more effective in offsetting the imbalances created through exploitation  control and protectionism. Indeed  these international financial powerhouses should be transformed into   41 10-55128  conduits for mitigating the effects of underdevelopment and poverty the world over.  It is lamentable that the assessment criteria for providing assistance to needy people or nations in distress are tied to political affiliations cloaked in inexplicable  good governance issues.  The Security Council has contributed to the unfair imposition of sanctions that have direct consequences for the lives of civilians. Such measures  often taken to bring down Governments  continue to expose this Organization and the ploys it subtly executes at the behest of powerful nations. We condemn such sanctions and recommend that thorough consultations and sounder procedures precede any sanctions that may have direct  negative impact on innocent lives.  Similarly  we condemn indiscriminate use of banned weapons with impunity while the Security Council does nothing to punish the culprits. Combatants should legitimately engage enemy combatants  and reckless attacks on defenceless people must not be condoned.  There are regional structures in almost every corner of the globe. The United Nations must recognize those structures and work closely with them to quell unrest wherever it erupts. To illustrate this point  let me observe that the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union (AU) have demonstrated ability  if adequately supported  to handle unrest on the African continent. I wish to call on the United Nations to intensify its collaboration with those groupings in crucial State and inter-State interventions.  The African Union and the subregional organizations in Africa have opened up many avenues for cooperation with the United Nations  especially in the area of preventive diplomacy. We would like to see greater support for the activities of the United Nations Office for West Africa.  It is an open secret that West Africa is suffering an onslaught of drug traffickers. We are committed to the fight against illegal narcotics  not only in the Gambia  but also in the whole of Africa  as illegal narcotics traffickers are holding some West African States hostage.  The dangers of narcotics transcend boundaries  as they provide a lot of money to dangerous criminals  including terrorists  who have no regard for human life. Given the enormous challenges that lie ahead of us in this battle  our security forces are alert and ready to cooperate with our neighbours and all those who share our concerns. We are determined more than ever to turn West Africa into a living hell for terrorists  drug traffickers as well as organized criminal gangs and human traffickers. This is a battle we must win  and win right.  Let me turn to the phenomenon of Islamophobia. It is important to note that the message of Islam is universal peace and progress  love for humanity and total submission to the will of Allah. History teaches us that Islamic civilization  which has flourished for 1 400 years  has always exhibited its unique capacity for peaceful coexistence  tolerance and compassion among global religions  manifested in the vast expanse of its dominions  cutting across parts of Europe  Africa  Asia and Eastern Europe  among other regions.  Islamic teachings condemn terrorism in all its manifestations and view such acts as not only savage but also criminal. Islam regards human life as sacred and condemns the killing of innocents. The world  and in particular the West  should therefore be wary of the actions of a small few  including those who abuse the Holy Koran and even threaten to burn it  thereby fuelling tensions and insecurity. Their actions constitute manipulations to judge Islam and its followers in the wrong way. We must not allow bigots  racists and evil entities in the West that are masquerading as nationalists and far right elements to spread a global war of religion. If this were to happen  the entire human race would suffer. Therefore  Western Governments should do more to stop these real terrorists who are on the rampage.  We maintain that the United Nations should play a lead role in combating terrorism through means approved by the General Assembly. Noting that terrorism is a global challenge  no unilateral action based on any form of doctrine should be taken by any nation against another  nor must the United Nations succumb to external pressure from any single nation in pursuit of national gains or interests. Conversely  we support the use of multilateral diplomacy and cooperation to complement internal measures where a particular nation is the target of terrorism.  My delegation’s position on the issues raised in this statement is to see to it that the United Nations reviews its governance structures in order to become    10-55128 42  more democratic. This would require that the representation quotas for various regions  particularly Africa and Asia  be redefined on the basis of the principles of fair play and justice  and not on the basis of sheer economic or military might.  We recommend that the laws and procedures governing the issue of arrest warrants  prosecution procedures and legal representation at the International Criminal Court also be reviewed objectively  in order to avoid politicization and the selective targeting of individuals.  We also urge that all sovereign States that have a legitimate Government based on the will and consent of their people be admitted to the United Nations  and this applies in particular to the Republic of China on Taiwan. We commend the countries on both sides of the Strait for their continuous progress in pursuing peace and shelving disputes over the past two years. While both States deserve special recognition and more encouragement  the United Nations also needs to be cognizant of the efforts by Taiwan in this peaceful process. It is important to note that Taiwan’s invitation to participate in the World Health Assembly as an observer in 2009 and 2010 not only enhanced international health and medical care networks  but also set a positive example for Taiwan’s participation. We therefore urge all Member States to ensure that other specialized agencies are opened up to Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the work of the United Nations.  Taiwan is contributing immensely to the international community through trade  investment  air transport  finance  telecommunications technology and environmental protection in the spirit of international cooperation. Therefore  we call upon the United Nations to find a proper way to accept Taiwan’s participation in all its specialized agencies  notably the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  The international community needs to recognize that Taiwan has adopted and pursued a pragmatic  moderate and steady foreign policy  and we therefore encourage United Nations specialized agencies to be open-minded with regard to Taiwan’s participation in their activities. It is our collective responsibility to enable the 23 million people of Taiwan to participate more visibly and make them able to function within the international system.  The United States embargo against Cuba is one of the longest running political disputes that this Assembly has needed to address for almost two decades. It is embarrassing that such a cruel and outmoded form of settling scores in international relations is still in place. The embargo has no legitimacy or appeal  and it is time for those that imposed it to show genuine leadership by ending it.  It is worth noting that the development of the African Union has shown that African leadership on African issues is the key to finding solutions to the problems that continue to plague the continent. From climate change to the undemocratic change of Governments  from peacekeeping to peacemaking  from development to regional integration  Africa has shown that it is ready to chart its destiny with dignity. That is what we are committed to  and all we ask of the international community is fulfilment of the pledges made to Africa. We are willing to cooperate with those that are willing to do so respecting the dignity of our countries  without humiliating conditionalities.  The Gambia’s commitment to peace and stability across Africa has been manifested not only in troop contributions  but also in our readiness at all times to find peaceful solutions to conflicts plaguing the African continent. We call on the international community to lend its full support to the efforts of the African Union and the United Nations to consolidate peace and stability across the Sudan.  As for Somalia  we recognize the need to empower the Government of Somalia  so that it can assert its authority over its territory  achieve lasting peace and  thus  address the problem of piracy. Supporting one faction against another is not a worthy solution to the Somali problem.  A major development in the evolution of the United Nations this year has been the creation of UN Women. As a firm believer in gender equality and women’s empowerment  my Government will do all in its power to support that entity. We wish the new board well and urge them to assign centre stage to gender issues and policies without politics.  Finally  we believe that there is no substitute for the United Nations  a body whose role in global governance we consider critical. The missing link has   43 10-55128  been the absence of a global governance framework to embrace universality and representation."
"66",2748,"GNB",65,2010,"First  I congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election to preside over the Assembly at this sixty-fifth session. I am convinced that our work will be crowned with success thanks to his proven competence and experience.  To the former President  Mr. Ali Treki  I express my recognition of the wise manner in which he conducted the Assembly’s work during its sixty-fourth session.  My compliments also go to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  and the entire United Nations team  the women and men who  on our behalf   15 10-55103  and on behalf of the nations and peoples of the world  work throughout the four corners of the planet to preserve human dignity  in which are expressed the values of peace and security  resulting in the development of friendly relations among nations and in international cooperation. To them all I express our respect and admiration for their courage and selflessness.  Similarly  I congratulate the Assembly on the recent adoption of resolution 65/1  on the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  10 years after their adoption. This important document will certainly create a new climate for the achievement of the eight Goals by 2015.  My compliments to all those present are also extended on behalf of the people of my country  which just yesterday  24 September  celebrated its thirty-seventh year as a sovereign  independent State. The country has undergone a series of transformations  but we must recognize that there remains much to be desired in terms of meeting legitimate aspirations for social and economic progress. Such progress would translate into improved quality of life and well-being for our combatant people  on whose behalf Amílcar Cabral spoke from this rostrum more than 40 years ago  in an historic statement in the fight against colonial domination.  Thus at the present session  when the peoples of the world meet to evaluate the fulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals and to define new strategies to achieve them by 2015  Guinea-Bissau is still dealing with essential  basic factors for the achievement of goals that are so fair and that everyone deserves: stability  peace and security.  Less than a year ago we dealt with tragic events that had a major impact on Guinea-Bissau’s internal and external image and led to early presidential elections  which exactly a year and seven days ago resulted in my starting to guide the country’s destiny. The heinous acts to which I refer were unanimously condemned. The international community supported the country in its efforts to prepare and hold elections which ultimately were considered to be free  fair and transparent  and at the same time to consolidate peace and internal security  particularly with reforms of public administration  of defence and security and of judicial power  and with support for the State budget.  There was a positive trend in projecting the image of the country and dealing with new challenges: the promotion of internal and institutional dialogue; the mobilization of development partners; the organization of a high-level meeting in New York; and the preparation of a planned donors’ round table  scheduled to be held before the end of this year  to discuss the development of Guinea-Bissau.  Unfortunately  that trend contrasted with the incident of 1 April this year  which of course was to be condemned. The handling of the incident and its consequences did not receive the understanding of all the partners of Guinea-Bissau  despite the country’s authority having been maintained with a dynamic harmonization at the local  bilateral  regional and international levels. In this world body  let me appeal to all our partners to proceed in the same spirit of friendship  solidarity  assistance and cooperation with our people and their democratically elected institutions  because it is now  in our current circumstances  that our country most needs such support.  The reform that we desire in our defence and security sector  for which we have sought international assistance  has become a matter of prime urgency and extreme sensitivity. The main target is the very men and women who 40 years ago bartered their youth and education — in other words  their future — for our national liberation: the same armed forces who were then so applauded and admired for their determination and courage in forging the freedom and independence of the peoples of Guinea and Cape Verde  as well as for their intervention in other theatres of war  following their international vocation. Today  an appropriate structure to attend to their basic needs is lacking  resulting in an erosion of dignity already won  and thus in a threat to the peace  stability and well-being of our people.  Another consideration is that Guinea-Bissau has an insular platform comprising more than 80 islands and reefs  where a confluence of favourable waters and winds creates an ideal microclimate for much of the world’s fauna  in what could and should be a true paradise. Instead  due to an assumed inability of the authorities to exercise effective control  there is a risk that it may become a sanctuary of evil-doers who use and abuse the space and the local people  leading to a regrettable situation  giving us a terrible reputation and    10-55103 16  potentially compromising the proper functioning of Government institutions.  The Assembly may find those facts frightening and deserving of condemnation. They are tragic and completely alien to the people of my country. A coordinated regional and global response is needed in order to take advantage of all the synergies that can be mobilized.  However  to this body of nations  of which we are proud to be an integral part  we bring more than a lament in the hope of an appropriate response not only commensurate with the problems but at the level of the capacity that mankind has already demonstrated. We are making our contribution as a people that is confident  mobilized and determined  a people proud of its past and determined to reverse the current situation. We bring a guarantee of multifaceted involvement in harmonizing an extensive internal dialogue  whose foundations we have just laid jointly with the Guinean parliament: an initiative on ways to consolidate peace and development. This will culminate with a conference on national reconciliation  to restore the promise of a positive and lasting commitment.  Despite the current serious situation  for which we take full responsibility  we have never confused our internal problems with those of our friends  and we take great pride in our present stable relations with our neighbours. Similarly  we are proud of the peaceful spirit of our people  who never blame others for our own problems and do not feel any animosity towards the thousands of world citizens who continue to choose our country as a place in which to settle.  During the period of instability we have nonetheless preserved some 15 per cent of our territory as a protected area and nature reserve  as has been highlighted in particular by international organizations such as UNESCO  the International Union for Conservation of Nature and others. That is a major contribution to meeting the universal concern for the preservation of biological and ecological balance in this International Year of Biodiversity  within the context of severe climate change that affects us all.  So  we call urgently for the solidarity and support that Member States can give my people. We appreciate and express the warmest gratitude for the attention we have received from our regional organization  the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  headed by Nigeria  in the form not only of stabilization initiatives  but also of concrete support for Government programmes. We similarly salute the follow-up and attention provided by the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries  which shows a spirit of determination at the bilateral and multilateral levels  as evidenced by the restoration of a climate of trust conducive to peace  stability and development.  Within the same framework  we salute the contribution of Portugal and Brazil  again at both the bilateral and multilateral levels  to keeping the world’s attention focused on giving Guinea-Bissau another chance. This extends to various other countries and institutions that maintain with us a relationship based on partnership and cooperation. I think particularly of Senegal  Libya  China  Cuba  the United States  France  Algeria  Morocco and South Africa  among others  as well as ECOWAS  the African Union and the European Union  along with the United Nations itself  through the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau.  The unstable internal socio-political environment that I have outlined has a negative impact on management of my country’s public finances  despite the Executive’s great and broadly acknowledged efforts. This means that our financial situation is very difficult  despite some recovery in our growth rate  which stood at 2.7 per cent in 2007 and 3.5 per cent in 2008.  The international crisis of 2009 had a small direct impact  and the country registered growth of 3 per cent thanks to a good agricultural year. The increase in international basic commodity prices in 2008 accelerated inflation  which reached an annual average of 10.4 per cent  though it retreated in 2009. The good performance in 2008-2009 in the export of cashew nuts  representing 90 per cent of exports  led to an improvement in the balance of payments  including donations.  However  the external debt burden continued to be unsustainable. At the end of 2009 it was equivalent to 126 per cent of the corrected gross domestic product and 640 per cent of exports of goods and services. The fact that we were unable to complete the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative resulted in an accumulation of delays in paying the external debt.  In 2008 the Government concluded with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) a post-conflict programme  later extended to 2009  which successive   17 10-55103  IMF missions evaluated as being broadly satisfactory. Hence  on 7 May this year the IMF Executive Board approved a three-year agreement with my country based on a credit facility which will cover the period 2010-2012.  The public administration of Guinea-Bissau has earned a very positive evaluation by the IMF and the World Bank  which reflects the extraordinary effort in fulfilling the programmatic targets set with regard to cleaning up public finances and regularizing major expenses. Therefore  it is essential that partners show no hesitation that might jeopardize the fulfilment of the decision-point requirements of the HIPC Initiative.  We are coming to the end of the first decade of the millennium  which had been declared a decade of globalization  with the promotion of a lasting peace and aimed at a new international order. We cannot slide backwards  nor can we show weakness in the face of the challenge that we have set ourselves in addressing problems such as migration  human trafficking and the trafficking of organs and trying to find ethically acceptable responses to them.  We support the efforts being made to resolve the conflicts in the Middle East  through coexistence of a Palestinian State with the State of Israel. Our membership of the Alliance of Civilizations and of the Community of Democracies in particular is based on the rules of peaceful coexistence among ethnicities and religions  and on the promotion of human rights.  We support global efforts to rehabilitate Haiti and we also follow with great attention and interest the process that will lead to the restructuring of the Security Council. We hope that this will result in a more equitable representation of the world and be a factor in the ascent of the African continent towards peace  democracy and development."
"67",2787,"GNQ",65,2010,"I have the great honour to speak at the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo  President and head of State of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  who is not able to be here to participate  as he would have liked  owing to numerous high matters of State.  In the name of the Government and the people of Equatorial Guinea  I would first like to address our most sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on your unanimous and wise election as President of the General Assembly at this session. We wish you great success in leading its work and deliberations. I also extend our thanks to the other elected members of the Bureau. Most especially  we wish to express our admiration and respect to His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  outgoing President and eminent diplomat of Africa  who did outstanding work as President at the sixty-fourth session and who is responsible for our beginning this session with optimism.  The Republic of Equatorial Guinea reaffirms its resolute commitment and attachment to the ideals  principles and objectives of the United Nations. In that context  I salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and reiterate to him the recognition of the Government and people of Equatorial Guinea of his wise administration at the head of this great Organization. In particular  we appreciate his vision and the timeliness with which he has identified the seven strategic themes of our current world  which merit the greatest attention from every State Member during this session.  Equatorial Guinea is taking part in the work of this session with a good deal of optimism with regard to an eventual and gradual solution of the problems today facing humankind in general  and the African continent in particular. Above all  that is because since the 1990s there have been several initiatives aimed at encouraging sustainable development. Those initiatives have been promoted through major world conferences and summits that have addressed such major subjects as population and sustainable development  food  the environment and financing for development. In the context of this 2010 session  we shall consider the implementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of those major summits and conferences  such as the Millennium Summit.  What can we see after more than 10 years since those summits  especially the Millennium Summit? As has been wisely pointed out in previous interventions in the Assembly  there is no point in doing things in the same way and expecting different results.  Unfortunately  both the report of the Secretary-General (A/65/1) and the interventions delivered in recent days by different delegations during the High-   10-55264 38  level Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals indicate that rather than improving  the number of people who suffer from hunger has increased  the number of those living in poverty remains high and the environment has been degraded. The latter has led to serious climactic changes and the ensuing natural disasters  including constant flooding  earthquakes  hurricanes and so on  which have caused total destruction in several countries and seriously undermined people’s ability to survive.  Were that not enough  there has also been an increase in acts of international terrorism  organized and cross-border crime and piracy on a continental level. There has also been a worsening in the acute economic crisis  which continues to affect all humankind. All those phenomena illustrate the need for greater awareness and coordination on the part of every country on the planet.  All of us must focus our efforts  energy and resources on promoting and maintaining peace and security in the world  fostering a healthy environment and actively working and cooperating to eradicate nuclear weapons and to forcefully combat terrorism and international organized crime. We should work side by side to shape a world where there is a sense of participation and equality among men and women; a world where Security Council reform allows for better representation  participation and decision-taking that reflect the will and interests of every region and country of the world — large  medium or small.  Previous interventions have underscored the importance that “every Member country of the United Nations be clearly involved here  at the heart of the United Nations  to respond to urgent matters of today’s world”. It was that call that  in 2007  inspired His Excellency the President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea to propose to the General Conference of the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization — UNESCO — the creation of an international prize for scientific investigation in the field of life sciences. That $3 million contribution is destined for the international scientific community  and its purpose is to seek solutions and remedies to the major pandemics and diseases that afflict the world today in general and especially the African continent.  Despite the great need of the international scientific community  despite the potential to alleviate the suffering of vulnerable communities  particularly in Africa  despite having been duly approved by the States members of the UNESCO Executive Board  and despite the unanimous decision of the international jury for the prize designating three international scientists  most of them from developing countries  as winners  this prize is still being blocked simply for being the initiative of an African leader.  The Republic of Equatorial Guinea cannot but denounce the manipulations and manoeuvres of the new UNESCO administration against the humanitarian initiative of the people of Equatorial Guinea. As a State member  we find it unprecedented and therefore disturbing that a decision made by the Executive Board of a United Nations agency is not carried out by its leadership. What is most disturbing is that clear manipulations and injustices of certain undeclared interests have become apparent even in the heart of the United Nations-related organizations  as is  unfortunately  the case with UNESCO  where we believed that all the member States had the same consideration and rights.  For all of those reasons  the people and Government of Equatorial Guinea agree that this is the appropriate occasion and place to once more express their deep concern regarding the irresponsible  openly unjust and racist attitude that some actors  masked as non governmental organizations  are orchestrating against the praiseworthy initiative and the humanitarian intentions that led to the creation of the UNESCO Obiang Nguema Mbasogo Prize to motivate and encourage the action of scientists around the world in research for the preservation of life.  The Republic of Equatorial Guinea asks that the UNESCO Obiang Nguema Mbasogo International Prize for Research in the Life Sciences come to fruition without further delay  in accordance with decision 180 EX/57  which was adopted by consensus by all the States members of the UNESCO Executive Board in October 2008.  The Republic of Equatorial Guinea is an independent and sovereign State  governed by a democratic and pluralist political system that respects the basic rights of people without racial  ethnic  gender or religious discrimination. Those principles are contained in the fundamental law and in the laws that serve as the basis for our country’s legal system  which guarantees and promotes the individual and collective freedoms of the citizens of Equatorial Guinea and   39 10-55264  provides for punishment for offenders who could violate the rule of law. Indeed  the Constitution of Equatorial Guinea reserves an important and privileged place for human rights and basic freedoms  inasmuch as they are based on the United Nations Charter and their principles and goals are inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Therefore  our country has begun a reform of its judicial system and has already ratified several international agreements and treaties concerning the promotion and protection of human rights  which have come to be an integral part of our legal system. Likewise  in the last 10 years the Government has made significant progress in updating and adapting its legislative  legal and administrative instruments with regard to the promotion and protection of civil and political rights  as well as social  economic and cultural rights.  In addition to those enormous and ongoing efforts  the Government of Equatorial Guinea has taken several other relevant measures and provisions to strengthen the implementation of the laws in force in the country in order to promote human rights and the rule of law. A particular instance is the recent enactment of the new Organic Law of Judicial Power  which determines the overall organization of the judicial system and the operation of justice in Equatorial Guinea.  In recent years  the world’s nations have witnessed an intensification and increase of violence in acts of terrorism  in particular starting with the tragedy that took place in this beautiful and historic North American city of New York on 11 September 2001. Such acts have meant that the fight against terrorism has become a one of the priorities of international and national policy of all countries.  In that disturbing context  the United Nations and international law have been defining a set of very strict obligations that States must comply with in order to ensure an effective fight against that global scourge  which affects all States equally  irrespective of nationality or borders. In particular  we must bear in mind resolution 1373 (2001)  and other related resolutions of the Security Council  which represents an important milestone with regard to international standards in the fight against terrorism. Indeed  that resolution is a general standard and imposes upon States a set of obligations that include that of criminalizing specific conducts  such as the financing of terrorism or the recruitment of members of terrorist groups. Consequently  the implementation of international standards in the fight against terrorism and  in particular  its criminal classification  is not merely a decision of domestic criminal policy  but rather a matter of compliance with obligations imposed by international law in general.  Our country has been a victim of terrorist attacks on several occasions in the past five years  and as a result the Government of Equatorial Guinea has put the fight against terrorism among the priorities of its Action Plan for national development  while at the same time condemning in the most vigorous terms all acts of terrorism  regardless of their motivation or origin  since those acts constitute one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.  Equatorial Guinea remains loyal to its commitments and is deeply convinced of the need to continue the efforts it has been deploying in connection with the Millennium Declaration and in harmony with the purposes and principles of the United Nations aimed at overcoming the many challenges of development.  However  the current situation requires a closer and more dynamic  effective  sincere and coordinated cooperation  without any conditions  as well as the coordinated and united support of all of the political forces of developed  developing and least developed countries  with a view to promoting shared prosperity and a better future for all the world’s countries.  I would like to conclude my statement on behalf of the Government of Equatorial Guinea by renewing our strong desire to change the current concept and management of international affairs — in which the often exclusive attitudes of certain States and regions can be discerned — through a firmer and more sincere commitment of the entire international community in favour of the current United Nations reform process which is designed to strengthen multilateralism. Only in that way can we establish solid and lasting bases for a world of peace and security — a prosperous world for today and a solid inheritance for future generations."
"68",2833,"GRC",65,2010,"I would like to thank the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki of Libya  for his tireless efforts in taking forward the Assembly’s work and to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President at the sixty-fifth session.  I would also like at this point to fully align my country’s positions with those expressed in the statement of the European Union (EU). It is my firm belief that the General Assembly would greatly benefit from arrangements that would allow EU representatives to fulfil their responsibilities in an effective manner at formal meetings.  We can all agree that the United Nations is the only global entity that commands universal legitimacy and is the Organization to which we should all look  and actively support  in order to provide collective and therefore optimal solutions to the ever-growing array of multifaceted issues confronting us. It is a fact that meeting the needs of our peoples increasingly transcends the abilities of individual nation-States. That is where the role of the United Nations comes to the fore  and it is why our discussions on reforming and revitalizing the Organization are of paramount importance.  Climate change is the world’s greatest environmental challenge. We all know that it will increasingly affect all aspects of our lives  including peace and security. We now need to focus all efforts in order to secure a successful outcome of the upcoming summit in Cancún.  The Greek Government is proposing a new Mediterranean Climate Change Initiative  in close collaboration with Mediterranean countries that are strongly committed to climate and energy security. A formal launch of the Initiative is planned on 22 October in Athens  ahead of the Cancún summit. In the same vein  the central theme of our Chairmanship-in-Office of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation is “the Black Sea turns green”.  The recent global economic and financial crisis has left few countries unaffected. Greece was no exception  despite the tough and radical reform agenda we are implementing that is setting the country steadily back on its feet. Efforts for a more efficient and concrete global financial regulatory framework are necessary. In that regard  I welcome the results of the High-level Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals  and I commend the Secretary-General for his timely initiative.  Greece continues to support all efforts for an effective and efficient Human Rights Council with enhanced status  mandate  structures and membership. Greece will actively defend the relevance of the Human Rights Council through its candidacy for the years 2012 to 2015.  Promoting effective interaction and coordination between the United Nations and regional organizations must be one of our key priorities. We consider the upcoming 2010 summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) a major   27 10-55264  milestone in the European security dialogue — the well-known Corfu Process  launched by the Greek OSCE Chairmanship in 2009.  Greece has made a commitment especially to our region and its people. A key factor for bringing stability and development to our region is good-neighbourliness  a fundamental principle that together with the other principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations constitutes the cornerstone of contemporary international legal order.  The Balkans —our immediate neighbourhood — is still a sensitive area in terms of stability. The dust from the dissolution of Yugoslavia has not yet settled. Greece’s vision for the Balkans is of a region in which democracy finally becomes the norm  where citizens’ aspirations can finally be realized through peaceful and democratic practices  where the rights of minorities are respected  and where Governments are accountable  economies are transparent and politics allow for the fullest participation of all elements of society.  In order to breathe new life into the prospect of the Balkans’ integration into the European Union  Greece has put forward a new initiative known as Agenda 2014. There are still open wounds in our region — Kosovo being the most pressing — and we must ensure that this time the European Union will be present with a strong voice. The European prospect for our entire region can boost the political process that is about to begin on Kosovo. At the same time  we need to keep an open and clear path for Serbia to begin accession negotiations with the European Union.  Another open issue in the Balkans revolves around the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. That is not a bilateral  pedantic dispute about historic symbols  as some may try to portray it  but a regional question with deep historical roots related to good-neighbourliness. A compromise on the name issue is needed. Greece has already done its part. A fair and lasting solution can be based only on a name with a geographic qualifier to be used for all purposes  erga omnes. Let me explain why.  Macedonia is a large geographic region  most of which lies in Greece. A small part is in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and a smaller part in Bulgaria. The part cannot represent the whole  and the exclusive claims of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the name “Macedonia” cannot be allowed to fuel nationalism. Any solution must be universally implemented  because otherwise today’s situation will simply be perpetuated. We have intensified our efforts to reach a settlement in the context of the established United Nations negotiating process  led by Mr. Nimetz.  I chose the General Assembly  which is the natural forum for solving international disputes  to declare once again Greece’s readiness to reach a solution  even tomorrow  and to call upon Prime Minister Gruevski to display leadership and become our partner for progress  progress that will result in a bright and prosperous future for our neighbours in the European Union — a future we wish to see become a reality soon. Greece is extending a hand of friendship and cooperation. The time has come for our neighbours to take that hand.  The Arab-Israeli conflict is again at a turning point. The resumption of direct talks was a significant achievement  but only the beginning. Now our number one priority is to sustain that dialogue and for it to bear fruit. Both sides have an obligation to show respect for that fragile diplomatic process. Actions that threaten its very existence  like Israeli settlement construction  must be avoided in order to prevent the negotiations from becoming one more exercise in futility.  I would like to thank the Secretary-General and all those who labour with him for a just solution in Cyprus  a solution based on United Nations resolutions for a bi-zonal  bi-communal federation with one international personality  one citizenship and one sovereignty  a solution in full conformity with the acquis communautaire.  Cyprus is a tragic example of where our shared sense of justice — our shared code of values — has gone astray. Cyprus is the victim of military invasion and remains occupied by foreign troops. That is the truth; that is reality  and it must end. We need to move beyond that situation. It will take courage from everyone involved. It is a matter of political will  resolution and determination  such as that displayed by President Christofias.  I extend my appeal to the Turkish Cypriots. We want you near us  in our wider European family. The participation of a reunited Cyprus in the European Union means that every Cypriot enjoys safety  equality under the law  protection of their human rights  appropriate representation and security under a European roof. Let me be clear: in the modern    10-55264 28  European environment  relics of the past  such as guarantor Powers  seem and sound anachronistic and completely out of touch.  Turkey can prove its commitment to a lasting solution to the Cyprus issue by withdrawing its occupation forces from the island  thus boosting both the negotiation process and its own European perspective.  Greek-Turkish relations are an important parameter for the stability of the region. Burdened by a heavy historical past as we are  it is not an easy task to change course and turn a long-standing rivalry into good-neighbourliness  free from the threat of the use of force or unfounded territorial claims. Respect for international law is the sole basis for a healthy and peaceful relationship between our two countries.  We have opened a dialogue  one that is honest  and although we may and do differ on many issues  such as how we see Cyprus and how we approach our bilateral relations  this open approach can only lead to a progressive resolution of our problems. The Turkish leadership and the people of Turkey know we are honest in what we say and in our desire for a new and peaceful relationship. I strongly believe our mutual interests can outweigh our political differences. We can and must resolve these differences through peaceful means  and a possible way to go is through the International Court of Justice.  I do not want to give the false impression that all our problems have suddenly been resolved. It is most distressing that a variety of statements and acts still undermine this very genuine and difficult effort. The long-standing threat of war  the casus belli against my country  is unacceptable and has no place in our European and global family of values and principles.  There are those who certainly may wish that our efforts fail  but it is our historical duty to overcome those difficulties and maintain the momentum in response to our peoples’ mandate and their desire for peace.  We look forward to the day when Belgrade and Pristina will be an easy bus ride away  when Jerusalem and Damascus  Athens and Ankara and  of course  the two parts of divided Nicosia will no longer be separated by fear and suspicion  but will be joined in peace. Those were the words used and the vision expressed by George Papandreou  today’s Prime Minister of Greece  in his very first address to the General Assembly as Greek Foreign Minister in 1999 (see A/54/PV.9). Allow me repeat those words and vision in my first address to this body in the same capacity. This is a wish and vision that  I think  we all share.  "
"69",2874,"GRD",65,2010,"I am honoured to address this body. I do so at a time when the world continues to face multiple challenges  foremost of which for small island developing States such as Grenada is the fragile economic  financial and ecological situation. But despite those difficult circumstances  the people of Grenada demonstrate tremendous resilience. Resourcefulness  patience and abiding faith in God keep us going forward. We will therefore not relent. Our resolve is firm. Dedication  creativity  renewed commitment to our fellow beings  unwavering commitment to multilateralism and  most of all  solidarity will help us survive these trying times.  Indeed  as it did in the past  this body can again prove to be the perfect partner in our quest to solve our problems  if only we commit ourselves to cooperate more with each other. Carefully targeted technical and other forms of assistance to countries most in need would make a vast difference in the lives of millions.  It is in that spirit that I join the many speakers who preceded me in congratulating you  Mr. President  on your election to guide the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. You have Grenada’s full support.  We commend the outgoing President  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  for his dedication and able handling of the Assembly’s work in the year just ended and wish him the very best for the future. In addition  Grenada recognizes the tireless stewardship and leadership of the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  as the United Nations tackles the very complex array of global issues.  In her July address to the United Nations  Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II  head of the Commonwealth of Nations  concluded her remarks with customary clarity and insightfulness  affirming that the United Nations is a real force for common good (see A/64/PV.105). Grenada supports that statement.  At the very inception of the Organization  65 years ago  its objectives were to avoid future wars and maintain the peace  and to partner with developing countries in their social and economic development. Grenada is satisfied that after more than six decades of existence  those goals remain worthy of continuing pursuit.  In times of conflict  strife  natural disasters and other humanitarian matters  the United Nations has   19 10-55128  been the first place to turn to. Its relevance  role and involvement in global affairs remain unquestionable. Any weakening of its authority and effectiveness cannot be in our best interests. The United Nations must remain the premier organization for global diplomacy and negotiations. We must do nothing to hinder the United Nations continuing as a real force for good in the world. Indeed  the United Nations must lead  not follow  in global governance.  Times have changed. The world is facing new realities  and the United Nations must adjust accordingly. For that reason  the recent advances made in United Nations system-wide coherence deserve special commendation. The formation of the new body  UN Women  aimed principally at promoting the rights of women and girls and equality between the sexes  is an early success of United Nations reform and is embraced by Grenada. Our desire to actively participate in the fulfilment of the noble objectives of UN Women has led us to seek membership on its Executive Board. I am hopeful that Grenada’s candidacy will receive strong support and be elected.  Similarly  the United Nations must recognize the inherent imperatives of democracy. Continued failure to meaningfully reform the Security Council will deny that body the political legitimacy it needs to maintain and indeed enhance its leadership role. Grenada joins with the Caribbean Community and calls for a Security Council seat for small island States as soon as possible.  Climate change is rightly described as one of the most urgent issues facing humanity and must remain at the top of the global diplomatic and negotiating agenda. Left unchecked  its potential consequences could be catastrophic  particularly for small island developing States. Recent studies confirm that over the past five decades the planet has heated up and that 93 per cent of this warming has occurred in the oceans. The consequential rise in sea level is already affecting low-lying countries in the Caribbean and beyond and is undermining small economies  ruining their societies and threatening their very existence.  In that connection  we continue to call for ambitious mitigation targets and to welcome climate financing. Fast-start funding in the amount of  $30 billion  announced in 2009 and intended to assist developing countries  especially the most climate-vulnerable nations  has reached only a small percentage of developing countries  and just a fraction of promised funds has been released. Clearly  that situation has to be corrected  for financial assistance must be commensurate with the scale of the threat faced and should be sustained  especially for small island developing States.  Grenada welcomes the empanelling of the Secretary-General’s High-level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing and the High-level Panel on Global Sustainability. We anticipate that in their reports the matter of appropriate and sustainable levels of climate-change financing will be properly addressed and promoted.  What an important review year 2010 is. We applaud the High-level Plenary Meeting on biodiversity (see  and PV.10) and support the call to halt species loss. We welcome the convening of the High-level Review Meeting on the implementation of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States (MSI+5) (see  and PV.18). In its capacity as Chair of the Alliance of Small Island States  Grenada was privileged to play a coordinating role in that important review process  and we thank all  including our development partners and the United Nations  for undertaking the process with us. Now that this body has endorsed the political declaration  we call for quick and full implementation of the MSI+5 decisions.  Similarly  Grenada welcomes the Millennium Development Goals and remains firm in its determination to achieve them. Our report submitted in the just-concluded review process indicated that while Grenada has made progress  there is much more to be done to achieve the established Goals within the five years that remain.  It is our view that if our countries are to eliminate poverty and realize their true potential  there must be a comprehensive review of the criteria for determining middle-income status. Many countries placed in that category  including Grenada  are highly indebted and deserve special attention in order to achieve sustainable development. Small island developing States cannot attain their full potential if they are prematurely set adrift in the development ocean with a false diagnosis of full preparedness. No matter what its growth pattern or level  a country with 37 per cent poverty and debt-to-GDP ratio of over 100 per cent —    10-55128 20  as is the case with Grenada — cannot be ready to sail the high seas of development financing autonomy. That day will come  but it is not yet here.  Grenada registers its strong support for the call for a United Nations high-level meeting on non-communicable diseases — NCDs. Currently  NCDs constitute the main cause of morbidity and mortality in our region. Life expectancy depends to a great extent on the avoidance of such illnesses  and thus preventative policies must be aimed at promoting changes in lifestyles. Therefore  we view with a great degree of satisfaction the progress made by our Caribbean representatives here at the United Nations in articulating the need for such a meeting in 2011. I pledge Grenada’s participation at the highest level.  Grenada has confidence in the United Nations and in the work it can do. We unreservedly support the pursuit of international peace and security  the rule of law  the promotion of democracy and human rights  the fight against terrorism  the fight against the illicit drug trade and the many other issues that threaten our world.  We also believe in justice. The economic progress and realization of the full potential of a fellow Caribbean nation continues to be stifled by a now infamous economic embargo of over 45 years. As a result  its people are humiliated by shortages and deprived of basic necessities essential to decent human existence. The vast majority of countries in the world have consistently and overwhelmingly voted in this very forum for its removal  but the irony persists.  Grenada again urges the United States of America to do what is right and completely lift the harsh economic measures against the people of Cuba  if only on humanitarian grounds. In the spirit of fair trade and good-neighbourliness  Grenada also calls on the United States to honour the recent decision in favour of Antigua and Barbuda in the World Trade Organization  as that too would show respect for the decisions of international tribunals.  Grenada reminds the world of the Caribbean Community’s instant and pivotal response and continuing presence in Haiti  following the devastating earthquake earlier this year. The successful rebuilding of Haiti will benefit all  and Grenada calls for a swift delivery of the pledged commitments made to that sister Caribbean nation.  We are obliged to work selflessly to preserve the world for future generations. The avoidance of a nuclear confrontation is one sure way. We therefore congratulate the Government of the United States and all other Governments that have put much time and effort towards the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.  We are also encouraged by recent positive signs of engagement between warring parties  and we hope that political and military conflicts around the world and  moreover  in the Middle East will soon come to an end. Grenada is particularly pleased that the Palestinians and Israelis are prepared to resume talks over their long-standing dispute with a view to finding a lasting peace once and for all.  We empathize with the many countries that have had to cope with recent natural disasters: Chile  China  Pakistan  New Zealand and Guatemala.  Over the decades  the United Nations has played critical roles in almost every facet of global affairs: political  economic and social. That is its strength  its enduring mission. Grenada remains ready to work with all who are partnering in political  economic and social development and seeing the United Nations as a forum for working through all thorny issues.  However  there will be no international peace and stability if people are unhappy  if they have no food or clothing  if they have no potable water or shelter from adverse climatic conditions. There will be no security if disputes cannot be settled amicably  if nations are not free to determine their own destiny and if diversity among us is not recognized and fully respected. The world would certainly be a better place if we shared our world’s resources to assist the more vulnerable among us.  I challenge this Organization  for another 65 years starting with this sixty-fifth session  to harness our strengths and continue to make the United Nations what we all want it to be — a real force for good in the world. "
"70",2921,"GTM",65,2010,"Our President  Mr. Álvaro Colom Caballeros  participated in the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (see A/65/PV.3) but had to return to Guatemala owing to commitments related to his high office. Similarly  our Minister for Foreign Affairs  who unexpectedly had to leave New York yesterday. It is for this reason that I have the high honour of presenting this message  which was prepared to be presented today by the Minister.    10-55276 40   Before proceeding  I should like to express our profound gratitude to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his outstanding performance in heading the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Likewise  Mr. Deiss  we wish you every success as President for the current session. We have no doubt that with your vast experience you will guide our deliberations and enhance the work of the General Assembly as the main policymaking organ of the United Nations.  We have just concluded our review of the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals  adopted 10 years ago in an international environment that was perhaps more encouraging than today’s. As has been highlighted in recent days  the results reflect both light and shadow  with some countries showing impressive gains  and others even suffering setbacks. The majority have made progress on some of the Goals but not in others  or have made advances whose benefits have been distributed very unequally among different segments of the population.   In addition  today’s international environment is far less encouraging than that of 10 years ago. The previous decade began with the attack on the twin towers in this very city  placing counter-terrorism squarely as a priority on the international agenda. It continued with a military confrontation that was not sanctioned by the Security Council  with all its consequences  and concluded with three simultaneous crises — food  energy and  especially  financial and economic — from whose effects we have yet to recover.   Further  after building up a cumulative body of scientific evidence that no longer allows any room for doubt  we have confirmed that the very effects of technological progress have brought with them devastating consequences for our common habitat — this planet — and that the destruction wrought by climate change is palpable and dramatic. On another matter  in the current decade we have witnessed very clearly that organized crime does not recognize borders and tends to spread to those countries with the least capacity to confront its considerable resources.  My own country has been a victim of some of these phenomena  which nullify or at least mitigate the considerable efforts we have deployed  especially since the Administration of President Colom took office early in 2008  to stimulate development  achieve higher levels of well-being for the disadvantaged sectors of our population  and strengthen our democratic institutions. Here again we see both light and shadow: in spite of an unfavourable international environment and as President Colom noted in this very Hall on 20 September  we have achieved progress is addressing some of the pressing problems faced by the our country’s most vulnerable.   But the shadow is still present. Its origin lies in phenomena that are totally or partially out of our control. I highlight three of them. First  the financial and economic crisis had a sharp adverse impact on our economic performance. Gross national product grew less than 1 per cent in 2009  with declining exports  shrinking family remittances and collapsing foreign direct investment. This had an extremely negative impact on our tax revenues  in spite of the many Government initiatives to raise tax rates to deal with increasing demands for social services and public security. Although we have seen a modest recovery this year  its strength will depend to a large degree on uncertain developments in the international economy. In other words  the international economic environment has not been very conducive to meeting our economic growth goals  in spite of the official cooperation that we have received  which we sincerely appreciate.  Secondly  in the last decade a array of unlawful activities related to organized crime have taken root in our country. Trafficking in persons  arms and narcotics  and money laundering have expanded to a worrisome extent  given the dual abilities of organized criminal groups to co-opt and intimidate. Above all  drug trafficking has undermined our democratic institutions. In response  we have associated ourselves with the United Nations and friendly countries  through both bilateral and multilateral cooperation. This can be seen mostly clearly in the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG)  to which I will return later. Furthermore  recognizing that the struggle against illegal activities and organized crime — a basic responsibility of all States — has today assumed a clearly transnational character  we have joined our neighbours in Central America and Mexico in combating regional criminal networks.  Thirdly  as if what I have already said were not enough  we have also fallen victim to natural disasters with an unusual frequency  which highlights the extreme vulnerability of Guatemala to the effects of climate change  given its location in a tropical area. We had not even begun to recover from the effects of tropical storm Stan of late 2005 when we were hit by a serious drought in 2009 and  over the past few months    41 10-55276  the eruption of the Pacaya Volcano  which caused extensive damage to agriculture  followed by tropical storm Agatha in June  which affected some 330 000 persons  killed approximately 100 and caused material damage totalling an estimated $1 billion. These estimates in human suffering and material losses have continued to grow with the unprecedented levels of rainfall during the past month  which has contributed even more human victims and material damage.  The Government has done all within its power to address the situation and has appealed for international assistance. I commend the fact that the United Nations was among the first to respond to our call  and I therefore express our appreciation to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme.  To date  we have been focused on the emergency phase  but it is imperative that we move on to reconstruction and recovery as soon as possible. The Government has drawn up a detailed plan to address those goals  and we will convene an international conference to present the plan to our partners in Antigua in Guatemala on 11 and 12 October.  I shall now make some brief remarks on our Organization and its agenda in the immediate future. I begin by reiterating our support for multilateralism in general and for the United Nations in particular. We have enjoyed strong  continuous support from the Organization  in supporting our peace process  facilitating development cooperation and providing assistance when we have faced emergencies  as at the present time.  The latest example of that fruitful and innovative cooperation is the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala. In only three years  the Commission has shown that it is indeed possible to combat impunity and strengthen the rule of law. We value this cooperative effort between the Government of Guatemala and the United Nations  and we will continue to support it.  We also value the work of our Organization in the area of peacekeeping. We have participated in several operations  principally in Haiti and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We support the work of the United Nations in the area of peacebuilding  and we hope to participate in the Peacebuilding Commission as a full member as of next January.  We welcome the decision of the General Assembly to establish the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women  and we are pleased that its first leader will be Ms. Michelle Bachelet. We also commit ourselves to continue supporting initiatives aimed at achieving greater system-wide coherence.  At the same time  we harbour the hope that  in the coming year  some tangible progress will be made in the long-delayed reform of the Security Council. We believe that it is crucial to provide greater legitimacy to that body  which would benefit all of the main bodies and the Organization overall. In the meantime  we have announced our candidature for one of the seats allocated to our region in the Security Council for the biennium 2012-2013  in the hope of continuing to contribute to its work.  We reiterate our profound commitment to achieving significant progress during the next Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Cancún. We have participated actively in the preparatory work  based on the understanding that rarely has humanity faced a larger challenge that affects all countries and communities on the planet.  In rejoining the Human Rights Council  we reiterate our commitment to the full respect of human rights in all their aspects  including the responsibility to protect our respective populations from genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.  It is commonly held that without peace there can be no development. Promising signs have been seen in various parts of the world  which  we hope  may lead to the resolution of long-standing tensions. We trust that the direct negotiations recently begun in the Middle East will be fruitful and lead to a Palestinian State that can coexist with Israel in peace and harmony  within borders that are secure for both parties.  We also applaud the engagement and growing climate of cooperation being generated between the parties separated by the Taiwan Straits.  Finally  I am pleased to announce that we have achieved a major step forward in addressing the International Court of Justice  together with Belize  to seek a juridical solution to the age-old territorial dispute between us. That step required the approval by    10-55276 42  our Congress of the Special Agreement signed with Belize in December 2008  which cleared the path for a popular referendum  as provided for under that Agreement. We hope that the Belizean Parliament will also authorize as soon as possible the referendum to be held simultaneously in both countries  as the final step that allows both parties to present themselves to the Court."
"71",2964,"GUY",65,2010,"I bring to all delegates at this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly the warm greetings of my Government and people.  The United Nations was founded out of the ashes of war and violence. Its noble ambitions  grounded in the timeless values of peace  equality and justice  seek to create a better world for this and future generations. But if those values are to mean anything  the United Nations must not be merely about a statement of aspiration. Instead  we must strive until the United Nations provides the framework where the timeless values I speak of can be given life through meaningful and practical responses to the contemporary challenges our peoples face.  The challenges are many  but this week has drawn three of them into particularly sharp focus: first  our global efforts to halve poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015; secondly  a global financial crisis that threatens to undo much of the progress we have made in lifting people out of poverty; and thirdly  a climate crisis that carries the risk of planet-wide disruption that endangers entire nations and the continuation of much of what we take for granted today.  Those challenges are all a function of the dominant characteristic of the modern world: our interconnectedness as a global community. And we will meet the challenges only if we adopt an interconnected response. The notion that we can protect our national and global interests through inward-looking national responses is no longer valid. Instead  it is in all of our interests for the United Nations to provide the platform that facilitates global  interconnected responses.    10-54965 16   But I think we have some way to go if that platform is to be created. When it comes to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  although progress has been made  we have not connected the rhetorical support for their achievement to actual delivery. When it comes to the financial crisis  we have not connected the benefits of globally open financial systems to measures that protect against the risks that those systems create. And when it comes to the climate crisis  we have not connected the scientific evidence to global policy responses that mitigate the worst extremes of climate change.  We could choose to continue in this vein  but it is clear where that would lead us. Or we could choose to ask ourselves if we are prepared to be held accountable for carrying our share of the responsibility.   My country recognizes that we must deliver our part. We are on track to meet most of the Millennium Development Goals  especially in the areas of education and health. We are doing all we can to weather the financial crisis with the minimum suffering for our people. And we recognize that we must do more than just complain about climate change. We have created our Low Carbon Development Strategy  which sets out a long-term path to protect our 16-million-hectare rainforest and move our entire economy onto a low carbon trajectory.  But there are times when it feels as though the international system sets out to put hurdles on the path to overcoming the challenges. Inconsistencies and a lack of coherence among aid  trade and climate policies in the developed world  to name just three areas  often create difficulties for developing countries who seek to make progress.  The United Nations can help to change those realities  and provide the framework for global responses that match the ambition of the institution. But at the core of that framework must be an enhanced understanding of the concept of accountability.  As countries like mine fully embrace our need to be accountable for the actions we take to support a global response to the MDGs  financial instability and climate change  so too developed countries must recognize their responsibilities and the need to take a holistic approach to their dealings with the rest of the world. Aid flows are appreciated and valuable  but they sometimes pale into insignificance when those countries that promote how their aid is helping the achievement of  for example  the Millennium Development Goals are also pursuing unjust  narrow-minded trade or climate policies.  I therefore call on the United Nations to establish a set of global accountability indicators with which we can transparently monitor whether the members of the international community are pursuing policies that  in a holistic sense  help them discharge their global responsibilities  not just through the provision of aid but also through the avoidance of unfair trade and climate policies. Through the Millennium Development Goals  we have started to develop some of the indicators we need. As we enhance them further  I believe we will see that better accountability  properly understood  can help us rise to the challenges we face.  I would like to highlight the centrality of the need to protect and preserve our environment. While each of the issues I have mentioned is a global one requiring a global response  the environmental challenges we face mock those who think we still live in a world where global collective action is somehow a matter of choice.  The destruction of a natural habitat anywhere in the world removes life forms that could have been the bedrock of future medical advances for citizens everywhere. A ton of carbon emitted in Africa or Asia threatens the citizens of the smallest village in North America. When those who seek to represent their citizens deny that that is true  or fail to understand its consequences  they threaten their own national interests and the wealth and security of their nation.  Therefore  failure to appreciate the need for an interconnected  global response to climate change and loss of biodiversity is not just an abdication of responsibility to some intangible global good or to people on the other side of the world. It is a very real  measurable threat to citizens in every village  hamlet and city in the world. History will not judge kindly those who were too blinkered or ignorant to realize that. So a step change in our efforts to avoid catastrophic climate change and protect biodiversity is needed.  When we met here last year  many hoped that the United Nations would facilitate agreement on global action to stabilize our planet’s climate at the meeting of most of the world’s leaders in Copenhagen in December. Not only did the global community fail to accomplish that  we are now in real danger of suffering from a catastrophic drift in ambition  where we no   17 10-54965  longer even try to connect the scientific evidence on climate change with the necessary global action to avert it.  This drift in ambition must be stopped. It is a consequence of choices we make; it is not predetermined. So we must rededicate ourselves to crafting a shared response to shared climate threats. Most progressive countries now realize this  and are committed to temperature rises of a maximum of 2° degrees C or lower. They feel that this will require global economic growth powered by efficient and clean energy  new green industries  and a new  less carbon-intensive approach to forestry and agriculture.  But despite knowing this  the international community continues to fail to put in place the measures that will enable the economic transformation that we claim we want. This is in large part due to the absence of a global agreement that puts a price on high-carbon activity and rewards low-carbon innovation. We need this to change. To that end  Guyana continues to hold that the international community needs a legally binding global climate treaty that would first facilitate the emission cuts needed to stabilize the planet’s climate  and then enable us to move on from seeing climate change purely in terms of its costs  while also allowing us to see how it can catalyse a once-in-a-lifetime global economic transformation that can benefit people everywhere. This cannot happen without deep  binding emission cuts in today’s developed world  which could stimulate the financial flows that can address mitigation and adaptation across the developing world.  We recognize that such a global treaty may not be achievable this year  but we are not powerless to act now. The international community can do three things even in the absence of a treaty  and we can achieve breakthroughs in each when we meet in Cancún.  First  we can hold the developed countries accountable for the commitments they have made to the immediate short-term ramping-up of financing for climate action in the developing world. The existing commitments of a total of $30 billion by 2012 and $100 billion per year by 2020 can be agreed to in Cancún. Secondly  we can solve the vexed issue of an effective financial transfer mechanism to ensure that the funds flow both to adaptation and mitigation actions. Thirdly  we should look at ramping up meaningful sectoral responses that work in the short term. Specifically  in Guyana we believe that action on deforestation and forest degradation is one of the efforts that can be made quickly and with maximum impact. I want to emphasize that none of this is about asking the developed world to provide us with aid. Instead  it is about ensuring that the capital for addressing climate change is allocated where it can have the biggest impact.  In addressing these matters  I want to raise a sensitive subject: the Copenhagen Accord  which was the only tangible outcome of last year’s climate Summit. I know that many countries here today associated themselves with the Accord reluctantly  and that some did not associate themselves with it at all. But I believe that reluctant or no association with the Copenhagen Accord  and strong support for some of its provisions  are not mutually exclusive. Even countries that did not associate themselves with the Accord should hold the developed world accountable for its commitments.  We have long said in Guyana that if the international community is prepared to be held accountable  we will not be found lacking. Three years ago  we said that notwithstanding the immense climate challenges in our country — in 2005 floods caused damage equivalent to 60 per cent of our gross domestic product — we were prepared to do our bit. We have determined that  as a country more than 80 per cent of whose territory is rainforest  we can make a disproportionate contribution to solving climate change. So we have looked at the contribution we can make in two ways: first  by creating a financial mechanism whereby we can put our entire rainforest under protection; and secondly  by using the resources we receive for the climate services we provide from our protected forest to reorient our economy on a low-carbon trajectory.  As a consequence  after one of the most comprehensive national consultations on climate change anywhere in the world  we have started to implement our low-carbon development strategy. We have identified how we can cumulatively save forest-based emissions of 1.5 gigatons by 2020. We have a deal in place with Norway on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation  and because of this we are in the process of creating a climate finance fund that will amount to between $300 million and $500 million between this year and 2015. We have also identified how we can use this climate financing to    10-54965 18  invest in education and health care; to catalyse private finance to move virtually our entire economy to clean energy; to open up non-forested land for new economic activities; to invest in climate adaptation needs and to support our indigenous people in the economic and social transformation of their communities. We therefore hope that we are demonstrating the value of action on the three interlinked financing commitments I spoke of  and I hope that we are starting to show how interconnected global responses can deliver globally valuable results.  The United Nations is  despite its many limitations  our best hope for the advancement of humanity. Its universality allows the Organization to play a central and catalytic role in balancing the differing interests of Member States and in generating consensus on the issues that divide us. We must therefore commit fully to the principles and purposes of its Charter and to the improvement of its structure. On behalf of my country and people  I wish to assure the Assembly of our full support for the Organization and for strengthening its capacity to better fulfil the many mandates entrusted to it."
"72",3009,"HND",65,2010,"On behalf of the people and Government of Honduras  I wish to recognize Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his leadership during the previous session. I also congratulate President Joseph Deiss on his election to the Assembly presidency and the Secretary-General  Ban Ki-moon  on his wise leadership of our Organization.  In this same house of the peoples of the United Nations  at the world summit on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  our President  Porfirio Lobo Sosa  highlighted the faith that our country has in this Organization and in its Charter for achieving a world that is more peaceful  prosperous and fair (see A/65/PV.3). As a founding Member of the United Nations and a peace-loving country  we reaffirm our obligations. As we have been working  ceaselessly and together with many other Member States  since the birth of the Organization  we will continue to work to fully realize the ideals enshrined in the San Francisco Charter.   Honduras — which is geographically small but great of spirit and generous in its democratic and peaceful vocation — has involved itself in the world  basing itself on the principles of equal rights  self-determination for peoples and non-interference in internal affairs.   The imperative of promoting economic and social progress for all nations moves us to acknowledge that the MDGs have been a first step in the right direction. We agree with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that the Millennium Goals are not easy  but they are achievable. However  the struggle against poverty requires additional efforts that recognize the fact that we have a collective responsibility to protect and share what the President of Honduras has called global common goods  including solidarity.   Another global good should be the prudent management of our economies. The financial crises have proven that that responsibility does not fall just to the developing countries. It is so important that  according to the World Bank  the recent crises in food  fuel and finances have sunk an additional 64 million human beings into poverty. Such crises can make our efforts to fight poverty more difficult or even impossible.   The opening of trade and of financial systems is another global good. Access to international markets is as important as official development assistance itself  although it does not replace it. We must add efforts to enable foreign direct investment in our developing nations; access to technology  in particular technology having to do with medications; the reduction of greenhouse gases; and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.  The challenge of achieving the Millennium Development Goals before 2015 in a manner as responsible as possible lies with our Government. Given the results already achieved and what remains to be done  President Lobo Sosa has launched an appeal to start talks as soon as possible on a new global agreement that will guide our actions and goals after 2015.   We firmly believe that poverty is not only the shortage of material goods  but also the lack of opportunities. That is why we are committed to respect for human dignity  the common good  support and human solidarity. Those four principles are not just a moral imperative; in the case of Honduras  they are a national imperative.  In that regard  with broad consultation with civil society  the political parties and other independent sectors  we adopted a country vision and national plan that sets out four focal points for achieving our national goals  inspired by the Millennium Development Goals: a Honduras without poverty  educated and healthy  with robust social welfare systems; a Honduras that is developing in democracy  with security and without violence  with absolute respect for human rights; a productive Honduras that generates opportunities and decent jobs  that sustainably exploits its resources and that reduces environmental vulnerability; and a modern  transparent  responsible  efficient and competitive State  with fully independent branches of government.   The cohesion of our society  unity  reconciliation  governance  coexistence and peace all depend on achieving that. That is why we are engaged in building    10-54965 58  an inclusive society  since no country is so poor that it cannot show solidarity with those that are even poorer.   Our first commitment is to helping people in extreme poverty through the “Bono 10 000” programme. Bono 10 000 is a credit programme that will greatly strengthen family economics and  furthermore  is conditional on steps to improve the access of the most vulnerable Hondurans to education  health care and nutrition through the broad dissemination of the School Snack scheme and other food security programmes.  We are strengthening the decentralization processes and improving citizen participation in the making  implementation  monitoring and assessment of public policies. We are also addressing social inequality by creating economic opportunities at the local level.  Productive programmes  such as the United States Millennium Challenge Corporation in Honduras  have had a huge impact on the recipients  resulting in a very significant increase in the income of the farmers participating in the programme. With the same aim of generating greater income for families  we have launched a programme to finance microbusinesses and small enterprises  thanks to the cooperation programmes of the European Union  Japan and Taiwan  as well as all those countries that are extending the hand of solidarity to our people.   In all those programmes  women are a particular target of our Government’s efforts because we know that  along with the fight against poverty  we must combat gender inequality.  While we work at the local and community levels  we are also promoting private investment. The purpose is to create decent jobs for more than 200 000 young people who join the labour market annually. The Government of Honduras bases the successful implementation of its social agenda on a social market economy.  With those premises in mind  our Government has drawn up a national programme to promote investment for the period 2010 to 2014 in six main sectors: industries generating more and better jobs  agro-food and forestry production  clean generation of energy  tourism development  infrastructure to support manufacturing  and water and sanitation. We will develop those programmes within the new framework of the law on public-private partnerships  the law on rural and marginal urban employment  a new law on clean energy and the law on promoting and protecting investments.   With such efforts  a new era is opening in Honduras with the creation of conditions so that private business can boost sustained economic growth with social responsibility and the country is guided towards prosperity and stability.  Honduras is ready to better address the challenges of reducing its vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change. The law on land management makes it possible to utilize and protect the land properly  with responsible management of the natural resources. At the same time  we have launched a national risk management system.  Efforts to improve the social situation and to boost economic growth must be based on a legal and institutional foundation. There is a strong link between individual freedom and political stability with economic growth and social justice. Higher rates of economic growth that are sustainable over time also help to create the social conditions for governance  confidence and smaller political threats.  For 30 years  we Hondurans have strived to develop our democratic institutions. The international community has supported us throughout that process. At the end of the third decade of our democracy  we had an institutional system that had ceased to be the monopoly of the executive branch and that shared power more evenly among the judicial  legislative and executive organs.  Despite that progress  we underwent a political crisis  from which we emerged when the Honduran people turned out in huge numbers on 29 November 2009 to vote in the election with the greatest turnout and transparency in our electoral history. We Hondurans exercised our popular sovereignty and our right to self-determination. We sent an unequivocal message: we love democracy and our institutions  and we prefer dialogue to conflict. That is our message  which has been understood and respected by the great majority of the nations represented here. We wish it to be acknowledged by all Governments in the world.  In that spirit  President Porfirio Lobo Sosa endorsed a broad amnesty for political crimes and formed a Government of national unity  with the   59 10-54965  participation of all the country’s political parties. Furthermore  the President decreed the creation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission — a totally independent body that will ensure that the critical events of 2009 will never happen again. The work of the Commission is already under way  and its report is expected during the first quarter of next year. Its conclusions will be broadly disseminated and its recommendations will be implemented.   We are convinced that national reconciliation and unity are based on respect for all sectors of society irrespective of political or ideological position. Tolerance is and must be the foundation of democracy.    We are also convinced that the human rights and fundamental freedoms of citizens must be respected without restriction. The President of the Honduras has proposed to the National Congress the creation a Secretary of State for Justice to promote and take charge of designing  implementing  supervising and evaluating all public policies and ensuring that they are based squarely on human rights principles.   Inspired by our respect for human dignity  our Government condemns all forms of racial discrimination and enthusiastically welcomes the forthcoming launch of the International Year for People of African Descent. To implement our commitment against racial discrimination  Honduras is creating an entity for the development of indigenous peoples and Afro-Honduran people and a policy of racial equality.  In the context of those commitments any person deprived of liberty must be treated with the respect inherent in his human dignity. To that end  the President approved an executive decree aimed at reducing overcrowding in the penal institutions through renovation of their infrastructure and equipment.  Along that same line  the Government of Honduras has energetically condemned and continues to condemn human rights violations  especially violation of the right to life. We are firmly committed to the fight against impunity and will continue to make every possible effort to bring to justice those who violate that essential right of the human person.  We are thankful for the cooperation we have received so far in overcoming difficulties in guaranteeing security for our citizens. President Lobo Sosa has also asked Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to have the United Nations consider support for setting up a commission to fight impunity  in order to support national institutions and strengthen their capacities as they carry out their tasks in investigating and prosecuting crime. At the same time  we reiterate our Government’s invitation to the agencies that make up the United Nations human rights system to follow up on the situation in Honduras.   I wish to convey the ongoing appreciation of Hondurans to the United Nations system and its Secretary-General for all the cooperation and assistance given our country. We thank all of those who have firmly supported Honduras  because that has benefited our people directly.  I want to highlight the solidarity and friendship that exist among the brothers of the Central American region. Within the Central American Integration System we will continue to go forward until our common homeland becomes one great nation  beyond the limits of the historic Central America.  Our Government is aware of the difficulties and challenges of the moment in history in which we are living  and we are taking decisions based on that awareness. Today I can state with conviction that we are moving along the path to prosperity  because I believe in the determination of the people of Honduras  their ability to deal with adversity  their hard work  their strength of heart and their sprit and hope. We have an unbreakable will; we have the human capital.   The time has come to reaffirm our commitment and to act in favour of the poorest members of society. The time has come to act in solidarity and with determination so that all human beings may be protected from discrimination and need. It is time to create a world with tolerance  with harmony and with freedom and security for all. The time to globalize social justice with freedom and democracy is now.  "
"73",3034,"HRV",65,2010,"At the outset  I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly  and to stress that you can count on the full support of the Croatian delegation in the coming year. At the same time  I would like to thank Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his successful work as President of the General Assembly over the past year and for the results achieved under his leadership.  The consequences of the serious threats facing the modern world — from terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to humanitarian crises and climate change  to mention just a few — reach far beyond the original framework within which they began. Without exception  they are acquiring global proportions. In the same way  contemporary social and economic relationships have grown far beyond narrow national frameworks and  through the flow of people  goods  services and capital  are creating a global network of mutual relations and influence. Does the recent eruption of the volcano on Iceland not testify to this in as vivid a manner as the   25 10-55128  joint humanitarian actions undertaken in response to recent terrifying natural disasters?  This accelerated development of the contemporary world  and especially the challenges and threats to which it is exposed  call on all of us to take swift action  shoulder joint responsibility and foment new solidarity. There is no alternative to working together in today’s world.  In that vein  the theme you have chosen  Sir  for the opening of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly reminds us  in focusing on the concept of global governance  of the role of the Assembly in formulating the global response to the challenges we face in today’s world. At the same time  your proposal calls for an examination of our own contribution to the formulation of responses to these challenges.  During its membership of the Security Council  Croatia promoted the ideas that are the backbone of all civilized governance and therefore also of global governance: the importance of the rule of law and the protection and promotion of international law  especially human rights and minority rights  international humanitarian law and transparency in the work of the main bodies of the United Nations.  Within the rich legal heritage of the United Nations  the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) has particular significance. That document confirms the global strategy of the United Nations in areas crucial to the life and well-being of a large proportion of humankind  and unites the activities of the relevant institutions in this sphere. For Croatia  implementing the Millennium Development Goals is of additional importance because of their strong link with the priorities related to the process of our accession to the European Union  which has entered its final phase.  Croatia has decided to confirm its readiness to participate in the international activities aimed at achieving these goals by increasing its financial contribution to the programmes and activities of the United Nations. In that context  allow me to mention the Republic of Croatia’s successful shift from recipient to provider of international aid. Croatia has aimed its support at the neighbouring region of South-East Europe  where our knowledge and experience may be most useful to the recipient countries.  Along with its contribution of peacekeeping troops  police and military experts to 14 international missions led by the United Nations  NATO and the European Union  Croatia is also ready to share its experience with States emerging from armed conflict by offering expert advice and other services in the field of security and defence sector reform and in reintegrating demobilized persons into civilian society.  I would particularly like to emphasize that peacebuilding support for countries emerging from armed conflict is one of the most important and complex challenges confronting the United Nations. In that light  Croatia strongly supports the work of the Peacebuilding Commission and the report (A/64/868  annex) drawn up by the co-facilitators of the process of reviewing the United Nations peacebuilding architecture and the work of the Commission. Croatia was a founding member of the Peacebuilding Commission  and  wishing to continue contributing to the significant efforts being made in this area  has announced that it will be a candidate for membership of the Commission for the period 2012-2013.  However important our joint action at the global level may be to finding responses to the many challenges that confront us  it is imperative when it comes to attempting to find a deterrent to the use of nuclear weapons. In recent years  we have witnessed a renewed desire within the international community for a world without nuclear weapons  which Croatia also recognized in the historic Security Council summit of September last year on the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  with President Barack Obama presiding (see S/PV.6191).  Making its own contribution to the significant efforts aimed at preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons  in June the Republic of Croatia successfully organized a regional workshop on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004). Of course  in Croatia we are aware that mere words and adopted documents are not enough  especially to preventing the direct threat posed by the possibility of terrorists getting hold of weapons of mass destruction. We therefore welcome the concrete steps being taken by the nuclear States to reduce their nuclear capacities and to increase the transparency and security of nuclear reserves.  At the same time  we must not forget that  in parallel with the existence of a nuclear threat  the illegal trade in small arms and light weapons has taken many human lives. Croatia most strongly condemns    10-55128 26  terrorism and is wholly dedicated to preventing this threat in all its various forms at the national  regional and global levels. In an attempt to make a contribution to these efforts  during its time as a member of the Security Council Croatia chaired the Counter-Terrorism Committee for two years. During its presidency of the Security Council in December 2008  Croatia organized a debate on the subject of threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts (see S/PV.6034). The Council then adopted a presidential statement (S/PRST/2008/45) calling on all Members of the United Nations to show the same level of solidarity they displayed immediately after the tragic events of 11 September 2001.  As a member of NATO and a future member of the European Union  Croatia is strongly engaged in securing peace and stability in South-East Europe. This is also precisely the reason why we advocate a clear Euro-Atlantic perspective for all the States in the region. To realize that perspective  it is first necessary to accept and fully apply the principles on which European integration was initiated 60 years ago: cooperation  dialogue and mutual respect.  In that spirit  Croatia and Slovenia last year agreed on a solution to their long-running border dispute through international arbitration. By my agreement with Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor  a new page was turned in Croatian-Slovenian relations  and at the same time a way was opened for all the other countries of South-East Europe to realize their right to a European future through dialogue and cooperation.  In that sense  I would like here to welcome the decision by the General Assembly to adopt by consensus a resolution on Kosovo (64/298) sponsored by Serbia and the European Union. In this way  a completely new European paradigm of cooperation  peace and progress is being created in South-East Europe. Croatia will lead the way in supporting and promoting these values throughout the region  and especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina  which also has the right to a Euro-Atlantic perspective as a united State of three constitutive and equal peoples. There is no real alternative to the Euro-Atlantic future  and any attempt to go back to the old and failed ways of the past would be extremely harmful. This is the only sphere of peace and security ensuring prosperity in the Euro-Atlantic zone whose doors will be open to the countries of South-East Europe that meet the conditions for membership of NATO and the European Union.  With this in mind  the Republic of Croatia advocates the accepted concept of responsibility for the protection of civilians against genocide  ethnic cleansing  war crimes and crimes against humanity. We welcome  support and follow with special attention the work of the International Criminal Court. In the same vein  allow me to point out here that the Republic of Croatia supports the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and welcomes the Tribunal’s exit strategy.  Finally  this is an opportunity for me to say that the Republic of Croatia  in line with its focus to date on human rights  will continue its activities to protect and promote them. I especially welcome the establishment of UN Women as an important and welcome new body within the Organization  aimed at supporting gender equality and strengthening the position of women.  In closing  allow me to end this address by asserting that lasting and civilized governance  especially insofar as it includes the United Nations  must arise from the individual and return to the individual. The protection of the dignity of human life  and the dignity and identity of each nation  is the firm foundation on which the United Nations can fulfil its task to promote peace and security in today’s globalized world."
"74",3079,"HTI",65,2010,"My first words will be to pay tribute to the memory of hundreds of thousands of Haitians and those who came to help — including about 100 United Nations staff  in particular Mr. Hédi Annabi  Special Representative of the Secretary-General — who all lost their lives during the earthquake that struck Haiti on 12 January.   But every tragedy offers some solace in terms of human solidarity. Therefore once again on behalf of the Haitian people and on my personal behalf I would like to thank all the people and Governments across the world  ranging from the Dominican Republic  our closely attached neighbour  to those at the far corners of the globe  that rushed to our assistance. That assistance was crucially important to us  in particular during the first few weeks when the need was so urgent.  Allow me to also thank those Haitians living abroad  in New York  Miami  Chicago  Montreal  Paris  Santo Domingo  the French West Indies and many other parts of the world  who joined the great international solidarity movement and  in their commitment  endeavoured for the most part to establish structures that would help our country rebuild.   I would be remiss were I not to pay special tribute here  publicly  to the people of Haiti    10-54965 10  themselves  a people who have been deprived of everything and yet who have demonstrated the immeasurable wealth of their humanity. Towns that had been destroyed did not become the scenes of widespread looting. The people showed such dignity and kindness  such exemplary stamina in their suffering  such boldness   devotion and courage  such solidarity  spirit of self-sacrifice and love for others. Those are the words that come to mind and I think that is how we must describe the acts of heroism of the Haitian people. Let us show our respect for them.  My country has lived a unique history since its birth immediately after a war of independence that took the lives of one third of its people and caused unimaginable destruction. And in the wake of the American and French revolutions of the eighteenth century  that war of independence challenged the human race to  recognize the universal character of the proclamation of humankind’s right to freedom  dignity and equality by making the men and women of Haiti free.  Our nation was born in 1804 and  although poor and  since then deprived of resources  it has never hesitated to extend material support to peoples struggling for freedom  including in greater Colombia  which is today Venezuela  Ecuador  Colombia and Panama  under the leadership of Francisco Miranda and then Simón Bolívar.  Despite our limited resources  Haiti has always demonstrated its firm belief in one human race. And therefore we fully appreciate that immense movement of solidarity and compassion of the international community for our country  from the moments immediately after the earthquake right up to the commitment on 31 March at the New York conference by which it agreed to participate in rebuilding Haiti on the basis of the plan of action prepared by the Haitian Government.  Since then  with the assistance of the international community and support from the United Nations  we have set up a commission to coordinate resources for rebuilding. This commission is an important strategic mechanism for helping the country manage transparently and with discipline the resources mobilized within the international community to support our country as it rebuilds. The commission has already adopted over 30 projects  on education  health  infrastructure and so forth  costing over $1 billion.  May I extend my thanks to those countries and agencies that have followed up on their commitments to make financial contributions. I trust that a similar effort will be made by others as well so as to help us respond quickly to the over one million Haitians who are still living in tent cities and temporary shelter.   We have just held an important high-level meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Ten years ago  when 189 countries met here to make the collective commitment to achieving the eight Millennium Development Goals by the year 2015  the international community was actually in agreement on what the world should look like in 2015 — a world well on the way to reducing extreme poverty  where children and mothers would not have to die because of lack of health care  where all children would be able to go to school  where millions of people would no longer die of hunger every year  where women would be able to fulfil their potential in a society without any gender-based discrimination.   That vision was the right one  because it placed human dignity at the very heart of all development programmes and the international cooperation agenda. And that vision also had the advantage of providing countries and their partners in the international community with a clear  straightforward structure for planning development and organizing cooperation with the countries that were committed to help achieve the Goals.   While significant progress has been made in the right direction  five years from 2015 there is still a long road to travel because the developed countries have not fully lived up to the commitments made with respect to the Millennium Development Goals  particularly their financial commitments.  What shall I say about the trillions of dollars that have been swallowed up over the last 10 years in wars that have been as bloody as they were unjustified?  What shall I say about the defence budgets which every year exceed by far what would be needed to attain the Millennium Development Goals?  And what shall I say about the incalculable wealth that has simply evaporated in speculation  in the arrogant supremacy of the virtual economy over the real economy?   11 10-54965   Are we going to continue sacrificing the well-being and lives of millions of human beings  the future of planet Earth  to this culture of fear and greed?  What shall I say about the fact that official development assistance continues to fall  when in 2005 the developed countries committed to doubling the amount by 2010?  What happened to the decision to encourage a more open trading system  when assistance to farmers in developed countries is over three times the amount of official development assistance?  In truth  the globalization that began centuries ago  with the colonization and the importation of African captives to work as slaves on sugar-cane and coffee plantations  whose products would then be exported to the West or the North  needs to be reinvented.   The time has come for us to invent a new kind of globalization  one that is based on the simple concept of our common humanity  on trust  cooperation and mutual respect  on respect for our environment and all forms of life in it. We must  as a matter of urgency  do away with a vision that sees profit as a veritable god  reduces citizens to the level of simple consumers  and regards planet Earth as a colony that we can destroy. The global village will not be able to maintain forever its fashionable neighbourhoods side by side with wretched slums where humanity is dissolving: a socio-economic North and South — not a geographic one.   In Haiti  living on an island in a part of the world that has always been swept by hurricanes  we are particularly worried about global warming and the climatic disturbances that come with it: more frequent and more devastating cyclones and a rising sea-level.   Must the poor continue to pay for the waste  the unbridled appetite for energy of their wealthier brethren? Must they renounce their efforts to improve their standard of living in order to feed the consumer frenzy of the industrialized countries?  The so-called war against drugs consists of a few little skirmishes in the consumer countries but full-scale bloody battles in the production and transit countries  whose very existence is sometimes jeopardized.  Are the countries of the South still to be pilloried as responsible for the production and transit of illegal drugs even though the engine for this lucrative trafficking is demand for drugs in countries of the North?  What shall I say about the arms trafficking  which flows from the North to the South and supports the drug trafficking?  It is for us to provide the answer to those questions  and we cannot sidestep them much longer without rushing to our common doom. The only hope lies in a renewed humanism  clear-sighted  embracing of all life and the environment  on which we are dependent and for which we are responsible. In that sense  South-South cooperation affords new promise  and I invite the leaders of the countries of the South to strengthen those channels for the well-being of our respective peoples.   Some of the statements I have heard in this session of the General Assembly seem to presage a new and different consciousness  which may be what is required for our vision of a new humanity. Still  as always  we must be mindful to that commitments and action match the expansive rhetoric.   This is the moment for Haiti to renew its call for the lifting of the embargo against Cuba. Besides having been condemned in many Assembly resolutions  an embargo of this kind is absolutely contrary to the values we advocate in matters of international commerce.   I would be remiss if I were not to convey  on behalf of the Haitian people  our condolences to the many peoples who have suffered lately from natural disasters in Chile  China  Pakistan  Guatemala and Mexico.  I shall conclude by referring to the presidential and legislative elections that will mark the end of my term and the end of a particularly difficult year for the people of Haiti. It is important that that difficult process be conducted with rigour  fairness and transparency  so as to consolidate our young democracy. Therefore I appeal to all national actors and our international friends  so that together we can make our way through that electoral crossroads successfully."
"75",3125,"HUN",65,2010,"As an engaged member of the United Nations  Hungary wishes to play its part in international efforts aimed at building our common future. In this spirit  we do our utmost to contribute to the crisis-management and peacekeeping operations of the international community  and we seek to deliver special added value to international development and humanitarian activities. I can assure the Assembly that as a candidate country for Security Council membership for the period 2012-2013  Hungary stands ready to work vigorously to overcome divisions and to strengthen global partnerships in today’s interdependent international environment.  The Preamble of the Charter states that we the peoples of the United Nations are determined  inter alia  “to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom” and  for this end  “to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples”.  In the year 2000  the United Nations exhibited leadership in the articulation and adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Contributions made at the MDG summit a few days ago reassured me that  although most of us are suffering from the fallout of the recent global crises  none of us would readily accept the vision of a bleak future that would result from slowing down the concrete actions we take. Hungary remains determined to take on its share of responsibility in realizing the MDGs on a global scale  and we will continue to implement donor programmes in various parts of the world.  The effects of the recent global financial and economic crisis have thrown millions of people into poverty  especially those who are most vulnerable in the developing world. The food  water and energy crises and humanitarian disasters such as the earthquake in Haiti and floods in Pakistan have also taken their toll on the lives of people. The growing number of disasters emphasizes the great need for prevention  preparedness and disaster risk reduction  as well as for development activities centred on the promotion of sustainable economic growth. Hungary believes that  in order to achieve success and effectively meet the needs of vulnerable or disadvantaged groups in these turbulent times  a    10-54959 2  partnership-based approach needs to be adopted in this regard.  Similarly  climate change figures high among the pre-eminent challenges of the twenty-first century that threaten our well-being  security and economic development. The international community should pay particular attention to the well-founded and legitimate concerns of the small island States of the Caribbean and the Pacific in this regard. Our primary goal should now be the adoption of a series of ambitious  action-oriented decisions at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations to be held in Cancún  Mexico  later this year. Such decisions would prepare the ground for the adoption of a comprehensive and legally binding global framework next year in South Africa.  As a State member of the European Union  Hungary is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020. Moreover  we are also ready to undertake further emissions reductions if our partners make similar commitments  taking into account their different capabilities.  The promotion and protection of human rights constitute the cornerstone of Hungary’s foreign policy. Hungary acts at the forefront of international efforts to fight all forms of discrimination  including discrimination based on national or ethnic origin. We are of the view that the rights of minorities  with special regard for the preservation of their cultural identities and linguistic heritage  should be high on the agenda of the international community. We believe that flourishing minority communities do not weaken a society but  on the contrary  contribute to the cultural enrichment of a country. Fruitful relationships between the majority and minorities can only be pursued if human rights are not being infringed and if tolerance prevails at all levels of society. This is one of the reasons that Hungary has decided to establish the Budapest-based Tom Lantos Institute  an international centre for promoting human rights and spreading the value of tolerance.  Hungary also feels compelled to raise the issue of women worldwide. The possible role played by women in accelerating the achievement of the MDGs and in reducing tensions and hostilities around the world should not be neglected. We are confident that the recent establishment of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) marks significant progress in this regard and will make a great contribution to the elimination of the disadvantages facing women.  Let me express Hungary’s sincere gratitude to the Secretary-General for convening  on this very day  a High-level Meeting on the disarmament machinery. New dynamism in this area was also clearly demonstrated at the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons earlier this year  and we are hopeful that the renewed international commitment to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation will lead to success.  We note with great concern  however  that the growing consensus around the ultimate goal of a so-called global zero of nuclear weapons is being offset by overt and covert attempts at the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles by certain countries. Hungary fully supports the statement made in New York on 22 September by the High Representative of the European Union  Catherine Ashton  on the negotiations conducted between the E3+3 Governments and Iran.  International terrorism is another of the most serious threats to international peace and security. Hungary strongly condemns this phenomenon in all its forms and manifestations and underscores the pivotal role of the United Nations in counter-terrorism. We welcome the fact that the recently concluded second review of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy reinforced the consensus among Member States to foster a global counter-terrorism alliance. And  expressing our full solidarity with the victims of terrorism  we lend our unequivocal support to all United Nations efforts in this regard.  Almost a decade ago  this city of New York suffered one of the most horrendous terrorist attacks in human history. The appalling statement made by one of the speakers yesterday concerning this tragic event is unacceptable and is detrimental to the noble cause of promoting mutual understanding and dialogue among religions and civilizations.  The United Nations was created  and I shall again quote from the Preamble of the Charter  in order to “practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours”. Coexistence and cooperation would serve regional stability in the Western Balkans  a region which  due to its proximity   3 10-54959  to Hungary’s borders  has great importance in our foreign policy.  In our view  progress towards the stabilization of the region and resolution of its persisting problems should be the result of an essentially internally driven process  with the unwavering support of the international community.  Hungary respects the recently issued advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on Kosovo  and our country remains strongly committed to encouraging direct dialogue between the countries and communities of the region.  In Afghanistan  the international community in general  and the countries in the region in particular  should assist efforts towards reconciliation  good governance and sustainable development. Strengthening State institutions at all levels  improving the security situation and effectively implementing civilian development programmes are all essential for decreasing tensions and transferring responsibility and leadership to the Afghan Government. Hungary remains committed to supporting Afghanistan politically  and we will do our best to provide assistance to the country through both bilateral and multilateral channels.  We envisage the establishment of an independent  democratic and viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours. We also believe that the Middle East peace process should and can lead to overall Arab-Israeli reconciliation. We all know that it takes brave men to start a war  but it takes statesmen to finish it. In this spirit  Hungary welcomes and strongly supports the fact that the proximity talks have recently transformed into direct talks between the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority. We commend the personal commitment of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the efforts made by the Quartet  including the European Union  as well as the valuable contributions made by a number of outstanding Arab statesmen in this regard.  Acting on its own  as well as within the United Nations framework  Hungary is a partner of African countries in enhancing development and establishing peace and security on the continent. We also encourage Africa’s voice to be heard in relation to compelling global questions such as water management  poverty eradication and the empowerment of women. Still  we once again emphasize the significance of the role of African countries themselves and the importance of dialogue and negotiations in this process.  In conclusion  let me  on a personal note as the only Olympic champion in the Hall  emphasize my strong belief that multilateral partnerships can only be enhanced by respecting the jointly established rules  with special regard to the rules of fair play with other teams and players on the field. I am confident that  during the coming session of work  the noble principles of the United Nations will continue to guide all delegations in strengthening the kind of global cooperation within the United Nations machinery that is so strongly needed to tackle the challenges facing us today. I wish to assure the Assembly that Hungary stands ready to do its utmost to contribute to those noble goals."
"76",3172,"IDN",65,2010," First I congratulate you  Sir  on your assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I am sure that under your able leadership our deliberations will be fruitful. Let me also commend your predecessor  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  for the wisdom with which he guided the Assembly at its previous session.  The theme of our session  “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance”  is both timely and well chosen. As we enter the second decade of the twenty-first century  humankind faces a multitude of challenges  challenges that are complex  multifaceted and transnational; challenges that defy national solutions alone; indeed  challenges that demand international cooperation. Those are precisely challenges of the type that the United Nations is potentially best equipped to meet.  Such a central role for the United Nations derives  above all  from its near universal membership — a representative United Nations. It derives also from its effectiveness  its capacity to deliver results: an effective United Nations that is capable of delivering peace and security worldwide; a United Nations that equally serves the interest of all nations  developed and developing  large and small; a United Nations that provides a robust institutional support for efforts to achieve prosperity and equitable development for all; a United Nations that advocates not only political and civil rights  but also economic and social rights  to all people around the world; a United Nations that promotes democracy and justice; in short  a United Nations that can play a central role in global governance.  A United Nations that is at the forefront in addressing global challenges requires that we  its Members  must move together in cooperative action: countries of the North and South  East and West  developed and developing. We must each contribute to the resolution of problems and not simply accentuate divisions  for there is no monopoly of wisdom amongst any one of us.  Each Member State can contribute to meeting the challenges to the international community. Therefore  our Organization  the United Nations  must have the wherewithal  the means  to ensure that the full problem-solving potential of every nation is unleashed. Therein rests the importance of reform of the United Nations.   The Security Council must better reflect the contemporary world  not that of 1945. A more representative Council would be a more effective Council.  The General Assembly must be revitalized. A more efficient Assembly is a more effective Assembly.  The Economic and Social Council must be made more relevant  in accordance with its Charter-mandated responsibilities.  Not least  the full potential of the Secretariat must be harvested. Its structure and organization must be effective and efficient and made more cohesive.  The central role of the United Nations in global governance is due not only to its capacity to reform  to enhance its representative character  but also to its ability to deliver in overcoming contemporary global challenges  to deliver on its Charter-provided purposes  or  as the Charter eloquently puts it in paragraph 4 of Article 1  “To be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations”.  As a Member State  Indonesia will do its part. We shall continue to contribute to United Nations peacekeeping efforts. We shall also strive to ensure that the recent positive momentum on the issue of disarmament is maintained. Therefore  Indonesia is on   11 10-55276  track to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.  Indonesia will also work tirelessly to ensure that the United Nations continues to discharge its historic responsibilities on the question of Palestine. Thus we welcome and support the resumption of direct negotiations between Israel and Palestine. This is a precious opportunity for Palestine and Israel to find solutions on all final status issues.  We therefore strongly deplore the decision by the Israeli Government not to extend the moratorium on the building of settlements in the occupied territory. Such a decision does not in any way contribute to a climate conducive for the direct negotiations.  We will continue to contribute to the capacity-building of Palestine  to support the Palestinian people in preparing for the day when they finally exercise their right of sovereignty.  Today’s global threat to security demands more effective global action. The United Nations must do its part to promote global cooperation to address  non-traditional security threats: terrorism  people smuggling  drug trafficking  piracy and money laundering  to cite just a few.  The United Nations must also contribute to achieving common prosperity  to make a better world for all. We support the strengthening of the United Nations frameworks for the attainment of equitable and sustainable development. The Rio Declaration  the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation have been the multilateral linchpin of this.  We welcome the renewed commitment of all Member States to meet the MDGs by 2015. We need to strengthen genuine partnership to deliver on these promises and to turn hope into reality.  The challenges we face in attaining equitable and sustainable development are compounded by the real and imminent threat of climate change. Addressing climate change is therefore essential. Accordingly  the United Nations should ensure that the sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Mexico  results in a consensus agreement that effectively addresses climate change. It should build on the Copenhagen Accord and the progress made in the two Working Groups in the fifteenth Conference.  We also look forward to the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development as an opportunity to enhance coordination  synergy and coherence in efforts  including within the United Nations system  to address challenges to sustainable development.  We need to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to deal with a complex array of natural disasters  including the delivery of international humanitarian assistance.  We attach great importance to the review process of the Human Rights Council in 2011. We need to ensure that the Council can truly support all countries  developed and developing  to promote cooperation in the field of human rights.  And  not least  we need to see the United Nations contribute effectively to the promotion of tolerance and mutual respect among cultures  religions  faiths and civilizations.  We  the Members of the United Nations  must promote better synergy between the United Nations and regional organizations and initiatives. Many global problems become more manageable if there are simultaneous efforts to address them at the regional level. That is why Indonesia continues to promote the strengthening of cooperation between the United Nations and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  Before the end of this year an ASEAN-United Nations summit will be held in Viet Nam. Meanwhile  the countries of ASEAN and other countries in the larger Asia-Pacific region are building a regional architecture that will bring about and sustain dynamic equilibrium in the region. ASEAN will  of course  be the driving force in the building of this architecture.  While the promotion of democracy is a global concern  we are also vigorously promoting democratic values in our own region  through ASEAN and beyond. In 2008  Indonesia launched the Bali Democracy Forum  the only intergovernmental forum on political development in Asia. In doing so  we created an inclusive platform for sharing experiences and best practices and giving mutual support in the development of democracy in the region. This December  we will hold the third Bali Democracy Forum  this time on the theme of “Democracy and the promotion of peace and stability”.  We in Indonesia cherish our democratic transformation. As the world’s third largest democracy     10-55276 12  Indonesia is proof that Islam  democracy and modernization can go hand in hand. But democracy is not something that can be achieved once and for all time. It is an endless journey  an unremitting process. It must keep evolving to remain capable of addressing new challenges. That is why we keep fine-tuning our political institutions  so that they become more effective in serving the people.  The same is true of the United Nations. It needs continuous reform  so that it serves all nations  developed and developing; so that it will be a more effective instrument of humankind; so that it will deliver peace and the dividends of peace. It is now time to make the United Nations deliver. "
"77",3219,"IND",65,2010,"Allow me to begin by congratulating you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly and by assuring you of the full cooperation of my delegation. In the interest of saving the Assembly’s valuable time  I will read out only part of my address  the full text of which has been circulated.   The United Nations was created  65 years ago  to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  to affirm faith in fundamental rights  to establish conditions under which respect for international law can be maintained and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. Six and a half decades later  globalization has made the world a much smaller place. It has also created conditions whereby the problems and challenges of one country or region can very quickly become those of the larger community of nations.  Terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  maritime piracy  pandemics and epidemics  organized crime and narcotics smuggling recognize no borders or boundaries. Similarly  the fallout of intra-State conflicts  failed States  climate change  natural disasters  food shortages and financial and economic crises transcend countries and regions. Under those circumstances the international community looks to the United Nations to overcome the common challenges of humankind through the harmonized actions of nations  as stated in the Charter.  The United Nations is the only organization that can be at the centre of an international governance system. However  it needs urgent reform to reflect contemporary realities and to effectively meet emerging global challenges. The first step has to be the reform of the Security Council. The overwhelming majority of the membership has been clear in seeking an expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent categories of membership. It is imperative that we bring the negotiations to an early and logical conclusion.  We must also truly revitalize the General Assembly. It must reclaim its position on vital matters such as the appointment of the Secretary-General and the relationship between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions. Along with the Economic and Social Council  the General Assembly should also set the paradigms of multilateral engagement for the global economy and for development and developmental cooperation.   It is matter of much satisfaction that this year we have significantly advanced the United Nations reform agenda in the areas of gender equality and women’s empowerment. I wish to reiterate our strong commitment to UN Women and to its strengthening.   We also need to ensure that the review of the Human Rights Council this year adds to the Council’s role as an effective  credible and premier United Nations mechanism dealing with human rights.   My Government accords the highest priority to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. Our development challenges were exacerbated by the financial and economic crisis that started in 2008. Acting in concert  the Group of 20 (G-20)  which includes the largest developed and developing countries  reacted promptly and purposefully to stem the global slowdown and send a strong message of confidence and stability. India believes that the  G-20 — the premier forum for international economic    10-55396 4  cooperation — can help catalyse strong  balanced and sustainable growth for the benefit of everyone.  As a country vulnerable to  and already suffering from  the impacts of climate change  India has an important stake in the success of ongoing international negotiations in that regard. There is no substitute to the United Nations-led process  with its inherent inclusiveness and transparency  to lead us to an ambitious and equitable outcome that respects the provisions and principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  in particular the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. It is important that there be acceptance of equal sharing of the resource of the atmosphere for all human beings.  India has an abiding commitment to achieve universal and non-discriminatory nuclear disarmament within a specified time frame — a vision that was most eloquently articulated in the Assembly by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1988. More than two decades later  that goal still remains distant. Meanwhile  newer threats have emerged  including the danger of terrorists gaining access to weapons of mass destruction.  India introduced a working paper on nuclear disarmament in 2006  which contained specific proposals that reflect the spirit and substance of the Rajiv Gandhi action plan. We call for an intensification of discussion and dialogue among Member States and the larger non-governmental community  so as to strengthen an international consensus that can be translated into concrete action to achieve nuclear disarmament.   India remains committed to the negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a multilateral   non-discriminatory and internationally verifiable fissile material cut-off treaty that meets India’s national security interests. We hope that the Conference will be able to commence negotiations at an early date. We remain committed to a unilateral and voluntary moratorium on nuclear-explosives testing.  Terrorism has emerged as one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. To defeat it  it is imperative for the global community to build on international cooperation and take concerted action against terrorists and their sponsors. There can be no justification for terrorism  just as there can be no good or bad terrorists. We urge Member States to display the necessary political will to finalize and adopt the comprehensive convention on international terrorism.  Peace and stability in South Asia is one of our highest priorities. We are committed to good-neighbourly relations with all our neighbours  including Pakistan. In that spirit of solidarity with the people of Pakistan in their hour of need we pledged $25 million in aid  which is being channelled through the United Nations for flood relief efforts in that country. As a neighbour  we wish to provide succour and relief in a timely manner to the victims of that natural disaster. We are saddened by the loss of life and property that Pakistan has suffered as a result of the unprecedented floods.  It is well known that many countries have deep-rooted concerns about the growth and consolidation of militancy and terrorism in Pakistan. We share those concerns  particularly because Jammu and Kashmir  which is an integral part of India  has been the target of such Pakistan-sponsored militancy and terrorism for many years now. Pakistan must fulfil its solemn commitment not to allow territory under its control to be used for terrorism directed against India. Credible and firm action by Pakistan against terrorist groups operating from its soil is in the interest of the region  as it is in Pakistan’s own interest.   Pakistan cannot impart lessons to us on democracy and human rights. If  however  Pakistan were to live up to its commitment not to allow the use of territory under its control by terrorists acting against India  that would significantly help reduce the trust deficit that impedes the development of better bilateral relations between our two countries. We are neighbours  and as neighbours we have an obligation to work together.  Afghanistan recently successfully concluded parliamentary elections. We believe the international community needs to be steadfast in its engagement with Afghanistan to ensure the success of its reconstruction efforts and its emergence as a democratic  pluralistic and prosperous society. The continuing existence of safe havens and sanctuaries for terrorists beyond Afghanistan’s borders is the major impediment to the restoration of peace and security in Afghanistan. That should be a primary focus of the international community.  Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru  India’s first Prime Minister  said in 1948:    5 10-55396   “The fundamental principles on which the United Nations is based are right principles. We believe in those fundamental principles and want to help the Organization in following these principles.” The Government and the more than 1 billion people of India have stood by that commitment. I would like to solemnly reaffirm our faith in the principles that underlie the United Nations  and in the United Nations system itself. "
"78",3265,"IRL",65,2010,"Let me begin by warmly congratulating President Joseph Deiss on his election and extending the best wishes of the Irish Government for a successful term in office.  We gather this year against a backdrop of grave challenges confronting the global community. Foremost among them is the continuing crisis of global hunger and poverty. We recognize the obligation upon us to fulfil the commitments made to the world’s most vulnerable people when the Assembly adopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000. Our Governments have to contend with the most severe global recession in many decades  but we must limit the impact of the crisis on those in greatest need. We must also maintain our commitment to halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty and hunger by 2015.  Firmer action is also called for in responding to the threat posed by climate change. If the global community fails to act now on that issue  we will face a steadily escalating threat to our planet and to human survival. In recent months  we have also seen the devastating consequences that natural catastrophes  such as those that have afflicted Pakistan and Haiti  can unleash on vulnerable populations.  As with so many of the challenges and threats to our common security  it is to this great Organization that we instinctively turn in searching for effective collective responses. The universality of its membership gives the United Nations a unique legitimacy and authority. It brings the nations of the world together under a common roof. It provides an invaluable framework for common reflection and decision-making. With the necessary political will  the Member States can use the authority and reach of the United Nations to fashion a more peaceful  equitable and secure world.  One area requiring our close attention is reform of the United Nations itself. To improve the effectiveness of the Organization  we need to ensure that its structures are fit for their purpose and adjusted to twenty-first-century realities. Ireland has actively championed the reform agenda at the United Nations in recent years  and we will continue to do so.  In that regard  I warmly welcome the establishment of UN Women. Ireland is committed to supporting that important new body within the United Nations system  as it promotes greater gender equality and works to enhance the rights and well-being of women worldwide. Also  the benefits to be had from the “delivering as one” programme — greater coherence in United Nations development activities and improved delivery of services at the country level — are clear and tangible. The valuable work done in those areas demonstrates that reform can be achieved when it is clearly shown to be in our collective interest.    10-55128 36   We need to do more  however. There is a pressing need for a Security Council that is more properly reflective of twenty-first-century realities and that can function better and with increased transparency. The constructive deliberations on that issue within the informal plenary of the General Assembly should be intensified  with a view to identifying whether there is a model for reform that can command broad consensus.  The system for apportioning the expenses of the Organization should better reflect the principle of capacity to pay. Ireland and its European Union partners have highlighted that issue in recent years  and we will continue to follow it closely. I look forward to positive results from the review of the existing scale methodology that the General Assembly has been mandated to carry out.  Perhaps the greatest challenge we face as a global community is to take effective action to eliminate poverty and hunger. We set ourselves clear targets in adopting the Millennium Development Goals 10 years ago. Here in New York we have reviewed progress over the past week. We have welcomed the remarkable progress that has been generated through our collective action in areas such as education  child health and the treatment of HIV and AIDS. But the reality remains that the actual numbers of people living in poverty and hunger in our world continue to increase.  In recent times  economic crisis and uncertainty have devastated the lives of communities already facing extreme poverty at the same time that they impose pressure on development budgets worldwide. It is therefore imperative that developed and developing countries  in partnership  now examine rigorously which actions have worked in the fight to end poverty and which can be pursued more effectively. We also need to focus more clearly on key sectors.  Since the publication of our Hunger Task Force report two years ago  Ireland has been arguing that a more concerted  comprehensive approach is required to end the continuing crisis of world hunger. The number of chronically hungry people has risen to almost one billion. One in four children in the developing world is undernourished. Failure to address that crisis is undermining progress across the full range of development goals. And yet the means are available  at an affordable cost  to end that scandal. We need to mobilize the political will to do so.  Last week  with the United States Secretary of State  I hosted a meeting of international leaders to build a partnership focusing on nutrition in the first one thousand days of life  from pregnancy to two years of age. We recognized and will give our full support to the Scaling Up Nutrition Initiative of the Secretary General. Our determination to maintain international attention to that issue is driven by the conviction that it is possible in the five years remaining to deliver measurable progress on our commitment to halve the proportion of people suffering from extreme poverty and hunger by 2015.  One of the core tasks of this Organization is to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. War and conflict are not merely profoundly destabilizing for the regions in which they occur; they also threaten the collective security of mankind. Mobilizing effective international responses to armed conflict  as and when it occurs  and providing peacekeeping and peacebuilding support in that context are high on the United Nations agenda. In that vitally important area  the United Nations record of accomplishment speaks for itself  as explicitly acknowledged through the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001.  There is one conflict that  more than most  requires the sustained engagement of the international community at the present time. The direct talks under way between Israeli and Palestinian leaders present a historic opportunity to make progress towards a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. I have no doubt that progress towards a comprehensive settlement based on the two-State solution would contribute more to improving global security than any other single peacebuilding effort.  I want to salute the leadership and commitment demonstrated by President Obama  Secretary of State Clinton and Special Envoy Mitchell in persuading Israel and the Palestinian Authority to resume direct negotiations. While there have been many critical junctures in the Middle East peace process in the past  there can be no doubting the significance of the initiative which is under way at present. It represents what is possibly the final opportunity to achieve a just settlement based on two States living side by side in peace and security.  President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu are also to be commended for their personal   37 10-55128  commitment to this process. I encourage both sides to stay the course and not to be deterred by those who seek to derail the process. In particular  I urge all parties to refrain from any actions which could endanger the negotiation process. It is vital that every effort be made to keep the process intact. Our own experience in the Northern Ireland peace process has shown that political progress can only be achieved through dialogue. Maximum restraint for the duration of these talks  which are intended to be — and should be — completed in 12 months  would be a small price for lasting peace. In this regard  I echo the statement made earlier today by the High Representative of the European Union (EU)  Catherine Ashton  regretting the Israeli decision not to extend the moratorium on settlements. There could be no greater single confidence-building measure and practical demonstration of commitment to peace than a decision to desist from all settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.  We must not forget Gaza at this critical time. I witnessed for myself the appalling humanitarian plight of the people of Gaza when I visited the region last February. Eighty per cent of them live below the poverty line. The deprivation and hardship that they are suffering because of the blockade are painfully obvious. Yet the people of Gaza show a remarkable dignity and resilience in the face of living conditions which are quite simply unacceptable.  I welcome the steps taken so far to improve the delivery of humanitarian and consumer goods to Gaza. However  the reality remains that much more needs to be done in terms of rebuilding Gaza and allowing normal commercial activity to resume. In particular  exports must be allowed to resume from Gaza; the vital work of recovery and reconstruction  which has been effectively on hold for almost two years  must be facilitated; and key infrastructural projects identified by the United Nations must be allowed to proceed.  I would also urge greater support for the invaluable work performed by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)  and its brave and dedicated staff  on behalf of the Palestinian people. I and others who have visited Gaza in recent months  such as Secretary-General Ban and European Union High Representative Ashton  can testify to the importance of what UNRWA is doing to support the welfare of Gaza’s inhabitants and to provide them with some basis for confidence in a better future.  The lack of progress in resolving the differences between the international community and Iran over that country’s nuclear programme is a source of great concern. I urge the Iranian authorities to engage constructively on this issue and to comply with the clear requirements set out in numerous Security Council and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) resolutions  most recently in Security Council resolution 1929 (2010). There is a sincere wish on the part of all of us to negotiate seriously and constructively with Iran on these and other important international issues. I look forward to such a dialogue resuming in the near future.  Any discussion with Iran would also need to include the human rights situation there  about which there continue to be the gravest concerns. Iran must do considerably more than it has done up to now to respect and fulfil the international obligations it has undertaken in the field of human rights. Recent cases of human rights abuses are profoundly disturbing  and Iran must be held fully accountable for them.  The global security which we all wish to achieve depends crucially on the eradication of the means of conflict. Efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament and to prevent the further proliferation of nuclear weapons have been key objectives for the United Nations since its inception. They have also been a major foreign policy priority for successive Irish Governments. Ireland was the first country to sign and ratify the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The successful outcome to last May’s NPT Review Conference has reinvigorated the Treaty and is an important milestone on the road towards the eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons. A key priority for Ireland is implementation of the action plan on nuclear disarmament agreed there.  I am pleased that Ireland made an important contribution at the Review Conference. In particular  we were able to facilitate progress in relation to implementation of the 1995 resolution on a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. I hope that the strong spirit of compromise evident at the Review Conference will be maintained and built upon in the preparations for the 2012 conference on the Middle East resolution.    10-55128 38   Ireland is also satisfied with the progress made over the past couple of years on the issue of cluster munitions. The Convention on Cluster Munitions  which was negotiated in Dublin in May 2008  has entered into force as of 1 August this year. This landmark development brings closer the prospect of the elimination of all cluster munitions and of the unacceptable harm to civilians they cause. We must now move ahead with implementation of the Convention and promotion of the widest possible adherence to its provisions.  Ireland is actively supporting preparations for the first meeting of States Parties of the Convention in Vientiane in November. We will continue to show leadership on this issue and to do all we can to ensure the worldwide elimination of these atrocious weapons.  This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the first deployment of Irish troops under the United Nations flag. In 1960  just five years after we joined this Organization  Ireland decided to participate in a peacekeeping mission to what was then the newly independent Congo. This began a long and distinguished tradition of service in United Nations peacekeeping operations in a wide variety of conflict situations around the globe. We will continue to contribute personnel to such missions and to play our part in the maintenance of international peace and security. I welcome the constructive discussions which have taken place within the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations on ways of improving the future conduct and management of United Nations peacekeeping missions  following on from Secretary-General Ban’s recent paper on the New Horizon Initiative.  This year  Ireland was honoured when our Permanent Representative  Ambassador Anne Anderson  took on the role of co-facilitator  along with South African and Mexican colleagues  of a major review of the United Nations peacebuilding architecture. We were very pleased to be able to make our contribution to this important and wide-ranging reflection on the work of the Peacebuilding Commission  five years after its establishment. The three co-facilitators have submitted a report which aims to revitalize the Commission and give it renewed focus and impact. I look forward to positive consideration by Member States of this report and the recommendations it makes.  Ireland has also been active in relation to another set of issues which have a significant bearing on conflict resolution and peacebuilding. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)  which  for the first time  explicitly acknowledged the key role of women in conflict resolution and peacebuilding. We have been working hard to raise international awareness of this resolution and to encourage greater implementation of its provisions by Member States.  As part of our focus on resolution 1325 (2000)  we have been pleased to work with Liberia and Timor-Leste in conducting important lessons-learned exercises. A report will be presented to the Secretary-General shortly on the key findings made in this process. We are also working to finalize our national action plan on women  peace and security in the very near future.  Ireland strongly supports the vital role played by the United Nations in upholding and defending human rights around the world. Next year’s review of the Human Rights Council provides an opportunity to assess the Council’s performance to date and to consider how it might be improved and strengthened. As a candidate for election in 2012  we look forward to making our own contribution to the work of enhancing the Council’s performance.  Ireland is also deeply supportive of the work of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Tribunals in promoting justice and combating impunity. I welcome the successful outcome to the recent Kampala Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court  including in relation to defining the crime of aggression  and I urge the fullest cooperation on the part of all Member States with both the ICC and the International Tribunals.  The appalling human tragedy of Darfur continues to challenge the international community. I applaud the courageous efforts of the United Nations personnel and all of the others on the ground in Darfur who are working to provide vital humanitarian services.  We hope that all sides in Sudan will continue to engage in the fullest cooperation in support of the United Nations/African Union mediation efforts in Darfur and also in the preparations for the historic referendum in southern Sudan early next year. Full implementation of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace   39 10-55128  Agreement still remains fundamental to securing peace and stability in Sudan as a whole and in the region.  The continuing unjust detention of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma epitomizes the fate of prisoners of conscience everywhere who seek to uphold the values of democracy and free speech. I call for her immediate and unconditional release. I also call for the release of all other political prisoners in Burma and for the launching of a genuine  inclusive national dialogue. And I very much endorse Secretary-General Ban’s call on Burma’s leaders to create the conditions in which free and fair elections can take place.  In a world where we continue to face enormous peacebuilding challenges  the Northern Ireland peace process is an example of what can be achieved with patience  imagination and strong international support. This year saw a hugely significant step forward in Northern Ireland with the devolution of policing and justice powers to a locally elected Minister accountable to the Northern Ireland Assembly. That is a major step towards fulfilling the vision of the Good Friday Agreement  which was signed 12 years ago.  That Agreement provides a genuine possibility for political inclusion for all who reject violence. It is the framework within which the Irish Government  working in partnership and full cooperation with the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive  is helping to build economic prosperity  assist communities to move beyond conflict and sow the seeds for a shared future for all.  The European Union and its 27 member States are firmly committed to effective multilateralism with a strong United Nations at its core. We look forward to further consultations with the Member States of this Organization on proposed changes to the status of the European Union in the General Assembly. These modest adjustments will help the Union to make a more effective contribution to the work of the Assembly and of the United Nations. A European Union speaking with a clear and coherent voice on the great global challenges that this Organization must address will  I believe  strengthen the impact and effectiveness of the United Nations as a whole. That is something to which Ireland and its EU partners attach the utmost importance.  We live in times of profound and unsettling change and daunting global challenges. As we struggle to deal with these challenges and to chart ways forward in an insecure world  the United Nations is an increasingly valuable resource. It remains the international organization with the greatest potential for international consensus-building and for the framing of collective strategies and solutions. At its heart are the fundamental principles embodied in the United Nations Charter  principles which have underpinned the conduct of international relations over the past 65 years and whose strength and validity is more apparent today than ever before.  Ireland is steadfastly committed to this Organization and the principles and values on which it rests. I very much welcome the General Assembly President’s emphasis on the need for a strong  inclusive and open United Nations  and we look forward to taking part in the consultations which he has indicated he will be convening. We look to the United Nations as the indispensable forum for developing effective multilateralism and for leading international endeavours towards the creation of a more peaceful  prosperous and secure world."
"79",3312,"IRN",65,2010,"I am grateful to the Almighty God who has granted me the opportunity to appear before this world Assembly once again.  I wish to begin by commemorating those who lost their lives in the horrible flood in Pakistan and expressing my heartfelt sympathy with the families who lost their loved ones  as well as with the people   7 10-54833  and the Government of Pakistan. I urge everyone to assist their fellow men and women as a humane duty.  Let me thank Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  who presided over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  for all his efforts during his tenure. I also congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on being elected to preside over the current session  and wish him every success.  In past years  I have spoken to the Assembly about some hopes and concerns; some concerns involve family crises  the security challenge  disrespect for human dignity  the deterioration of the world economy  climate change and disregard for human aspirations to achieve justice and lasting peace.  After about a hundred years of domination  the capitalist system and the existing world order have proved to be unable to provide appropriate solutions to the problems of societies; thus their demise has come about. I shall try to examine several causes of this failure and picture features of an ideal order.  The first cause of failure relates to our attitudes and beliefs. As the Assembly is well aware  the divine prophets had the mission to call everyone to monotheism  love and justice and to show mankind the path to prosperity. They invite men to contemplation and to seek knowledge in order to better appreciate the truth and to refrain from atheism and egoism.  The essence of the message of all prophets is one and the same. Every messenger endorsed the messenger before him  and gave glad tidings about the prophet to come  who presented a more complete version of the religion in accordance with man’s capacity at the time. This trend continued until the last messenger of God  who presented the perfection of an all-inclusive religion.  In opposition to the call by the prophets  the egoist and the greedy stood up against their clear call  revolting against their messages. Nimrod countered Hazrat Abraham  Pharaoh countered Hazrat Moses  and the greedy countered Hazrat Jesus Christ and Hazrat Muhammad — may peace be upon all our prophets.  In recent centuries  human ethics and values have been rejected as a cause of backwardness. They were even portrayed as opposing wisdom and science  because the proclaimers of religion in the dark ages of the West inflicted man with backwardness. Therefore  man’s disconnection from heaven has detached him from his true self.  Man — with his potential to understand the secrets of the universe  his instinct to seek truth  his aspirations for justice and perfection  his quest for beauty and purity  and his capacity to represent God on Earth — has been reduced to a creature restricted by the materialistic world with a mission to maximize individualistic pleasures. Human instinct  then  replaced true human nature.  Human beings and nations are considered rivals  and the happiness of an individual or a nation is upheld at the cost of others  to the point of even eliminating or suppressing others; rather than developing a constructive and evolutionary method of cooperation  it was replaced by a destructive struggle for survival. The lust for capital and domination replaced monotheism  which is the gateway to love and unity.  This widespread clash of the egoist with the divine values gave way to slavery and colonialism. A large part of the world came under the domination of a few Western States. Tens of millions of people were taken into slavery  and tens of millions of families were shattered as a result. All the resources  the rights and the cultures of the colonized nations were plundered. Lands were occupied and the indigenous people were humiliated and mass-murdered.  Yet  nations rose up  colonialism was alienated  and the independence of nations was recognized. Thus  the hope for respect  prosperity and security was revived among nations. In the beginning of the past century beautiful motives of freedom  human rights and democracy created hopes for healing the deep wounds of the past. Today  however  not only are those dreams not realized  but memories  even at times more bitter than before  have been recorded in our history.  As a result of the two World Wars  the occupation of Palestine  the Korean and Viet Nam wars  the Iraq war against Iran  the occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq  as well as many wars in Africa  hundreds of millions of people were killed  wounded or displaced. Terrorism  illicit drug production  poverty and social gaps have increased. The dictatorial and coups d’état Governments in Latin America committed unprecedented crimes  with the support of the West.  Instead of disarmament  the proliferation and stockpiling of nuclear  biological and chemical    10-54833 8  weapons expanded  putting the world under a bigger threat. As a result  the very same old goals of colonialists and the slave masters were pursued  but this time around with a new façade.  The second cause of the failure of the existing world order and capitalism has to do with the current global management and its ruling structures. The League of Nations and then the United Nations were established with the promise of bringing about peace  security and the realization of human rights  which in fact meant a global management.  One can analyse the current system for governance of world affairs by examining three events.  The first event is that of 11 September 2001  which has affected the whole world for almost a decade. We recall that at the time suddenly the news of an attack on the Twin Towers was broadcast using numerous footages of the incident. Almost all Governments and important figures strongly condemned this incident. But then a propaganda machine came into full force; it was implied that the whole world was now exposed to a huge danger — terrorism — and that the only way to save the world was to deploy forces into Afghanistan. Eventually Afghanistan and shortly thereafter Iraq were occupied.  I ask the Assembly please to take note: It was said that some 3 000 people were killed on 11 September  for which we are all very saddened. Yet so far in Afghanistan and Iraq hundreds of thousands of people have been killed  while millions have been wounded and displaced  and the conflict is still going on and expanding.  In identifying those responsible for the 11 September attack  there were three viewpoints. The first was that a very powerful and complex terrorist group  able to successfully cross all layers of American intelligence and security  carried out the attack. That is the prevalent viewpoint advocated by American statesmen.  The second viewpoint was that some segments within the United States Government orchestrated the attack to reverse the declining American economy and its grip on the Middle East in order also to save the Zionist regime. The majority of the American people as well as other nations and politicians around the world agree with this view.  The third viewpoint was that the attack was carried out by a terrorist group  but that the American Government supported and took advantage of the situation. Apparently  this viewpoint has fewer proponents.  The main evidence for that viewpoint links the incident to a few passports found in the huge volume of rubble and a video of an individual whose place of domicile was unknown  but it was announced that he had been involved in oil deals with some American officials. It was also covered up and said that due to the explosion and fire no trace of suicide attackers was found.  Regardless of each of those three viewpoints  there remain a few questions to be answered.  First  would it not have been sensible that first a thorough investigation should have been conducted by independent groups to conclusively identify the elements involved in the attack and then map out a rational plan to take measures against them?  Secondly  assuming the viewpoint of the American Government  is it rational to launch a classic war through widespread deployment of troops that led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people to counter a terrorist group?  Thirdly  was it not possible to act in the way in which Iran conducted the operations fighting the Riggi terrorist group  who killed and wounded 400 innocent people? In the Iranian operation no innocent person was harmed.  It is proposed that the United Nations set up an independent fact-finding group in regard to the event of 11 September to ensure that the different views about it are not banned from future discussions.  I wish to announce here that next year the Islamic Republic of Iran will host a conference to study terrorism and the means to confront it. I invite officials  scholars  thinkers  researchers and research institutes of all countries to attend the conference.  The second cause of the demise of the existing world order is the occupation of the Palestinian territories. The oppressed people of Palestine have lived under the rule of an occupying regime for 60 years  and have been deprived of freedom  security and the right to self-determination  while the occupiers are given recognition. On a daily basis  houses are   9 10-54833  being destroyed over the heads of innocent women and children. People are deprived of water  food and medicine in their own homeland.  The Zionists have imposed five all-out wars on the neighbouring countries and on the Palestinian people. The Zionists committed the most horrible crimes against defenceless people in the wars against Lebanon and Gaza. The Zionist regime attacked a humanitarian flotilla in a blatant defiance of all international norms and killed civilians. This regime  which enjoys the absolute support of some Western countries  regularly threatens the countries in the region and continues publicly to announce the assassination of Palestinian figures  while Palestinian defenders and those opposing the regime are pressured  labelled as terrorists and called anti-Semites. All values  even the freedom of expression  which seem to matter so much in Europe and in the United States  and to be so important  have been sacrificed at the altar of Zionism.  Solutions are doomed to fail because the right of the Palestinian people is not taken into account. Would we have witnessed such horrendous crimes if instead of the occupation being recognized  the sovereign right of the Palestinian people had been recognized?  Our unambiguous proposition favours the return of the Palestinian refugees to their home land and a vote by the people of Palestine  all Palestinians  to exercise their sovereignty and decide on their type of governance.  The third cause of the demise of the existing order has to do with the outlook on nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is clean and cheap and a heavenly gift which is among the most suitable alternatives to cut pollution emanating from fossil fuels. The Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) allows all States parties to use nuclear energy without limits  and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is mandated to provide such States with technical and legal support.  The nuclear bomb is the worst inhumane weapon  and must be totally eliminated. The NPT prohibits its development and stockpiling  and calls for nuclear disarmament. Nonetheless  some permanent members of the Security Council and other nuclear Powers — those that possess the nuclear bomb — have resorted to the following measure. They have equated nuclear energy with the nuclear bomb  and have removed such energy from the reach of most nations by establishing monopolies and pressuring IAEA. At the same time  they have continued to maintain  expand and upgrade their own nuclear arsenals. The Assembly may have heard that in the current year the United States Administration has asked for $80 billion to maintain its nuclear bombs.  The situation that I have described has entailed the following: Not only has nuclear disarmament not been realized  but also nuclear bombs have proliferated in some regions  including by the occupying and intimidating Zionist regime. Here I would like to propose that 2011 be proclaimed the year of nuclear disarmament and nuclear energy for all  nuclear weapons for none.  In all the cases to which I have referred  I admit  the United Nations has been unable to take any effective  viable course of action. Unfortunately  in the decade proclaimed as the “International Decade for the Culture of Peace” hundreds of thousands have been killed and injured as a result of war  aggression and occupation  and hostilities and antagonism have increased.  Very recently the world witnessed an abhorrent and inhumane act of burning the Holy Koran. The Holy Koran is the Divine Book and the eternal miracle of the Prophet of Islam. It calls for worshipping the One God  justice  compassion towards people  development and progress  reflection and thought  defence of the oppressed and resistance against oppressors; and it names with respect the previous Messengers of God  such as Noah  Abraham  Isaac  Joseph  Moses and Jesus Christ — may peace be upon all the prophets — and endorses them. The Koran was burned to burn all those truths and good judgements.  However  the truth cannot be burned. The Koran is eternal  because God and truth are everlasting. This act and any other act that widens the gap and distances between nations is evil. We should wisely avoid playing into the hands of Satan. On behalf of the Iranian nation  I pay respect to all divine books and their followers. In one hand I hold up the Koran and in the other the Bible. We pay respect to both books  as both are dear to us.  For years the inefficiency of capitalism and the existing world management structures have been exposed enough for us to understand what they mean. The majority of States and peoples have begun a quest    10-54833 10  for fundamental changes and to allow justice in global relations to prevail.  The cause of the United Nations ineptitude is its unjust structure. Major Powers have monopolized the Security Council  due to their veto privilege  and sidelined the General Assembly  which is the main pillar of the Organization.  In the past several decades  at least one permanent member of the Security Council has always been a party to a conflict. When both the judge and the prosecutor are on the same side of a conflict  how can one expect justice? They feel immune in aggression owing to the structure of the United Nations. For example  if Iran enjoyed the veto privilege  would the Security Council and the IAEA Director General have taken the same position on the nuclear issue?  The United Nations is the key centre for coordinating common global management. Its structure needs to be reformed in such a manner that all independent States and nations may participate actively and constructively in global governance.  The veto privilege should be revoked. The General Assembly should be the highest body  and the Secretary-General should be the most independent official and all his positions and activities should be taken with the approval of the General Assembly and should be directed towards promoting justice and eliminating discrimination in the world order.  The Secretary-General should not come under pressure from Powers and/or the country hosting the Organization for stating the truth and administering justice. It is proposed that the General Assembly should  within a year and in the framework of an extraordinary session  finalize the reformation of the Organization’s structure. The Islamic Republic of Iran has clear suggestions in this regard and stands ready to participate actively and constructively in the process.  I announce clearly that the occupation of other countries under the pretext of freedom and democracy is an unforgivable crime. The world needs the logic of compassion and justice and inclusive participation instead of the logic of force  domination  unilateralism  war and humiliation. The world needs to be governed by virtuous people like the Divine Prophets.  The two vast geographical spheres of Africa and Latin America have experienced historic developments during past decades  developments that have changed their face. The new approaches in these two continents  based on an increasing level of integration and unity  as well as on localizing the growth and development models  have borne considerable fruits for the peoples of those regions. The awareness and wisdom of the leaders of the two continents have overcome the regional problems and crises  free of the domineering interference of non-regional Powers.  The Islamic Republic of Iran has expanded its relations with Latin America and Africa in all aspects in recent years.  And now I speak about the glorious Iran. The Tehran Declaration was a hugely constructive step in confidence-building efforts  a step made possible through the admirable good will of the Governments of Brazil and Turkey  along with the close  sincere and honest cooperation of the Iranian Government. Although there was an inappropriate reaction to the Declaration by some Western Powers  and it was followed by an unlawful resolution  it is still valid.  We have observed the IAEA regulations beyond the requirements of our commitments  yet we have never submitted to illegally imposed pressures  nor will we ever do so.  It has been said that there is a desire to pressure Iran into a dialogue. Well  first  Iran has always been ready for a dialogue based on respect and justice. Secondly  methods based on disrespecting nations have long been ineffective. Those who have used intimidation and sanctions in response to the clear logic of the Iranian nation are in real terms destroying the remaining credibility of the Security Council and the trust of nations in it  proving once again how unjust is the Council’s function.  When those concerned threaten a great nation  a great people  such as Iran  which has been known throughout history for its scientists  poets  artists and philosophers  and whose culture and civilization are synonymous with purity  submission to God and seeking justice  how can they ever expect other nations to have confidence in them?  It goes without saying that domineering methods — and mainly capitalism — in managing the world have failed. Not only has the era of slavery and colonialism and dominating the world passed  the path to reviving old Empires is blocked  too.   11 10-54833   We have announced that we stand ready for a serious and free debate with the American statesmen in this very venue to express our transparent views on issues of importance to the world. It is proposed here that in order to have a constructive dialogue  an annual free debate be organized within the General Assembly.  In conclusion  the Iranian nation and the majority of the world’s nations and Governments are opposed to the current discriminatory management of the world. The inhumane nature of that management has led it to a dead end  and it requires a major overhaul.  Reforming the world’s affairs and bringing about tranquillity and prosperity requires the participation of all  pure thoughts and the divine and humane management that we have been given. We are all of the view that justice is the basic element for peace  durable security and the spread of love among peoples and nations. It is in justice that mankind seeks the realization of his aspirations  rights and dignity  since he is wary of oppression  humiliation and ill-treatment.  The true nature of mankind is manifested in love for fellow humans and love for all the good in the world. Love is the best foundation for establishing relations among people and among nations. As Vahshi Bafgi  the great Iranian poet  says  “From the fountain of youth  drink a thousand sips/You’ll still die if you don’t have love’s grip”. In making a world full of purity  safety and prosperity  people are not rivals  but companions. Those who see their happiness only in the sorrow of others and their welfare and safety only in others’ insecurity  those who see themselves as superior to others  are out of the path of humanity and are in evil’s course.  Economy and materialistic means are only some tools to serve others  to create friendship and strengthen human connections for spiritual perfection. They are not tools for showing off or means of dominating others.  Men and women complement each other  and the family unit  with pure  loving and long-lasting relations of the spouses  becomes the centre and the guarantee of the continuity and bringing up of generations  for true pleasures  for spreading true love and for reforming society.  Woman is a reflection of God’s beauty and the source of love and care. She is the guardian of purity and exquisiteness of society. The tendency to toughen the souls and behaviours of women deprives them of their very basic right of being a loving mother and a caring wife. It will result in a more violent society with irreversible defects.  Freedom is a divine right that should serve peace and human perfection. Pure thoughts and the will of the righteous are keys to the gates of a pure life full of hope  liveliness and beauty. This is the promise of God — that the Earth will be inherited by the pure and the righteous. And the people free from selfishness will take up the management of the world. Then there will be no trace of sorrow  discrimination  poverty  insecurity and aggression. The time for true happiness and the blossoming of the true nature of humankind  the way God has intended  will arrive.  All those seeking justice and all the free spirits have been waiting for this moment and have been promised such a glorious time. The complete human  the true servant of God and the true friend of mankind  whose father was from the generation of the beloved Prophet of Islam and whose mother was from the true believers of Jesus Christ  shall wait along with Jesus  the son of Mary  and the other righteous to appear on those brilliant days and assist humanity. In welcoming them  we should join ranks and seek justice  as would be befitting of man.  Praise to love and worship  praise to justice and freedom  praise to true humanity  the complete human  the true companion of humankind. I say to all those listening: “Peace be upon you and all the righteous and the pure.” "
"80",3359,"IRQ",65,2010,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session  and the friendly people of Switzerland  on his election. Our delegation will cooperate with him to its fullest extent in the performance of his task. We are confident that his experience and wisdom will be important factors in the success of the Assembly’s work and in the achievement of the purposes of the United Nations. I also thank his predecessor  my close friend Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  for presiding over the Assembly at its last session.  The political process in Iraq since the collapse of the dictatorial regime in 2003 has resulted in radical political change  as well as in the building of a federal  democratic  independent and united Iraq with respected constitutional institutions and a Government elected in accordance with the Constitution. Achieving that goal   41 10-54833  was neither easy nor simple. Iraq faced many challenges  foremost of which was confronting extremist  sectarian and factional forces and countering terrorist groups and groups of the former dictatorial regime that are attempting to take Iraq back to the dark era of mass graves and fruitless wars.  Those groups have used various means  including the most heinous crimes  and have allied themselves with organized crime and transnational terrorist networks in order to destabilize the security situation in Iraq. The main task of the Government of Iraq was to provide security throughout the country and to strengthen national unity and the rule of law.  There have been significant developments in Iraq since I stood before the Assembly last year. This year and last have witnessed a significant decrease in violence and a marked improvement in security in Iraq. Although there were some terrorist acts targeting innocent civilians in different places in the country  the overall security situation has improved  and that paved the way for the withdrawal of United States combat forces operating in Iraq. The complete pullout of those forces on 31 August 2010 was based on the Agreement Between the United States of America and the Republic of Iraq On the Withdrawal of United States Forces from Iraq and the Organization of Their Activities during Their Temporary Presence in Iraq  signed by both parties on 17 November 2008.  This year has also seen successful legislative elections  which were held on 7 March with considerable Arab  regional and international interest. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq and the observers from the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the League of Arab States  the international community and civil society organizations all expressed their belief that the elections were transparent  free and fair.  The principal political parties have been in continuous communication with the aim of holding a fruitful session of the newly elected Iraqi Council of Representatives to elect a Speaker for the new parliament and the President of the Republic of Iraq  after which  according to the provisions of the Iraqi Constitution  the elected President will ask a new Prime Minister to form a Government. It is our hope that that new Government will be formed as soon as possible  as any delay will negatively affect the security situation  reconstruction and prosperity.  The improved security situation in Iraq has encouraged many Arab and other countries to reopen their diplomatic missions and has helped to develop Iraqi relations regionally and internationally. The appointment of new Iraqi ambassadors to various countries around the world has also helped to promote and broaden the horizons of those relations. Iraq’s assuming the presidency of the current session of the Arab League and of the Arab Summit Conference in March of next year will promote Iraq’s regional role and will be considered an important step in its efforts to regain its global standing as an effective and responsible member of the international community. The Government of Iraq will continue to move in that direction through strengthening its friendships  cooperation and good-neighbourly efforts  thus creating greater opportunity for stability and security in the region.  In the development arena  on 4 April 2010 the Government of Iraq initiated a national development plan for the five-year period from 2010 to 2014. It contains around 2 700 strategic projects in various sectors at a total cost of $186 billion. That plan will help to develop the Iraqi economy and enhance the quality of services provided to Iraqis. It will also create 4 million jobs  thus helping the unemployment problem in Iraq.  The national development plan will also help Iraqi refugees return to their homes. The Government of Iraq believes that the real solution for the problem of Iraqi refugees and displaced persons lies in their return to their homeland and their residences. Iraq needs the experience of all its citizens to help build the country’s future. We therefore call upon countries hosting Iraqi refugees  international organizations and civil society organizations to promote awareness of the culture of voluntary return.  Iraqi women enjoy important status in the new federal and united Iraq and enjoy political rights equal to those of men. Women have been granted 25 per cent of the seats in the Iraqi Council of Representatives. Additionally  for the first time in many decades  the women of Iraq have assumed many important ministerial positions and have represented their country as ambassadors  this after having been deprived of those rights for more than 30 years. The Constitution also guarantees that women grant their nationality to their children.    10-54833 42   The Constitution formulated the basic principles of Iraq’s foreign policy  which focuses on observing good-neighbourliness and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  the resolution of disputes by peaceful means and the establishment of international relations based on shared interests and respect for Iraq’s international obligations. On that basis  we seek to establish the best relations with sisterly Arab and Islamic countries and are committed to the resolutions of the Arab League and the Organization of the Islamic Conference.  In this spirit we support the Palestinian people’s just struggle to secure their inalienable rights  including the establishment of a Palestinian State on the land of Palestine  as we work to implement the internationally legitimate resolutions aimed at returning the occupied Arab territories. We consider the Arab Peace Initiative to be a practical step towards resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict and achieving security  peace and stability in the Middle East.  We also call for making the Middle East a zone free of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction  which would enhance the prospects for peace and security in the region. We call on all States that have not yet done so to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and comply with its provisions.  With regard to the Iranian nuclear issue  Iraq believes in the legitimate right of States to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. That is a right guaranteed by international conventions  including the NPT. We stress the importance of reaching a peaceful solution to that issue  and that dialogue and quiet diplomacy are the most effective ways to achieve that goal. Any escalation would harm the interests of all parties and would endanger regional security.  The most important issue Iraq continues to face is the removal of the burden created by Security Council resolutions adopted against it under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. By reviewing those resolutions  in accordance with Council resolution 1859 (2008) and in response to the report of the Secretary-General in document S/2009/385  we have been working diligently with our friends and members of the Council to settle all the outstanding issues concerning the situation in Iraq.  At the forefront of those issues are the remaining restrictions on Iraq in the field of disarmament  the conclusion of the remaining contracts under the Oil-for-Food programme and finding the right mechanism for guaranteeing Iraqi funds following the replacement of the Development Fund for Iraq and the International Advisory and Monitoring Board for Iraq. Iraq would like to see those dossiers closed by the end of this year.  The newly elected Iraqi Government will also deal with the situation between Iraq and sisterly Kuwait and related issues  such as the maintenance of border pillars  compensation and missing Kuwaiti persons and properties. We will work seriously with our Kuwaiti brothers  other stakeholders and United Nations organs to reach a settlement that satisfies all parties without prejudice to our obligations under Security Council resolutions  concerning which we emphasize our respect and commitment.  The situation in Iraq has changed as a result of the important positive developments since the collapse of the former regime and the end of the dictatorship. It is drastically different from the situation at the time the Security Council adopted resolution 661 (1990). For that reason  and following the adoption of resolution 1859 (2008) and the publication of the report of the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 5 of that resolution (S/2009/385)  we believe that the time is ripe for the Council to act in accordance with the Secretary-General’s report and the mandate set out in resolution 1859 (2008). Also  in keeping with its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security  it is time for the Council to review resolutions pertaining specifically to Iraq  beginning with resolution 661 (1990)  with a view to helping Iraq achieve the international standing it enjoyed before those resolutions were adopted.  The current political process in Iraq aims at building a federal  democratic  independent and united Iraq  where citizens work within a constitutional framework that guarantees the rule of law  where human rights are protected and where all segments of the Iraqi people are treated with full respect. We have great faith in our ability and potential  as a country rich in natural and human resources  to achieve those objectives.  However  at this important stage in the life of the Iraqi people  we continue to need the political and economic support of and cooperation from the international community in order to stand on a firm foundation — one that will enable us to advance   43 10-54833  towards a future in which not only can we promote our country’s and our people’s stability  progress and prosperity  but also contribute fully as a member of the international community to the achievement of peace  security and sustainable development for all nations."
"81",3406,"ISL",65,2010,"Let me start by congratulating His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election to the presidency at the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly  and assuring him of the fullest cooperation of the Icelandic delegation.  When I spoke for the first time from this distinguished rostrum last year  my country was ravaged by financial crisis. It left Iceland with a total collapse of the entire banking system. Our financial crisis was exacerbated by the worldwide recession  but I have to tell you  honestly  that to a large extent it was made in Iceland. It was the product of a system that embraced the neo-liberalistic view of rampant capitalism with lax regulations. Economic emergency laws had to be passed. And we needed the helping hand of our close family in the North  the Nordic nations  not least the Faroese  and our friends the Poles  in the form of currency loans  just to prevent our society from melting down.  Now we have swallowed the bitter medicine of fiscal cuts and radical financial reforms. We have embarked on close cooperation with the International Monetary Fund. And Iceland has now applied for membership of the European Union  on which the Icelandic people will decide in a referendum in due course.  A specially appointed prosecutor is now handling the cases of bankers who allegedly broke the law  and this week  parliament in Iceland is debating whether to prosecute former ministers. So we took firm  decisive action.  Well  I can tell you  the medicine worked. Iceland is pulling through. We are finally on the road to recovery. We are blessed with ample resources in the form of fish in the ocean  the fierce power of our waterfalls and geothermal geysers and a pristine natural environment that supports a flourishing tourism sector. Economic growth is  finally  returning to Iceland.  I am therefore very happy to inform the Assembly that  this summer  the International Monetary Fund declared that  technically  the recession in Iceland is over. I want to use this opportunity to thank Member States for their support and their understanding.  The crisis turned our eyes back to what really matters in life  the core values of democracy and human rights. At home  we have taken important steps to change the Constitution to increase the people’s power. We are also proud of having legally ensured full equality for same-sex partnerships  and we strongly urge other nations to remove all discrimination based on sexual orientation.  As the Assembly knows  our foreign policy has always reflected the high priority we place on gender equality. This year  we celebrate 95 years since women first gained the right to vote and 30 years ago since a woman was first elected President in Iceland. As members saw for themselves  with their own eyes  when the Icelandic Prime Minister spoke here this week  the Icelandic Government is now led by a woman.  In New York  we also have cause to celebrate. Iceland for years has supported a new and consolidated United Nations gender entity  and  look  today it is a reality. Well done  United Nations  you deserve a big pile of thanks for your vision and for your courage. I can state that Iceland will be a strong supporter of UN Women  just as we have been through the transitional phase.  There is also  I believe  another cause for this Assembly to celebrate  and that is the fact that next month we will celebrate the 10-year anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000). This has been a priority of the foreign policy of Iceland. Let the nations of the United Nations come together to celebrate by increasing the participation of women in peace negotiations. Empowering women is empowering society.  But it is exactly with reference to women’s rights that we have learned with utter sadness about the decision of Iranian courts to stone to death an Iranian woman  Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani. President Ahmadinejad  on behalf of the Icelandic people  I ask you to spare Ashtiani.  When we address the looming dangers of climate change  human rights are also at stake. Climate change will wreak havoc on the lives of a great number of people. It will erode what we as an international community have defined as their basic human rights.  Let me take three different examples. The small island nations in the Pacific are threatened by rising sea levels to such an extent that whole nations might be forced to leave the land of their forebears — Kiribati  for instance. The floods in Pakistan caused death to many and devastation to tens of millions of people. The    10-54965 54  melting of the Arctic ice may prevent my neighbours  the Inuits  from pursuing their traditional lifestyle based on hunting on the ice.  All this is aggravated by the limitless use of fossil fuels that is literally tipping the delicate balance of nature. We  the wealthy nations of the world  are therefore paying for the quality of our good life with the human rights of others. If we do not take drastic action  more radical action than what was agreed in Copenhagen  future generations will see ours as serial offenders against the human rights of peoples in need.  At the same time  millions of people lack access to safe drinking water and sanitation. It is a firm position of my Government that the right to safe drinking water and basic sanitation should be recognized as a human right  essential for the real and full enjoyment of life and all other human rights.  In the fight against climate change  Iceland tries to lead by example. We already meet 80 per cent of our energy needs through renewables  and that is far higher than any other nation can claim. We have campaigned for a new global climate fund with the goal of financing the transfer of green technologies to developing countries.  But we in Iceland also want to contribute in another way. As the Assembly knows  we have not been able to stop the volcanoes in Iceland from erupting with huge clouds of ash  but we have learned to harness the fierce power of the fire beneath  and put it to use as geothermal energy. Geothermal by itself  of course  will not solve all the climate problems  but in some parts of the world it could make a huge difference.  In East Africa  the utilization of geothermal potential could free the people of several nations from the bondage of energy poverty. They do  however  lack the geothermal expertise and the finances for the infrastructure.  Iceland  therefore  has formally engaged in discussions with some of the big nations operating  for example  in East Africa to form a partnership for a geothermal drive in countries with unused potential. Iceland would put up the expertise  the partners the necessary financing. This initiative could enable some countries to escape from energy poverty  industrialize without undue emissions and embark on the road to prosperity.  I have spent almost this entire speech of mine tonight talking about human rights in one form or another  and human rights cannot be debated without discussing the plight of the Palestinians and the people of Gaza. We now have the results of the experts  mandated by the Human Rights Council  who concluded that Israel broke international law by attacking the flotilla bringing humanitarian assistance to Gaza last spring.  Iceland has strongly condemned the raid. It drew a strong reaction from Icelandic society at large. I can tell the Assembly that the Icelandic nation is deeply sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinians  held in occupation by an oppressing Power. As I speak  we have Icelandic humanitarian workers being held up in Israel  trying to bring prosthetic feet to people in Gaza who have lost their limbs  people that urgently need assistance. This is not acceptable to Iceland. This is not acceptable to the world. This is inhuman and unjust  and we urge Israel not to prevent humanitarian assistance from reaching the needy in Gaza.  Yesterday  we heard President Obama urge patience  but we also heard a hidden hope in his words. Well  we know that sometimes dreams come true. Sometimes the unexpected happens. Sometimes we even have miracles. We in Iceland will  of course  strongly support the resumed direct talks  and let us all hope and pray for a solution that will allow us  as soon as possible  to welcome the independent State of Palestine as the 193rd member of the United Nations family.  In the meantime  all of us should use every possible  sensible way to demonstrate our solidarity with the people of Palestine. My country  Iceland  was not afraid to stand up and be counted on behalf of the people in the Baltic States almost 20 years ago  when Iceland was the first country to break the ice and recognize their independence. The same happened with regard to Croatia  Slovenia and later Montenegro. And today Iceland is not afraid to stand up for the Palestinian people either. Every nation has a duty to defend human rights. Every nation has a duty to speak up. That is no less true for Palestine  where human rights are broken — especially in Gaza — every day."
"82",3453,"ISR",65,2010,"When I arrived yesterday in New York  I received a phone call from the chairman of one of the Jewish organizations  who asked me how I was coping with all the pressure that is being placed on Israel. “Surely”  he said  “it must be very difficult”. I recalled an old joke  which tells of five Jews who changed the way we see the world: Moses  law is everything; Jesus  love is everything; Marx  money is everything; Freud  sex is everything; and Einstein  everything is relative. So  I told him that everything is relative. On one hand  it is very difficult. On the other hand  it is easier than before  because now we have a stable coalition and a stable Government and we have the support of a majority of Israel’s citizens. We are ready for a fair solution and we are ready to cooperate with the international community. However  we are not ready to compromise our national security or the vital interests of the State of Israel.  At the outset  I want to emphasize that  contrary to what is often presented in the international media  the political arena in Israel is not divided between those who seek peace and those who seek war. Everyone wants peace  and the controversy in Israel centres on the specific question of how to achieve this peace  how to reach security and stability in the region. And the question is: why  in the 17 years since we signed the Oslo Accords  have we not arrived at a comprehensive agreement signifying the end of the conflict and the removal of future mutual claims?  Despite all of the efforts of all the good people with the best of intentions  including Yitzhak Rabin  Shimon Peres  Benjamin Netanyahu  Ehud Barak  Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert; despite the summit meetings at Camp David between Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat with the presence of former President Bill Clinton; and despite the Annapolis Summit between Ehud Olmert and Mahmoud Abbas  we are today still in deadlock.  In fact  contrary to the prevalent view that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the heart of the instability in the Middle East or is the main reason for the region’s numerous conflicts  the reality is entirely different. More than 90 per cent of the wars and war victims of the Middle East since the Second World War did not result from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and are in no way connected to Israel. Rather  they stem from conflicts involving Muslims or conflicts between Arab States. The Iran-Iraq war  the Gulf war  the wars between North and South Yemen  the Hama atrocities in Syria  and the wars in Algeria and Lebanon — these are just a few examples from a list that goes on and on.  The second flawed explanation for the long-standing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians that has gained popularity is that the root of the problem is the so-called occupation  the settlements in Judea and Samaria and the settlers themselves. Only the establishment of an independent Palestinian State in Judea  Samaria and Gaza  so the argument goes  will ensure peace in the region.  It is sufficient to state a number of well-known facts in order to refute that claim. First  all of Judea  Samaria and Gaza were under Arab control for 19 years  between 1948 and 1967. During those 19 years  no one tried to create a Palestinian State. Peace agreements were achieved with Egypt and Jordan  despite the presence of settlements. And the opposite is also true: we evacuated 21 flourishing settlements in Gush Katif and transferred more than 10 000 Jews. And  in return  we have Hamas in power and thousands of missiles landing on Sderot and southern Israel.  Another misguided argument is the claim that the Palestinian issue prevents a determined international front against Iran. This argument is not only flawed  it is completely irresponsible. The same argument could be made that the Palestinian issue prevents action on North Korea  piracy in Somalia  the humanitarian crisis in Sudan or the challenge of Afghanistan.  Just as the Khomeini Revolution had nothing to do with the Palestinian issue  neither is the Iranian decision to develop nuclear weapons related. In truth  the connection between Iran and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is precisely the contrary. Iran can exist without Hamas  Islamic Jihad and Hizbullah  but the terrorist organizations cannot exist without Iran. Relying on those proxies  Iran can  at any given time  foil any agreement between Israel and the Palestinians or with Lebanon.  Thus  in searching for a durable agreement with the Palestinians  one that will deal with the true roots of the conflict and will endure for many years  one must understand that  first  the Iranian issue must be resolved. One must deal first with the root cause of the problem  and not its symptoms. There are  of course  yet other problems that must be solved; solving that one would not be sufficient  but it is nevertheless a necessary condition.   9 10-55264   In trying to resolve the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians  we are dealing with two types of problems: emotional problems and practical problems. That is why the solution must also be a two-stage one.  The emotional problems are  first and foremost  the utter lack of confidence between the sides and issues such as Jerusalem  recognition of Israel as the nation-State of the Jewish people  and refugees. Under those conditions  we should focus on coming up with a long-term intermediate agreement  something that could take a few decades. We need to raise an entire new generation that will have mutual trust and will not be influenced by incitement and extremist messages. To achieve a final status agreement  we must understand that the primary practical obstacle is the friction between the two nations.  As is true everywhere  where there are two nations  two religions or two languages with competing claims to the same land  there is friction and conflict. Countless examples of ethnic conflict around the world confirm this  whether in the Balkans  the Caucasus  Africa  the Far East or the Middle East. Where effective separation has been achieved  conflict has either been avoided or has been dramatically reduced or resolved. Consider the cases of the former Yugoslav republics  the split-up of Czechoslovakia and the independence of East Timor as cases in point. Thus  the guiding principle for a final status agreement must not be land-for-peace but rather  exchange of populated territory. Let me be very clear: I am not speaking about moving populations  but rather about moving borders to better reflect demographic realities.  This is not an extraordinary insight and is far less controversial than some may seek to claim. In fact  precisely this notion — that a mismatch between borders and nationalities is a recipe for conflict — has long been accepted as a virtual truism in the academic community. Leading scholars and highly respected research institutions have even coined the term “right-sizing the State” to capture the idea that States and nations must be in balance in order to ensure peace. This is not a controversial political policy. It is an empirical truth.  But beyond empirical truth there is historical truth  namely  the almost 4 000 years during which the Jewish people were born in the land of Israel and developed the corpus of ethical and intellectual treasures that have been instrumental in the rise of Western civilization. The 2 000 years of forced exile and interim conquest by Byzantines  Arabs  Mamelukes  Ottomans and others cannot and never will impair the unbreakable bonds of the Jewish people to its homeland. Israel is not only where we are  it is who we are.  In closing  let me remind everyone in this Hall of the quote on the plaza across from the United Nations  words spoken in Jerusalem almost 3 000 years ago by the Jewish prophet Isaiah:  “They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation  neither shall they learn war any more.” (Isaiah 2:4)  Inspired by the deep wisdom embodied in these words  let us hope that the path to true peace prophesied by Isaiah will guide our two peoples  in two nation-States  living in peace and security."
"83",3500,"ITA",65,2010,"Italy is about to celebrate the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its unification. We are a young country  but a people with deep roots and ancient traditions. By our history  geographic location and age-old international outlook  we are proud of our illustrious legacy. By necessity and vocation  we are dedicated to dialogue  respect for diversity and mutual understanding.  There is no alternative to this inclusive approach  even when it requires compromises or concessions. I prefer to call it idealistic pragmatism  since our ultimate goal is to spread peace  freedom and prosperity  an ambition that is best achieved through cooperation. This propensity for dialogue is one of Italy’s greatest contributions to the United Nations.  Italy is a strong supporter of the central role of the United Nations in global governance and in the management of international crises. By virtue of its universality and impartiality  the Organization has the legitimacy to intervene in crisis situations. Italy participates in peacekeeping missions not only by contributing large numbers of highly qualified troops     10-55109 18  but also by drafting strategic plans and protocol  and by providing training and logistic support. We are the sixth largest contributor to the United Nations regular and peacekeeping operations budgets and  since 2006  the top troop contributor to the United Nations among the members of the European Union (EU) and Group of Western European and Other States.  Approximately 8 000 Italian troops are assigned to operations under the aegis or the mandate of the United Nations. Our presence is spread across 22 missions throughout the world: from Lebanon to Haiti  the Balkans to Afghanistan. Through its experiences in these difficult areas  Italy has learned important lessons. In particular  our comprehensive approach provides valuable insight into how to integrate the military aspects of a mission with the commitment to economic  institutional and civil reconstruction.  We are convinced that to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century  the United Nations system must be strengthened  starting with its capacity to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. The United Nations must be empowered to fulfil its role as a “producer” of security and stability  a role designed to foster reconciliation  strengthen democracy and  ultimately  help to create a more stable world.  This is why we support the Secretary-General’s New Horizon and Global Field Support Strategy initiatives. We must also continue to foster synergies between the United Nations and regional organizations that play a key role in bringing peace to crisis areas. I refer to the African Union and  above all  to the European Union. The Treaty of Lisbon includes new arrangements for the EU’s international representation. Once the resolution on EU participation in the work of the United Nations has finally been approved  I sincerely hope the European Union will be able to make a greater contribution to General Assembly responsibilities and to enhance the Assembly’s capacity for providing political guidance.  In the field of security  a commitment to disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction has always been a feature of Italian foreign policy. Proliferation is a growing threat that can only be countered through international cooperation and  in this regard  the Italian Government has just put forth some concrete proposals. We need to set the goal of a zero-nuclear option in an appropriate time frame  but without conveying the impression that it is an unrealistic aspiration.  The year 2010 is a key date on the road to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In this endeavour  our collective responsibility and credibility are at stake. Italy is a strong proponent of a holistic approach to development. For the sake of true democratic ownership  the donor community  in collaboration with the private sector and civil society  must work in a partnership that makes the beneficiary countries the protagonists of development.  The time has come for the international community and the United Nations to increase their commitment to two regional crises. Somalia is the most serious and urgent situation on the African continent today. In the past two years  the Italian Government has contributed considerable financing to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and the Somali security forces  but this is not enough. International support for AMISOM must be stepped up.  The second crisis is in Pakistan  where the recent floods have devastated the lives of 20 million people. The Italian Government is disbursing an additional aid package of €80 million to bring relief to the Pakistani population.  But in addition to providing aid  we need to act wisely. This is why Italy has called for new trade measures to increase market access for Pakistani goods and bolster Pakistan’s economic recovery. A natural disaster of this magnitude also demonstrates the urgent need to address the effects of climate change through collective and shared measures.  Globalization has generated a new demand for belonging and identity. But a fruitful dialogue among cultures cannot take place without universal values. It is imperative to defend the universal validity of fundamental rights and avoid the risks of relativism. Given the strength of its humanistic heritage that affirms the human being as the measure of all things  Italy is well-equipped to play an important part in this dialectic.  True to this heritage  the Italian Government has promoted a campaign for a moratorium on the death penalty. We welcome the strengthening international trend towards achieving this objective  and hope it will be confirmed when Italy and a broad alliance of   19 10-55109  countries present a resolution on the moratorium in the upcoming months.  Religious tolerance is a prerequisite for peace and a founding principle of our civilization. The right to search for truth through the word of God is the freedom of freedoms  but in some areas of the world people are afraid to freely and openly profess their faith because they face persecution by extremists. Italy is strongly committed to protecting freedom of religion and will always oppose discrimination against religious minorities. In fact  Italy together with its EU partners is actively involved in the preparation and presentation of the annual resolution on religious intolerance.  Another target of our fight against discrimination is the international initiative to ban female genital mutilation. Since September 2009  Italy  together with a group of African countries  has promoted such an initiative  which  hopefully  will lead to the presentation here in the Assembly of a resolution that fully respects African ownership.  Female genital mutilations  which violate a woman’s physical integrity  affect millions of women and girls throughout the world  including in my country  where 35 000 such cases have been reported. Women’s rights and national progress go hand in hand  but  nevertheless  women are still suffering in many countries throughout the world.  By pooling together our efforts we can ensure the necessary consensus for resolutions that safeguard our own and future generations from prejudice and intolerance. In this spirit  we very warmly welcome the creation of UN Women within the Secretariat and hope that it quickly becomes operative.  Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance requires a constant commitment to the comprehensive reform of the Organization. Such reform should affect the Secretariat  the various funds  agencies and programmes of the United Nations and  obviously  its decision-making bodies.  In regard to reform of the Security Council  we seek realistic compromise solutions that garner the broadest possible consensus and ensure an adequate representation of African  Arab and other underrepresented groups of countries. More than 15 years of negotiations have demonstrated that the membership is profoundly divided. It is now time to search for genuine and far-reaching compromise. Italy and its Uniting for Consensus partners are ready to participate constructively in the reform process and have already demonstrated their flexibility. We look forward to engaging with the rest of the membership during the current session of the General Assembly.  The process of revitalizing the General Assembly should strive to restore its central role. The Assembly’s universal character gives it potential for providing political guidance that should be realized. The Assembly is the place where we could jointly identify the main problems that threaten the security  stability and development of all Member States and draft common strategies to address them effectively.  In conclusion  the vision for the future to which my country  Italy  aspires — a future of peaceful coexistence and mutual enrichment between values and cultures — can only be ensured through the successful completion of the many reform processes under way. We can achieve this future if we build our actions on dialogue and mutual understanding. And when we do achieve peaceful coexistence and mutual enrichment  the United Nations system will be equipped with the tools it needs to fulfil the main principles and values of the Charter. One of these stands above all the others in importance: each and every individual throughout the world is endowed with inalienable and absolute rights concerning which no kind of compromise can ever be tolerated.

"84",3546,"JAM",65,2010,"I would like to congratulate Mr. Deiss again on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at the sixty-fifth session and  on behalf of the Jamaican delegation  to assure him of our full cooperation in the ambitious undertaking on which he has embarked. I extend Jamaica’s appreciation to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Ali Treki  for so ably guiding the proceedings of the sixty-fourth session of the Assembly.  We come to the Hall of this great institution as partners. It is the only organization of its kind  where countries of the world  no matter how rich or poor  big or small  powerful or weak  sit at the same table  joined together by the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members.  As leaders  we are privileged to be the custodians of the world  mandated to secure for its people a just and peaceful existence and to enable them to achieve happiness and prosperity. We come with differing perspectives  shaped by our own experiences and the peculiar challenges we face. But we have long recognized that however unique our individual circumstances may appear  they are all affected by our interdependence.  The impact of climate change shows that we all live under the same canopy. Diseases that can devastate whole populations know no boundaries and require no    10-55122 16  entry permit. Natural disasters are indiscriminate in the selection of their targets. The financial crisis on Wall Street did not disrupt just the American economy; it ricocheted across the world  affecting millions of people who do not even know where Wall Street is. Communications technology has rendered us neighbours in the same village  for no matter how vast the oceans that separate us or the continents over which we are scattered  we are affected or influenced for good or bad by each other.  It is in that in mutuality  that interconnectedness and interdependency  with all our commonality and diversity  that we find both our strengths and our weaknesses. We have seen those strengths at work and what they can accomplish  the positive difference we can make when we surmount our differences and find common purpose in preventing wars and securing peace  in safeguarding human rights and promoting human development. And we recognize our weaknesses  our failure so often to raise our lowest common denominator to a level where consensus can more readily be found and action galvanized.  We cannot afford to ignore the cynics who feel that we should have done more  for there is more that needs to be done. Some age-old problems still remain  and new challenges have emerged that threaten to undermine the achievements we have already made. We refuse to accept that after 65 years of our existence  1.5 billion people — 1.5 billion — should have to live in poverty and more than 1 billion suffer the pangs of hunger.  The playing field of the world is still not level  because the equality of our sovereignty has not been matched by the equality of opportunity. Now global warming  terrorism and transnational organized crime pose new threats to the peace  security and progress of the world.  The heavy agenda set for the sixty-fifth session reflects the scope and complexity of the issues that confront us. Each of us approaches that agenda with a different set of priorities. Yet there are some issues that are so broad in their implications that they demand from us special and urgent attention. They manifest themselves in the stark reality of our existence: 20 per cent of the world’s population enjoys 75 per cent of the world’s income  and 15 per cent of the world’s population lives on less than 1 per cent of the world’s income. We come here as equals  but when we go back home some are vastly more equal than others.  It is easy to blame that on the injustices of the distant past  the neo-colonialism of the more recent past or the Washington consensus of the present. That is only part of the story.  Developing countries struggling with poverty and underdevelopment must accept our share of the blame. We must recognize that there is a lot that we can and must do for ourselves. Each of us must adopt and pursue with fixity of purpose the appropriate economic and social policies and good governance practices. We must be prepared to take the tough decisions that are so often necessary to secure the advancement of our people  and we must never squander the sacrifices we call on them to make. President Obama was right when he declared at the High-level Plenary Meeting last Wednesday (see ) that each of us must assume leadership of our own transformation even while requiring the support of the international community.  The existing international financial system and multilateral trading arrangements will not enable us to redress those imbalances. They have not done so up to now  and they are unlikely to do so in the future. Market forces and competitiveness are indispensable for economic development  but the new millennium cannot be defined by the survival of the fittest. We must make it our business to assist the weak to become fit in order not just to survive but to prosper.  For almost a decade we have been trying to conclude the Doha Round in order to put in place a regime that facilitates the expansion of trade  which is so vital to increasing global prosperity. Redressing the lopsidedness in international trade is necessary if we are to restore and sustain global economic growth. It is just common sense that if one part of the world is not able to export more to the rest of the world  it will not be able to import more from that other part of the world. It may do so for a time by borrowing from that other part of the world in order to pay for its imports  but that is a bubble that will eventually burst. Many countries have seen that bubble burst in the recent global crisis.  We insist that Doha must include a development dimension to build competitiveness and capacity in weak exporting countries  as well as special and differential treatment calibrated to our differing levels   17 10-55122  of development  economic size and vulnerabilities. That offers a win-win situation: more exports from developing countries mean that there will be more jobs for their people and more demand for imports from other countries.  We urge that every effort be made to conclude the Doha Round in that spirit  and we urge  further  that the gains already accrued to developing countries in earlier negotiations not be unravelled. The global financial crisis exposed weaknesses in governance of the international financial system  weaknesses that have become more acute with changes in the global landscape and shifts in the centre of gravity of the world’s economy.  We endorse the need for reform of the international financial institutions  in order to improve standards of efficiency and accountability  and the creation of a more democratic structure  one that will allow developing countries a greater voice.  In the same vein  while we welcome the establishment of the Group of 20 as the locus of global economic policymaking  we urge that it institute a mechanism to engage the views of the wider  developing world. It is also important to establish a close working relationship with the United Nations to ensure complementarity with the role of the United Nations in economic development as mandated under its Charter.  We urge also that the multilateral agencies move beyond what is now the paramount objective: to ensure that the international payments system is secure. The financial assistance provided to many countries during this time of stress  necessary and welcome though it is  is rooted in policies that are contractionary  designed to consolidate and stabilize even at the cost of increasing poverty and social dislocation.  We have hardly learned from the experiences of the past. The gains made towards achievement of the Millennium Development Goals are being eroded and our ability to recover from the global shocks is being stymied. Bold new thinking is required  thinking that places development as the primary focus of multilateral intervention. We know we must make sacrifices  but let those sacrifices be an investment for our future  not just a tourniquet for our immediate dilemma.  We too are disappointed that the climate change summit in Copenhagen failed to reach consensus on mitigation and adaptation strategies. While the Copenhagen Accord did not deliver the comprehensive agreement we had hoped for  it nonetheless provided political impetus for negotiations towards a binding agreement for the second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol. We are hopeful that the Cancún meeting in November and December will further advance the process that will eventually lead to a legally binding and comprehensive agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Bali Road Map.  With member countries that are among the most vulnerable to global warming  the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and its partners in the Alliance of Small Island States will continue to defend the long-term stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations with a cap of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The 2°C threshold being advanced by some would be catastrophic for countries in our region and low-lying small island States in general  and we appeal to all our partners to coalesce around a temperature threshold that would preserve the viability of the most vulnerable countries — as was underscored a few days ago during the high-level five-year review of the Mauritius Strategy. The commitment by developed countries to provide $30 billion in new funding to assist developing countries to improve mitigation and adaptation strategies over the next two years offers an opportunity to prove the cynics wrong  to demonstrate that when we speak  we say what we mean and mean what we say.  The catastrophic earthquake in Haiti in January of this year and the recent disastrous floods in Pakistan are stark reminders of the increasing vulnerability of many countries and regions to natural disasters. We were shocked by the immensity of the impact of those disasters and saddened by the loss of life  the suffering and the destruction of property and infrastructure. We express our solidarity with the Governments and people of both Haiti and Pakistan.  The reconstruction of Haiti is CARICOM’s most urgent priority. We commend the international community for committing almost $10 billion from 57 donor countries and organizations. However  we impress upon them the urgency with which actions must follow those commitments  especially in strengthening the institutional capacity of Haiti to undertake the mammoth task at hand. The Haitian people have suffered too much for too long. We have a    10-55122 18  duty to help them to make a fresh start and to embark on the journey of lasting progress and development. We underscore the important role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti in helping to foster the environment necessary to ensure a sustainable future for the Haitian people.  The danger to international peace and security of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism must remain at the top of the international security agenda. We are encouraged by the 2010 Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in June  which elaborated on measures toward a nuclear-weapon-free world and the strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. We have no doubt that the new START treaty  signed between Russia and the United States of America in April of this year  was a contributing factor. We look forward to the ratification and entry into force of that treaty between those two States  which together possess more than 90 per cent of the world’s nuclear arsenal. Their faithful compliance with the treaty and their commitment to greater transparency in achieving further reductions will secure our hope for eventual nuclear disarmament.  We are also encouraged by the resumption of talks between Israel and Palestine. It offers renewed hope for a just  lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East  one that guarantees the security of Israel and the unquestioned recognition of a Palestinian State. We urge both sides to ensure that this renewed hope does not turn into despair.  Latin America and the Caribbean are faced with the twin menace of the illicit trade in narcotic drugs and small arms. The open borders in the Caribbean make us an easy conduit for trans-shipment between the major sources and destinations of illicit drugs. The attendant crime and violence constitute a major threat to national development because they create instability and compel us to divert scarce resources to tackle this scourge.  Jamaica has adopted a multifaceted approach to tackle crime and violence  relying not only on law enforcement but on strategic social intervention and social transformation initiatives to create new opportunities and inspire hope  especially among our young people  who are vulnerable to being recruited or conscripted into criminal enterprises.  However  we cannot do it alone. The transnational nature of organized crime requires cross-border collaboration at the bilateral  regional and international levels if we are to combat the illegal trade and to tackle with equal vigour the supply  transit and demand sides of the international drug trade. The recent high-level meeting on transnational organized crime and the Fourth Biennial Meeting of States on Small Arms and Light Weapons were instrumental in reinforcing the need for the implementation of measures to curtail the growing threat. Those efforts would be strengthened by the conclusion of a legally binding instrument to curtail the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and ammunition  and we urge the United Nations to approach this troubling issue with the urgency that it deserves.  International institutions cannot retain their legitimacy if they do not adapt to changing times and the new configuration of the international community. The United Nations Security Council cannot be exempt from that process. Fundamental reform is required to address the existing imbalances in the current power structure of the Council and to secure expansion in both categories of membership in order to correctly reflect the contemporary global realities.  In advancing the discussions on system-wide coherence  we support the need to improve the operations of the United Nations at the country level to ensure that the system can appropriately respond to the needs of recipient countries and to prevent the unnecessary imposition of undue conditionalities. In this context  we laud the establishment of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women)  and we congratulate former President of Chile Mrs. Michelle Bachelet on her appointment as head of UN Women. I am confident that under her leadership significant progress will be made to achieve the goals of gender equality and to meet the special needs of women and girls worldwide.  We must not allow ourselves to be imprisoned by our past but even as we look to the future we dare not ignore the experiences that have shaped our present condition. The transatlantic slave trade to which millions of Africans fell victim was one such epoch. CARICOM States are therefore pleased that our initiative to have erected a permanent memorial to honour the victims of slavery has won the support of the United Nations community  in keeping with the mandate of the 2001 World Conference against Racism. We commend UNESCO for its decision to   19 10-55122  launch an international competition for the design of this monument.  Jamaica reaffirms its confidence in the United Nations as the indispensable forum for our collective deliberations aimed at addressing the major challenges confronting our world. We must take pride in our achievements  but we must always be mindful that our mission is not yet accomplished. We must never tire  even when burdened with frustration. Our impatience must be turned into renewed energy. Into our hands has been entrusted the responsibility to make this world a better place for all of mankind to live  prosper and enjoy happiness. That is what they expect of us. That is what they deserve  and that is what we must do everything in our power to deliver. "
"85",3592,"JOR",65,2010,"More than ever before  our world is confronting multiple global crises which cannot be effectively addressed without a coordinated  multilateral action. No country can face these crises and provide for its future in isolation. The threats are global  and so are the solutions. A strong  central role for the United Nations is essential.  It is also essential to resist forces of division that spread misunderstanding and mistrust  especially among peoples of different religions. The fact is that humanity everywhere is bound together  not only by mutual interests  but by shared commandments: to love God and neighbour; to love the good and neighbour.  This week  my delegation  with the support of our friends on every continent  will introduce a draft resolution for an annual World Interfaith Harmony Week. What we propose is a special week during which the world’s people  in their own places of worship  could express the teachings of their own faith about tolerance  respect for the other  and peace. I hope that the draft resolution will have the Assembly’s support.  Another critical area for United Nations leadership is peace — and one peace hangs in the balance today. With direct negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis  a door opens to a final  two-State settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. And the establishment of an independent  viable and sovereign Palestinian State  living side by side with Israel  will pave the way for a comprehensive regional peace. An end to this conflict is long overdue.  No regional crisis has had a longer or broader impact on global security and stability. No such crisis has been longer on the United Nations agenda  or has frustrated peacemakers more. Every resource spent in this conflict is a resource lost for investing in progress and prosperity. Every day spent is a day lost to forces of violence and extremism that threaten all of us in the region and beyond.  People are wary of disappointment  and spoilers are doing everything they can to make us fail. We cannot underestimate the importance of success  or the painful cost of failure. All of us need to support swift action  hard choices and real results. The alternative is more suffering and deeper frustrations  with spreading  more-vicious warfare. Such a catastrophic scenario will continue to drag in the whole world  threatening security and stability far beyond the borders of the Middle East. To prevent that  the talks must be approached with commitment  sincerity and courage.  There should be no provocative or unilateral actions that can derail the negotiations. Instead  the parties must work hard to produce results  and quickly. That means addressing all final-status issues  with a view to ending the occupation and reaching the two-State solution  the only solution that can work  as soon as possible. The status quo is simply unacceptable — enough injustice  enough bloodshed.  Jordan and the rest of the Arab and Muslim world are committed. In the Arab Peace Initiative  we reach out to Israel with an unprecedented opportunity for a comprehensive settlement  a settlement that will enable Israel to have normal relations with 57 Arab and Muslim States  one third of the United Nations. Now we reach out to our fellow members of this United Nations. All stand to lose if the talks fail; all gain when peace is achieved. Our global and collective influence is key. Together we must tip the balance towards peace. "
"86",3639,"JPN",65,2010,"I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Joseph Deiss on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I also express my appreciation    10-54959 32  to His Excellency Ali Abdussalam Treki for his efforts as President at the previous session. I should also like to express my respect to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership.  Sixty-five years ago  in the aftermath of the Second World War  Japan faced the same challenges as those that today confront developing countries. Japan received a great deal of support from the international community in its struggle to overcome those challenges. It is for that reason that Japan feels strongly about attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  which is a main focus of the General Assembly this year.   At this time  the international community faces a series of challenges  including poverty  hunger  infectious diseases  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles  regional conflicts and global environmental issues. It is an honour for me to have this opportunity to share with the General Assembly my thoughts regarding the role Japan should play in the international community  building on our own experiences.   Let me start by sharing a philosophy that I cherish  namely  that the primary role of the leader of a country should be to create a society in which human suffering is reduced to a minimum. I believe that it is the duty of all political leaders to minimize  to the extent possible  sources of human suffering such as poverty  disease and conflict. With that philosophy in mind  I shall now discuss Japan’s concrete contributions in four areas: development  the global environment  nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and peacekeeping and peacebuilding.  The first area of our contribution is assisting the development of the developing countries. After the Second World War  Japan achieved economic reconstruction owing in part to international assistance. Later  through rapid economic growth  Japan became one of the major economic Powers. With such history behind it  Japan cannot overlook the realities of the world today  where a billion people suffer from hunger  where nearly a million die each year of malaria and where poverty keeps some 72 million children out of school.   Japan attaches great importance to achieving the MDGs. I attended the MDG summit the day before yesterday (see )  where I announced our new contributions in the areas of health and education — the Kan commitment — based on our desire to save all fledging lives and to enable all children to go to school. Over the course of five years  we will provide $5 billion in health assistance and $3.5 billion in education assistance. Our commitment in the area of health includes a contribution of up to $800 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria. Our assistance in the area of education will provide a high-quality educational environment for more than 7 million children.  Japan will continue to work comprehensively on development assistance in accordance with the concept of human security  and will lead the efforts of the international community towards meeting the MDGs. As a part of those efforts  my country proposes to convene an international conference in Japan next year in order to strengthen coordination among a broad range of stakeholders  including Governments and international and non-governmental organizations  and to in follow up on the High-level Plenary Meeting on the MDGs.  Reinforcing assistance to Africa  in particular  where progress towards the achievement of the MDGs is slow  is one of the priorities of the international community. Attaining the MDGs in Africa is an important pillar of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) process. Japan is enhancing its efforts in areas such as health  water and sanitation  education and food. Japan will continue and strengthen its assistance in order to honour our commitments made at TICAD IV  including the doubling of our official development assistance and providing support in order to double private investment to Africa by 2012.  The second area of our contribution is the global environment. At last year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference  Japan announced its target of reducing emissions by 25 per cent compared with 1990 levels by 2020. That is premised on the establishment of a fair and effective international framework in which all major economies participate  as well as on their agreement on ambitious targets.   Small island States face the danger of being submerged as a result of climate change. With a view to adopting a new  comprehensive and legally binding document  Japan will continue to coordinate with other States and the United Nations to lead international negotiations to ensure the success of the sixteenth   33 10-54959  session of the sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held at the end of this year. We will also steadily support developing countries that are vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change  including those taking mitigation measures such as reducing emissions through public-private partnerships.  Next month  the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity will be convened in Nagoya  Japan  under the theme “Living in harmony with nature”. At that meeting  we must come to an agreement on beginning new actions in order to halt the rapid progression of biodiversity loss. The greatest challenges in that regard include setting a common global action target and establishing a new international regime in the area of access and benefits-sharing in connection with genetic resources. As Chair of the meeting  Japan is determined to play an important role in these efforts.  The third area of our contribution is nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. I believe that given that the invention of nuclear weapons and the subsequent threat to the survival of the human race was man’s doing  the solution to the problem must be within the reach of man’s efforts. Japan  as the only country that has ever suffered the devastation of atomic bombings  has a moral responsibility to take concrete steps to achieve a world without nuclear weapons. Japan is determined to lead the international community in those endeavours.   Every year for the past 65 years  peace memorial services have been held in Hiroshima and Nagasaki to pray for a world without nuclear weapons. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Japan in August this year and was the first Secretary-General to attend the Hiroshima peace memorial ceremony and visit Nagasaki. I would like to thank him once again for making that visit. A representative of the United States was also in attendance at the Hiroshima ceremony  along with representatives of other countries. I very much welcome their decision to attend  which will contribute to increasing momentum towards a world without nuclear weapons.  Japan bears a responsibility to all humankind to pass on to future generations an awareness of the catastrophic nature of nuclear weapons. With that goal in mind  I decided to appoint atomic bomb survivors — known in Japan as hibakusha — as special communicators for a world without nuclear weapons. I have asked them to send out messages to the world about the horror of the use of nuclear weapons and about the value of peace  which only those with first-hand experience can convey.   Japan will coordinate with other countries and civil society to promote education on disarmament and non-proliferation issues. At the sixty-fourth session  Japan submitted a draft resolution entitled “Renewed determination towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons”  which the General Assembly adopted in December as resolution 64/47  with the United States as a co-sponsor for the first time. Japan is determined to continue its efforts to strengthen the trend of broadening support for that resolution in the international community.   The steady implementation of the agreement achieved at the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  held in May  is essential. On the occasion of the opening of the new session of the General Assembly  Japan and Australia co-hosted a meeting of foreign ministers from like-minded countries on the issue of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. We also launched a new group dedicated to working towards a world without nuclear weapons. We intend to deepen discussions on reducing the role and number of nuclear weapons in the world.  Here  I must make reference to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran. The nuclear and missile-development programmes of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea pose a threat to the entire international community. Japan urges the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to take concrete actions in accordance with the series of relevant Security Council resolutions and the joint statement of the Six-Party Talks. Moreover  the steady implementation of the relevant resolutions by all Member States is essential.   Japan has not altered its intention to comprehensively resolve outstanding issues of concern  settle the unfortunate past and normalize relations in accordance with the Japan-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Pyongyang Declaration. To that end  it is absolutely indispensable to resolve the abduction issue. If the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea takes constructive and sincere steps such as implementing its agreement with Japan  Japan is ready to respond in kind.    10-54959 34   On the Iranian nuclear issue  it is important for the international community to work in unity to implement firmly the relevant Security Council resolutions and to urge Iran to take realistic decisions. Japan will continue to urge Iran to make efforts to dispel the suspicions of the international community. We will also work together with the international community for a peaceful and diplomatic resolution of this issue.  The fourth area of our contribution is peacekeeping and peacebuilding. Japan  which underwent reconstruction from the destruction of war and achieved economic growth  is deeply aware of the importance and value of peace. Our efforts in the area of peacekeeping and peacebuilding are a manifestation of our determination to act proactively towards achieving true peace.  There is a common assumption that peacebuilding activities aimed at promoting health and education  industrial development and employment should begin after peacekeeping is concluded. However  in order to realize true peace  it is imperative to work on peacebuilding efforts in tandem with peacekeeping activities from the earliest stages of the latter. In April this year  as President of the Security Council  Japan hosted an open debate of the Council on post-conflict peacebuilding (see S/PV.6299). Japan will make efforts to advance this seamless approach to peacebuilding in the world  based on the perspective of human security.  In Haiti  which was devastated by unprecedented damage following the tragic earthquake earlier this year  a team of engineers from the Japan Self-Defence Forces is actively contributing to the United Nations peacekeeping operation’s recovery efforts. In flood-hit Pakistan  we currently have helicopters of the Self-Defence Forces providing assistance as an international disaster relief team. With regard to Timor-Leste  we recently took the decision to send military liaison officers to the United Nations peacekeeping operation on the ground. Japan will continue to actively participate in United Nations peacekeeping and disaster relief operations.  Furthermore  we will make concrete efforts in such areas as investing in peace using official development assistance  providing assistance to training centres for peacekeeping operations and developing human resources  such as in the training of civilian peacebuilding experts in Asia.  Of all the places in the world where peacebuilding efforts are under way  Afghanistan in particular is at a crucial stage. At this moment  it is Afghanistan that poses the greatest challenge for the international community in terms of peacebuilding  and it is to Afghanistan that Japan is providing its most intensive assistance. Japan  in cooperation with various partners  has supported the Afghan Government’s efforts in a comprehensive and integrated manner  focusing on three pillars: the improvement of security  including police training; reintegration through vocational training for former Taliban rank-and-file soldiers; and job creation and sustainable and self-reliant development through agricultural assistance and similar strategies.  Japan will cooperate with the Republic of Turkey in assisting in Afghan police training by providing funding as well as police personnel  with a view to improving security in Afghanistan. We also recently disbursed $50 million in assistance for the reintegration of insurgents. Japan will provide its assistance in such a way that the people of Afghanistan will be able to perceive a tangible improvement in their livelihoods. I wish to stress the importance of United Nations reform. The United Nations is the only universal international organization with the goal of promoting world peace and prosperity. Ensuring a functional United Nations that is capable of effectively addressing diverse global issues is of the utmost importance. To that end  all Member States must work proactively to promote structural reform and functional reinforcement of the United Nations. The United Nations  for its part  must continuously maintain the understanding and trust of Member States by ensuring its own transparency and accountability.   The role of the Security Council is particularly important for the United Nations to perform effectively in resolving global challenges. For the Security Council to be effective  it needs to have legitimacy and reflect the current realities of the international community. In that regard  reform of the Security Council is indispensable.    35 10-54959   I believe that Japan  as the only country that has ever suffered the devastation of atomic bombings and as a country that does not possess nuclear weapons  is well suited to play a role in the Security Council in the twenty-first century. I wish to express once again Japan’s determined aspiration to take on further responsibilities for international peace and security as a permanent member of the Security Council.  Japan is confronted today by various social and economic challenges  including an ageing society  a declining birth rate  fiscal problems and energy dependency on other countries. I regard those challenges as global  as many countries are destined to face them sooner or later. It is my belief that Japan will be able to contribute to the world by providing an innovative model  developed through its own national experience  for solving problems facing the world now and in the future. Japan is determined to tackle those challenges aggressively.   Compared with the magnitude of the responsibility we bear to the future of humankind  the differences that divide nations are not great. I am convinced of that. Everything rests on the decisions and actions we take today. Let each one of us take that thought to heart as we begin the new session of the General Assembly and seek to achieve good results in our deliberations."
"87",3664,"KAZ",65,2010,"First of all  I would like to offer congratulations on the upcoming sixty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. For an individual person  65 is an age when life experience turns into wisdom. As the great Goethe once said  it is our experience that teaches us to truly appreciate life. Today  the United Nations  with its 65 years of experience gained in the noble work for peace and progress  is the most reputable and relevant international organization there is. Each State Member of the United Nations  regardless of its size or power  seeks to contribute to building a safer and better world.  On 29 August 1949  the first atomic explosion on the ancient Kazakh land was carried out near the city of Semipalatinsk  unleashing an insane nuclear arms race and inflicting enormous suffering on the people of Kazakhstan. On 29 August 1991  the President of Kazakhstan  Mr. Nursultan Nazarbayev  issued a decree that unilaterally shut down  once and for all  one of the world’s largest nuclear test sites.  It is highly symbolic that 18 years later  the General Assembly at its preceding session acted upon his initiative to adopt a resolution establishing 29 August as the International Day against Nuclear Tests (resolution 64/35). The unanimous adoption of the resolution has effectively reaffirmed the commitment of the international community to the process of reducing the nuclear threat.  The April visit of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Kazakhstan started with a tour of the former Semipalatinsk nuclear test site. Standing right on the former Ground Zero  he urged the international community to redouble its efforts to create a world free of nuclear weapons.  For the people of Kazakhstan  who know only too well all the horrors of nuclear tests  the issue of a total ban on such tests is particularly relevant. Over the course of 40 years  some 490 nuclear explosions were carried out at the Semipalatinsk test site  affecting more than half a million people and damaging territory as large as today’s Germany.  Today we call upon States that have not signed or ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) to do so as soon as possible. The entry into force of the CTBT will become one of the key areas of effective implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  an important instrument forming a foundation for the security of all humanity.  We are satisfied that the States parties to the NPT were able to adopt a final document last May at the conclusion of the latest NPT Review Conference. But new and more decisive steps are needed today for nuclear disarmament. An early drafting of a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty  which along with the CTBT should become an important pillar of the NPT  is one such step.   45 10-55103   We believe that it is extremely important to begin  as soon as possible  to draft an international legally binding instrument providing security assurances by nuclear Powers to non-nuclear-weapon States. Only such assurances can effectively keep in check the aspirations of certain non-nuclear States to acquire nuclear weapons  which they regard as a guarantee of their own security.  The establishment of new zones free from nuclear weapons  including in the Middle East  would represent another step towards achieving the goal of a nuclear-free world. We are convinced that a focused and progressive move in that direction would contribute to the establishment of trust among neighbours in the region and lay the foundations for a radical change in the situation of that long-suffering region.  Addressing the Assembly from this rostrum  I would like to reaffirm the urgency and relevance of the initiative of the President of Kazakhstan  Mr. Nursultan Nazarbayev  to draft a universal declaration on a nuclear-free world  which would reflect the commitment of all States to firmly and consistently move towards a nuclear-weapon-free world.  We support the legitimate and inalienable right of each State party to the NPT to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. However  such activities should be carried out in a transparent manner and on the basis of strict compliance with all requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and under its control. Kazakhstan  the world’s largest uranium producer  intends to contribute to the development of nuclear energy and is ready to host an international nuclear fuel bank  under the auspices of the IAEA  and to commit itself to its safe storage.  As 2010 Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  Kazakhstan  in the interests of all participating States  has emphasized efforts to shape not a security space but a security community  free of dividing lines and zones with different levels of security.  The promotion of an atmosphere of trust in the interests of all and strengthening consensus on key issues in all three dimensions of OSCE activities has made it possible to reach a historic consensus on an OSCE summit  to be held on 1 and 2 December 2010 in the capital of Kazakhstan. It will be the first such event in the past 11 years. I have no doubt that this upcoming Astana summit will become a landmark in the progressive movement of the OSCE participating States towards shaping a truly common and indivisible security community in the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian zones  based on shared values  principles and commitments.  In that regard  we view the discussion at this OSCE summit of the issue of the stabilization and social and economic rehabilitation of Afghanistan as an important contribution to regional and global security. Time has proven that a purely military solution to the Afghan problem does not exist. Accordingly  Kazakhstan favours enhanced efforts by the international community to adapt Afghanistan to post-war development. On the initiative of our head of State  an educational programme has begun this year to train some 1 000 Afghan nationals in the educational institutions of Kazakhstan for careers in medicine  agriculture and construction. We have allocated $50 million to that purpose.  The serious political crisis in Kyrgyzstan  which could have extremely negative consequences not only for Central Asia but also far beyond its borders  has demonstrated the lack of an effective and comprehensive mechanism to prevent such conflicts. That is why the forthcoming OSCE summit provides a unique opportunity to develop an appropriate mechanism  drawing on the great potential and experience of the OSCE  the United Nations and other multilateral institutions.  In the context of countering new challenges and threats  primarily terrorism and drug trafficking  we pay close attention to the implementation of counter-terrorism conventions and Security Council resolutions  and we support early adoption of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. Kazakhstan has actively supported the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. At the initiative of President Nursultan Nazarbayev  Kazakhstan put forward at the global Nuclear Security Summit in Washington  in April 2010  a proposal for a conference on countering the financing of terrorism.  That phenomenon is closely linked to drug trafficking  and thus combating that scourge is one of our top priorities. Accordingly  Kazakhstan attaches great importance to the Central Asian Regional Information and Coordination Center (CARICC) for combating illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs     10-55103 46  psychotropic substances and their precursors  located in Almaty  Kazakhstan. We believe that CARICC can and should become a platform for interaction between regional anti-drug agencies.  We also intend to take those issues forward within the framework of our activities in other international organizations  including the upcoming 2011-2012 Kazakhstan chairmanship of the Ministerial Conference of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). One of the universally accepted themes is the promotion of the ideas of tolerance  non-discrimination  and intercultural and interfaith dialogue. At the initiative of the President of Kazakhstan  Astana has become the venue for a unique forum  the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions  recognized today as an effective platform for dialogue to promote ideas of interfaith peace and harmony.  As a sponsor of resolution 62/90  we welcome the efforts of Member States  UNESCO and other international organizations to conduct activities in observance of the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures.  We commend the work of the Alliance of Civilizations and stand ready to continue to actively cooperate with it to promote the goals and objectives of the Alliance at the international level.  Based on its experience  Kazakhstan supports the active use of the capacity of authoritative regional arrangements  such as the OSCE and the OIC  in efforts to overcome nationalism  religious intolerance  racism  xenophobia and anti-Semitism  and we intend to work for the adoption of concrete decisions within those organizations. We are deeply convinced that today security cannot be for a single country  region or continent alone. Therefore Kazakhstan believes that all existing structures of regional and international security must coordinate their efforts and cooperate actively together.  In this context  I would like to note with great satisfaction that the first meeting of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia and the OSCE  which was held in June 2010 in Istanbul  has laid the foundation for a future transcontinental security belt. It appears that the level of institutional development of the Conference and the growing interest in its activities on the part of Asian countries will allow us to consider that forum as a prototype of a collective security system in Asia.  Today  the world is slowly but surely emerging from a severe financial and economic crisis. At this juncture  it is critically important to ensure that the development of a post-crisis model of development is not limited to cosmetic measures. Instead  it should produce a qualitative restructuring of the entire system of international economic relations. We believe that all the world’s economic problems are rooted in the inefficiency of the existing world monetary system  which no one controls and which is not democratic.  Kazakhstan’s leader has proposed that a new financial architecture be developed  with a global regulatory system to oversee financial markets at its core. Such a mechanism would allow us to avoid speculative interflows of resources that exist only on paper and a situation in which developing countries are actually financing consumption in the developed countries. The establishment of a more stable macroeconomic model  in our view  calls for the introduction of a single supranational currency  under the auspices of the United Nations.  Finding an urgent solution to environmental problems is one of our main responsibilities to future generations. It is also a prerequisite of preserving life on Earth. In this context  we have initiated plans for holding ministerial conferences for the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the Economic Commission for Europe in 2010 or 2011 in Astana. The goal of these events is to build a “green bridge” between Europe and Asia and to harmonize programmes for sustainable development and environmental protection.  We appreciate the assistance provided by the international community  including the United Nations and its specialized agencies and programmes  to our country’s efforts to overcome the effects of environmental disasters in the Aral Sea and Semipalatinsk regions. Given their global nature  they call for an effective new approach on the part of the donor community to solve these problems.  Kazakhstan is firmly committed to the democratization of its society and building a State based on the rule of law. In February this year  our country successfully passed its first universal periodic review of the Human Rights Council and intends to fully implement its recommendations. Reaffirming its   47 10-55103  commitment to open and constructive cooperation in the area of human rights  Kazakhstan has sent a standing invitation to all mandate holders of the Council’s special procedures.  Our country has always been and still remains open to cooperation with the international community in the protection and realization of individual rights and freedoms. With those values and ideals in mind  Kazakhstan has put forward its candidature to the Human Rights Council for the 2012-2015 term  which we hope will be supported.  Over the past 65 years the United Nations has made an enormous contribution to international peace and security on the Earth and to the solution of many social  economic  humanitarian and other problems. It is in our common interests that the United Nations continue to demonstrate leadership in promoting peace and cooperation and sustainable progress on Earth. Kazakhstan not only has consistently supported and supports the activities of the United Nations  but always seeks to contribute to the attainment of the lofty goals set by our respected Organization. "
"88",3711,"KEN",65,2010,"The theme of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly  “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance”  is appropriate and timely. Today’s transnational challenges  including issues of peace and security  development  human rights  the environment and health require genuine global governance that encompasses all United Nations Member States.  In this regard  Kenya fully reaffirms the central role of the United Nations in global governance  consistent with its Charter and international law. It is  therefore  imperative that the ongoing United Nations reforms be accelerated in order to ensure that this institution of multilateral engagement is representative and transparent  is accountable to its 192 members and optimally achieves the aspirations of today’s world.  When I last addressed the General Assembly two years ago  I briefed this august body on the major steps taken by my country to resolve the political difficulties following our general elections in December 2007. Since then  we have made tremendous progress in implementing far-reaching reforms that will entrench democracy and secure our peace and stability. Top on the reform agenda has been the enactment of a new constitution  which was promulgated on 27 August 2010 following a successful national referendum.  The new Constitution greatly improves the structures of governance and lays a firm foundation for political stability and economic prosperity. It has created new vitality and a sense of renewal. We believe that this step will go a long way in contributing towards the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals. It is also our hope that this historic development    10-54827 30  will contribute to the continued consolidation of democratic governance in our region.  Ten years ago  world leaders meeting here in New York committed themselves to pursue the Millennium Development Goals in response to the world’s main development challenges of poverty  ignorance and ill-health. Two thirds of the time allotted for the attainment of these Goals has lapsed. With only five years left to the targeted year 2015  the urgency of bridging the remaining gap is a reality we must now confront.  As I indicated in my statement to this Assembly three years ago  Kenya has invested significant resources in the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals. We have recorded substantial progress in poverty reduction and education  in reducing maternal and child mortality  in the fight against HIV/AIDS and malaria  and in promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women.  Climate change continues to hamper our development aspirations. In recognition of this challenge  my country has taken major steps to enhance environmental sustainability  such as reclaiming and protecting our five major water towers; undertaking investments in wind  solar and geothermal energy; and making comprehensive commitments to green our economy.  Despite these efforts  Kenya is facing many negative consequences of climate change. Our crop- and livestock-based agriculture  on which the vast majority of Kenyans depend  is now at the mercy of unpredictable weather patterns. It is with a deep concern  therefore  that we note the international community’s inability to make headway in the critical negotiations on climate change. It is Kenya’s hope that the world will recognize the urgency of concluding these negotiations in the interest of the survival of humanity. I look forward to positive outcomes from the upcoming meetings on climate change in Mexico and South Africa.  I now wish to turn to one of the major obstacles to the pursuit of peace and development  including the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals  in our subregion  namely  the continuing political instability in Somalia that is festering beyond that country.   Since the early 1990s  Kenya has borne the full weight of insecurity in Somalia. Today  as this Assembly meets  the security situation in Somalia continues to deteriorate and threaten peace and stability across the entire region and beyond. Needless to say  the threat posed by today’s Somalia to international peace and security is greater than that of any other conflict in the region. Yet Somalia continues to suffer benign neglect from the international community  leading to many lost opportunities to resolve the crisis. The perceived reluctance of the Security Council to engage with Somalia has been a matter of great concern for those of us who suffer the worst consequences of the conflict. Today  I wish to draw the attention of this Assembly to yet another opportunity that should not be lost.  In July of this year  the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) Summit identified critical elements of engagement and took a number of decisions on the way forward. These decisions were endorsed by the African Union summit in Kampala in July 2010. Unfortunately  the support needed to implement these decisions by the international community has not been forthcoming.  It is against this background that Kenya urges the United Nations and the entire international community to seize the opportunity created by the African regional initiative and lend support to the proposed measures  which include the appointment of an eminent high-level personality for Somalia  the effective deployment of the proposed 2 000 troops  a review of the current mandate of the African Union Mission in Somalia to enhance its peace enforcement capacity  and the extension of support to the Transitional Federal Government to bolster its effectiveness countrywide.  As the Chair of the IGAD Committee on the Sudan  I have remained actively engaged with the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). I have done so because we in the IGAD region believe that the CPA holds the key to peace and stability in the Sudan and the region.   I wish to inform this Assembly that I have received assurances from both President Omer Al-Bashir and First Vice-President Salva Kiir to remain on course with respect to the preparations for the referendum. I am pleased to further inform the Assembly that both reaffirmed their commitment to resolve all the outstanding issues  to hold the   31 10-54827  referendum on 9 January 2011  and to accept the outcome of the vote. We in the region are looking forward to the holding of a successful and peaceful referendum that promotes regional peace and stability.  These efforts by the neighbours of the Sudan and the African Union have created a momentum that is critical to the full implementation of the CPA. It is crucial that the world stand in support of these initiatives as Sudan takes vital steps in relation to its future governance. I believe that continued engagement with the leadership of both the National Congress Party and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement is the only way towards the peaceful resolution of the challenges facing the Sudan.   In view of this perspective  I wish to inform this Assembly that I will convene the second IGAD Special Summit on the Sudan in November 2010  in order to take stock of progress  ensure the process remains on course and support efforts relating to the post-referendum arrangements.  In conclusion  I wish to express my hope that through our unity  solidarity  cooperation and commitment  the challenges facing the international community will be overcome. Let us rise to the occasion and demonstrate our political will and ability to work together for the good of all humankind."
"89",3735,"KGZ",65,2010,"I would first like to congratulate you  President Deiss  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at it sixty-fifth session. I wish you every success.  For Kyrgyzstan  2010 has been a year of profound changes and serious challenges to our continued existence  unity and statehood. In April  having overthrown the authoritarian system of State governance  with its flagrant corruption and illegality  the Kyrgyz people resolutely chose a path to renewal and genuine democratic development.  Nevertheless  in May and June  the world witnessed acutely destabilizing situations in the south of Kyrgyzstan  where radical forces of the former Government and criminal and extremist groups sought revenge. Accordingly  they provoked bloody clashes   41 10-55122  between Kyrgyz and Uzbek communities  who have lived and worked in peace side by side for centuries.  Those extremist forces insidiously played the ethnic card by knowingly exploiting the precariousness of such socio-economic problems as poverty  high unemployment — especially among youth — corruption and unequal access to economic and financial resources  which were ignored by the former Government. In that difficult period  the interim Government succeeded in consolidating all positive and patriotic forces among the people. With the assistance of the international community  the interim Government was able to stabilize the situation and thereby prevent a return to the past.  On 27 June  a new Constitution was adopted by national referendum that provided the basis for parliamentary Government in the country. Today  we can in good conscience declare that all the necessary political  economic and organizational conditions have been established for the holding of transparent parliamentary elections in Kyrgyzstan on 10 October 2010. Kyrgyzstan has a unique opportunity to build a truly democratic parliamentary State based on the rule of law and human rights. I am confident that the people of Kyrgyzstan will show wisdom and a high level of political involvement and not miss this chance.  In order to move successfully along the path of democratic development and prevent future political and socio-economic disturbances  we intend to thoroughly analyse the origins and reasons behind the apparent conflicts that took place in our country in the past year  and more specifically over the past six months.  At present a State commission to investigate the reasons for the conflict is at work. The commission consists of prominent political activists  scientists and experts  of Kyrgyz  Uzbek and other nationalities that make up multinational Kyrgyzstan. An international independent commission has also begun its work  supported by the United Nations  the European Union  the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Nordic countries. We should identify the organizers of the bloody clashes  seek what lessons can be learned  try to comprehend and eradicate the causes of friction and seek ways to reach inter-ethnic accord in the society.  But most important  the realization of the tragic and futile nature of the results of extremist actions must become established in the minds of the peoples of the various ethnic communities living in Kyrgyzstan. An unshakable commitment to national unity and nationhood must become the cohesive element and uniting force in the country.  We are expanding the various forms of cooperation with regional international organizations in order to further stabilize the situation in Kyrgyzstan. Thus  with a view to rendering assistance to law enforcement staff and restoring confidence between people and local administrations  the negotiations on engaging the OSCE police advisory group are concluding. In line with agreements reached  the partner countries of the Collective Security Treaty Organization render procurement and advisory assistance.  The Kyrgyz Republic highly appreciates the position and actions of the leadership of the Republic of Uzbekistan  and of President Islam Karimov personally  in stabilizing the situation in the south of our country  especially in the first days of the unrest. We are also grateful for the support and invaluable assistance rendered by the Government of that brotherly country to citizens of Kyrgyzstan displaced into Uzbekistan  and for facilitating their return.  We are sincerely grateful to all those who responded to the call for help and assistance in the framework of the flash appeal for Kyrgyzstan launched by the United Nations  and also for comprehensive support provided on a bilateral basis.  The immediate humanitarian assistance from friendly countries  international organizations and agencies and United Nations institutions has been vital in stabilizing the crisis situation and overcoming the destructive consequences of a humanitarian catastrophe. As of today we have received 40 per cent of the required help within the framework of the appeal. It is obviously not sufficient  given the urgent need of the population on the streets of the affected cities and settlements. People still need housing  the wounded need medical care  and schools and social service buildings need to be rebuilt.    10-55122 42   At present our Government is focusing its basic efforts on post-conflict reconstruction of the country’s social and economic infrastructure  especially in the southern regions. Therefore  timely and practical implementation of commitments made at the donor conference on Kyrgyzstan held in Bishkek this July is extremely important.  Kyrgyzstan supports the position of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  stated on 23 September at the Security Council Summit (see S/PV.6389)  on strengthening the role of the United Nations in responding to humanitarian catastrophes and resolving crisis situations.  The establishment of the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia was an important and necessary step on the part of the United Nations. We consider it essential to expand and strengthen its operations  which will allow it to implement a package of preventive measures and to activate mediation services. We also welcome the launch of a counter-terrorism strategy for the Central Asian region and are ready to strengthen cooperation aimed at adoption of a joint action plan by 2011.  The Security Council summit prompts us to consider more seriously the problem of terrorism. The events of June of this year in the Kyrgyz Republic — when various terrorists groups attempted to enter the territory of Kyrgyzstan by mountain paths from neighbouring countries — testify to the presence of real threats of terrorism to the peace and security of the States bordering Afghanistan.  Terrorist groups joining forces with drug barons and other criminal elements is a great concern. Such combustible hybrids should be eliminated by the most drastic measures. Therefore  the Kyrgyz State drug control agency  which was liquidated a year ago  has recently been restored. As we intensify our efforts in the fight against illegal drug trafficking  we are extremely interested in furthering a strategic programme for the countries of Central Asia to oppose illegal drug trafficking and fighting international crime. We must further strengthen the activity of the Central Asian Regional Information and Coordination Centre in fighting illegal trafficking of psychotropic substances and their precursors under the aegis of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.  The action plan of the European Union and the Central Asian countries for 2009-2013 should become an important part of international efforts to fight illegal drug trafficking  along with coordinated actions within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. We continually call upon the United Nations to improve coordination of the fights against drug trafficking and transnational organized crime.  In Afghanistan  the fragile process of peacekeeping and reconciliation and the development of the institutional structures are points of special concern. The recent parliamentary elections in that country inspire some optimism about strengthening civil society and creating a parliament of national unity. The construction of a stable economy and effective support of Afghanistan’s State institutions will serve as the basis for a durable peace in that country and will reduce the threat to security in the Central Asian region. Kyrgyzstan supports international programmes for Afghanistan’s economic reconstruction and is ready to contribute material and personnel and to work closely with the anti-terrorist coalition.  The Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference last May demonstrated the possibility of achieving an understanding in the critical sphere of nuclear disarmament. My country is also contributing to that effort. Kyrgyzstan has been designated as the depositary of the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia. Thus it promotes regional security while broadening collaboration with other nuclear-weapon-free zones.  The ecological dimension is a special feature of the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia. That is because there remains a large quantity of uranium tailings in Kyrgyzstan  which poses a serious risk to human life and to the environment in general. On this matter  we are grateful to the United Nations Development Programme for its increased attention to those zones of high ecological risk and for conducting an international meeting in 2009.  We would like to call delegates’ attention to item 97 (i) on the Assembly’s agenda for this session  entitled “Establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia”  and we ask them to support it.  United Nations peacekeeping operations are a key tool in preserving and maintaining peace on our planet. Kyrgyzstan is the only country in the region that is contributing more than 30 peacekeepers to United   43 10-55122  Nations missions in Africa  Asia and the Caribbean  and it is ready to increase its participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations.  The delegation of Kyrgyzstan has repeatedly come out in favour of fully optimizing the management of peacekeeping operations. It supports the comprehensive strategy for field support and its reform  as documented in “A New Partnership Agenda: Charting a New Horizon for UN Peacekeeping”. We are convinced of the vital importance of involving such authoritative regional organizations as the European Union  the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Collective Security Treaty Organization in peacekeeping activities and post-conflict reconstruction.  Kyrgyzstan is devoted to the purposes and tasks of strengthening international peace and security  and  as a candidate for non-permanent membership on the Security Council  is ready to contribute to the cause of peace  especially by participating in the work of the Council and its committees.  We wish to focus the Assembly’s attention on the issues of environmental safety and hydropower. Recent studies have confirmed the loss of more than 20 per cent of Kyrgyzstan’s glaciers and snowfields  which requires urgent efforts to preserve our river headwaters and restore our forests. Kyrgyzstan is interested in the rational exploitation of its resources  an attractive investment climate  preserving ecological security and developing alternative energy sources. We need to launch regional projects within the framework of the Central Asia/South Asia Regional Electricity Market  starting with the construction of a Kyrgyzstan-Tajikistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan electric power line.  We pledge our full support to developing concrete measures at the forthcoming sixteenth Climate Change Conference in Cancún in November. Among the practical steps to be taken in this area  I will mention that the forthcoming International Conference of Mountain Countries  on climate change  to be held in Kathmandu  will be making broad proposals for the Cancún meeting.  Kyrgyzstan is studying significant projects on sustainable development and supports Mr. László Borbély in his work for the nineteenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development. Our imperative is achieving the agenda of the twenty-first century and making the Johannesburg Plan of Action a reality.  In conclusion  I would like to emphasize that the activity of the United Nations must respond fully to the expectations of people throughout the planet and that we  countries both small and large  must not forget the responsibility we bear for our actions. I also wish for all the wisdom and courage that will help us in achieving the enduring purposes and values of our Organization in building a better peace."
"90",3778,"KHM",65,2010,"At the outset  allow me to join the previous speakers in expressing my sincere congratulations to His Excellency Joseph Deiss of Switzerland on his election as President of the sixty-fifth session of our General Assembly. I am confident that under his able leadership our Assembly will be crowned with significant progress on many global issues of international concern. Likewise  I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for the professionalism and dedication with which he conducted the previous session of our General Assembly.  This sixty-fifth session is particularly significant  combining in a timely manner two important high-level meetings  namely  the high-level meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the High-level Review of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. Those important meetings remind us that there is no better entity than the United Nations to address global challenges and that multilateralism is relevant in addressing the world’s interconnected and proliferating    10-55264 10  challenges  including the global economic and financial crisis  climate change  food security  international peace and security  regional conflicts and others.  The global economic and financial storm seems to be over  but the task of restoring confidence and promoting economic recovery is far from complete and remains a daunting task  especially for the developing countries. However  achievement of the MDGs is uncertain owing to the fragile economic recovery of those countries. Failure to meet the MDGs by 2015 will leave millions of people locked in the cycle of poverty. Therefore  as the economic recovery continues  a joint effort towards concrete action is needed to further boost confidence and maintain the momentum of global economic growth.  In Cambodia we adopted our own MDGs in 2003  known as Cambodian MDGs and have thus achieved the MDG targets on reducing child mortality and HIV/AIDS  malaria and other diseases. According to a recent study issued by the Overseas Development Institute and the United Nations Millennium Campaign  Cambodia ranks among 20 countries that have made the most absolute progress on the MDGs.  Our world today is facing most serious global challenges. Climate change presents a major threat for every country  although it is more severe for poor countries. Daily  we see an increase in headline news and reports on chaotic weather occurring worldwide  with record heat and cold waves  unusual torrential rains leading to apocalyptic floods and landslides and mudslides that kill hundreds and displace millions of people. Intense forest fires resulting from to extreme heat indicate that Mother Nature is raging.  The confluence of those natural calamities also means that the agricultural sector  which depends largely on weather  has been hit most often  resulting in adverse impacts on food security. All those events have aggravated poverty and led to increased illegal immigration  which has already become a serious human security problem.  Although the much awaited summit of the fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties in Copenhagen last year failed to achieve a binding agreement  it established a good foundation at the least to enhance international cooperation on a number of key issues  such as deforestation  renewable energy and financial support for the world’s poorest countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change. We regret  however  that the pledges have not been actualized.  It is still uncertain whether a binding agreement will be secured in Cancún this year. In particular  the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities for developed and developing nations should serve as the foundation for negotiations. Such a principle is key to rebuilding mutual trust among nations  which is the most urgent task needed to achieve a meaningful result at the Cancún Conference. The spirit of compromise is absolutely necessary for the sake of humanity. Climate change has already reached a point of no return.  Cambodia urges developed countries to honour their commitments to provide financial and technological aid to developing nations for the fight against climate change and to take the lead and cut their respective carbon dioxide emissions  so that the Conference in Cancún can produce tangible results. Fruitful outcomes in Cancún will depend on efforts by all to save humankind from much more serious catastrophes. Climate change is not a vital problem of only one country or one region  but of the world as a whole.  Cambodia is pleased to join the group of countries for implementation of the Copenhagen Accord. We have launched our own initiative called the Cambodian Climate Change Alliance  which focuses on capacity-building and strengthening national institutions. Cambodia has also steadily implemented projects aimed at reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and will continue to assume its share of responsibility in curbing carbon dioxide emissions and bringing about adaptation and mitigation measures.  Cambodia believes that the problem of food security also deserves great attention. At the World Summit on Food Security in November 2009 it was disclosed that the number of hungry people had already reached 1 billion. That number will certainly increase day by day with the augmentation of the world population  thus further aggravating food security in the world  particularly in the poorest countries.  The lack of financial resources devoted to agriculture  the lack of access to agrotechnologies and the irrational use of water resources are among the catalysts of the food crisis. At the same time  as a result of recent high fuel oil prices  agricultural land has been diverted to grow bioenergy crops to meet increasing   11 10-55264  demand for fuel  while the world population needs more and more food. Furthermore  official development assistance (ODA) has not been sufficiently focused on agricultural production. Therefore  Cambodia hopes that the international community will turn its attention to redirecting and increasing ODA to emphasize food security. At the same time  adequate and timely measures must be taken to address the various obstacles to food security  in order to avoid recurrence of food crises in the future.  In this context  the pledge of $20 billion over three years made at the 2009 Group of Eight Summit in L’Aquila to support agricultural production in poor countries was extremely opportune and offered much hope  not only with regard to narrowing the food shortage but also for progress towards the MDGs and poverty reduction in general. Still  respecting that commitment through timely disbursement and efficient utilization of that funding are absolutely essential. Within Cambodia  food production is the top priority of our Government policy  and agriculture and irrigation are being aggressively promoted as a springboard for broader economic development  with the ambition of turning Cambodia into a more important rice-exporting country.  Peace and security remain issues of grave concern in many parts of the world. Terrorism remains a very serious threat to the world  killing innocent people every day in many parts of the world. The regional security landscape in Asia and the Middle East constitutes a concern for the international community  compelling us to be ever vigilant.  The situation in the Korean peninsula still presents a threat to peace and security in that region. Cambodia earnestly calls on the parties to refrain from any act that could escalate tensions  with a view to promoting conditions that could enable the Six-Party Talks to resume as soon as possible. Peace will prevail only as a result of negotiations aimed at re-establishing the confidence necessary to a peaceful Korean peninsula.  The Israeli-Palestinian issue remains one of the longest and most explosive running conflicts in the Middle East. Year after year the Palestinian people are denied their right to establish a Palestine State living side by side in peace with the people of Israel. Year after year this Assembly urges the parties concerned to comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions  while the whole world waits impatiently for a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. Cambodia urges both parties to act with utmost restraint and to avoid any act of provocation  in order to pave the way for a peaceful solution.  Cambodia warmly welcomes the recent direct peace talks between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Palestinian President in Washington and in Egypt  as a step in the right direction for bolstering an atmosphere of trust between the two sides. Cambodia shares the view of the international community that new settlements in the West Bank present the main obstacle to efforts towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict. Cambodia hopes that both sides can finally look for a compromise on this crucial issue in order to achieve a breakthrough for the sake of a lasting peace in the Middle East.  With regard to the embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba  Cambodia firmly supports the resolutions of our Assembly on the necessity of ending that embargo and calls upon all Members of the United Nations to implement those resolutions in order to end the prolonged suffering of the innocent people of Cuba. Given the very serious emerging global challenges  the United Nations must be ready to fulfil its growing responsibilities to tackle those complex worldwide issues. The functioning of every organ of the United Nations should be readjusted and reinvigorated so as to effectively manage the complexity of the world today to overcome all the challenges in order to build a suitable world for all. Regarding the reform of the United Nations Security Council  Cambodia is of the view that priority should be given to increasing the representation of developing countries  which comprise a vast majority of the United Nations membership. For many years  many have raised the matter of reform  but unfortunately particular interests have prevailed over the world’s concerns and prevented the reform from taking place."
"91",3792,"KIR",65,2010,"Every year  we gather in this General Assembly Hall to take stock of our achievements in the pursuit of a more peaceful  more secure and a better world for all citizens of the global community.  As it emerged from the ashes of devastating world wars  the United Nations heralded a new era and a new world order of international cooperation in the pursuit of international peace and security. It is premised on the principles of sovereign equality and peaceful coexistence.  Taking stock of what we have achieved since then  we can say today that we have been successful in preventing many of the scourges that have challenged humanity  including world wars and widespread disease. But as we rid our global society of those injustices  new and emerging forms of injustices now threaten our global security.  I believe that climate change remains the greatest moral challenge of our time. While it affects all nations of this planet  the irony is that it is the poorest and smallest countries  which have made the least contribution to greenhouse gas emissions  that are paying the ultimate price in order that the lifestyles and development agenda of some countries may be maintained. Where is the justice in that?  The Copenhagen Conference failed to meet the expectations of many  but especially of those countries on the front line for which the threat of climate change is no longer a matter of speculation but one of survival  and therefore of great urgency. There is a tendency in much of the world to view climate change as a distant and gradual process whose harmful effects are remote possible and not worthy of much attention. I have said in various forums that  for low-lying island countries like Kiribati  Tuvalu  the Maldives and the Marshall Islands  among other similarly vulnerable countries  climate change is a matter of survival and of increasing urgency.  Already we are witnessing major damage to infrastructure and property as a consequence of higher-than-normal tides and storm surges. Coastal erosion in heavily populated areas is occurring at a rate that exceeds the Governments’ capacity to respond. Lack of resources is exacerbating the situation. Coastlines continue to be eroded and homes and properties continue to be damaged.  Long before our islands are inundated by the rising seas  they will become uninhabitable as freshwater aquifers are contaminated by saltwater intrusion from rising tides. Increasing demand for resources to undertake effective responses to climate change impacts will become a dominant feature of our development agenda. I truly hope  therefore  that I can during this session communicate the deep sense of urgency and growing sense of despair besetting our people in the face of this oncoming catastrophe.  On the basis of current scientific projections  the Copenhagen Accord does not provide the means to guarantee our future survival  and therefore we did not sign it in Copenhagen. We have subsequently associated ourselves with the Accord  essentially for the following reasons. First  we are of the belief that the Accord at least represents a positive step towards   7 10-55109  an international governance system on climate change. Secondly  we have the expectation that further  forthcoming scientific evidence will unequivocally determine the targets to be agreed upon. Finally and most importantly  we believe that our support for the Accord will ensure the flow of urgently needed adaptation funds. I regret to say that  to date  we have not been able to access any of the fast-start funds pledged.  I acknowledge that many elements of any international regime on climate change will take several years to conclude  but I also believe that there is common ground on which there is no real debate. The urgent need for the flow of adaptation funds to address the more urgent adaptation needs of the most vulnerable countries is a matter over which there is general consensus. It is not a matter to negotiate or procrastinate over; if we do  it will be too late for some countries and any subsequent agreement will be meaningless. It is also important that adaptation funds not be regarded as additional development funds by either development partners or recipient countries  but be provided and applied for the sole purpose of adaptation to climate change.  I believe that we need to modify our approach to Mexico if we are to succeed. I believe that we have a moral obligation to reach agreement on a legally binding framework that regulates our ability to pursue policies that harm others. For very obvious reasons  I do not believe that any country should have the right to exercise sovereignty over its greenhouse gas emissions. In my view  any alternative to a legally binding framework is simply unacceptable and would have potentially destabilizing consequences.  The experience at Copenhagen taught us that if we are to make any progress  we must acknowledge our differences and discuss ways around them rather than allow them to dominate the international agenda behind the process. In this regard  we believe that trust and mutual respect are indispensable to the process.  Climate change offers the international community an opportunity to reflect upon the future direction of our relations as sovereign nations. I believe that the climate change challenge provides us with the opportunity to be more innovative in our concept of international governance. Our current arrangement is similar to that of State Governments not accepting federal authority within a federal system. One can imagine the chaos.  While other countries are focusing their efforts and resources on their sustainable development  we  the most vulnerable countries  continue to spend the limited resources we have on fighting the continuous onslaught of the rising seas and storm surges on our homes and livelihoods. It is no surprise therefore that we are off-track to achieve most of the Millennium Development Goals and the implementation of our sustainable development agenda under our national development plan  the Pacific Plan and the Mauritius Strategy. For every step we take forward  we are knocked back two or three due to the challenges we face  which are exacerbated by climate change.  In this regard  it is imperative that the pledges made at Copenhagen for fast-start funds to assist vulnerable countries like Kiribati to adapt to the impact of climate change and sea-level rise be mobilized at the earliest possible opportunity. This is a matter of great and increasing urgency.  We acknowledge the critical role of our environment as the pillar of sustainable development. Maintaining the health of our biodiversity within our oceans and ecosystems faces the very same challenges that we have so far failed to address in respect of our atmosphere. It is imperative  therefore  that we undertake the commitment to put in place now the measures needed in order to avoid the mistakes we have made with climate change. In pursuit of this  we in Kiribati have designated the largest marine protected area and marine World Heritage Site  the Phoenix Islands Protected Area. It covers an area of more than 400 000 square kilometres  representing some 11 per cent of our exclusive economic zone. The Protected Area is the result of a collaborative partnership with Conservation International and the New England Aquarium. It provides a natural breeding ground for tropical fisheries and ocean ecosystems. It is a natural laboratory for the study of such ecosystems and the impact of climate change in a pristine area virtually untouched by human activity.  The preservation of that Area is our gift to humanity and our contribution to international biodiversity conservation efforts to significantly reduce biodiversity loss in this International Year of Biodiversity. Even now  as we confront the possibility that our islands will become uninhabitable within the    10-55109 8  century due to the rising sea level  we recognize the value of protecting something that is the common heritage of humanity.  Kiribati and the Pacific are committed to the sustainable conservation and management of their ocean ecosystem through the Micronesia Challenge  the Coral Triangle Initiative  the Nauru Agreement and the many other national efforts throughout the region to conserve biodiversity and ecosystems. At its meeting last month in Vanuatu  the Pacific Islands Forum endorsed the Pacific Oceanscape Framework  which promotes collaboration and cooperation among marine protected areas in the Pacific region. Initiatives such as the Pacific 2020 Challenge and a novel Pangaea World concept of green development through knowledge economies link those initiatives to the countries of the Pacific Rim and beyond.  Our message to the international community is that the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems in the Pacific is not important only to the sustainable development of Pacific peoples. It is also of vital significance to the rest of the world. Support from the international community in protecting ecosystems in the Pacific  and indeed elsewhere  should not be viewed as a handout  but as an investment for future generations of this planet.  Last year  we all called for a new world order. We all acknowledged that our great Organization must evolve to reflect the realities of our time — a time in which new and emerging security threats and injustices such as climate change are challenging the credibility of our international system of governance; a time in which the future survival of some nations is seriously in question; a time when all those countries with the ability to do so must contribute to the prevention of that calamity or be forever judged in history.  We note that tensions remain high in certain regions  notably in the Middle East and the Korean peninsula. For the sake of those of us on the front line of the major global challenges  let us pray that great understanding and stability will prevail. For while we  as small nations  may seem not to be affected by such events  they serve to distract the focus of attention away from the real challenges facing the international community and our planet today.  It is gratifying to note the easing of tensions and improvement of relations across the Taiwan Straits — no doubt  a most welcome development for all in that region. We also welcome the inclusion of Taiwan in the World Health Assembly  and we hope that similar understanding will prevail in respect of other international institutions in which Taiwan can participate and contribute meaningfully for the good of humanity.  As we chart the path towards a new world order  we must address the fundamental threats to the very existence of the units that make up our Organization. As the so called community of nations  we must be able to guarantee the survival of members of our community by addressing this defining challenge of our era. Climate change must be addressed before it is too late for those nations on the front line and for the whole of humanity.  At this time  we need compassionate  visionary and responsible leadership to direct our path towards a more secure and more just world. We need to share the solution  and we need to act as one in Mexico. We owe it to our future generations to act  and to act now. Maintaining the status quo is simply not an option. "
"92",3823,"KNA",65,2010,"The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis has looked forward to this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly with much anticipation. We welcome the opportunity to share in the usual rich general debate  to strengthen existing relationships and to build new ones.  This environment  we believe  facilitates the exchange of views on issues of common interest. We look forward  particularly  to the views on the work still ahead in tackling the insidious global challenges.  The tasks I have in mind are: mitigating the negative impact of the ongoing economic crisis on our countries and peoples  and dealing with its many implications for vulnerable small economies like ours; tackling the prolonged tightening of credit markets; protecting the environment from degradation; promoting human security; and redressing the global epidemic of interpersonal violence.  These are but a few of the problems with which Governments across the globe must grapple. And we must do this against a backdrop of uncertainty  while established centres of power are shifting. Governments must now reconcile the pursuit of statecraft and national interests with rapidly changing and less predictable relations among States.  Additionally  the 2008 economic and financial crises  whose effects are still very real today  have undermined confidence in our financial market systems and in what we had hitherto hailed as sound economic models.  Similarly  since the global recession  poverty ranks across the world have been swelling. The    10-55122 34  percentage of working poor has reached unprecedented levels  and millions more  now unemployed  see little prospect for hope or relief. As a consequence  many have lost faith in governance methods and in our long-established financial systems.  We have all become painfully aware that environmental degradation is not country-specific and that the actions of individuals and enterprises in one country ultimately harm ecosystems and threaten livelihoods in others. Hence  as countries pursue national agendas  we need to be mindful of the common interests and ties that connect our societies and peoples  and we must use every opportunity to work towards a realistic convergence of our respective interests.  There can be little doubt that we have established a solid foundation that allows us to envision new and exciting horizons. Reaching these horizons  however  requires that  as we contemplate bold initiatives appropriate for the challenges confronting us  the United Nations must itself be prepared to further deepen its engagement with Member States  regional and national systems  and international financial institutions.   My delegation believes that this is one way to help provide new opportunities  to facilitate greater access to the resources needed to implement national policies and meet international obligations.  The United Nations  created out of the ruins of war  has over the past six and a half decades  been providentially guided by an unfaltering spirit of partnership and prevailing common sense. Despite countless challenges  that spirit is alive and well today. We must therefore work even harder to fulfil the dream of its architects and to live out their vision. The United Nations  then  must remain that vital nexus  fostering the necessary partnerships for the greater good. Perhaps that would provide us with a more visible presence on the global stage  furthering the effort to build a better future for us all. We have seen this partnership in action on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We saw it as we worked to address the global financial crisis  which threatened large economies and almost crippled the economies of small island States. We saw it when Governments and peoples across the globe came to the assistance of our brothers and sisters in disaster-stricken Haiti  the magnitude of whose tragedy we had not experienced before in this hemisphere.  In the context of repositioning the United Nations  we began  earlier this month  a process of review. It is through improved partnerships that the United Nations has an opportunity to bring international business communities and civil society together with Member States in a more structured way  allowing for the practical exchange of ideas  the sharing of expertise and best practices  and the promotion of development and prosperity. Saint Kitts and Nevis welcomes such a dialogue and partnership and recognizes the extent and reach of the United Nations in helping to build capacity  in the face of challenges such as the brain drain  which robs developing countries of their invaluable human resources. Through such advocacy  the United Nations can help also to safeguard gains in social and economic development. Saint Kitts and Nevis encourages Member States to embrace this idea of a multipronged partnership as a way to bolster development processes and strengthen global governance and accountability.  Cognizant of the spirit of cooperation  the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis thanks the Government and people of Taiwan for their continued outstanding support  international cooperation and development assistance over several decades. I welcome the recent passage in that country’s Parliament of their international cooperation and development law  which incorporates the essence and principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the United Nations MDGs. We owe them a debt of gratitude for their efforts and for sharing their development experience through public projects and social  agricultural and private sector development.  We note that  despite being successful before the World Trade Organization dispute settlement body  Antigua and Barbuda  a fellow CARICOM member State  has yet to benefit therefrom. In the spirit of cooperation  we urge the parties involved to seek quickly to resolve the situation and to arrive at a negotiation settlement that is fair and just to Antigua and Barbuda and its nationals.  2010 has so far been a year of epic global natural disasters. The regularity and ferocity of floods  hurricanes  typhoons  sea-level rises and other catastrophic events are stark reminders of the consequences of climate change. This is of particular   35 10-55122  concern to us  as small island developing States are hardest hit by the consequences of climate change. In the light of the facts  it should be a matter of some importance to develop a proactive coordinated approach  in collaboration with financial institutions  insurance companies and other catastrophic-event-mitigation stakeholders. It is clear that the disaster preparedness  mitigation and response paradigms incorporated into our national development strategies are in need of urgent strengthening. Indeed  my country is committed to a comprehensive approach in disaster-risk abatement and mitigation  through capacity-building and through the creation of internal mechanisms that would ensure more effective responses. I urge Member States to continue exploiting and exploring technology and best practices  as we work in partnership to find sustainable solutions to this problem.  We believe that stronger political commitment  greater cooperation and less apportioning of blame are required if we are to succeed in this endeavour. Therefore we hope that the global partnership and solidarity evidenced in the aftermath of this year’s many disasters will continue to prevail.  Four months ago  in May 2010  the General Assembly adopted resolution 64/265 on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. That resolution seeks to halt the growing trend of premature deaths from these diseases — mainly  diabetes  cardiovascular diseases  cancers and chronic respiratory diseases. Saint Kitts and Nevis applauds that resolution. At the same time  however  we seize the opportunity to remind this Assembly of another public health and public security issue that begs attention and resolution. Many will recall our efforts last year to focus attention on the issue of the global epidemic of interpersonal violence and its implications for development  health  security and governance. The data reveal that interpersonal violence accounts for about 4 300 deaths per day  one every 20 seconds  one half of them being due to homicide. In some countries homicide rates are as high as 60 to 70 per 100 000. The human  social and financial costs of violence are unacceptably high and are escalating.  The World Health Organization has been playing a key role in this field through its Milestones of a Global Campaign for Violence Prevention programme  and the General Assembly has adopted individual resolutions on violence against children  violence against women and armed violence. There is still  however  no General Assembly resolution that calls for an integrated approach to all forms of interpersonal violence; there is no resolution that speaks to youth violence  one of the major contributors to high murder rates and social breakdown; and there is no resolution that emphasizes the necessity of a multisectoral response to this problem. Saint Kitts and Nevis is therefore once again soliciting your support for such a resolution. We are calling for an integrated and multisectoral response to all forms of interpersonal violence and recognition of the causes  with a view to its placement on the General Assembly agenda for debate next year  2011. As we celebrate the International Year of Youth  I can think of no better time to introduce such a resolution.  Saint Kitts and Nevis guards zealously the effective management and care of our resources. Our primary resource is our people  particularly our youth — our future. In preparing them for the promises and the potential perils of tomorrow  we have been investing strategically in education — education with relevance.  I applaud the establishment of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). The occupying of high office and decision-making roles by women has been the norm in Saint Kitts and Nevis  and we remain committed to gender-equal opportunities at home and abroad. We look forward to participating actively in UN Women in the coming years and would be most pleased to share our experiences.  As we move forward through this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly  I encourage us to remain committed to the ideals that have brought us to this point. Let us marshal the courage to do the things that ought to be done if this indispensable global institution is to be able to deliver at its very best.  In conclusion  permit me to congratulate you  Mr. President  and the Government of Switzerland  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I thank you  Sir  for your readiness to preside over this General Assembly at a time of great challenge. We feel confident that you will rise to the occasion with great fortitude and determination.  Permit me also to thank Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-   10-55122 36  fourth session  for his leadership and commitment during the past year.  I trust that under your leadership  Mr. President  we will seize the moment for change — this compelling moment for reform and one that is reflected in the deliberations of the recent Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals — as we draw closer to the 2015 target. I assure you  Sir  of my Government’s full support for your stewardship."
"93",3849,"KOR",65,2010,"I would like to begin by extending my warmest congratulations to you  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency at the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I have every confidence that under your distinguished leadership this session will indeed yield fruitful results. May I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki moon. We deeply appreciate his wholehearted commitment and selfless dedication to the noble and lofty goals of this august Organization.  Since their launch in 2000  we have made headway towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Yet progress varies greatly across regions and countries and is uneven in terms of targets. Among other things  maternal and child health warrants our special attention as the most off-track goal in most regions. Indeed  improving maternal and child health is the best investment we can make to carry momentum over to all other closely related goals. In view of the importance it attaches to this goal  the Republic of Korea has joined the Group of 8 Muskoka Initiative for Maternal  Newborn and Child Health. Furthermore  Korea fully supports the Secretary-General’s pursuit of the Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health  and it welcomes the enthusiasm of all stakeholders for this important initiative  as was demonstrated at this week’s meeting.  With only five years remaining until 2015  the prospects for meeting the MDGs are not altogether encouraging. It is high time for the international community to renew its resolve and galvanize global efforts to achieve these vast and meaningful goals. I earnestly hope that  when we gather again in 2013 to review progress  we will find that implementation of the commitments at the High-level Meeting held earlier this week exceeds our most optimistic expectations.  We must bear in mind that the success of the MDGs hinges on honouring development commitments and redoubling efforts to strengthen global partnership. In full recognition of this  the Republic of Korea has embarked on a midterm plan to triple its official development assistance (ODA) budget over the next five years to 0.25 per cent of gross national income  despite tight financial constraints.  As a new Member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Assistance Committee  Korea is seeking to improve the quality of its development assistance by undertaking far-reaching reforms in its ODA system. Last year  basic laws on ODA were enacted as the first step forward. Korea will also align its development policy to reflect the actual needs of the recipient countries and encourage their taking ownership. With its unique experience of fast economic and social development  Korea will do its utmost to play a bridging role between the donor and recipient countries.  Next year  Korea will host the Fourth High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan. The Korean   31 10-55109  Government will make every possible effort to ensure that this forum serves to map out a new direction for international development cooperation that can address evolving global needs.  It is indeed our common belief that development cooperation is an investment for all. A sustainable and balanced world economy requires us to narrow down the persistent development gap. This is the shared goal of the Group of 20 (G-20) and the United Nations. The G-20 leaders have agreed to place development as a crucial new item on the agenda for the upcoming G-20 summit in Seoul this November. The G-20 development agenda will concentrate on building capacity to promote economic growth in the developing world. In this way  the Group of 20 is expected to complement the ongoing development agenda  including the MDGs.  Global financial safety nets will be another new agenda item at the Seoul summit. Robust and reliable global financial safety nets are vital  especially for developing countries  which are most vulnerable to volatile global capital flows. The Seoul summit will focus on faithful implementation of the previous agreements  which will help to bring back the stability of the global market at an early date. Leaders will continue to coordinate their policies for a strong  sustainable and balanced growth of the world economy. Reforms of international financial institutions and financial regulations will also be central to the discussion at the G-20 summit.  As the G-20 President this year  Korea is committed to ensuring a successful outcome for the summit  one that will contribute to overcoming the current crisis and to working out the post-crisis management of the world economy.  In discussing economic growth  particular emphasis must be placed on green growth. Indeed  this lies at the heart of sustainable development. In an effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions  Korea has set a voluntary reduction target of 30 per cent against the business-as-usual levels by 2020. Together  we will gradually shift the growth paradigm from an energy-intensive to a green growth economy.  As part of the efforts to promote the green growth strategy in the international community  we launched the Global Green Growth Institute last June. We hope that this institute will become an integral part of the global endeavour to move towards sustainable development as Korea strives to share green growth vision and assistance with developing countries.  On the peace and security front  peacekeeping operations have become the most visible and defining feature of the United Nations. The increasing demand and growing complexity of peacekeeping operations call for continuous improvement in the operation of the missions.  Strategic goals should be set more clearly. The troops should be deployed more swiftly. Operations should be conducted in a more professional and disciplined way. To this end  all stakeholders  including troop-contributing countries and financial contributors  should focus on close coordination and cooperation.  The Republic of Korea has been a committed contributor to United Nations peacekeeping efforts. Korea dispatched 240 contingent troops this year alone to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti to help rebuild the country shaken by a tragic earthquake. Currently  some 650 Korean soldiers are serving in 11 peacekeeping missions  including the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. We believe that our newly enacted law on participation in peacekeeping operations will further enhance our response capacity in United Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations.  One of the most urgent security challenges today is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. It is imperative to further strengthen international disarmament and non-proliferation regimes built around the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).  In this regard  Korea welcomes the adoption of the Final Document at the 2010 NPT Review Conference in May. We trust that this hard-won achievement will lay the groundwork for future progress in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  The nexus between weapons of mass destruction and terrorism also poses a grave risk to global security. With this shared understanding  the leaders at the Nuclear Security Summit held in Washington  D.C.  last April recognized the potentially catastrophic consequences of nuclear terrorism and committed to strengthening nuclear security. It was agreed that concrete steps for securing nuclear materials should be taken to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists. We look forward to follow-up discussions on    10-55109 32  nuclear security at the second Nuclear Security Summit  which is to be held in Korea in 2012.  In August  President Lee Myung-bak of the Republic of Korea proposed a new vision of the peaceful reunification of Korea  which will serve to stabilize inter-Korean relations and ultimately bring about a reunified Korea. To make this vision reality  we will work earnestly to build three communities: a peace community to ensure security and peace on the Korean peninsula; an economic community to develop North Korea’s economy and eventually achieve inter-Korean economic integration; and a community of the Korean nation which will ensure the dignity  freedom and human rights of all individuals.  However  this vision for peaceful reunification is not without obstacles. Sixty years after the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950  there still remain threats to peace on the Korean peninsula. A case in point is the sinking of the Republic of Korea’s naval vessel  the Cheonan  by a North Korean torpedo attack on 26 March this year. The international community sent a firm and unified message to North Korea by adopting the Security Council presidential statement of 9 July. North Korea must take responsibility for its unprovoked attack and refrain from any further provocations.  The biggest obstacle in our path towards a peace community is the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue. Unless North Korea forgoes its nuclear weapons programme  no sustainable peace can be achieved on the Korean peninsula and beyond.  Through the adoption of Security Council resolutions 1718 (2006) and 1874 (2009)  the international community urged North Korea to abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes in a complete  verifiable and irreversible manner. In order to secure the lifting of sanctions and the ending of isolation  North Korea should make the strategic decision to live up to its commitments to denuclearization. A nuclear-free North Korea would also open the way to saving its people from the current miserable human rights and humanitarian situation.  Last year  on this very occasion  President Lee proposed the “grand bargain” initiative: a single comprehensive agreement that encompasses all steps for North Korea’s denuclearization and the five parties’ corresponding measures. Together with the international community  we will work tirelessly to persuade North Korea to make the right choice — a choice that will ensure a better future for both its country and its people. Once North Korea demonstrates genuine change in its behaviour and attitude  my Government is prepared to engage in meaningful dialogue and cooperation with North Korea.  We are witnessing many global challenges that are testing the international community. These challenges cannot be addressed by one country alone or even by a group of countries. They summon us as global citizens to fulfil a common purpose. They call on the United Nations to assume the mantle of global leadership. In order to effectively address the increasingly diverse and interconnected challenges  the United Nations should heighten its reform efforts aimed at broadening its operational response capacity.  The launch of UN Women is a clear testimony to the world community’s efforts towards this end. Korea commends that historic move to step up progress in meeting the needs of women and girls worldwide. UN Women will greatly contribute to enhancing system-wide coherence  bringing together resources and mandates for greater impact. We also welcome the recent appointment of Michelle Bachelet at its helm.  Furthermore  the upcoming review of the Human Rights Council represents an excellent opportunity to muster our collective efforts to make the Council more effective and efficient at fulfilling the promises we made at its establishment. The Republic of Korea looks forward to working closely with the international community in this joint effort.  No reform of the United Nations can be complete without Security Council reform. It is crucial that the Council be more representative  effective and accountable. To this end  the Republic of Korea will continue to play a constructive role in finding the widest possible agreement on the major issues relating to Council reform.  The challenges facing the United Nations are formidable. We may succeed in some endeavours and not in others  but we should not forget that the United Nations is the best source of hope for many who are suffering from armed conflicts  extreme poverty and human rights abuses across the globe. The Republic of Korea remains fully committed to playing its due part in the efforts of the United Nations to translate those hopes into reality. "
"94",3895,"KWT",65,2010,"It is my pleasure at the outset to congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss sincerely on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. As he represents the friendly Swiss Confederation  I shall now say a few words on behalf of the people of Kuwait in one of the official languages of his country. Allow me  on behalf of the people of Kuwait and myself  to congratulate Mr. Deiss on his election. We are certain that  thanks to his wisdom and experience  coupled with the prestigious standing of his friendly country  the Swiss Confederation  with which we enjoy a very solid relationship on the international stage  our deliberations will be crowned with success. Also  I cannot but commend the sincere efforts of his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  and express our utmost thanks and appreciation to him for the successful and distinguished way in which he conducted the work of the previous session.  I also wish to express our great pride in the sincere efforts of His Excellency the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  to achieve the international purposes and principles we are all pursuing in order to strengthen the concepts of international cooperation and respect for international legitimacy  as well as to foster the principles of the United Nations Charter.  Soon we shall be celebrating the sixty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. It is our hope that the success story of the United Nations will continue for many years to come  not only because it is considered the best multilateral international mechanism there is  but also because it is the most legitimate  neutral and credible institution. Over the span of six decades it has demonstrated its ability to prevent destructive wars and maintain international peace and security.   However  since the challenges and threats facing the international community are increasing rather than decreasing and are becoming more tangled and complex  the role of the Organization has had to be expanded and strengthened in importance and vitality in order to deal with social crises and problems. Those include poverty and hunger  the spread of diseases and epidemics  the scourge of drug trafficking and organized crime and violations of human rights. Economic problems must be confronted  including the increase in food prices and the global economic and financial crisis  and security challenges — such as terrorism  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ongoing armed conflicts in a number of regions of the world — must be addressed.   Together  over the past two years all those different challenges have contributed to wiping out much of the progress and gains that a great number of developing countries had made towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  Natural disasters have also had a destructive effect on the economies of many developing countries  causing tremendous loss of life and of property. The most striking examples were the earthquake that hit Haiti last January and the floods that swept Pakistan last month.   There is no doubt that plenty of work remains to be done to limit the dangers of the climate change phenomenon. We hope the conference in Cancún  Mexico in November will provide us with the opportunity to reach a binding agreement that will determine the required goals  the time frame for their fulfilment  the responsibilities of Member States  and the joint action mechanisms for guaranteeing the financing and technology transfer commitments from developed to developing countries to help them adapt to climate change and cope with its impact.  Without doubt  those challenges require continued reform and improvement of the organs  agencies and programmes of the United Nations  so as to keep pace with the changes in international relations and to improve their performance.  In that regard  we welcome the adoption of General Assembly resolution 64/289  entitled “System-wide coherence”. It established a new composite entity — UN Women — to foster international efforts to accelerate gender equality and women’s    10-54959 30  empowerment and created a Deputy Secretary-General position for this purpose.  On another topic  we believe that after 17 years of negotiations to reform the Security Council  it is high time to take the necessary steps to improve and develop the work of the Council and make it more transparent. Its membership must be expanded in accordance with standards and controls that would achieve a fair balance in representation and efficiency in the discharge of its duties and responsibilities. Such measures should also guarantee the right of the Arab and Muslim States to be represented in a manner that reflects their size  their contributions and their role in defending the purposes and principles of the Charter.  In affirmation of its steadfast support for the efforts and activities of the United Nations in various fields  the State of Kuwait has continued to extend a helping hand to the needy in different parts of the world. Furthermore  in consolidating the principles of Kuwait’s foreign policy  the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development has continued to provide — as it has for the past five decades — assistance and grants  which to date have benefited more than 100 countries all over the world with concessionary loans totalling $14.5 billion. That is equivalent to 1.31 per cent of Kuwait’s gross national product — twice the level of official development assistance agreed upon internationally.  Based on Kuwait’s firm belief in the vitally important role of the United Nations in easing the human suffering resulting from natural disasters or conflicts  Kuwait has decided to increase almost five-fold its voluntary contributions to a number of United Nations agencies  funds and programmes. Kuwait will do so out of its desire to support those humanitarian activities and to deepen its joint cooperation with the United Nations.  As we celebrate the golden jubilee of our independence  and in implementation of the desire of His Highness the Emir of the State of Kuwait to transform the country into a regional financial and trade centre  a development plan has been approved for the period 2010 to 2014. A budget of almost $115 billion has been allocated to develop infrastructure  build ports and railways and construct new cities  as well as to continue to work to improve the level of basic services provided to citizens and residents alike.   In that context  the State of Kuwait is proud to be a leader  in the Arab world and internationally  in terms of the quality of education  living standards and health care services  as well as in the fields of gender equality  economic achievement and political freedoms  according to rankings issued by international organizations  specialized agencies and non-governmental organizations.  Twenty years have now passed since the invasion and occupation of the State of Kuwait by the former Iraqi regime. It is a painful anniversary that we and our brothers in Iraq are determined to overcome by laying the foundations for stable relations based on the principles of the mutual respect for sovereignty  independence  good neighbourliness and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States. We will seek to resolve all differences by peaceful means  to respect all resolutions of international legitimacy and to implement remaining commitments stipulated by relevant Security Council resolutions.   The State of Kuwait is optimistic regarding future relations between the two countries and is totally ready to provide all sorts of support to assist the Iraqi Government in its efforts to enforce security and stability and to preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq  as well as to rebuild the various State sectors that have suffered as a result of the adventures of the former regime and its hostile expansionist policies.  In that regard  we hope that the ongoing negotiations between the different parties and political forces in Iraq will lead to the formation of a Government of national unity that represents the entire spectrum of Iraqi society and all its political components. Such a Government should be able to address the country’s security  political and economic challenges and fulfil the needs and aspirations of the Iraqi people to build a free  democratic and unified Iraq living in peace with itself and its neighbours and contributing to the consolidation of the pillars of security and stability in the region.  The State of Kuwait  in its capacity as Chair of the current session of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)  hopes that communication at all levels will continue between the sisterly United Arab Emirates and the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran to seek a resolution to the conflict over the occupied Emarati Islands  in line with the principles and norms of   31 10-54959  international law and on the basis of good-neighbourly relations  as set out in the resolutions issued by GCC summits and ministerial meetings.  While the State of Kuwait affirms the right of States to utilize nuclear energy for peaceful purposes  we call on all States with such programmes to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency and to take whatever steps are necessary to build confidence so as to reassure the international community about the nature of their nuclear programmes  in line with resolutions of international legitimacy. We also emphasize the need to resolve those issues peacefully through diplomatic means and direct negotiations between the parties concerned. That will pave the way to the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons in the Middle East  in implementation of the resolution adopted at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference held at the United Nations Headquarters last May.  The Arab-Israeli conflict is considered the gravest threat to peace and security in the Middle East region. The failure of the United Nations over the past six decades to find a solution to that pivotal issue has contributed to the complication of the Palestine question and has prompted Israel  the occupying Power  to persist in its disrespect of international legitimacy. Israel has also persisted in its settlement policy  imposed a siege on Gaza and destroyed the landmarks of Jerusalem in order to Judaize it.   Moreover  instead of welcoming the Arab Peace Initiative as a strategic choice and the nucleus of the peace process in the Middle East  Israel has continued to confiscate territory and to torture and detain unarmed Palestinian civilians. It has used the rockets launched against it as a pretext to launch savage wars and to use excessive force. All of that is in addition to its arrogant attack on the Turkish freedom flotilla in international waters.   Israel is confident of its impunity and thus commits crimes continuously and systematically  without any adequate response from the international community to its arrogance. We therefore reaffirm the responsibility of the international community and of the Security Council for the maintenance of peace and security  as well as to deal seriously and sternly with Israel and force it to comply with the international will.  We hope that the direct negotiations that began at the start of this month between the Palestinian Authority and Israel will lead to the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East and the establishment of a Palestinian State  with Jerusalem as its capital  in line with relevant Security Council resolutions  the principle of land for peace  the Road Map and the Arab Peace Initiative.  We also renew our full support to the Syrian Arab Republic in regaining its occupied lands in the Golan and the return to the line of 4 June 1967. We also stress the need for implementing Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) and putting an end to repeated Israeli violations of Lebanese airspace and of the Blue Line of separation. We also emphasize the need for Israel to withdrawal from all occupied Lebanese territories.  The peoples of the world want to live in a clean  safe and stable environment. In recent decades  we have been able to enact numerous international agreements and conventions under the umbrella of the United Nations to ensure dignified lives for our peoples in a world where justice and equality prevail. We must therefore shoulder our responsibilities and adhere to our commitments in order to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of all the peoples of the world."
"95",3941,"LAO",65,2010,"At the outset  I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I am fully confident that with his vast experience he will be able   31 10-54965  to lead this session to great success. May I also commend His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdulssalam Treki  President of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  for his effective leadership. I would also like to applaud Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership in fulfilling effectively the various duties and tasks mandated to address the current emerging challenges and constraints.  The global state of affairs today has undergone rapid change and become more complex  offering both opportunities and challenges. Global and regional peace and security are threatened by conflicts and armed confrontation. Severe and unprecedented natural disasters have become a regular phenomenon that we have to live with. The tragedies caused by natural catastrophes  such as in Haiti  China  Pakistan and elsewhere  have intensified and are coupled with the economic crisis that we are already facing.  No one can deny that those calamities and challenges are mostly the result of our own human action. National challenges have gone beyond national boundaries and become matters of international concern  matters that a single country or even a group of countries cannot overcome alone. Therefore it is the full responsibility of the international community as a whole to tackle them.  Against that backdrop  it is time for us to fully realize all the promises and commitments that we have made. The United Nations reform process  which has been pending through past decades  should continue in a more concrete manner with a view to ensuring mutual benefits for all Member States. The reform should also seek to ensure a relevant and effective role for the United Nations as the only universal body addressing global challenges. To achieve those objectives  it is critical that all Member States enhance cooperation in a sincere and trustworthy manner and avoid taking advantage of one another.  Peace and stability are still threatened by weapons of mass destruction  especially nuclear weapons. The results of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons held in May this year did not by any means meet our expectations in addressing the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and making our world free of nuclear weapons. Consensus is far from being reached due to manifest suspicion and distrust. Therefore it is time to build trust and confidence in order to create an enabling international environment for a nuclear-free world.  The use and proliferation of weapons of all forms undoubtedly have a long-term impact on the lives of people and impede national socio-economic development efforts. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic is still badly suffering the consequences of wars that ended several decades ago.  The legacies of the Indochina war include a huge amount of remnants and unexploded ordnance  which have continued to kill and injure innocent people. That is a major obstacle to the possibility of an ordinary daily life for the Lao people. Over 30 per cent of Lao soil is heavily contaminated by unexploded ordnance  and that is a major constraint and challenge in the country’s efforts to achieve its national socio-economic objectives and to attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  The Convention on Cluster Munitions  which entered into force on 1 August 2010  is a result of the close cooperation and shared commitment of the international community to put an end to the serious impact of cluster bombs and to thus free people from that danger. As the country most affected by unexploded ordnance  especially cluster munitions  it is a great source of pride for the Lao People’s Democratic Republic to have played an active part in the Oslo process  which led to the adoption of this Convention. We will continue to cooperate closely with the international community to ensure that it is fully implemented.  In that context  it is a great honour for the Lao People’s Democratic Republic to host the First Meeting of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions in Vientiane from 8 to 12 November 2010. That event that will be an important milestone for the Oslo process and provide an opportunity for the international community to reaffirm its strong determination to address the challenges caused by cluster munitions. The First Meeting of States Parties will offer us an excellent occasion to chart a clear vision and adopt appropriate mechanisms to ensure the effective implementation of the Convention. On that note  once again I would like to extend my Government’s cordial invitation to all United Nations Member States  international organizations and non-governmental organizations to participate and play    10-54965 32  an active part in the discussions and ensure the successful outcome of the Meeting.  Regional peace and security remain critical for ensuring global peace. We share a common concern over the situation in the Middle East  which has caused great suffering and immense loss of lives and property in the region  especially for the Palestinian people. It is my fervent hope that the resumption of peace talks between Israel and Palestine  with the participation of the United States  will lead to a solution and the realization of the vision of two States  Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace and security and within internationally recognized borders  as stipulated in the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.  The Republic of Cuba is a sovereign and politically stable State that has enjoyed peace and security for several decades. Nevertheless  for over half of a century  the people of Cuba have been affected by the economic  trade and financial embargo imposed on them by the United States. Indeed  such an embargo constitutes a clear violation of the United Nations Charter and international law. Therefore  in order to respond to the legitimate interests of the two countries and peoples — Cuba and the United States — the embargo should now be lifted.  The cooperation among South-East Asian countries has been steadily expanding. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has set the objective for 2015 of building our community with three pillars  namely  the ASEAN Political-Security Community  the ASEAN Economic Community and ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community. To attain that objective  ASEAN has laid an important socio-economic foundation  including the Free Trade Area among ASEAN countries as well as Free Trade Areas between ASEAN and China  ASEAN and the Republic of Korea  ASEAN and Japan  and ASEAN and Australia-New Zealand.  Furthermore  the ASEAN Master Plan on connectivity will be adopted at the Seventeenth ASEAN Summit  to be held in Hanoi in October 2010 to support the ASEAN Free Trade Area. The successful cooperation within ASEAN has contributed to the effort to narrow the development gap within ASEAN as well as between ASEAN and other countries. It also helps the ASEAN countries attain the MDGs.  While the world is facing a financial and economic crisis  coupled with various natural calamities  the most impacted are the least developed countries (LDCs)  the poor and the vulnerable in the society. The international community’s main objective in attaining the MDGs is to ensure that the lives of the poor and disadvantaged are improved and that the number of LDCs is reduced. That would demonstrate that we can achieve the MDGs.   In that context  the ten-year review of the implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action for LDCs  to be held in 2011  is crucial. We will assess whether the seven commitments that we endorsed together in 2001 have been fulfilled. In that connection  I commend the Secretary-General for setting up a group of eminent persons on least developed countries to advise on support for LDCs.  The year 2010 is of great significance for the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. Our country has completed the implementation of the Sixth Five Year Socio-Economic Development Plan and has already started the preparation for the Seventh Plan  for 2011-2015. Over the past years  our socio-economic development has been steadily progressing. The economy has grown at an average rate of seven per cent annually  poverty has continuously declined  and the living standard of the multi-ethnic Lao people has gradually improved. All that success has been due to the right policy and the timely measures undertaken by the Government. The decisive factor in creating an enabling environment for socio-economic development in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic is political stability and social order that our nation has enjoyed over the past three decades.  Nevertheless  to a certain extent  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic remains challenged by the global financial and economic crisis  and that is contributing to the decline of our economic growth. Against that backdrop  the Government has adopted immediate measures that have helped to alleviate the impact of the crisis.  However  due to the uncertainty of the state of today’s global economy  like other developing countries  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic is still vulnerable  and thus requires the assistance and support of the international community in addressing the impact of the crisis over the long term. Such assistance will help the country overcome any future problem resulting from the current crisis  enable us to   33 10-54965  achieve the MDGs and  ultimately  leave the status of least developed country by 2020.  The Lao People’s Democratic Republic reiterates once again its firm commitment and willingness to work closely with the international community to build a peaceful world under a just and more democratic new order  based on cooperation with all countries  in tackling the various global challenges facing us. I am convinced that only through genuine partnership will we be able to ensure that the world is secure  peaceful and prosperous."
"96",3984,"LBN",65,2010,"First  I would like to congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session and to thank his predecessor for his able management of the Assembly’s work at its previous session. I also wish to express my appreciation to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his valuable report on the various aspects of the work of our international Organization (A/65/1).  This is the first time I have addressed this Assembly since Lebanon was elected a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the 2010-2011 term. That status confers on us responsibilities that Lebanon is proud to assume in service of its causes and the just causes of the Arab world  and in the service of justice and peace around the world. In that context  I would like to commend the efforts and commitments undertaken as a result of the high-level meeting of the Security Council (6389th meeting) aimed at increasing the effectiveness of its role and enabling it to implement its resolutions without resorting to double standards.  Moreover  we welcome the statement issued after the Assembly’s High-level Plenary Meeting on implementation of the Millennium Development Goals  which contribute to alleviating poverty  promoting education and improving health services. We also commend the progress achieved by the United Nations in strengthening the role of women  an issue to which Lebanon attaches special importance  in line with its enlightened role in that regard. Indeed  Lebanon was among the first countries in our region to grant women the right to vote in legislative elections  in 1953.  Despite the growing and important role the United Nations plays in the field of socio-economic development  our Organization remains  in essence  a political organization  one that was created primarily to maintain international peace and security and to protect humanity from the scourge of the wars and conflicts that had befallen it and that had blocked progress and development over successive periods of history.  In that context  since the outbreak of the Arab-Israeli conflict the United Nations has not hesitated to address that issue and has adopted a series of resolutions aimed at reinstating peoples’ rights and consolidating the pillars of peace and development. However  those efforts abated and faded in the face of Israel’s intransigence and its obvious inclination to expand and to implement a settlement policy. Indeed  to this day Israel refuses to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to place all of its nuclear facilities under the comprehensive safeguards regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  We welcome the current growing international awareness of the urgent need to find a settlement  within set time frames  to the Middle East problem  with the Palestinian issue at its heart  and to revive efforts to reach such a settlement. However  decades of experience show that a genuine  permanent solution for the Middle East problem is impossible unless it is a just and comprehensive solution  one that addresses all aspects of the conflict on all tracks.   Also  such a solution is impossible unless the international community musters the necessary determination to move from making declarations on guiding principles towards working to ensure the appropriate means for implementation  while promoting the elements that would lead to a solution based on internationally legitimate resolutions  the Madrid terms of reference and all the provisions of the Arab Peace Initiative. We highlight in particular those provisions that ensure a rejection of any settlement by Palestinian refugees in Arab host countries  since the circumstances of those countries do not allow for such settlement.  In fact  Lebanon has frequently declared that it will not accept any form of settlement of Palestinian refugees on its territories. That is due to the reasons   11 10-54959  and considerations I emphasized in the Security Council yesterday (see S/PV.6389)  and is especially true because such settlement would entail dangerous repercussions and would threaten security and the pillars of stability. It is important to note that the issue of Palestinian refugees cannot be solved through isolated Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in a way that disregards Lebanon and other concerned host countries.  At this point  we must reiterate that the primary responsibility for guaranteeing decent living conditions for and the well-being of the Palestinian refugees falls on the shoulders of the international community. We also reiterate that increasing the contributions to the budget of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East — which was created specifically for that purpose in 1949 — would guarantee a life of dignity for Palestinian refugees  under the sovereignty of the host countries and with their assistance  without extremism or violence.  On the other hand  Lebanon once again condemns international terrorism  from which it has suffered in different ways. Lebanon cooperates with the international community in combating terrorism and supports the calls to explore measures to clearly define terrorism and address its root causes in order to clearly distinguish it from legitimate resistance to foreign occupation  which is recognized by the United Nations Charter and relevant resolutions.  While Lebanon is committed to Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) and seeks to compel Israel to implement all its provisions  Israel continues its daily violations of Lebanese airspace  territory and waters  violations that the Secretary-General has described as provocative in many of his reports. Moreover  the Israeli spy networks and recruitment of agents aimed at sowing strife and destabilizing our country have reached a point where the international community must take a firm position and thwart those acts of Israeli aggression and persistent threats against Lebanon  its people and its infrastructure.   The international community must also compel Israel to withdraw from the Lebanese territories that it still occupies in the Sheba’a farms area  the hills of Kfar Shuba  and the northern part of Al-Ghajar village  without delay or preconditions. In that regard  it is important to note that we retain our right to retrieve or liberate our remaining occupied territories by all legitimate and available means.   Furthermore  Lebanon looks forward to receiving more financial and technical support to pursue the removal of mines and cluster bombs that were randomly planted by Israel in residential areas during the aggression of July 2006 and the periods of its occupation of Lebanese territories. Within the appropriate framework  Lebanon will spare no efforts to seek to compel Israel to compensate for all the losses and damage it caused Lebanon throughout its successive aggressions.  In the face of Israel’s designs and in keeping with international law  Lebanon also wishes to assert its right to use its waters  oil and natural gas wealth  especially as it plans to exploit those resources within the limits of its exclusive economic zone. Parts of the southern border of that zone were delineated as shown on the map that the Lebanese Government submitted to the Secretariat on 9 July 2010.  While we commend the efforts and sacrifices made by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon  which operates in south Lebanon  and while we are keen to continue that arrangement  we re-emphasize the importance of continued coordination and cooperation between the Lebanese army and the international forces  in accordance with the agreed rules of engagement  in order to ensure the proper implementation of the mission entrusted to those forces. That cooperation is matched only by arrogant and provocative Israeli positions that are the root causes of the incidents that occur every once in a while along the Blue Line and that  with some work  could be prevented.  During the past few years  Lebanon has strived to maintain its internal stability through dialogue  by completing its implementation of the Taif Accords  by resorting to legal institutions to resolve any disputes  and through its commitment to the resolutions of the Security Council and other internationally legitimate resolutions. Lebanon was keen to meet all constitutional deadlines without any delays  whether for municipal or parliamentary elections. Those elections took place in a free  transparent and calm atmosphere  in accordance with the requirements of democracy and the principle of the peaceful devolution of power.    10-54959 12   In addition  Lebanon undertook efforts to prevent any external aggression by seeking to compel Israel to implement Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) and by mobilizing all its national deterrence capabilities within the framework of its national defence strategy.  As we vow to persevere with that solid approach  no matter the dangers  with the support of the free and conscious will of the Lebanese people and the support of friendly and sisterly States  we are confident that Lebanon will always be open to dialogue and to civilized  rich and innovative interaction. We remain loyal to our mission and committed to strengthening the state of justice and law  despite all challenges  and to upholding the values of freedom  democracy and concord — values our country has based itself on since its inception.

"97",4030,"LBR",65,2010,"I am honoured to address this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly on behalf of the people of Liberia. I congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to lead this Assembly and am convinced that you will bring to the office your wealth of experience as a former President and Foreign Minister of the Swiss Confederation.  Let me express appreciation to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  for the capable manner in which he conducted the affairs of the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly.  Allow me also to extend highest commendation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his unwavering commitment to the Organization and his efficient management of its affairs.   I wish to congratulate President Jacob Zuma and the Government and people of South Africa on having successfully hosted the 2010 World Cup for the first time on our African continent. They made Africa proud  and we in turn are proud of them.  Some four years ago  I stood at this rostrum and told the story of a country exhibiting the symptoms of two decades of self-destruction: a criminalized and collapsed economy  a suffocating external debt overhang  dysfunctional institutions  destroyed infrastructure  a pariah nation in a state of decay  and a people in a state of despair. All of this translated into hundreds of thousands in refugee camps  equal numbers of the talented in the diaspora  and thousands of women  young people and children struggling for survival.  Today  I stand here to report on the progress that can be made from the collective effort of a resilient people  a responsive partnership  and effective leadership. We have come to report with confidence that Liberia is well on the way to recovery. In less than five years  our economy has experienced an average annual growth rate of 6.5 per cent  despite the drag on the two-digit potential occasioned by the 2009 global economic crisis.  I can say with pride that  having successfully carried out the reforms required under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative  on 17 September  at the Paris Club  the final segment of Liberia’s $4.9-billion external debt was written off the books. I can report that we have opened the economy to put the private sector at the centre of our    10-54965 2  development effort and thereby have attracted some $16 billion in private investment in the reactivation of our mining  agriculture and forestry sectors. In addition  a new potential was recently discovered in oil exploration.  The results of reform in our security sector  enhanced by the continued deployment of the United Nations peacekeeping force  have stabilized the security situation in the country  where people move freely around. Experience in this regard shows that peacekeeping and peacebuilding can and should take place concurrently  and we are pleased that Liberia is now formally placed on the agenda of the Peacebuilding Commission to enable us to chart the way for a smooth transition from peacekeeping and peacebuilding to recovery.  Moreover  we have encouraged a vibrant environment in which people have exercised their inalienable rights to free expression  association  religion and access to the press without hindrance. Nobody has been molested on account of views expressed. Liberia has no prisoners of conscience in detention  nor does anyone have cause to flee in fear for their life or safety on account of their political beliefs or association.  Thus  in promoting a liberal environment in which freedom  equity and equality are exercised as the best guarantees of peace  security and stability  we can boast of being counted among the Governments that have demonstrated commitment to good governance and proven respect for human rights.  Regionally  Liberia continues to demonstrate its commitment to good-neighbourliness  peaceful coexistence and respect for the sovereign integrity of other nations. We actively participate in subregional and regional affairs through the African Union  the Economic Community of West African States  the Community of Sahel-Saharan States  and the Mano River Union. The Mano River Union is currently under Liberia’s chairmanship  and this has allowed us to stay engaged with our members  Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire  as they embark upon their political transitions.  We hail the recent breakthrough by President Barack Obama in bringing the Palestinians and Israelis back to the negotiating table and holding their leaders to their words to fulfil their promise to remain engaged and conduct direct talks aimed at ending that long-running crisis.  Because we live in a global village  a continued crisis in any Member State or region should warrant our concern. Moreover  an unending crisis contradicts the cardinal objective of the United Nations  which is the promotion of international peace and security. In that regard  we suggest that the situation in Somalia warrants a Chapter VII intervention. In a country that has gone many years without a stable constitutional Government  the presence of pirates  extremists and other terrorist elements there should sound the alarm. The world needs to act promptly  as we cannot afford to see Somalia remain a haven for anarchists and extremists.  That is why our Government supports the role of the African Union in fielding troops in Somalia. We call for more troop deployment from other countries  and we strongly support action to put an end to the Somali quagmire. We also call on the Somalis themselves to accept dialogue and go to the negotiating table to thrash out their differences and restore their country to rightful peace and dignity. While we acknowledge the right of States to self-defence and the promotion of programmes in support of national interests  we call on them to do so responsibly  with respect for international public opinion and the protocols and conventions surrounding such developments.  At this week’s Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) summit  we reaffirmed Liberia’s commitment to continuing to work for the achievement of all eight Goals  although we are implementing those Goals under a more challenging context. Our national development agenda and programmes for ensuring national reconciliation  good governance and the rule of law  national security  food security  and the implementation of our poverty reduction strategy are consistent with the objectives of the MDGs. Our progress bears the fruits of this commitment.  We are pleased to note the progress the world has made in the advancement of women. Today  there is greater representation of women in Government  in political life  business and civil society. Liberia’s own effort was recognized on Sunday when we received an award for our progress on MDG 3  on the empowerment of women. We also commend this body and the Secretary-General for their work in establishing the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women  and we   3 10-54965  applaud the appointment of the former President of Chile  Michelle Bachelet  to take on this responsibility.  We have five years left to go to achieve the MDGs. For us  it is not the target date that matters; rather  it is the commitment to achieving the Goals that is important. We therefore call upon our partner countries to support the realization of the Goals through strong global partnership  as recommended in MDG 8. We believe in the partnerships we have enjoyed with the bilateral and multilateral institutions that have made our progress possible. We call upon all in this Hall to secure the strength of this partnership  which benefits all of our countries  by supporting the replenishment of the resources of the World Bank and the African Development Bank.  Liberia’s progress is not without challenges. The satisfactory security environment of which I speak is still fragile  and made more so by the political uncertainties in our subregion. We also continue to face the tensions associated with the thousands of our young people who  lacking skills  are still unemployed. Moreover  we continue to manage the raised expectations expressed in the demand from villages and communities across the country for essential infrastructure such as roads  schools and clinics. Perhaps the greatest challenge we face is to go beyond the measures we have taken in formulating a public service code of conduct  in introducing new procurement and financial management systems  and in establishing and strengthening the pillars of integrity — all aimed at addressing long-standing corruption. Reform of the judicial system and efforts to change an inherited value system are additional measures that are under way.  Another challenge is Liberia’s vulnerability to organized cross-border crime  including drug and human trafficking  as the result of porous borders and limited law-enforcement capacity  with weak national security organizations. Against this background  we recently signed the Freetown Commitment on Combating Illicit Trafficking of Drugs and Transnational Organized Crime in West Africa  which should assist us in promoting capacity-building in the region to combat transnational crime.  The root cause of civil crisis in Liberia was the consistent failure of democratic transitions that would usher in Governments elected by the people. With the support of the United Nations  multiparty democratic elections were held in 2005  following the end of the civil crisis. In keeping with our Constitution  the Liberian people will once again exercise the right of choice when we hold elections in 2011.  The 2011 elections will mark a groundbreaking turning point. They will complete Liberia’s transition to full constitutional rule and participatory democracy. This will be the true test of Liberia’s progress on the road to development and its defining moment  which  if successful  will serve as proof that we can truly stay on an irreversible course towards peace and development. It is absolutely essential that everything be done to ensure a peaceful  legitimate and transparent process. I wish to state categorically that my Government is completely and fully committed to this objective  and we call on the international community to stay with Liberia on this last stretch. Already  the process leading to the holding of elections in 2011 has begun with the release of the election timetable.  As a founding Member of this Organization  Liberia remains inspired by the noble objectives of the United Nations in meeting enormous global challenges. We believe in its ability to formulate and implement programmes  particularly those aimed at raising the standard of living of people  forging global cooperation and solidarity  and encouraging dialogue to reduce tension and conflicts.  In closing  we say again that Liberia is on the way to recovery. We have thrown off the label of a pariah State. We have restored hope to our people  credibility and honour to our national integrity  and won international creditworthiness and respect. Our confidence in the future of our country is firm. Our new vision of a rising Liberia seeks to move us to a middle-income country by the year 2030. This is an aggressive goal  but we are determined  and through efficiency in the allocation and use of our natural resources  we will succeed. We thank you  Sir  and all the members of this noble institution for the support that has brought Liberia to this point of progress."
"98",4075,"LBY",65,2010,"I am happy to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to preside over the General Assembly during the current session. I wish you every success in managing our business.  It would be remiss of me not to express our appreciation to your predecessor for his efforts during his stewardship of the Assembly during the previous session.  I also wish to express the appreciation and thanks of my delegation to the Secretary-General for his efforts in the maintenance of international peace and security  which will not be achieved until the world gets rid of all weapons of mass destruction and implements the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) with respect to all  without distinction.  I remind the Assembly that my country has stressed the important need to amend the NPT so as to enable the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to perform its tasks and verify the reduction of nuclear arsenals  whose existence is the most dangerous threat to mankind. Equally important  we must encourage States to possess and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. We have affirmed many times that the voluntary initiative of our country to reject all activities related to the production of prohibited materials should be a role model for countries possessing  or seeking to possess  nuclear power.  The United Nations was established to meet the needs and concerns of Member States. An honest and strict evaluation of the current situation and the Organization’s achievements shows that we still need to work in unison to support it. Here we should contemplate the suggestions of our brother  the Leader of the Revolution  Colonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi  in his address to the Assembly during the sixty-fourth session.  The United Nations is at a crossroads. It must be reformed in order to achieve equality for all States. This is the real reform to which we all aspire: that the General Assembly become the main legislature  the organ that can produce binding resolutions  as it represents the real parliament of the world. The Security Council  on the contrary  should be the executive tool  implementing the resolutions of the Assembly. We have time and again called for permanent membership to be given to certain Member States  but  in order for the Council to accommodate small States as well  the ideal solution is to give Security Council membership to regional groups. That would secure the representation on the Council of all nations  without the exclusive veto right  which is contrary to democracy.  The African continent  which has been deprived of fair representation on the Security Council  should    10-55276 2  have a permanent seat. That is a legitimate request. It would put the African continent on an equal footing with all the other geopolitical groupings. The speedy pace of development in developing countries and the need to narrow the painful gap between the developing and developed countries require international cooperation within the framework of a new and effective partnership.  It goes without saying that the underdevelopment and poverty of most nations are the remnants of colonization and plunder  the theft of their resources and the illegal usurping of their riches. The former colonizers should apologize for those actions. It is time the Assembly took the necessary measures to criminalize colonialism  put the blame on the countries concerned and make them accountable for their historical responsibilities.  Nations suffered immensely from the two world wars  after which the United Nations was established. Since then the world has witnessed wars of aggression and illegal interventions which are a flagrant violation of all international customs and conventions.  The invasion of Iraq is a shameful example of such unfair and heinous wars. In order to achieve international justice  the United Nations is called upon to establish an international investigative panel to understand the motivation behind the invasion and to investigate the mass killings and executions of prisoners of war  including the head of State.  At this forum last year  the Leader of the Revolution  our brother  Colonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi  also raised the question of the political assassination of many personalities  including Dag Hammarskjöld  John Kennedy  Patrice Lumumba  Martin Luther King  Maurice Bishop and many Palestine Liberation Organization leaders. Those assassinations shocked the conscience of the world and created anger and rage the world over. However  justice was not done; the perpetrators enjoyed  and continue to enjoy  impunity. My country has called for an effective international instrument to secure an honest investigation of all the circumstances that led to the assassinations.   An alternative Headquarters for the United Nations has been suggested. We all know that certain considerations were in play in choosing the host country for the current Headquarters. But for the good conduct of our work  and to facilitate the work of the diplomatic missions accredited to the United Nations  it is imperative to choose another Headquarters  in another country. We must study all the bids presented by other countries  at the forefront of which is the offer by the Jamahiriya to host the Headquarters.  Anti-personnel mines are weapons used by weak States to defend their territories against invaders and to protect themselves. Strong and mighty States do not need such weapons  because they possess advanced arsenals. In this connection  the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction  the Ottawa Treaty  should be amended in a way that takes into account the security interests of small States. The drafters should have included a provision for compensation to be paid to the States where such mines have been planted. My country suggests a review of the Treaty.  We must distinguish between the heinous phenomenon of terrorism and the deliberate biased distortion of the struggle of nations languishing under occupation. The Palestinian people are waging an incredible struggle against enemies nourished by a racist creed  who deny the right of that oppressed people to existence and self-determination.  The world understands the suffering and losses of the Palestinian people over 62 years. We cannot deny the facts of history. This question cannot be settled through the so-called peace process  because it will go on indefinitely. The solution  rather  is the establishment of one democratic State in which all can coexist  without discrimination  in accordance with the suggestion by our brother Muammar Al-Qadhafi in his “White Book” regarding Isratine.  In the framework of strengthening cooperation between the States of the South and those of the North  my country is to play host in October to an Arab-African summit. We shall also host  in November  a summit of Africa and the European Union  which will be a major transformation in the relationship between all the States concerned. We call on all stakeholders and all States to take part in the two summits at the highest level  as they are of prime importance.  In current circumstances  and in the framework of today’s challenges  we have great hope that bold measures will be taken to strengthen the General Assembly  its authority and effectiveness so that it better represents the interests of all nations."
"99",4108,"LCA",65,2010,"In my address on the accomplishments and shortfalls of Saint Lucia towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals  I stressed that all of our gains would be useless if we could not address the threatening saga of adverse climate change. Many other nations highlighted that urgent issue  and I hope that our collective voices will receive the attention of those most capable of acting.  I will therefore focus on two of the most critical factors in our development as small island developing States (SIDS): first  the effects of global climate change  and second  the uncertain economic and financial crisis.  Saint Lucia notes the ongoing negotiations in advance of the sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Cancún  Mexico  later this year. Following the fifteenth Conference of the Parties  which failed to achieve consensus on a legally binding framework for addressing climate change  Saint Lucia recognizes the critical importance of the current talks in laying a solid foundation for a more favourable outcome in Cancún  one that will truly fulfil the purpose of the Convention and help to ensure the continued existence of humankind.  We have long since moved past the debate over the existence of climate change to a discussion about the severity of its impacts on the nations and regions of the world. The small island developing States of the world  Saint Lucia included  are recognized as being among the most vulnerable to climate change  with that phenomenon threatening the very existence of some of our island nations. That is so despite the fact that  jointly  the SIDS contribute a fraction of one per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.  We began this year with news that a cataclysmic earthquake had hit Haiti. The United Nations came together in solidarity with our sister island and pledged $1.5 billion in assistance. To date  Haiti’s officials report that only 10 per cent of the pledges have been funded. The same seems to be true for most appeals for humanitarian causes. We trust that the pledging conference for Pakistan  the most recent country to be hit by a catastrophe  will be more successful.   Addressing the humanitarian consequences of today’s disasters and emergencies remains a United Nations priority. We thank those who have kept their pledges  while we encourage those who have shown good intentions but have not yet matched words with action to do so with some urgency.  For those reasons  for the good of all humankind and indeed  for the good of all creation  Saint Lucia  like all member States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) is committed to lending its efforts to achieving an ambitious  just and legally binding agreement that will realize our goal of timely and successfully addressing climate change.  Speaking of justice  climate change can be successfully addressed only if countries most responsible take the necessary steps to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and provide adequate financial resources for the development and transfer of technology for both adaptation and mitigation to those who have been most seriously affected.  Few developing countries possess sufficient financial and human resources to address adequately the ongoing and anticipated impacts of global climate change. According to World Bank estimates  the total annual impact of potential climate change on all CARICOM countries could be  in 2007 dollar prices  $9.9 billion of our total gross national product (GDP)  or about 11.3 per cent of total GDP. That means that we have no choice but to divert critical funding from our poverty alleviation programmes to trying to protect our countries from that formidable threat.   There is no doubt that stable long-term funding is of critical importance to developing countries and cannot be underestimated. We urgently need to scale up new and additional resources and sources of funding to support mitigation efforts. We cannot rely on humanitarian assistance alone  which only addresses the consequences of such events.   47 10-54965   We know that our development partners are serious about implementing meaningful mitigation action  so we call for a firm collective commitment to providing new and additional resources. Let us not continue to renege on promises made  as developing States cannot go it alone and should not be penalized for the actions of industrialized countries. We call for an understanding partnership in tackling the pressing issues that threaten to engulf our world.  Despite our geographic distribution  small island developing States (SIDs) are working diligently together on shared concerns through regional and international networks  the most notable of which is the Alliance of Small Island States. We recognize that traditional hydrocarbon fuel usage is unsustainable and are therefore looking to make use of the alternate energy sources that are available to us. The use of hydropower  wind  solar and geothermal sources and converting waste into energy are means by which we could reduce our energy reliance  lower trade deficits and generate employment. However  those require investment in research  development and infrastructure.  The other most critical factor in our development is the speed of the global economy’s return to sustained growth. Recent news of deteriorating economic conditions and a fall in house sales in the United States has fanned the flame of fears of a double-dip recession. Over the past few weeks  the short-term growth prospects of the United States  Europe and Japan have been downgraded on the back of recently released economic data  which is below expectations.  The prospects for economic recovery in Europe were dampened by the crisis in some countries earlier this year  but renewed confidence has recently emerged  spurred by the stronger-than-expected performance of the German economy in the second quarter of 2010. However  the growth prospects for Europe remain uncertain  given that fiscal retrenchment measures could pose a risk to growth and the pace of recovery. The weakened growth prospects for the United States and Europe could impede growth in emerging markets  with a slowdown in the growth of exports and investment flows. The uneven pace of the global economic recovery in countries and regions has led to differences in approach in policy responses.  I have made these points because the economies of the United States  Europe and the European Union are our major sources of tourism  agricultural trade  official development assistance  foreign direct investment (FDI) and remittances  which constitute the mainstays of our economy. We therefore urge the focus on global economic recovery to be maintained for the benefit of the global community.  As a small island developing State with a highly open economy  Saint Lucia has been hard hit by the effects of the global financial and economic crisis. As with most small developing countries  the crisis led to a deterioration in Saint Lucia’s economy  resulting in a contraction in GDP  a rise in the level of unemployment and a weakening of the Government’s fiscal position.  The decline in economic activity was driven mainly by a fall in stay-over tourist arrivals  lower production in the agricultural sector and a sharp downturn in construction. The decline in activity in the construction sector was attributable to a fall in FDI inflows as the freeze in international credit adversely affected the financing of a number of hotel construction projects in Saint Lucia. It was also attributable to a decline in remittances  which have helped sustain the local housing sector.  Notwithstanding the decline in revenue collection  expenditure outlays increased  resulting in a deteriorating fiscal position. That outcome led to a widening of the central Government’s overall fiscal deficit to 4.8 per cent of GDP in the financial year 2009-2010  compared to a deficit of 1.9 per cent of GDP in the previous year. Public debt as a percentage of GDP rose from 66 per cent in 2008 to 71 per cent in 2009 as a result of increases in borrowing to finance the budget deficit.  The adverse impacts of the combination of global and regional shocks have prompted the Government of Saint Lucia to implement a number of measures designed to mitigate the social  fiscal and regulatory challenges of the crisis. In order to mitigate the impacts of the price shocks  the Government implemented a number of measures to protect the most vulnerable in our population.   Such measures included the creation of short-term employment programmes  the suspension of import duties and other taxes on basic consumer items  the establishment of controls on retail markups and profit margins on some basic food items  and the provision of limited price subsidies on basic commodities to vulnerable groups.    10-54965 48   In its strategic response to the crisis and in laying the foundation for growth  the Government of Saint Lucia has undertaken the development of a medium-term development strategy plan for the period 2011-2016. The plan will lay the blueprint for the development of emerging new sources of growth  such as offshore education  health and wellness tourism  and high–end information and communications technology  and for expanding existing critical sectors  such as tourism  agriculture and manufacturing.  The signing of the economic partnership agreement with the European Union in 2008  the implementation of the CARICOM Single Market and Economy and the Economic Union of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States will bring new sets of challenges and opportunities for Saint Lucia. The Government’s strategic priority is to develop meaningful partnerships with the private sector to meet the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities provided. The capacity of the private sector will be strengthened to take advantage of the opportunities presented by such trading arrangements.   However  the Government recognizes that this will require a host of general improvements in the business environment  including strengthening the investment climate  expanding the skills base  promoting innovation and technology adoption  and improving international transport services and other infrastructure. All those will require large capital outlays.  While the Government has responded to the challenges by developing specific programmes and projects to improve the business climate in Saint Lucia  the role of international financial institutions and bodies like the Group of 20 in stabilizing the global economy and restoring growth is crucial to small developing countries like Saint Lucia. As the focus of the global recovery efforts is aimed at laying the foundation for sustainable and balanced growth  Saint Lucia  through its new policy directives and programmes  is positioning itself to benefit from the growth prospects for the global economy.  In that respect  we call for a review of the United Nations delivery to SIDS  and particularly for strengthened support measures to address the vulnerabilities of all SIDS and for support within the United Nations system for a special category. Most SIDS do not get our fair share of assistance because we fall into the middle-income country category. However  being middle-income does not reduce vulnerability. There is a greater need for advocacy and a resource-mobilization role for SIDS under the Mauritius Strategy for the further implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States.  The support of the international community is therefore necessary if Saint Lucia and all other SIDS are to fulfil the goal of sustainable development and thereby improve the standards of living of their populations and meet all of the MDGs by the year 2015.  Let me now touch briefly on our moral environment. Among all the disasters we face today  we can accept some as natural occurrences  yet others are of our own making. Conflicts brought about by differences in ideology  political persuasion  religion and economic circumstance have presented challenges to global peace and security  including the many mass atrocities that the world has witnessed. Even with numerous advances in technology  education and health and an increase in material progress  the world seems to suffer from mental restlessness and discontent. We seem not to have found the formula for peacekeeping and peacemaking within nations  even after 60 years of searching.  Keeping the peace and building peace are critical components of sustainable development worldwide. But peacekeeping goes far beyond civilian conflict. We are pleased to note that there is now acceptance of the relationship between such non-traditional security issues as poverty and health  on the one hand  and conflict on the other. Maybe with that new understanding we will help find a solution.  We understand that the United Nations is incapable of solving all the world’s discordant issues and that the best solutions for conflict are home-grown. However  there are identified areas where the United Nations can realistically make a difference. Where this is the case  we need to strengthen the role of the United Nations in the promotion of peace and economic development. In this regard  and while keeping our goals realistic  we look forward to Security Council reform. We need an equitable international system and a more balanced approach to international security.  We acknowledge that States remain the principal duty-bearers and cannot abrogate their responsibility to   49 10-54965  implement policies  enact national legislation and foster an enabling environment in which human rights can be enjoyed by all. When these rights go unexercised  economic growth is stunted and development is paralysed. A key role of the United Nations is to help ensure that economic growth translates into wider enjoyment of human rights for all. Without human rights  we cannot achieve the Millennium Development Goals; we cannot achieve the advancement of humankind. When we expect the United Nations to protect human rights  we hold the same expectations of ourselves. After all  we are the United Nations.  Also integrated within the issue of human rights is human security. As Members of the United Nations  we are concerned with human life  education  longevity and social inclusion. There would be no United Nations if there were no universal concern for the well-being of the collective. Respect for human rights and the protection of human security are therefore mutually reinforcing.  Most people want peace  democracy and social equity  and we recognize the State’s inherent responsibility to provide these for its citizens. If Governments are to be successful  people must participate in formulating and implementing strategies to enhance their national authorities’ capacity to achieve these goals. However  with globalization  the ever-evolving threats that arise when one country falls to maintain the social order ricochet to affect the rest of the world. Every State requires international cooperation to preserve its own security.  We Caribbean countries take the issue of security very seriously. We suffer from an increasing incidence of crime and violence  which is compounded by relatively easy access to and use of illegal firearms. The number of gun-related homicides has jumped to unacceptable levels  and this has been aggravated by a worsened economic situation.  Another great tragedy of our times is the uncontrolled illicit drug trade. We must find solutions to both problems. We are perplexed  therefore  to see the closure of the Caribbean office of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. We call for a reassessment of that decision. We also call for a comprehensive treaty on small arms and light weapons  alongside the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Small arms and light weapons are responsible for more deaths than natural causes in some parts of the world.  In attempting to fulfil our commitments on the MDGs  we have engaged many partners  including the United States  the European Union  Canada  our Latin American neighbours  India  Japan and South Korea  to name but a few. I wish  though  to make a special appeal to this body to support the aspirations of the Republic of China on Taiwan to make its contribution to the world collaboration through membership and effective participation in the air transport and health bodies and climate change discussions  including the International Civil Aviation Organization  the World Health Organization  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and other organizations of a universal nature.   The contribution of Taiwan to countries that have sought its assistance in these areas matches that of any other  and it has helped without asking for much in return. No country should be prevented from making its contribution to humankind  for they do share the world with us and their contribution to health and environmental issues know no boundaries.   Increased concern for air safety also remains a global priority. We therefore hope that ongoing cross-Strait talks will lead to a peaceful solution. This is a long-standing problem that deserves an urgent resolution that is acceptable to all and in keeping with the Charter and principles of the United Nations  as well as the aspirations of peoples to self-development and progress.  There are some anachronisms that still persist in this world  and one is the embargo against Cuba. We have moved into a world where political uncertainty has been replaced by economic uncertainty. Yet a mechanism that was put in place to deal with a political issue remains today and is being used for economic strangulation  even as we appeal to everyone else for cooperation and understanding in other areas. We must respect the freely expressed wishes of the people of our region as well as their right to shape and chart their destiny. Our region is diverse  but our aspirations are shared. Only mutual respect will foster the relationship that is so necessary and vital to the development of our region.  Here again  permit me to make another point regarding respect. When the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled against our preferential regime on    10-54965 50  bananas  we were told that we had to comply. Now that the WTO has ruled in favour of our efforts in the services sector — I am speaking here of the favourable ruling we received on the gaming dispute referred to the WTO by Antigua and Barbuda — there is reluctance to comply. We cannot have double standards. We therefore urge all parties to agree on mutually agreed principles that govern the conduct of relations among States  large or small  in order for everyone to be treated fairly.  Our world is in crisis. We face a growing  more aggressive realm where the insatiable appetite for the world’s resources has led to the subversion of justice and humanity. The tumultuous times that we live in can be weathered only through continued and increased commitment to human development. Let us all work towards that goal and the sustainability of biodiversity and humankind."
"100",4135,"LIE",65,2010,"It is a great honour for me to speak to the Assembly today  20 years after the admission of Liechtenstein to the United Nations. Membership of the United Nations is one of the cornerstones of our foreign policy and the central platform for global diplomatic contacts. A strong United Nations  with a strong General Assembly  is a matter of self-interest to us.  It is therefore a special pleasure  Sir  to welcome you in the presidency of the Assembly. We look forward to working under your leadership. You have already shown wise leadership by placing this general debate under the broad theme of global governance  the discussion most urgently needed in the General Assembly  which is the main deliberative body of the Organization.   The very purpose of the Charter was in fact to establish a system of global governance  with the United Nations at its centre. Today  we must ask ourselves: Is the United Nations still at the centre of global governance? How does it relate to a number of other rising actors in the ever more crowded field of international relations? How can we improve global governance so that it better serves our peoples?  There can be no doubt  to our mind  that global governance can only be effective if it is truly global. That means global not only in reach  but also in participation. A system where a few make decisions that everyone else is expected to implement would be not only be unjust  but also ineffective. Past experience has shown time and again that multilateral action can be very effective when it is based on a broad political consensus  which is not the same as giving everyone a right to veto.  A strong fundamental agreement among States is the only way to ensure that decisions are effectively put into practice. The place where such decisions are possible  where genuine political consensus can be forged  is and remains the United Nations. We therefore have to invest in the United Nations to make the improvements that are required  instead of looking for solutions outside.  It is with this general philosophy in mind that we view efforts by different groupings  most prominently the Group of 20  to discuss questions of global reach. We certainly welcome the fact that the largest developed nations and the most powerful emerging Powers gather to discuss matters that affect the global economic and financial architecture.   The recent crisis has illustrated how important — indeed  indispensable — common action by the Group of 20 in such situations can be. And more is to be done to address the systemic issues that led to the crisis in the first place. We will continue to support those activities. At the same time  inclusion and participation should be placed higher on the Group’s agenda  and its work should be better integrated with that of the United Nations system. The quality of the discussions within the Group of 20 and the effectiveness of their outcomes would greatly benefit from an approach based on “variable geometry” — bringing in the views of all those who are directly affected by the subject matter under consideration.   We are therefore an active member of the Global Governance Group  coordinated by Singapore  which seeks to promote the principles of inclusion and participation. We are grateful to the hosts of the next two Group of 20 summits  Korea and France  for their constructive exchange with Global Governance Group   5 10-55276  Ministers yesterday here in New York. We look forward to continuing this dialogue.  We welcome the work of the Group of 20 and other groupings that seek to contribute to global solutions. At the same time  they can only deal with a limited number of issues. And  more importantly  they can never be a substitute for genuine multilateralism  which must continue to take place inside the United Nations. But we can only safeguard this central place of the United Nations if we can put it to use to find effective solutions to problems such as climate change  disarmament and other areas where results have been insufficient. If we continue to underachieve in the United Nations framework  we must not be surprised if solutions are sought elsewhere.  The United Nations continues to be the centre of global governance in the area of peace and security  the domain of the Security Council. The Council has the power to make decisions that are binding upon Member States  including on the use of force. This is the strongest tool available in international law. Yet its effectiveness is increasingly undermined by the perception that decisions of the Council lack the required political legitimacy.   A central ingredient of that perception is the Council’s composition. Everybody agrees that it no longer reflects today’s geopolitical realities. And yet an agreement to change it has been elusive for well over a decade. We believe that there could be a middle ground in the negotiations: the creation of a new category of seats allowing States to serve permanently on the Council  if the wider membership elects them to do so  on a recurrent basis. It seems to us the only logical approach towards a compromise  given the various positions around the table.   But the principal question may well be one of timing. If States increasingly believe that the Security Council can only be reformed in a climate of serious institutional crisis  a view with which we disagree  then we must reconsider the wisdom of trying to find a negotiated solution at this time.  Of no less importance for the legitimacy of the Council’s work is the way in which it arrives at its decisions. Addressing the way in which the Council conducts its work is one of the biggest governance challenges we face in the United Nations system. If the Council is indeed to carry out its functions on behalf of the entire membership  as mandated by the Charter  it must be ready to listen to those it represents — especially when they are directly affected by its work.  The group of small five countries  of which we are a member  has over the last few years initiated a process of reflection and gradual improvements that is very much in the interests of the Council itself. We look forward to continuing this process  with both the permanent and the elected members of the Council.  The role of the United Nations in global governance depends not only on the performance of its intergovernmental organs  but to a great degree also on the performance of the Secretariat. This is an enormous responsibility on the shoulders of all our international civil servants  especially the Secretary-General himself.   We saw a few years ago how much damage this Organization can suffer from management failures and system breakdowns in the areas of procurement and accountability. A number of important reforms have been undertaken since. Most notably  we have strengthened internal oversight and accountability. But can we be confident that we have now appropriately managed the risk of another system breakdown in the future? Clearly  more needs to be done in this area  in particular to fully implement some of the management reform measures already taken.  The strongest emerging tool in our system of global governance is the dimension of justice. We have made tremendous normative and institutional progress in this area in the recent past. At the same time  we are struggling with the challenge to reconcile peace and justice in particular. How can we balance the dignity of victims and the justice owed to them with the likelihood of preventing further crimes? That is a choice nobody will want to face.  But experience shows that there is no contradiction between peace and justice over the long run. And there is a broad international consensus that there can be no impunity for the worst crimes under international law  and therefore no amnesties.   Given the massive crimes committed against civilian populations all over the world  this common stance against impunity is more important than ever. It is embodied by the International Criminal Court  whose effects are felt across the globe. Most important  though  it is also leading States to make greater efforts to fulfil their obligations to investigate and prosecute domestically. These are developments of truly historic dimensions.     10-55276 6   We are only at the beginning of our efforts to integrate the justice dimension into our overall governance structure. This integration will not be a quick or easy process. But we must not shy away from these discussions  and we have to approach them with both an open mind and a determination to stand firmly on the principle of fighting impunity.  The challenges in global governance are numerous and interlinked. The governance architecture reflected in the Charter gives us the possibility of addressing them. It is up to us to make the necessary political investments to make this system work for our peoples."
"101",4182,"LKA",65,2010,"I have great pleasure in congratulating His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I also take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  His Excellency    10-54827 22  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  for his effective stewardship of the General Assembly.  That the United Nations is now in its sixty-fifth year serves to underline the durability of this Organization. It is an important mechanism in ensuring cooperation between States and a forum for discussion between sovereign nations. We must never underestimate the importance of this Organization  based as it is on the principle of equal treatment of countries big and small.  It is in this spirit that I address the Assembly at a crucial juncture in the history of my own country. In two months  I will be assuming office for my second term. My mandate will be very different from my last one. For my second term as President  my promise to my people is to deliver sustainable peace and prosperity to all and to ensure that terrorism will not be able to raise its ugly head again.  In 2005  I was elected by my people on a promise to rid my country of the menace of terrorism. I say that Sri Lanka is now at peace: peace that was only a dream a few years ago. Over the past year  much has been reported and much has been said regarding my country’s liberation from terrorism. However  far less has been said of the suffering we had to undergo and the true nature of the enemy we have overcome.  The rapidly forgotten truth is that we had to face one of the most brutal  highly organized  well funded and most effective of terrorist organizations  one that could even spread its tentacles to other countries. Many of the atrocities of terrorism that the West has come to experience in recent times  the people of Sri Lanka were themselves the victims of for nearly 30 years  losing almost 100 000 lives  among them a President of Sri Lanka  a visionary leader of India and scores of intellectuals and politicians. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) was an organization so brutal that even those it claimed to represent  the Tamil community of Sri Lanka  were as much victims of its terror as the rest of the population of our country. Those who observed from afar and suggested that the Sri Lankan Government should have conceded to the demands of the terrorists need to be reminded that terror is terror  whatever mask it wears and however it is packaged. To all those  I say this: My responsibility is to the entire nation. My responsibility is to the lives of millions of men  women and children  and those yet to be born. My responsibility is to the peace and prosperity of the nation and the right to a peaceful life for all who live there.  In this context  it is worth examining the capacity of current international humanitarian law to meet contemporary needs. It must be remembered that such law evolved essentially in response to conflicts waged by the forces of legally constituted States  and not terrorist groups. The asymmetrical nature of conflicts initiated by non-State actors gives rise to serious problems which need to be considered in earnest by the international community.  As we close a sad chapter in our country’s history  I would like to remind the Assembly that we  along with many others  made repeated attempts to engage the LTTE in constructive dialogue. I still believe that dialogue is the best way to resolve any conflict. It is much to be regretted that all these attempts were rejected with reckless arrogance and contempt. It was in those circumstances that we were compelled to mount a humanitarian operation  with the blessing of many international friends  to neutralize acts of terrorism and restore peace and security.  The entire focus of our nation is now on building a lasting peace  healing wounds  ensuring economic prosperity and guaranteeing the right of the whole nation to live in harmony. We are mindful that in order to fulfil these aspirations  economic development and political reconciliation must go hand in hand. Towards this end  constitutional changes which appropriately reflect the aspirations of our people will be evolved with the full participation of all stakeholders.  We are pursuing a nationwide agenda of renewal. Sri Lanka has already returned over 90 per cent of the internally displaced persons to their original villages  which were previously riddled with landmines  and has provided the essential infrastructure necessary for them to resume normal life. We have helped bring back the vitality of youth to former child soldiers. We have rebuilt the eastern province and have begun the same task in the north. Sri Lanka’s armed forces now have the role of delivering essential services  rebuilding homes  clearing mines and restoring vital infrastructure to whole tracts of formerly decimated land.  Despite the lingering dangers that have remained  Sri Lanka has nevertheless repealed a substantial part of the emergency regulations that were so necessary during our conflict situation and plans to repeal a good part of the remainder in the coming months.   23 10-54827   A great deal has been said by those beyond our borders about our Tamil community. Let me be clear: no nation on Earth can wish Sri Lanka’s Tamil community more good fortune than Sri Lanka itself. To the misguided few  I say do not allow yourselves to become an instrument of division  hate and violence  to be used as an enabler for hatred to be reborn in another form. Rather  come  let us join together and break the bonds of mistrust to rise to meet new horizons.  Sri Lanka recognizes the challenges we face  among the greatest of which is healing the wounds of the recent past. To that end  earlier this year  a lessons learned and reconciliation commission was established  which gives full expression to the principles of accountability. This independent commission  comprising eight Sri Lankans of eminence and stature  has already begun its work. Recently  the commission handed over to me an interim communication recommending certain administrative steps that may need to be taken in the reconciliation process.  We believe that for the rebuilding and healing of our nation to succeed  the process must evolve from within. If history has taught us one thing  it is that imposed external solutions breed resentment and ultimately fail. Ours  by contrast  is a home-grown process which reflects the culture and traditions of our people.  We certainly welcome the support of the international community as we rebuild our land and our economy. We sincerely hope that its members will be prepared to take a practical approach to developing partnerships with Sri Lanka through international trade  investment and capacity- building.  Our economy is well on the way to realizing the dividend of peace. We are experiencing steady and sustained growth  including during the last quarter  of over 8 per cent  moderate inflation and low interest rates. During the past five years  we saw our per capita income double. It is our ambition to take this further  to double yet again the present per capita income by 2016 and also to become one of the top 30 countries in which to do business by 2014.  “Mahinda Chinthana — Vision for the Future”  my election manifesto  articulates my vision of having sound infrastructure at the national  provincial and rural levels  which is vital for the inclusive growth that will make development meaningful to the whole of society. I can also proudly claim that my country  through this economic strategy  is comfortably realizing the Millennium Development Goals well in advance of the target set by the United Nations. We are at present strongly focusing on putting in place the necessary public infrastructure while strengthening the enabling policy environment for the private sector to invest even more in my country.  In order to achieve the full realization of our potential  we desire a supportive external environment. To that end  we will always seek constructive engagement and partnerships. For our part  we will continue to contribute  as we have always done  to the cause of multilateralism and a principled global order. In this regard  I am happy to note that 2010 marks the fiftieth anniversary of our first contribution to a United Nations peacekeeping mission. Our armed forces and police are today combat-tested  with the capacity to carry out their duties in the most challenging of conditions.   The world as never before in the past has become severely vulnerable to natural disasters. Almost every day we see millions of people becoming victims of severe floods  landslides  volcanoes  cyclones  earthquakes and the like. It has become increasingly difficult for affected countries to manage post-disaster recovery programmes unassisted. The recent natural calamities in our region underline the crucial need for effective action in which there is collective participation to reduce human suffering. Without doubt  climate change and global warming are today issues which demand the urgent attention of all nations.  Among the political issues that have continued to fester for too long is the continued denial of the right of the Palestinian people to a State of their own within recognized and secure borders. It is the fervent hope of the people of Sri Lanka that this most tragic of situations will be resolved without delay and in a sustainable manner. We also hope that Palestine will be a Member of the Organization by this time next year.  Our guiding principle must always be that of mutual respect in international discourse  even as we disapprove of and condemn measures such as unilateral embargoes. Experience in the recent past amply demonstrates that these embargoes have an impact not on Governments  but rather on the most vulnerable sectors of the community. In the same spirit  I would call for the empathy of the international community towards the aspirations of the Cuban people.    10-54827 24   I also wish to urge with all the emphasis at my command the need for greater concern and involvement on the part of the international community to assist the people of Africa in their efforts to raise the quality of life on their continent.  Leaders who have been chosen by their people often face difficult decisions. They must be entitled to the good will and confidence of the international community with regard to the heavy burdens they are required to shoulder. The results of their decisions must be evaluated objectively and they must be allowed to speak for themselves.  That is not to say countries should operate in isolation. In this globally interdependent world  we must work together where we can and constructively counsel each other where appropriate. The United Nations forms the bedrock of this interaction  and in that role it will always receive the support of Sri Lanka."
"102",4224,"LSO",65,2010,"Allow me  Sir  to congratulate you on your well-deserved election to the office of President at the sixty-fifth session of the    10-55122 24  General Assembly. Your career as a leader and diplomat speaks for itself. I assure you of my delegation’s support during your tenure of office. I should also commend your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  for a job well done.  The choice of theme for this session of the General Assembly  namely  reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance  is not only apt but inspired. The founding of the United Nations was propelled by the determination to save future generations from the scourge of war. It was driven by the desire to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  the rule of law and  not least  to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.  For the past 65 years  this Assembly of nations has been convening here every year in pursuit of the lofty ideals of the United Nations. Yet for 65 years  the achievement of these ideals has eluded us. Unilateralism and war remain the order of the day. Disrespect for international law  vast economic inequities  injustice and suppression of basic freedoms are the challenges we face today  just as we did 65 years ago. In addition  we have climate change  financial and economic crises  terrorism and religious intolerance to contend with. Needless to mention  such challenges have heightened threats to world stability and international peace and security.  Let the events of the first decade of this millennium be a lesson for all of us to learn and treasure. We have learned a lesson in the futility of unilateralism  intolerance and war; that selfishness in world relations is suicidal. We have learned a lesson in the value of collective decision-making and inclusive development  if our planet and its inhabitants are to survive. These lessons say to us that mankind must turn away from the path of self-destruction. The route to peace and stability is clear to all of us  yet we continue to lose ourselves in the wilderness of instability and poverty  because we are blinded by ulterior motives.  If we value the lessons of the past decade  we must accept that war is brutal  destructive and unacceptable. The founding fathers of the United Nations were right when they affirmed the centrality of the United Nations in global decision-making and governance. We must admit that great injustices are being committed during our times and that human rights are being trampled upon as we stand by silently.  In this regard  for decades now  the people of Western Sahara  Cuba and Palestine have been calling on this august body for help in reversing the injustices  humiliation and atrocities that are visited upon them by colonialism  unilateral economic blockades and brutal occupation. Even today  the people of these territories are still calling. They are calling to you. Will you listen and respond  or will you look or walk away? Surely we cannot condone injustice and yet hope for peace. Sustainable peace can only be based on justice and the protection of basic freedoms for all.  By the same token  Zimbabwe must be freed from unilateral sanctions  as her people work together under the unity Government to determine their own future under the leadership of their own choice. In addition  external interests must not be allowed to take precedence over the desire of the people of Madagascar for democracy and stability in their country.  Somalia is a festering wound on the African continent. Let us rise to the appeal that was made by the President of the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia to the Assembly a few days ago. He urged us to assist the people of Somalia to join the international movement for the achievement of peace  the rule of law and the Millennium Development Goals (see ).  Planet Earth is the only world in which we can live in shared prosperity and peace. In the wake of the devastating effects of climate change  we all converged in Copenhagen with optimism  but left with mixed feelings following lack of international consensus and the necessary political will. In the meantime  climate change continues to wreak havoc  particularly in those vulnerable developing countries that do not have the means to adapt to or mitigate the impacts of global warming. Lesotho signed the Copenhagen Accord because we believed that it represented a step forward  even though it did not fully satisfy our aspirations. It is our hope that  the forthcoming Conference in Cancún  Mexico  will achieve international consensus  leading to a legally binding regime on the management of climate change.  The just-ended High-level Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals confirmed to us that the recent economic and financial downturn has disrupted our strategies for achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Despite this fact  we appeal to our development partners to fulfil their   25 10-55122  official development assistance commitments to help accelerate our progress in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  The world is still grappling with terrorism. For as long as this menace exists  there will not be peace on Earth. Terrorism knows no boundaries and does not respect human life. There is neither a country nor an individual who can claim immunity from terrorism. Terrorist groups are benefiting from globalization by decentralizing their operations  building new partnerships with armed groups  and using advanced technology to further their cause. This menace will not be eradicated until we address the root causes  not the symptoms  of terrorism.  Religious intolerance is closely related to terrorism. We must acknowledge that religious tolerance is a prerequisite to international peace and stability  and that the world’s diversity of cultures and religions must be respected and tolerated  as it represents the strength and collective heritage of humankind. Cultivation of the culture of religious tolerance must be inscribed high on the agenda of the international community.  One of the fundamental conditions for maintaining international peace and security is our commitment to the disarmament and non-proliferation agenda. More than six decades after the founding of the United Nations  disarmament sadly remains a major challenge for the international community. Today we see a steadily growing list of de facto nuclear-weapon States. Proliferation of the weapons of mass destruction must stop. So must the development of new generations of nuclear weapons by nuclear-capable States. We must strive for a nuclear-weapon-free world. It is the responsibility of those States to stop threatening the use of nuclear weapons as an option in the pursuit of their foreign policy interests. Lesotho will continue to join hands with all peace-loving nations to support international disarmament and non-proliferation regimes.  While the international community has registered some successes in consolidating peace in some parts of the world  a significantly large number of conflicts remain unresolved. Some of these conflicts are in Africa. As African leaders  we purposefully declared 2010 as the Year of Peace and Security in Africa. We resolved to find African solutions to African problems. However  we have acknowledged our shortcomings in terms of capacity in peacekeeping and peacebuilding. Consequently  we look to the international community to complement our efforts and resources in this regard. Conflict-affected countries must also have the necessary political will to accommodate and facilitate legitimate external intervention that is intended to resolve conflict. At the same time  they must not abandon their primary responsibility as Governments to protect all their citizens.  In conclusion  it is my considered view that all these challenges can be overcome  if we accept that the United Nations is a place where a better and more secure life for humankind must be championed. But its structures should be reformed to efficiently fulfil this noble mandate. Multilateral diplomacy should supplant the traditional unilateral path in the resolution of disputes. The United Nations must not be held hostage to the desires of any single country or group of States. Its actions should reflect as wide a consensus of Member States as possible.  Let us continue to reaffirm the central role of the United Nations in global governance. Let us remember that might can never be right and can never defeat collective resolve. It is only then that collectively we shall be able to promote progress and better standards of life in larger freedom."
"103",4250,"LTU",65,2010,"I am delighted and privileged to address this Assembly. I believe that this is the right place to discuss the issues of greatest concern to the international community. Recent years have been marked by many challenges. All countries  large and small  had to tackle the financial and economic downturn. They also had to deal with the painful consequences of natural and man-created disasters. In a global world  all our countries must share responsibility for the future. The scale of our deeds and the openness of our hearts will make the difference  not the size of our countries and territories. Here  I would like to share some views of my country  Lithuania.  Let me start with our proposals in the fields of security and the environment. Lithuania has launched an initiative to introduce in the General Assembly a draft resolution on sea-dumped chemical weapons. Lithuania wants to strengthen international efforts in raising public awareness about dangerous munitions buried in the sea. It is in every country’s interest to support a voluntary information exchange in order to strengthen common security. Everyone must be aware how lethally dangerous these dumped chemicals still are. We need to have guidelines on how to behave in case of disaster. That is why United Nations involvement and an eventual resolution on this issue are so indispensable. That is why I call on the United Nations to take a much more active role in very concrete projects  even if they may not seem big enough for global attention.  Gender equality is another topic of vital importance for the nations of the world. We decided to promote it in the framework of the Community of Democracies. That is another example of precisely focused action. Gender equality issues are rarely associated with issues like overcoming the economic crisis or stopping climate change. However  it has been estimated that the elimination of gender discrimination in the labour market in Europe  for example  could increase gross domestic product by as much as 30 per cent.  It seems that the Lithuanian people have decided to test this estimate in practice  and I can give an example. It is no surprise to us that women in Lithuania hold a number of top positions in politics and business. It is only natural that Lithuanian women have made their own the famous saying: When the going gets tough  the tough get going. But we still need much more coordinated effort. Gender equality on a global scale will become possible only when a certain level of security and economic development is achieved. Let us all put all our efforts together to eradicate intolerance and discrimination  which so often are the main reasons for the many conflicts in the world. By doing this we also pave the road to achieving the Millennium Development Goals that we all aspire to. European Union activities such as the European Institute for Gender Equality  based in Lithuania  can serve to lead other regions. I strongly hope that the high-level meeting on gender equality issues which will be held within the framework of the Community of Democracies in Vilnius  Lithuania  on 30 June next year will explore many more new ideas and good practices.  Security  the environment and gender equality: all are interdependent  and all need to be adequately addressed on the international agenda. That is a    10-54833 34  prerequisite for ensuring sustainable development. The European Union has been for years the largest and most responsible donor worldwide  the best example for any country willing to contribute. These European values are very dear to my country  which has been a member of the European Union since 2004. Lithuania has limited resources  but we have provided humanitarian aid to Haiti  Pakistan  Moldova  Ukraine  Russia and other countries.  We have engaged in such difficult initiatives as the training of the national security forces of Afghanistan. Working together with the people of Ghor province in Afghanistan  Lithuania has funded a number of community-based education programmes  built 19 schools which have opened up their doors also for girls  founded the first public library in the province’s capital of Chaghcharan. That is our modest contribution  but it works. I am sure that each time we implement a concrete project we move closer to achieving our global objectives all together.  I invite all the leaders gathered here to contribute. We should welcome  support and multiply any and every constructive effort  however small it may seem to us. Only joint efforts and concrete deeds will bring positive change to international politics. Let us develop initiatives  let us implement them  let us implement the best practices and let us work together."
"104",4294,"LUX",65,2010,"The values upon which the Organization was founded  65 years ago  are still appropriate for overcoming the global challenges we face today. Whether in fighting poverty  protecting the environment and conserving biodiversity  building peace in conflict areas  helping populations affected by natural disasters  promoting human rights  the rule of law and democracy in the world  making progress towards disarmament and non-proliferation or combating terrorism  we need to work together today more than ever before.  You yourself  Mr. President  have quite rightly organized the general debate under the theme “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance”. As a founding Member of the United Nations  Luxembourg fully endorses the Secretary-General’s assessment that only the United Nations has the scope  knowledge and legitimacy necessary to develop and implement effective policies in order to address global challenges  which require urgent and collective responses. However  we cannot content ourselves with that simple article of faith. We need to draw the necessary conclusions and take responsibility for them. Those responsibilities are both individual and collective ones  especially for members of the international community and our universal Organization.  At the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals  which was held earlier this week  we reiterated our collective determination to do everything possible to free humankind from hunger  illiteracy and disease and ultimately to free the Earth of inequalities — between and within continents  regions and countries and between men and women.  Luxembourg welcomes this renewed commitment to combat poverty in its manifold dimensions. The establishment of a true partnership for development is based upon shared responsibilities for both donor and recipient countries. Although we rely on stronger action from developing countries on good governance  the rule of law  capacity-building and development ownership  developed countries must fulfil their commitments in terms of aid quality and quantity. This is a needed basis for such a partnership  particularly with regard to Africa.  I am proud to say that Luxembourg is among the countries to have kept its promises. We strive to be a reliable international partner  even in times of crisis. By 2000  Luxembourg’s official development assistance (ODA) had reached the threshold of 0.7 per cent of gross national income (GNI)  and in 2009  our ODA surpassed 1 per cent of GNI. Our Government is committed to maintaining this effort  both in terms of volume and percentage of gross national income. That effort is necessarily linked to steadily growing quality of aid.  The duty to prevent  contain and resolve violent conflict is a central aim of our Organization. The    10-54959 36  Charter calls on us to unite our forces in order to maintain international peace and security. With more than 120 000 men and women deployed  peacekeeping operations have reached an unprecedented scale in recent years. While the stabilizing role of United Nations forces is undeniable  the changing nature of conflicts and the increasing complexity of mandates have also revealed the limits of the system  structures and basic tools of our Organization.  The mass rapes and sexual assaults that took place in North Kivu this summer and the inability of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to protect civilians are stark reminders of the difficulty of maintaining peace in conflict areas in the absence of adequate resources and mandates. Those atrocities compel us to urgently continue the debate on the future of peacekeeping operations and to overcome our differences and divisions on this particular issue.  They also serve to underscore once again the importance of substantial United Nations action to eradicate the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war. In that regard  I welcome the appointment of Ms. Margot Wallström as Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. In this  the tenth anniversary year of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)  on women and peace and security  such heinous acts and flagrant violations of human rights can no longer be tolerated. Impunity must also be brought to an end.  While the primary responsibility for the safety and safety of its citizens and for combating poverty and establishing the rule of law lies within the Congolese Government  the international community must do everything possible to support that Government in its efforts to ensure that those responsible for these horrendous crimes are actively sought out  tried and punished. Combating impunity must also lead us to be far more attentive to the report on violations of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 1993 and 2003  the publication of which the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has announced for 1 October 2010.  As I said at the Review Conference of the Rome Statute  held in Kampala in May  combating impunity for the most serious crimes should not be an abstract goal any longer  but become a tangible and concrete reality. All of us must cooperate to ensure success in that regard.  Year after year  in this very forum  we express our hope to see peace established in the Middle East. We once again call for a solution based on the coexistence of two States  Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace and security. We urge the parties to assume their responsibility to create through their actions the framework for a lasting settlement of the conflict. To date  as we know  such calls have mostly been in vain.  The resumption of direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians on 2 September 2010  however  once again gives me hope that we will finally reach a final settlement that ends the occupation that began in 1967 and leads to the birth of an independent  democratic  viable and contiguous Palestinian State living in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours. I genuinely hope that the call by President Obama to work to achieve a Palestinian State in 2011 will become a reality.  However  we must not be distracted by the enemies of peace and those who seek to sabotage peace talks. It will be important for both parties to show determination  courage  calm and restraint  and to act solely according to international law. Hence the importance of ending all settlement activities. They are illegal  contrary to international law and clearly constitute an obstacle to peace. Why is that so? While the material fact of building on another person’s land is in itself to be condemned  it is also a symbol of domination and humiliation that cannot be accepted. As a European  I am heartened that the European Union persists in its strong unanimous call for a prolongation of the moratorium beyond next Sunday  26 September 2010. President Obama’s position is clearly and unambiguously along the same lines.  Meanwhile  it will be of paramount importance to find a lasting solution for the situation in Gaza and to revive its economy. The blockade continues. I hope that the calls by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East will at last be heard. In that context  I welcome the launching by the Secretary-General of an international investigation into last May’s incident involving the aid flotilla en route to Gaza. A full  honest  impartial  balanced and transparent investigation consistent with   37 10-54959  international standards is of great importance. It also  of course  entails the credibility of our Organization.  In the Sudan  the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement is entering its final phase with the referendum on the self-determination of Southern Sudan and Abyei. After more than two decades of confrontation  the prospects for a settlement are taking shape at last. The road ahead nevertheless remains fraught with difficulties. It is our collective responsibility to help the Sudan steer through this critical period and carry out a process that at last leads to lasting peace for its people. We must ensure that the elections are conducted in a transparent and peaceful manner  regardless  of course  of the outcome.  Increased efforts are also needed to support the current initiatives of the African Union and the United Nations towards a political solution involving all parties in Darfur in order to address the root causes of the conflict and ensure the protection and promotion of human rights  justice and reconciliation. The continuing violence in Darfur threatens the stability of the whole of the Sudan and of the larger region.  A comprehensive approach is also needed in Somalia  a country that has for too long been synonymous with civil war and bloody conflict. Only a comprehensive approach will put an end to the terrorist threat that armed groups pose to Somalia  the subregion and the entire international community  as well as permanently eradicating piracy and establishing the rule of law in Somalia.  My country seeks to play its full effective role in the global efforts to resolve the crisis in Somalia. To that end  Luxembourg actively participates in Operation Atalanta to deter  prevent and suppress acts of piracy and armed robbery off the Somali coast  as well as in the military mission to help train security forces of the Transitional Federal Government — two operations launched by the European Union in support of Security Council decisions. Together with our European and African partners  we intend to continue our support for the Djibouti peace process and for the search for a lasting political solution.  Allow me for a moment to address another issue that I believe it is important not to overlook when discussing ways to guarantee and strengthen peace  security and stability at the international level: disarmament and non-proliferation. The success of the eighth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  held here in New York in May  brought us closer to our common goal of a world safer for all and free of nuclear weapons. It will now be important to maintain the political momentum and to ensure the full implementation of the decisions taken  including that relating to the holding by 2012 of a conference on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. I am certain that progress in this area will not remain without implications for other actors and for other issues.  In addition  as I had the opportunity to say yesterday at the ministerial meeting on revitalizing the work of the Conference on Disarmament convened by the Secretary-General  we must continue our efforts at both nuclear and conventional disarmament. The constant search for security at the lowest possible level of armaments will make an essential contribution to stability in the world.  In that regard  I welcome the entry into force  on 1 August 2010  of the Convention on Cluster Munitions  which prohibits the use  production  transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions. At the national level  Luxembourg  which was among the first countries to sign and ratify the Convention  has also prohibited the funding of cluster munitions.  The progress made towards a legally binding arms trade instrument under the auspices of the United Nations is also to be welcomed. The problems linked to the unregulated trade in conventional weapons and the diversion of those weapons into illicit markets have the potential to fuel instability  organized crime and terrorism  thereby  jeopardizing peace  security and sustainable economic and social development. Hence the importance of finally adopting a binding instrument in this field.  Next week  together with other partners  my country will hold a symposium in Boston on an arms trade treaty. All United Nations Member States have been invited to participate. We hope thereby to contribute to the discussion and consideration of this important issue.  If we believe in the relevance of a multilateral approach based on the United Nations  we must give the Organization the means to be the centre of multilateral action and a real catalyst for change. We need to push for decisive internal reforms  including  I believe  reform of the Security Council. We are all    10-54959 38  aware of the need for Council reform to make it more inclusive and more representative of today’s realities  as well as more effective and more transparent. Ensuring an adequate place for small States  which now represent the vast majority of the Organization’s Member States  is paramount in this regard.  We must review the instruments at our disposal  be it peacekeeping operations  to which I referred previously  the Peacebuilding Commission or the Human Rights Council  including the necessary integration of human rights in all aspects of United Nations action.   The Peacebuilding Commission represents a key asset for the operational capacity of the international community in the vast peace agenda. Luxembourg fully supports the philosophy behind the Commission and is actively involved in the Guinea-Bissau configuration. The Commission has begun to prove its usefulness. However  we should consider how we can make its results more tangible at the country level in order to allow other countries to benefit from its achievements and face emerging challenges. Our goals must meet the expectations of post-conflict societies and peoples. In that regard  I welcome the recent decision to include Liberia on the Commission’s agenda.  We also need to overcome the systemic fragmentation that has gradually developed since the establishment of the Organization and enhance system-wide coherence. An important step in that direction was taken this year with the establishment of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). I would like to warmly welcome the appointment of Ms. Michelle Bachelet as head of UN Women. I have no doubt that   she will demonstrate a dynamic and unwavering commitment to serve women and girls worldwide. She will be able to rely on the full support of my country  which has for many years pursued an integrated gender approach and an active policy of promoting gender equality  including in the area of development cooperation.  As you rightly pointed out  Sir  when you were elected to the presidency on 11 June (see A/64/PV.93)  our primary task is to work together to find constructive solutions for the dignity  safety and security and well-being of all. My country is ready to continue to play its part at the national level  but also as a member of the European Union. The willingness of Luxembourg to assume its national responsibilities can be seen in the concrete examples that I have just given. It is also expressed in our bid for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council for the period 2013 to 2014.  The commitment of Luxembourg is also a European one  as I have just said. By strengthening its capabilities and the increased synergy of its instruments following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty  the European Union is now more than ever ready to be an active  effective and supportive actor for the United Nations in all areas in which the Organization is active. The European Union wants to be such an active and supportive partner. Hence the importance we attach to a resolution regulating the effective participation of the European Union in the work of our Organization. It is only together in the United Nations that we can help build a better future for all. "
"105",4320,"LVA",65,2010,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Deiss on assuming the post of President of the General Assembly at the current session. I pledge him Latvia’s full support.  Sixty-five years ago  the United Nations was created on the ashes of the bloodiest war in the history of mankind as an international forum where all nations meet as equals  willing to address international challenges and to prevent the scourge of war. Since then it has become the most broadly representative body of nations focused on promoting security  peace and prosperity all over the world.  This year also marks the twentieth anniversary of Latvia’s freedom  regained after 50 years of Soviet occupation  oppression and injustice. Latvia’s story shows that the values enshrined in the Charter are universal and  with the people’s persistence and common vision  can come alive  even if it takes decades. It also shows that it is possible to overcome even the deepest of divisions. It shows that  while honouring our history  we can extend a hand of cooperation and look into the future with hope.  There are many global issues that need our real attention and require urgent action. Just a few days ago we renewed our commitment to development at the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). While important improvements have been made globally  progress towards achieving the MDGs by 2015 has not been sufficient. If we are serious about achieving the Millennium Development Goals  we need to show commitment and action.  A new consciousness is emerging from the awareness of the negative impact of climate change. Climate change is a fact. We are witnessing a rising number of storms  excessive rainfall and atypical temperatures  which lead to flooding  forest fires and crop failures. All those disasters have an immense material cost and claim people’s lives  and therefore they should be treated as a serious security threat. The response must be twofold. We have to adapt to the changes already in place and to those we will face in the coming decades. And most importantly  we have to work on preventive measures  such as the reduction of emissions.  We have a road ahead of us on the issue of climate change  and every country has to contribute if our actions on it are to be successful. Within the framework of the Copenhagen Accord  Latvia  among other European Union member States  is providing assistance that  along with financial contributions from other key players  helps developing countries fight climate change. We must make the next step in Cancún. We have to agree on global action to address climate change. The future of the next generation is at stake.  While we are working for long-term goals  we also have to address immediate crises wherever they occur. The international community  with the United Nations in the leading role  has been addressing humanitarian needs following the devastating flooding in Pakistan  which has affected more than 14 million people. This year we also witnessed a terrible earthquake in Haiti. Latvia  despite its economic challenges  was able to respond to those international emergency humanitarian needs  both through the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund and through additional pledges of €150 000 for Haiti’s recovery. We will continue to help countries affected by such tragic disasters.  Latvia has always supported the strengthening of the United Nations as the only truly global international organization. However  in a time of globalization and rapid development  the need for reform is an inevitable reality. We must therefore continuously seek maximum effectiveness and efficiency in the work of the United Nations in order to deliver results worthy of this Organization. A Security Council that reflects the realities of the twenty-first century would be a significant step towards a more effective United Nations. We sincerely hope for a faster pace for the reform process.  We commend the work of the United Nations in the promotion of gender equality and welcome the creation of a unified gender entity. I would like to congratulate the new head of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women  the former Chilean President Mrs. Michelle Bachelet  on her appointment and to wish her every success in that highly important post.    37 10-54965   This fall we also mark the tenth anniversary of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security. We see it as an opportunity to review implementation of the resolution with a view to identifying best practices and challenges  particularly regarding equal participation of women in decision-making and the eradication of all types of gender-based violence  especially in conflict situations.  At this session we have a very important task ahead of us: reviewing the work of the Human Rights Council. The Council has already shown itself capable of addressing many human rights situations and of advancing human rights. I particularly wish to highlight the independent work of the special procedures and the establishment of the universal periodic review mechanism. However  improvements are still necessary. I am confident that with goodwill  and with participation and input from all of us  the review process will lead to a strengthened institution with increased credibility and greater impact on the improvement of human rights.   Latvia has always placed the promotion of human rights among its top priorities. We have therefore put forward our candidacy for the Human Rights Council for the year 2014.  The role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security is irreplaceable. We must continue to work with all the means at our disposal to create a more stable world. Latvia appreciates the positive momentum that was created at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference earlier this year. Stabilizing and strengthening a nuclear non-proliferation regime is a shared responsibility of all United Nations Members. As a member of the international community  Latvia expresses the hope that every diplomatic opportunity will be used to find a comprehensive long-term solution to the Iranian and North Korean nuclear issues.  The New START treaty between the United States and Russian Federation sets a powerful and remarkable example of real steps to reduce the threat of strategic arms and to engage other Powers in fulfilling the goals of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Latvia firmly supports the nuclear security discussion initiated by President Obama. Promising signs on the international agenda have positively influenced European security and fostered the debate on conventional regimes in Europe. An ambitious road map is before us  and together we should all move forward to strengthen security around the world.  Stability and security in a number of regions remain on the international agenda. In the Middle East  the international community must encourage the parties to move towards real compromises leading to a comprehensive settlement of the conflict. Common efforts of the international community  including the Quartet  and the unity of Arab States are decisive to ensure continuation of the peace process with a very clear final aim of establishing an independent  democratic and viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace with the State of Israel.  We welcome the launch of direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority and commend all involved partners for their efforts. Sustainable and durable solutions for Gaza  Palestinian reconciliation  and extension of the settlement moratorium are crucial for the Palestinian State-building process. We sincerely hope that the talks will continue in a constructive manner and be supplemented by negotiations on the Israel-Syria and Israel-Lebanon tracks towards comprehensive peace and stability in the Middle East.  A week ago the people of Afghanistan voted for their new parliament. The elections showed that the Afghanis are determined to build a peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace with its neighbours. We commend the work done by the Independent Electoral Commission. The elections were conducted in a difficult security and political environment. It is of the highest importance that the Government of Afghanistan corrects the irregularities caused by the harsh environment.   The international community plays a substantial role in coordinating civilian efforts in Afghanistan. The work of the Secretary-General’s Special Representative must be commended. The recently released Mid Year Report 2010 Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict is worrisome and shows how much work remains to be done to improve the situation.   To be successful in Afghanistan  one should not forget the regional aspect of the issue. Stability in Central Asia is an important factor for success in Afghanistan.     10-54965 38   We are satisfied to see that the Kabul process is under way and that the Government of Afghanistan is resolved to act in order to regain the trust of the Afghan people and to align the support of the international community behind the goals of national development. A well-coordinated effort is necessary to follow up the Kabul commitments so that in 2014 the Government of Afghanistan will be able to take full responsibility for the governance of the country. Latvia is therefore putting more emphasis on training Afghan security forces  both army and police. In June  Latvia carried out a training project for Afghan police officers in the field of criminal investigation.   Another important task is to foster Afghanistan’s economic and social development. Regional cooperation can be very useful in that effort  especially with regard to energy and transport infrastructure. Latvia envisions multiple transport corridors connecting Afghanistan to the neighbouring region  as well as to Europe.  I would like to refer to the European Union as an important partner of the United Nations. The United Nations and the European Union share the same fundamental values — freedom  democracy  rule of law  human rights  equality and tolerance. It is our duty to work together to ensure that those values are not just words but something to be enjoyed daily by everybody.  The European Union has been changed through the Lisbon Treaty. We hope that that change will give the European Union a clearer voice in relations with our partners  including the United Nations. I hope that agreement will soon be reached to ensure the European Union’s effective participation in the work of the General Assembly.  Finally  I would like to touch on the economic slowdown in the global economy during the past couple of years. Latvia was one of the countries hit hardest by the crisis. Now Latvia’s economy is showing signs of recovery. We have seen positive trends in macroeconomic indicators since the beginning of the year. We are on the way up.  The reason for our recovery is the tough fiscal adjustment that Latvia has demonstrated since 2008. I am certain that other countries will need to go through considerable budgetary consolidation soon. Our experience shows that it is possible  but only with the full understanding and support of the population. Latvia has carried out large-scale reforms  and we are ready to share our experience. That is one of the reasons why Latvia has put forward its candidature in this year’s elections to the Economic and Social Council.  Prudence will be a key element to prevent future economic crises  but not the only one. Global financial governance will be another such element. Latvia commends the role and leadership shown by the Group of Twenty (G-20) countries. Financial governance should be global  and we highly value the initiatives put forward towards that end by the G-20  international financial institutions and other forums.  The world is entering the second decade of the twenty-first century  and there are challenges to security  peace and prosperity. They can be met only by a common effort and the unity of mankind. I wish us all the wisdom and courage to maintain the higher interest in the common good. Latvia looks forward to a fruitful sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly."
"106",4367,"MAR",65,2010,"His Majesty Mohammed VI  the King of Morocco  has honoured me by asking me to deliver his statement to the General Assembly.   “Allow me  at the outset  to congratulate you  Mr. President  on being elected to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session  and to commend your predecessor  Mr. Ali Treki  on having given fresh dynamism to the proceedings of the Assembly. I would also like to express my deep appreciation to His Excellency the Secretary-General  who spares no effort to enhance the role of the United Nations.   “This session  which is being held 10 years after the Millennium Summit  is a great opportunity for us to agree on a consensual vision to steer our joint action for the years to come and to reiterate our commitment to the three basic axes underlying that vision  namely  security and stability  development and prosperity  and advancement of human rights and human dignity. Those priorities form the bedrock of the new international agenda. This important meeting therefore provides us a good opportunity to reassert our commitment to tackling those priorities and to reiterate our determination to promote international cooperation and lay solid groundwork for a new world where safety and solidarity prevail.   “Morocco  which firmly believes in the important position of the United Nations as the symbol of universal values and international legitimacy  has worked tirelessly to give the Organization active and concrete support  to promote its principles and to contribute to the achievement of its objectives. Indeed  my country has also actively sought to ensure that its national priorities are in line with issues on the international agenda.   “Peacekeeping was the main objective behind the creation of the United Nations  which is playing a key role for all mankind. From this rostrum  the Kingdom of Morocco calls on the international community to increase its involvement and work for the settlement of all disputes — whether overt or covert — that strain    10-55122 32  relations between neighbouring States and hamper the indispensable integration of their economies  particularly in Africa.   “To foster healthier relations in our Maghreb region  we submitted an autonomy initiative to the United Nations in 2007 with a view to bringing an end to the artificial dispute over the recovery by Morocco of its southern provinces. That bold  innovative initiative has received the support of the international community and the Security Council  which have repeatedly described the efforts underlying it as serious and credible. They have also commended Morocco’s active steps to facilitate the settlement of this dispute  which seriously jeopardizes the integration of the Arab Maghreb and the prosperity of the peoples of its five countries.   “In that context  the Kingdom of Morocco calls on the other partners to seize this historic opportunity and engage in substantive and serious negotiations under the auspices of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy  to whom we reiterate our sincere willingness to cooperate.   “The need to free our region from the yoke of this dispute  which hampers our joint action  has never been greater  not only for us  but also for our strategic partners. We must therefore settle this dispute  given the numerous pressing challenges facing us  especially with respect to security in the Sahara and Sahel regions and in the Mediterranean basin.   “Achieving peace in the Middle East is not an impossible goal  nor is the persistence of the conflict inevitable. The only solution to the conflict remains that of two States  living side by side in peace and security.   “The international community is therefore called upon to support the direct negotiation process taking place under the commendable auspices of the United States Administration. This is a good opportunity to strive to achieve a final settlement  in compliance with international legitimacy and the relevant United Nations resolutions and on the basis of a clear frame of reference  a comprehensive agenda and a specific timetable.   “As an active player in the peace process  Morocco is aware that such negotiations must address the issue of establishing a fully sovereign Palestinian State  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital  as well as the related and complex issues  and that for negotiations to succeed  unilateral actions must be avoided and settlement building must end  especially in Al-Quds Al-Sharif.   “As Chair of the Al-Quds Committee  I have consistently drawn the attention of the United Nations and of the international community to the sensitive nature of the issue of Al-Quds Al-Sharif and to attempts to Judaize that Holy City and obliterate its character. Al-Quds must remain a symbol of coexistence and concord between the monotheistic religions  a city of peace and of coexistence between the Palestinian and the Israeli peoples.  “Two days ago  we took stock of the progress that has thus far been made in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. We agreed that a combination of crises  including the adverse effects of climate change  has clearly delayed the attainment of most of these Goals in many developing countries  particularly on our African continent.  “With a population of more than 900 million people and natural resources abundant enough to ensure the continent’s self-sufficiency  Africa is indeed capable of enjoying steady growth and development. This potential notwithstanding  Africa largely remains on the sidelines when it comes to foreign direct investment flows  a trend which has been compounded further by the global economic and financial crisis. The Kingdom of Morocco therefore proposes that the General Assembly hold a high-level dialogue on investment in Africa.  “Similarly  the magnitude of the challenges posed by globalization requires from the international community urgent  substantial reforms of the existing international economic governance institutions as well as further mobilization to lay the foundations for a new  equitable  balanced and efficient international environmental order that will enable us to   33 10-55122  safeguard our planet for the sake of current and future generations.  “The Kingdom of Morocco has committed itself irreversibly to protect and promote human rights. To this end  it will implement a comprehensive strategy based on a participatory approach which places special emphasis on human resources development and the promise of a dignified life  these being the key elements in our endeavour to build a democratic society dedicated to development.  “Accordingly  Morocco has launched a programme of major workshops and reforms. Substantial progress has been made towards expanding the scope of individual and collective freedoms  safeguarding human dignity and promoting and protecting the rights of its citizens  especially those of women  children and people with special needs.  “Internationally  Morocco has manifested a deep commitment to protecting human rights since the establishment of the Human Rights Council and its operational mechanisms. This commitment was recognized in March 2010  when Morocco was chosen by the General Assembly to be a co-facilitator of the review process aimed at charting a renewed vision for the Council by putting human capital at the heart of human resources development and sustainable development.  “Morocco will spare no effort to achieve this goal and to help develop a shared  responsible vision of the true values of human rights  a vision which excludes empty slogans and the tendentious manipulation of lofty objectives.  “The world still has a long way to go before States and peoples learn to accept diversity and make it a genuine source of spiritual  social and cultural enrichment. More than a necessity  dialogue among civilizations has become an urgent priority.  “Indeed  it is of the utmost importance that the United Nations become the standard-bearer of a culture of peace  tolerance and mutual understanding and that it serve as a catalyst for a new form of cooperation based on solidarity and dedicated to achieving dignity  prosperity  well-being and peace for all people everywhere.”  "
"107",4391,"MCO",65,2010,"I would like to convey to you  Sir  the warmest congratulations of the delegation of the Principality of Monaco on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I would like to reiterate to you that  in my capacity as a member of the Bureau  I will spare no effort to contribute to the success of your mandate in the service of the Member States and the Organization.  We are preparing to begin our work on an optimistic note because of the international community’s unfailing recommitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as well as of the belief  reaffirmed in the general debate now drawing to a close  that the United Nations is at the heart of global governance and remains  despite the many difficulties  our best hope for ensuring peace  development and justice.  Economic growth  which is indispensable to development and therefore to peaceful international relations  cannot take off in the absence of well-defined and fair international rules and without respect for the rule of law at the national level. Our Organization has contributed tirelessly in recent years to strengthening the capacities of Member States to enable them to provide their citizens with the institutions necessary for them to flourish in their communities. The rule of law is also a guarantee that the fight against corruption is not just a vain promise  that respect for human rights is universal and that justice is independent and impartial.  The benefits of economic growth must be shared and equitable. They must take into account the needs of the most deprived and contribute to social cohesion with a view to attaining the MDGs and involving the full participation of all partners.  That is the thrust of Monaco’s commitment within the Global Governance Group — the 3G —   5 10-55408  whose members are convinced of the need to involve the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the work of the Group of 20 (G-20)  given relevance of the General Assembly agenda to international governance. In that regard  I draw attention to the ministerial declaration of the Global Governance Group adopted on 27 September  with a view to contributing to the reflections of the working group on the development of the next G-20 summit  in Seoul in November.  As His Serene Highness Prince Albert II recalled before the Assembly  the Principality is determined to act as a responsible partner in solidarity and will continue its mobilization efforts  both through its official development assistance as well as through the provision of emergency assistance to populations struck by natural disasters (see A/65/PV.4).  At a moment when the presence and activities of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are increasingly needed and increasingly dangerous  the cause of refugees and displaced persons must more than ever be placed in our policies and be backed unconditionally by the international community. Here we wish to express our recognition of the devotion of the thousands of people who labour under the banner of the United Nations  at times risking their lives  both in humanitarian emergency situations and in peacekeeping operations.  The role of women in driving development is now clear to all. I wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General for having strengthened the role of women within the United Nations. Monaco welcomes the appointment of Ms. Michelle Bachelet to head up UN Women and assures her of our full support.  The Principality has also endorsed the conviction that investing in the health of women and children is indispensable for building societies that are more stable  more peaceful and more productive  for reducing poverty and for stimulating economic growth. In that vein  we support the Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health  which represents an additional step towards the full empowerment of women.  As atrocities continue to be perpetrated against civilians  especially the cowardly crimes of sexual violence  we pay tribute to the courage of Special Representative Ms. Margot Wallström and her commitment to making the international community aware of its responsibility and to ensuring the effective implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) as we approach the tenth anniversary of its adoption.  With your leadership  Mr. President  and our common will  the General Assembly has the means to demonstrate its central role in the major themes for our future at a moment when we are all aware of the shameful damage caused to the planet by the overexploitation of its wealth and biodiversity. We therefore attach the greatest importance to the preparation of the Rio+20 Conference and hope that the green economy and the opportunities it affords will become a major vehicle for sustainable development.  You can also count on the support of our delegation  Sir  with regard to the upcoming summit on non-communicable diseases and the consultative process on revision of the statute of the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission  which must take into account the presidential statement adopted at the ministerial-level meeting of the Security Council on 23 September (S/PRST/2010/18).  At the beginning of the twenty-first century  our deliberations must contribute to bringing together and harmonizing our actions. Only our Organization possesses both the means and the legitimacy to successfully establish effective global governance  and we must all show pragmatism and work in a constructive spirit to achieve our goals.  The interdependence of the global challenges which all of us are facing requires us to define together a set of rules aimed at coordinating our policies and managing relations between Governments  the private sector and civil society. We share your belief   Mr. President  that our Organization should be at the heart of that new multilateralism  which should be founded on integration and solidarity. "
"108",4416,"MDA",65,2010,"At the outset  I would like to join previous speakers in addressing our sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session and to assure you of the full support of our delegation.  This year  the general debate is being held on the eve of the sixty-fifth anniversary of the entry into force of the United Nations Charter  which laid the foundation of our Organization. For more than six decades  the United Nations has been tested by numerous challenges and crises. Today  we can proudly state that it has proven its relevance  importance and vision for humankind.  We extend our appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts in steering the work of this global Organization and addressing critical international issues. We commend his engagement in convening the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  during which Member States  including my own country  assessed the progress achieved and the numerous challenges we face in implementing the MDGs.  The Republic of Moldova is committed to the accomplishment of the MDGs by 2015. As a member of the Economic and Social Council  Moldova presented its comprehensive national voluntary report on the MDGs during the Council’s annual ministerial review meeting in July. The inclusion of the MDGs in our national policies and their effective implementation are among my Government’s main priorities. I take this opportunity to express our appreciation to the organizations of the United Nations system for their support in reaching the Goals.  The economic and financial crises that beset the international community have been exacerbated by food insufficiency and natural disasters  local and regional conflicts  terrorism and transborder criminality. The issues on the agenda of the United Nations reflect modern realities and challenges. I would like to bring to the Assembly’s attention a few areas that are of the utmost importance  namely  human rights and democracy  welfare and sustainable development  climate change  peace and security and  last but not least  the reform of the United Nations.  Building a state of law lies at the heart of the overall activities of the Moldovan Government. The development of legal and institutional frameworks in the area of human rights and strengthening human rights protection mechanisms are among our Government’s main objectives. While our country is characterized by diversity and multiculturalism and    10-55408 2  intercultural and interreligious dialogue  we reiterate our commitment to fighting extremism  xenophobia and other forms of racism and discrimination.   Our country became a member of the Human Rights Council for the first time in 2010. Our membership is in line with Moldova’s irreversible course towards protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms. We assumed the commitment to contribute to the prevention of human rights violations through our active participation in the Council’s activities. We will present our first national report under the Universal Periodic Review mechanism in 2011.  I would also like to point out that Moldova is a State party to nearly all multilateral treaties in the field of human rights within the United Nations system. Last week  we deposited with the Secretary-General our ratification document on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. We will soon become a full-fledged member of the International Criminal Court (ICC)  following the recent ratification by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova of the Rome Statute of the ICC.  We express our solidarity with the appeals articulated in various United Nations forums that more be invested in the advancement of women. We support the Secretary-General’s Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health. Likewise  we are confident that the new entity  UN Women  will contribute to the consolidation of international efforts to achieve the goals of equality and advancement for all women.  Although the impact of the global economic crisis has had a negative effect on the economy of the Republic of Moldova  including on the achievement of MDG targets  the crisis has also constituted a turning point in starting new economic reforms  building up innovative partnerships and mobilizing all national stakeholders in order to create a sustainable economic and social system. To that end  the Government has proceeded to change the country’s development paradigm to an economy based on investments  innovations and competitiveness  creating new jobs and undertaking robust measures in the area of poverty reduction.  Those goals will not be achieved unless we create a healthy and eco-friendly environment while putting in place a sound infrastructure that protects our wealth and families from natural disasters. In recent years  Moldova has confronted considerable natural calamities  from acute droughts to harsh floods  whose devastating impact and frequency have increased each year. The harm caused to the population  agricultural and food production sectors and the overall economy is immeasurable.  On behalf of my Government  I would like to express our sincere gratitude to our development partners and to Governments and multilateral organizations for their prompt response and assistance in overcoming the consequences of the severe floods that affected our country last summer. I would also like to extend our particular gratitude to the United Nations Office in Moldova for its support in assessing post-disaster needs. For its part  my country has also extended a helping hand to others in need  contributing $100 000 to the people of Haiti.  We believe that the adoption of a post-Kyoto treaty is more relevant and vital than ever before. We have to address the challenge of climate change with a synergy of national and integrated international responses. We look forward to a positive outcome to the forthcoming Conference in Cancún.  The latest global crises have emphasized the central role the United Nations is to play in the mobilization of efforts by the international community and  more than ever  the need to increase the efficiency of the Organization. Efforts to strengthen the multilateral potential of the United Nations should be pragmatically adapted to the new realities  enhancing its influence in strict accordance with the United Nations Charter. The United Nations system therefore ought to be optimized by strengthening its main and subsidiary bodies in order to avoid duplication by different United Nations structures. In addition to increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of United Nations activities  that reform will save significant resources  which can be redirected to priority areas where the Organization’s support is most needed.  A major component of the United Nations revival is the reform of the Security Council. We welcome the results achieved during the intergovernmental negotiations and believe that the success of the reform requires political commitment by all Member States. We share the view that Council membership should be expanded in both categories and that one additional non-permanent seat should be allocated to the Eastern European Group.   3 10-55408   The importance of cooperation to enhance international security  promote disarmament and  non-proliferation and counter international terrorism has been stressed by many speakers in the Hall. The terrorist acts occurring in different parts of the world demonstrate that terrorism continuously threatens international security  fundamental democratic values and human rights. The Republic of Moldova condemns terrorism and extremism in all its forms and expresses its entire support for the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.  After many years of deadlock  significant progress in disarmament and non-proliferation in all its aspects was made this year. The new United States-Russia START agreement  the nuclear summit in Washington and the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons are just a few of the positive examples of increased cooperation by Member States. We welcome the entry into force  on 1 August  of the Convention on Cluster Munitions  to which Moldova made its contribution  as well as the launch of the negotiations on an arms trade treaty.  The participation of the Republic of Moldova in United Nations peacekeeping operations highlights our country’s political willingness to contribute to international peace and stability and to be effectively engaged in building a strong security architecture through peacekeeping and peacebuilding activities.  The enhancement of international cooperation in the field of conflict settlement  with a view to preventing future occurrences or escalation of crisis situations that jeopardize the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  is of primary importance for my country as it confronts the secessionism phenomenon in its eastern districts.  The Republic of Moldova continues to face significant security challenges generated by separatism in the Transnistrian region of the country. Eighteen years since the ceasefire agreement was signed  Moldova remains artificially divided. Because of that  the whole system of international commitments in the fields of democratic governance  human rights and arms control is not functioning in that part of our national territory. The local population is living in a situation of a legal vacuum  with no clear future. Foreign forces are still stationed in Moldova  despite the lack of consent of the host Government and previous decisions and commitments regarding their withdrawal.  At the same time  it is absolutely obvious that there are objective considerations in resolving the Transnistrian problem. The practical steps undertaken by the Government of Moldova clearly show that the settlement of the Transnistrian conflict is one of its central priorities. We consistently advocate in favour of a policy of dialogue  openness and trust. Our efforts are concentrated on developing regular contacts between Chisinau and Tiraspol at the level of political representatives  as well as in the working groups created to build confidence in various areas. Our main goal is to provide much-needed support to the population and businesses in the region  including through international projects and programmes.  International partners in the settlement process are also showing interest in increased engagement aimed at the full territorial reintegration of the Republic of Moldova. That positive trend should be strengthened. The first step in that direction would be the earliest possible unconditional resumption of official negotiations in the “5+2” format. That would allow us to start working on a formula for a viable and comprehensive settlement based on the principles of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova.  It would also offer us the necessary framework for the implementation of confidence-building and reintegration projects  as well as for the transformation of the current so-called peacekeeping operation into a multinational civilian mission based on the relevant international standards and mandate. In that context  we firmly believe that the summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to be held at the end of this year should provide a clear perspective for the settlement of the Transnistrian conflict and the withdrawal of foreign forces from Moldova  in line with commitments undertaken at the previous summit.  We would like to take this opportunity to reiterate our principled position that conflict situations  whenever they appear  seriously impact peace  security and stability. They must therefore be solved on the basis of full respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of States.  We are concerned by attempts  particularly by non-State entities  to misinterpret and restate the sense of the International Court of Justice advisory opinion    10-55408 4  on Kosovo. Such attempts run counter to the spirit and substance of the imperative principles of international law and endanger the international legal order and international security and stability. It is therefore of the utmost importance to make it clear that international law does not confer the right for ethnic  linguistic or religious groups to break away from the territory of a State of which they form part without that State’s consent.  Like other Member States  the Republic of Moldova fully shares the view that unilateral secession cannot be an acceptable way of resolving conflict issues. When engaging in settlement efforts  we must also proceed from recognition of the fact that each and every case is unique and should not constitute a precedent for addressing and settling other conflicts of different factual context.  The Republic of Moldova is determined to advance on its path towards European integration  which is a fundamental priority of our domestic and foreign policies. The achievement of that goal will enable our country to embark on a course of stability and prosperity governed by democratic values and respect for fundamental human rights  the rule of law and economic freedom.  Moldova-European Union relations have intensified in the past year  given the firm commitment of our Government to improve ties with the European Union (EU) and its member States. On 12 January  we successfully launched negotiations on the Association Agreement and held three rounds of negotiations  during which there was a convergence of approaches. Moreover  we have launched three dialogues with the European Union  on human rights  visa liberalization and the creation of a broad and comprehensive free-trade area. We are confident that the constructive approach of our cooperation process will contribute to the advancement of our country on the European track. We are grateful to EU member States for their strong support and the firm shoulder they have provided for Moldova’s ambitious European agenda.  Furthermore  we consider that since the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty  new opportunities have emerged for enhanced European Union cooperation with its international partners  including the United Nations. We express our support for the active and efficient participation of the European Union in the work of General Assembly.  In conclusion  I would like to reiterate that the involvement of the Republic of Moldova in the work of the United Nations is one of the strategic objectives of our foreign policy. Our country remains committed to achieving the objectives of the United Nations Charter  as set by the founding fathers 65 years ago and embraced by all Member States."
"109",4499,"MDV",65,2010,"I would first like to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to    10-55122 6  preside over the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Please be assured of my delegation’s full support and cooperation. I would also like to take this opportunity to offer our appreciation to both your predecessor  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  for the exemplary manner in which he guided the work of the sixty-fourth session  and to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership of the United Nations over the past four years.  Last week  I had the opportunity to report on the Maldives’ progress towards attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). My report demonstrated that while we have achieved five of the eight MDGs — namely  Goals 1  2  4  5 and 6 — several others remain challenges  and some achievements are increasingly becoming threatened. For example  the Maldives has made great strides in eliminating poverty  in education and in improving mortality rates among mothers and infants. However  we have yet to make significant gains in the area of the empowerment of women. We are also still struggling to provide for our environmental and development needs. Moreover  religious extremism runs counter to notions of equality and social justice and endangers our achievements in gender parity. All the while  environmental and economic vulnerabilities threaten to diminish our gains.  Those gains  among others  have improved the lives of the Maldivian people and contributed to a situation that has led to our imminent graduation from the United Nations list of least developed countries (LDCs) this year. While we look forward to our graduation  we are also concerned about the sudden withdrawal of some of the benefits afforded to LDCs that have helped sustain our development efforts for the past four decades. Those include preferential market access and concessionary financing. While we were very encouraged by the pledges made by our partners at the donors conference held in the Maldives in March this year to invest in urgent development projects  we anxiously await the speedy disbursement of the promised aid.  Furthermore  we look forward to working with our development partners to achieve consensus on a transitional model that provides for a gradual reduction of benefits to avoid the disruption of our development efforts  as stipulated in resolution 59/209. As a country on the verge of LDC graduation  we look forward to adopting a development strategy that places emphasis on greater independence and economic stability through private investment and public-private partnerships. Our Government’s policies on privatization and our employment of commercial diplomacy are designed to achieve this transition. However  like many other small island States  our geopolitical and socio-economic circumstances will continue to render the Maldives vulnerable.  The impact of the recent global recession clearly demonstrates those vulnerabilities. As a country primarily dependent on tourism and fishing  the Maldives was severely affected by decreases in consumption in our traditional markets. As a result  the Government was compelled to implement severe austerity measures that cut public spending and undertook massive economic reforms. Nevertheless  our people continue to face formidable development challenges  and thus the Maldives will continue to push for greater recognition within the United Nations for the plight of small island developing States.  The economic transition in the Maldives complements an ambitious political transition from autocracy to democracy. Although this is a daunting task  we have been successful in achieving important milestones over the course of these past two years. In fact  the two-year period of transition stipulated in our new Constitution concluded in August. This process resulted in the establishment of our Supreme Court and the creation of other relevant institutions. While our transition process was accompanied by some political discord  it was largely peaceful.  Our friends in the international community helped us find peaceful solutions during this somewhat tumultuous period in our politics. I would like to thank all members of the international community for their continued engagement and assistance  and especially President Mahinda Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka for his constructive contributions.  The Maldives’ transition to democracy has been accompanied by our evolution from an abuser of human rights to a staunch advocate for them. We are proud of what we have achieved  but are the first to recognize that there is no shortage of challenges that require our immediate attention. These include the need to abrogate the use of torture  the need to safeguard the rights of women  children and the disabled  and the need to improve our capacity to deal with human trafficking in our region.    7 10-55122   The Maldives is proud to have been elected to the Human Rights Council in May  and we are cognizant of the trust and responsibility conferred upon us by the overwhelming support demonstrated by United Nations Members across all regions. We will continue to uphold our pledge to use our membership to promote human rights through positive engagement and to address sensitivities in our collective quest to protect the most vulnerable. Moreover  the Maldives is undergoing its own universal periodic review this year  and we consider this exercise to be an opportunity to further strengthen human rights protections at home.  While our interest in human rights is rooted in our ambition to improve the lives of our own citizens  it also emerges from our rising concerns about life in our now interconnected global village  where the need to compel tolerance  understanding and respect for human dignity is greater than ever before. We support the initiatives for a culture of peace  dialogue among civilizations and tolerance among different faiths.  As a Muslim country  we lament the rising tide of Islamophobia in non-Muslim States. The people of the Maldives certainly appreciate the difference between Government-sanctioned incidents and those anti-Muslim activities that can be attributed to marginal segments of non-Muslim societies. However  we believe that religious intolerance  negative stereotyping  racial profiling and discrimination thwart this institution’s mission for peace and prosperity among all societies. Therefore  we must intensify our efforts to promote a culture of tolerance and understanding while pursuing an effective dialogue to expand the scope of rational discourse between the Islamic world and other civilizations.  Some of the gravest threats facing humankind today do not occupy their rightful places in the headlines  nor do they gain the significant attention they require. We believe that climate change is such a threat. For the Maldives  the effects of global warming pose an overwhelming threat to our infrastructure  our economy and our very existence.  In an attempt to implement adaptation measures  the Maldives has invested in water and sanitation projects and coastal defences and is attempting to develop voluntary resettlement programmes to more viable islands within the country. We are also investing in a low-carbon future that emphasizes renewable energy and other green projects to achieve our goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2020.  It is obvious that our actions alone cannot save us. The global community must act. Regional initiatives that complement United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) processes must be pursued. Weeks before Copenhagen  the Maldives convened a group of countries and formed the Climate Vulnerable Forum to declare our concerns with a united voice. I am pleased to report today that Kiribati will take over the leadership of this group ahead of the sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in Cancún this year  and that Bangladesh will steer it to the seventeenth session in South Africa next year.  The Asian region is one of the most vulnerable to climate change. We recognize that failure to extend emissions targets beyond 2012 will leave 60 per cent of the world’s population without durable solutions for the global warming effects already being felt. Threats to food and water security for the world’s most susceptible populations will undoubtedly perpetuate disease  exacerbate conflicts and threaten to erode decades of hard-won successes achieved by countries throughout the region.  While we have high hopes for the ensuing sixteenth  seventeenth and eighteenth sessions of the Conference  we believe that alternative solutions that harmonize the development needs of industrial States with the human and economic rights of vulnerable peoples should exist. Therefore  the people of the Maldives and Timor-Leste call for an Asian initiative that would forge a consortium of Asian countries and regional partnerships. This will aim to enable our region to aid the world’s most vulnerable States.  The Maldives believes that it is time to let go of the mistrust and blame that has plagued the UNFCCC process. We welcome the recent voluntary initiative of India to curb its emissions and its commitment to promoting green energy without waiting for others to follow suit. We call upon all nations large and small to come together in a cooperative spirit in Cancún so that we may effectively establish and promote mitigation activities that will restore our native carbon sinks  increase energy efficiency  reduce emissions and preserve our ecosystems.  The Maldives would also like to state its support of the Group of Four position for reform of the    10-55122 8  Security Council. We believe that an expansion of permanent membership to reflect the realities of our contemporary international system will improve representation in the Council and better serve to address a panoply of concerns facing nations in all five regions today.  The Maldives also continues to grapple with traditional security threats. The scourge of terrorism and the growing menace of piracy threaten national  economic and maritime security throughout our region and around the world. Yet deficits in the capacity to attribute criminal accountability to the perpetrators of terrorism persist. Our failure is marked by the advances in the modus operandi of terrorists  the proliferation of illegal technology transfer  and the surge in the trade of illicit weapons. The Maldives cannot stress enough the importance of this Assembly’s finalizing the draft convention on terrorism.  Our geographical location in the Indian Ocean makes the Maldives particularly vulnerable to threats to its maritime security  as our vast open waters continue to prove difficult to police. We are deeply concerned over the surge in piracy that has moved beyond the Gulf of Aden into the Indian Ocean. If the international community does not increase its efforts  we fear that piracy may end up turning into an uncontrolled threat to security in the region. Thus  we were particularly encouraged by the adoption of Security Council resolution 1897 (2009) and are pleased with the work of the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia. We feel  however  that it is important for the Group to urgently establish an easily accessible legal toolkit for States that enables them to fill the vacuums in their national legal systems and address piracy in a comprehensive manner.  The continued suffering of the Palestinian people deeply saddens the Maldives. They have been denied their right to self-determination and their right to live in peace and freedom in their own independent State for far too long. While recognizing the rights of the Palestinians  we also appreciate and support the right of the people of Israel to live in peace and security alongside an independent and sovereign State of Palestine. We continue our call for all sides to use the ongoing peace talks as an opportunity to resolve their differences  and are therefore heartened by the new initiatives being pursued by the United States in its pursuit of a Middle East peace treaty. Furthermore  we call for continued support for the Governments of Jordan and Egypt in their work on the Arab Peace Initiative  which we believe may provide an enduring solution to the conflict for the people of the region.  Additionally  our pursuit of a more secure and just world and our respect for international law were the basis of the Maldives’ recognition of the independence of Kosovo  declared on 17 February 2008. The Maldives believes that the declaration of independence by the people of Kosovo reflects a last-resort remedy that embodies the best prospects for peace and stability in the region. The Maldives also welcomes the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the unilateral declaration of independence in respect of Kosovo  issued on 22 July 2010  which concluded that that declaration of the independence of Kosovo did not violate international law. While we have been disappointed by recent efforts to reverse this judgment  the Maldives welcomes the alternative solution  contained in the unanimously adopted European Union-sponsored resolution 64/298  as a positive step towards Kosovo’s assumption of full United Nations membership.  Closer to home  the Maldives has borne witness to advances in democracy  sustainable development  and peacebuilding throughout the region of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. Notably  we praise the progress made by the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan  including the development of democratic institutions  as well as improvements in the areas of health  education and the status of women. We wish the Afghans continued success in their efforts to rebuild their long-suffering nation  and implore the international community to maintain their support of the Afghan people.  Furthermore  the Maldives welcomes Sri Lanka’s success in its ongoing consolidation of peace and democracy  and we call upon the international community to support that country in its reconciliation efforts  as well as in its efforts to rebuild a nation torn apart by 25 years of sustained conflict.  We are a small nation with big dreams. Our dreams are rooted in the vision of the Charter that binds the membership of this Assembly together here today. Our hopes are inextricably linked to the fears of the past that inspired this body and to the hopes of those who dream of a future grounded in justice  equity  opportunity and peace for peoples of the North and South  in nations large and small. Our humanity   9 10-55122  defines our obstacles  but we believe that our dreams for a better future defy our limitations.  "
"110",4546,"MEX",65,2010,"Let me begin by conveying the warm congratulations of the delegation of Mexico to Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election as President of the General Assembly at this new session. I also wish to express our appreciation to   27 10-55276  his predecessor  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  for his work  and our appreciation and support to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts for peace and development.  The recent high-level meetings have shown the magnitude of the challenges that confront the international community and thus the United Nations. The obstacles to achieving the Millennium Development Goals  the economic crisis in all its manifestations  the disasters associated with climate change  the continuing threats to peace and security — in either their traditional or new forms — and the difficulties in effectively addressing nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation define the agenda of multilateral institutions and of the policies of our Governments.   Nevertheless  the primary responsibility of this Organization is the maintenance of international peace and security. Years of war and conflict on every continent  with enormous loss of lives and significant economic and social costs  have tested the ability of the United Nations to prevent  contain and reverse armed conflicts.   That is the case in Afghanistan and Iraq  where after years of conflicts and interventions there is still hope that those countries will be able to fully assume their own destiny without outside interference. In Somalia and the Sudan the prospects for peaceful settlements and reconciliation still seem to be distant  requiring the will of the parties and careful monitoring by the international community to prevent the escalation  the extension  of the crises and to ensure the protection of the civilian population.  In the Democratic Republic of the Congo impunity prevails  and despite the presence of United Nations forces  outrageous and unacceptable crimes are committed against civilians  particularly women and children. The reconstruction of Haiti after the terrible earthquake last January  which even affected United Nations personnel  is taking place under dramatic conditions.  The list of challenges is endless  and indeed there is the risk of a backsliding and escalation of violence in several critical regions of the world.  In the Middle East  despite 60 years of conflict and scepticism due to past failures  there is renewed hope for peace  thanks to the resumption of direct talks between the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The creation of a politically and economically viable Palestinian State  living in peace side by side with Israel  within secure and internationally recognized borders  is an essential condition for the establishment of lasting peace in the Middle East. We particularly welcome the efforts of the Administration of President Barack Obama to achieve that goal.  Mexico expresses its strong support for the ongoing negotiations. Nonetheless  the hope of a definitive agreement is marred by the threats and provocations of extremist forces that seek to derail direct negotiations. The leaders of Israel and the Palestinian Authority have an appointment with history. Let us hope that they are up to the challenge. To that end they can count on the unstinting support of States genuinely committed to the peace process.  The existence of weapons of mass destruction remains a threat to humanity and increases global insecurity. In 2010  significant progress has been made in the areas of disarmament and non-proliferation  and the international community has renewed its commitment to nuclear safety. The signing of the new strategic arms reduction treaty between the United States and Russia  the nuclear summit held in Washington and the outcome of the Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) are achievements that must be commended. We cannot ignore that the credibility and viability of the disarmament agenda depend on the universalization of the NPT and the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East would constitute a parallel and decisive step in that regard.  With regard to the cases of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran  it will be necessary to move forward through dialogue and negotiation in order to resolve the controversies arising from their nuclear programmes. The adoption of sanctions is not incompatible with the recourse to diplomacy  which is still ongoing.  However  international security does not depend exclusively on the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. It is also threatened by the existence of small arms and light weapons and their illicit trafficking  which fuel conflicts  claim the lives of thousands of people and destabilize our societies. It is    10-55276 28  time to tackle that challenge head on  implementing the Programme of Action on illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons and progressing towards the adoption of an arms trade treaty.  With regard to development  the consequences of the recent international economic and financial crisis  caused largely by the failure of the regulatory mechanisms and the excessive indebtedness of the world’s major economies  are still being suffered worldwide.  The failures that led to this crisis must be addressed  and the United Nations must be able to play a significant role in that undertaking. The crisis demonstrated the need to promote international cooperation schemes that would allow us to act effectively and efficiently to meet the challenges arising from it. In particular  it is worth highlighting the positive work of the Group of 20 in this regard. However  we also believe that the United Nations should play a more relevant role in the discussions on necessary international economic governance reform. In this sense  we share the objectives set by the President of the General Assembly.  In this context  the prospects for achieving the Millennium Development Goals have been severely hampered by the crisis. Thus  the commitments in official development assistance made at the Monterrey International Conference on Financing for Development and endorsed at the 2008 Doha Follow-up Conference have been jeopardized. These commitments must be honoured. The Millennium Development Goals can be attained in all countries if we take appropriate individual and collective action  as indicated in resolution 65/1  adopted at the High-level Plenary Meeting held here at Headquarters last week. It is also indispensable that we progress towards the successful conclusion of the Doha Round of trade negotiations  fully respecting its linkage with the development agenda.  In addition to the traditional challenges  our Organization faces new challenges that test its ability to react and adapt. Terrorism  on the one hand  and the globalization of transnational organized crime on the other  including drug trafficking  pose new threats to peace and security that destabilize entire countries and regions  modifying the traditional notion of international security. The fight against these phenomena is not the exclusive responsibility of one particular country or region; these are global phenomena that must be addressed and resolved by the international community based on the fundamental principle of shared responsibility. We cannot ignore the fact that the permissive social behaviour in some countries stimulates illicit activities in others.  The Government of Mexico has assumed full responsibility for meeting the challenges posed by drug trafficking and activities related to organized crime  restoring State authority in areas where impunity had prevailed. This fight requires an increased investment of resources and has unfortunately also led to the loss of lives. The cost is high  but would be even higher for our society if the authority of the State remained impassive in the face of violence  corruption and the accompanying impunity. Compliance with international commitments in the area of drug trafficking is indispensable in order to meet this challenge.  Migration is a reality of our contemporary world that cannot be ignored by our Organization. Its multidimensional nature obliges us to consider its causes and effects from an international perspective. The migratory phenomenon should be addressed through a holistic approach that recognizes the contribution of migrants to the countries of origin and of destination alike  among other factors. In November  Mexico will host the fourth meeting of the Global Forum on Migration and Development  the outcome of which will be duly reported to this Assembly.  The Government of Mexico is committed to the promotion of human rights of all migrants  irrespective of their migratory status. We call on all Member States to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Unfortunately  the tendency to criminalize international migration has prevailed. Legislative initiatives and actions singling out minorities in various countries unacceptably codify racism and xenophobia  establishing new barriers between communities and nations. This is unacceptable.  Mexico  a country of origin  transit and destination for migrants  has experienced within its borders the consequences of the exploitation and violence perpetrated by organized criminal gangs that not only smuggle people from different countries  but have not hesitated to cruelly threaten their lives  as was the very regrettable case in our country in August. The competent authorities  in coordination with the   29 10-55276  Governments of which the individuals concerned were nationals  are investigating this case and establishing the necessary coordination mechanisms to prevent similar events in the future and to attend more effectively to the protection of migrants  regardless of their origin and legal status.  Nature also poses new challenges. We cannot afford to remain idle in the face of the adverse effects of climate change. The economic and human costs of not addressing this problem are enormous and negatively affect the welfare and well-being of present and future generations. As host of the sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and of the sixth Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol  to be held later this year in Cancún  Mexico is making every possible effort in a transparent  inclusive and responsible manner to achieve concrete and operational results. In Cancún  we will be able to adopt a broad and balanced set of decisions for immediate implementation. One single action or agreement is not enough to address such a complex phenomenon. The international regime on this matter should evolve constantly in response to technological and socio-economic developments and on the basis of common but differentiated responsibility.  The main advantage of our Organization among the multilateral institutions is its universal character. Its Charter enshrines the commitments that States have made in all these aspects. Thus  United Nations actions are fully legitimate  in accordance with international law. However  we cannot ignore the difficulties that the Organization faces without running the risk of its becoming increasingly less capable of addressing the enormous challenges facing the international community. Its decisions  including those that are legally binding  are difficult to implement and its resources fall short of meeting the many needs that arise in the maintenance of peace and in addressing natural and humanitarian disasters. The Organization’s budget and scale of assessments do not reflect the realities of our countries.  As a result  the comprehensive reform of the Organization can be put off no longer; if it is  alternative forums or more selective groups will fill the vacuum created by our Organization’s lack of effectiveness. Our Organization requires comprehensive reform  ranging from the adaptation and representativeness of the Security Council to greater coherence in activities for sustainable development. In 2011  the General Assembly will consider the status of the Human Rights Council  while the Council itself will review its own working methods. We must ensure that the outcome of both processes results in the increased effectiveness of its work.  With respect to peacekeeping  difficulties on the ground and the need to adapt operation mandates require the Security Council and the Organization as a whole to elaborate pragmatic actions and strategies that will produce results in the short term. Security Council reform may be the most urgent. Mexico has participated in the process of intergovernmental negotiations  convinced of the need for comprehensive reform to improve the Council’s representativeness  transparency  democracy and accountability. This process is relevant to all States  and Security Council reform can be neither determined nor addressed in alternative forums that have an eminently financial purview. This much-needed and urgent reform will not be achieved by imposing the aspirations of a few on the collective will.  As an elected member of the Security Council for the biennium 2009-2010  Mexico has been able to appreciate the constructive role that non-permanent members can play through their contributions to the work of the Council and its subsidiary bodies. Nevertheless  we are also aware of their limitations. The short duration of their mandates impedes the consolidation of achievements and affects the continuity of the work of the Council itself. We are therefore convinced that the principle of immediate  re-election or of longer-term seats for non-permanent members are the best options for pragmatic and viable Security Council reform in the short term.   Mexico’s participation in the Security Council has been guided by its conviction of the importance of the contribution that elected members can make to the maintenance of international peace and security  in the understanding that this is a shared responsibility in accordance with obligations under the United Nations Charter and not the monopoly of a few. In this sense  we have been able to encourage mediation and the peaceful settlement of disputes; promote disarmament and non-proliferation; preserve respect for international humanitarian law; ensure the protection of the civilian population in armed conflicts  with special emphasis on children; strengthen the rule of law; and foster activities to promote stability and reconstruction in States emerging from conflict.    10-55276 30   This year  Mexico celebrates its bicentennial as an independent nation and the centenary of its revolution  the first of the great social revolutions of the twentieth century. From our own experience  we are well aware of the difficulties and obstacles facing the construction of any nation-State in a complex and changing world. Throughout its history  our country’s interaction with the world at large has been fraught. Our country has experienced external interventions  occupations and even losses of its territory during periods of political instability. We have been able nonetheless to forge a national identity and unique profile in contemporary international relations.  Today  Mexico is a constructive and open country  peaceful and fully committed to forging agreements for a better world. As a founding Member of our Organization  we have been loyal to its purposes  consistent with the principles of foreign policy enshrined in our Constitution. Our adherence to international law and the contributions of Mexican foreign policy to various fields are well known. We have also learned to appreciate the importance of international cooperation inasmuch as there is no challenge on the United Nations agenda that can be tackled in isolation. The survival of humankind  given the dangers of nuclear war  combating the effects of climate change  overcoming social regression  and the relentless fight against new threats to international security and to our own societies require our greatest individual efforts as well as coordination among States. Mexico will therefore remain deeply committed to multilateralism  of which this universal forum is the first and foremost expression."
"111",4571,"MHL",65,2010,"I bring the warm greetings of “Yokwe” from the Republic of the Marshall Islands.  Every September since the country became a member of the United Nations in 1991  leaders of the low-lying Republic of the Marshall Islands have been reminding the international community of the need for full global action on climate change.  We have no mountains or high ground; we have only our narrow archipelago resting a metre above the ocean. There has been enough talk  and too much repetition. It is now time for meaningful action  creative cooperation and visible results to address climate change. If we fail in the short-term  the economic and moral costs for our low-lying islands — and eventually the whole world — will be beyond calculation.  The global commitment at Copenhagen to safeguard the most vulnerable faces a true litmus test: will our local communities see visible results leading towards a climate-resilient future? I urge that by the time of the climate change talks in Cancún nations build political trust through “fast start” finance  by providing transparent information and actively turning commitments into results.  We cannot wait for the uncertain path to achieve a full multilateral climate agreement  and we cannot allow laggards to set us back. Those most vulnerable and those willing to confront the challenges facing us must take leadership in this process by putting forward our own agreement spelling out real and ambitious commitments and actions to address climate change. And we urge others to follow.  To work in true partnership we must first show our own commitment. The Marshall Islands Government has endorsed a new climate change road map  spelling out specific actions to cut our own emissions by 40 per cent by 2020  and concrete strategies to ensure that the growth of our local communities is safeguarded from climate impacts.  The Marshall Islands has made important progress towards achieving several Millennium Development Goals  but much remains to be accomplished. With our international partners  we must also better address climate change risks in the context of our core development.    10-55103 2   Practical and “shovel ready” adaptation actions taken now — water security  resource conservation and infrastructure protection — will sharply reduce the long-term risks to our security and sovereignty. But we cannot ignore such threats. It should be a matter of serious concern to the Secretary-General that we are actively contemplating risks to our territorial integrity and United Nations membership  that we are considering options to safeguard our population’s political rights if our land —and our thin water table — becomes unusable in the face of rising seas.  The Republic of the Marshall Islands is known to the United Nations as a small island developing State  but we are first and foremost a large ocean nation. Our thin atolls may appear tiny on a map  but our exclusive economic zone is over 2 million square kilometres. As Chair of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement  I address the United Nations on behalf of a unified political bloc vested in ensuring the future of the Western and Central Pacific  the world’s largest viable tuna fishery.  The development pathways of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement are narrow and limited  and at the highest levels we have committed to putting a firm stop to the unrestricted global harvest of our resources. The status quo of overfishing is unacceptable; it has strangled our development and threatened the viability of our resources. We have closed off surrounding pockets of international waters  and if our development and ecosystem needs so demand  we will close off more.  We currently realize only a tiny fraction of a multibillion-dollar industry — only one penny from each can of Pacific tuna — and we are seeking global support and economic partnership to grow our benefit. Without political and economic cooperation in regional fisheries decision-making  and unless fishing targets are in line with science  the collective economic development of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement will remain at a standstill as our coastal resources decline. We have already driven our partners to achieve positive action. However  far greater efforts are needed  from both United Nations agencies and regional fisheries management organizations  to identify time-bound strategies which assist us in realizing a greater share of benefits from our own resources.  The United Nations must make faster progress towards reflecting modern twenty-first-century dynamics. The Security Council should be restructured to accommodate those nations whose size  leadership and responsibility — in particular  the Group of Four of Japan  Germany  India and Brazil — indicate a deserved role as permanent members. Further efforts should also ensure that Africa and small nations  including island States  have an improved voice.  The Republic of the Marshall Islands welcomes the progress achieved on both sides of the Taiwan Straits. The pragmatic and moderate actions of Taiwan should not be overlooked by the United Nations  and deserve further encouragement. I call upon the United Nations system and Member States to be open-minded and identify appropriate means to accept Taiwan’s participation within specialized agencies  including the International Civil Aviation Organization  and in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In particular  recognizing the commitment to reduce emissions by the 23 million people of Taiwan — a fellow island nation — in addressing climate change is in the common interest of us all.  The Republic of the Marshall Islands welcomes the leadership of the United Arab Emirates as host of the International Renewable Energy Agency. We look forward to pursuing increased partnership with the United Arab Emirates and to establishing a dialogue with the Arab League on investment and development assistance in the Pacific region.  Finally  I must address one of this year’s most important issues within the United Nations. Member States and leaders must improve progress towards achieving the goal of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and pursue the peace and security of a world without them.  The Marshall Islands has a unique reason for seeking the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. During our time as a United Nations Trust Territory  67 large-scale surface tests of nuclear weapons were conducted on our homeland  explicitly authorized under two United Nations resolutions  in 1954 and 1956. No people should ever bear such a burden. For decades  we have told the United Nations about our communities who are still displaced  about the deliberate use of our people in scientific experiments and of ongoing health impacts inherited through generations. We continue to face the challenges of a   3 10-55103  United Nations-era nuclear waste storage site  surrounded by rising waters  towards dealing with which we lack resources or technical capacity.  We acknowledge important and positive actions already taken by partners  including our former administrator  the United States  but we need  and deserve  improved attention and assistance from the United States  as well as from the United Nations system and multilateral bodies.  I also acknowledge the support of the Pacific Islands Forum  including the leadership of the outgoing chair  Australia  as well as of the Non-Aligned Movement  in ensuring that this year’s Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons acknowledged the need to address sites contaminated by testing. I fully expect that Member States of the United Nations will be willing to further recognize that a special responsibility exists towards former United Nations Trust Territories adversely affected by nuclear testing. As the United Nations maps a global future of non-proliferation  the past legacy of nuclear activities can no longer be ignored.  The message is the same for nuclear weapons  global security and freedom from terrorism  or climate change: international law is not an empty promise."
"112",4595,"MKD",65,2010,"It is a privilege and a great honour for me today to address this unique forum where great and small  powerful and less powerful nations speak with one voice; a forum we undoubtedly expect to result in dialogue and leadership in order to   39 10-54965  deal with the challenges to peace and security  hunger and development  human rights and climate change. Success will be possible only by overcoming individual interests. I am convinced that today more than ever  each of us individually and all of us together have reasons to turn our words into actions.  Let me first congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session and assure him of my delegation’s readiness to cooperate during his term. I also congratulate the former President  Mr. Treki  on successfully presiding over the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. At the same time I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the engagement and the efforts made by the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  to strengthen the role of our Organization.  At the outset  I would like to say a few words on the consequences of the global financial and economic crisis  and I will refer in particular to the role of the United Nations in this context.  The global economic and financial crisis threatened to reverse the progress made in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and efforts to attain peace in all regions. I think that all we Member States and the United Nations system in general successfully dealt with it. Timely  joint and adequate solutions were found to many of the problems. Processes were initiated to mitigate the effects of the crisis and to face possible future crises. Actions were taken to help the most affected  according to the agreed action plans and with appropriate support and cooperation  often resulting in successful outcomes. Let us not forget that economic  financial and social security is a foundation on which sustainable development  national and global security and prosperity rest.  Five years remain before the deadline for the implementation and realization of the Millennium Development Goals. That objective is still before us — an objective we must not give up on achieving now  despite the decelerated pace of implementation. We are all aware of the high stakes and potential benefits. I welcome the outcome of the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals held last week  when we all pledged to strengthen our efforts to attain the ultimate goal.  The Republic of Macedonia  as before  remains strongly committed to achieving the Goals  as reflected at the national level in the Government’s strategy for economic and sustainable development and in national legislation  which is adapted to the current obligations deriving from international treaties and agreements.  On the other hand  global climate change is both a serious threat to our planet and survival. Frequent natural disasters and humanitarian catastrophes have made it clear that nature reacts to the irresponsible attitude that humankind has adopted towards it. However  the struggle to preserve nature must not only be a matter of declarations; it must enjoy global leadership and be visible in every small town  every State  and the strict observance and development of national strategies. Successful formulas must be transformed into in a common global struggle to preserve our way of life  side by side with the needs of the planet.  The Republic of Macedonia stands ready to contribute adequately to the global efforts. Many initiatives have been undertaken. We are truly focused on the best possible weapons in this struggle: awareness-raising and education on and a culture of reducing the use of electricity by using alternative energy sources and reductions in harmful emissions. As a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change for over a decade  my country has worked actively to achieve the Convention’s objectives.  Unfortunately  the world still does not live in the desired peace and prosperity. Unfortunately  every day we continue to witness disturbances to peace and security in certain regions in the world  both in old and frozen conflicts and in the emergence of new tensions in several regions in the world. If the fundamental institutional goal and essential objective of this Organization is to spare humanity from suffering  wars and conflicts  then we should ask ourselves whether our efforts have been sufficient to secure peace and prosperity. The answer is no  neither globally nor regionally.  The consequences of the global financial and economic crisis and the slow pace of implementation of the MDGs have had a serious impact on the essence of conflicts  often because of a lack of democratic processes and rule of law in certain areas. Only by promoting peace  human rights and the rule of law through dialogue and tolerance can we make the world a just and fair place to live in.    10-54965 40   In the context of what I have just said  I welcome the relevance of this session’s theme  which should help create effective responses to global crises and restore the role of the United Nations in global governance. The genuine vision of the founders of the United Nations should be restored. They have left us a legacy.  The Republic of Macedonia strongly supports the joint efforts to improve the overall coherence of the United Nations system. I believe that we all agree that it was and remains necessary to redefine the functioning of the United Nations system in order to respond to the demands and priorities of the Member States in the best and most effective manner possible. We should create a highly functional global governance organization that has no overlapping of mandates  but achieves maximal effect through an appropriate and transparent use of existing resources.  Since gaining independence  the Republic of Macedonia has been fully committed to substantial reforms in all areas aimed at promoting democracy and improving the standards of living of its citizens  based on historical traditions of respect for multiethnic coexistence  dialogue and mutual understanding.  Our achievements in this context have been validated and internationally recognized. Therefore  the Republic of Macedonia rightfully expects a date to be set to begin negotiations on its accession to the European Union (EU) and an invitation to join NATO. We have enforced the necessary reforms to join NATO  we have been an EU membership candidate country for five years  and last year we received a positive recommendation to start negotiations with the EU. Unfortunately  our citizens have not yet felt the full benefits of that. And yet  the reforms that brought us to the front doors of these organizations were not at all easy. In addition  my country is actively committed to regional cooperation and to building good-neighbourly relations. Macedonia accepts and promotes dialogue as the only mechanism for overcoming all outstanding issues in the region.  The Republic of Macedonia has directed all its available capacities and resources towards implementing our top strategic foreign policy goals: integration into the EU and NATO membership. I would like to remind the Assembly that  15 years ago here in New York  the Interim Accord was signed with our southern neighbour  whereby Greece agreed not to obstruct my country’s membership of and integration into international and regional organizations. Nevertheless  I must note that my country is still waiting at the doors of these two organizations due to the actions of our southern neighbour  which are contrary to the obligations under the 1995 Interim Accord.  The Republic of Macedonia is fully committed to the process of resolving its differences with Greece within the framework of the mechanism established by United Nations resolutions. Our name is at stake  as is our right to self-identification and human dignity. We have done our utmost to nurture close and friendly relations with our neighbour Greece and its people. A solution will be reached only if the United Nations Charter  the relevant resolutions and international law and its principles  on which the international order rests  are respected.  The Republic of Macedonia and its citizens deserve to enjoy the benefits of NATO membership and to start EU accession negotiations.  Yesterday  here at the United Nations  I had a meeting with the Greek Prime Minister  which sought to build a climate of mutual trust and understanding. I hope that  as two neighbouring countries that have lived and will live with one another  we will be able to find a mutually acceptable solution. It will be a big step not only for us but also towards fulfilling our common vision for the whole region.   I must say that I am encouraged by the situation in our region. The more intensive communication and cooperation efforts are  the better understanding and respect will be. By accepting dialogue as the only way to overcome inherited problems and open issues  we create a new climate. Proof of this was the second Balkan Leaders Forum  which was held here in New York City a couple of days ago. Slowly but surely  the Balkans is restoring its impaired dignity. The Balkans again aspires to become part of the European space  where European values  European criteria and European principles will be respected. The Balkans has been  is and will be Europe.  Let me conclude with the statement that the Republic of Macedonia believes in the United Nations and the postulates upon which it rests. I believe that the United Nations can maintain the stability of international order and relations and successfully meet current and future global challenges. The Republic of   41 10-54965  Macedonia stands ready to further provide its constructive contribution to the implementation and realization of these goals. "
"113",4639,"MLI",65,2010,"It is a great privilege and signal honour for me to address the    10-55276 20  Assembly on behalf of the President of the Republic of Mali  His Excellency Mr. Amadou Toumani Touré  who  because of a very busy schedule resulting from the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of Mali’s independence  is unable to be here with us today. He has expressly charged me with conveying to the Assembly his sincere greetings and his wishes for every success for the work of this current session.  At the outset I should like to convey to you  Sir  the warmest congratulations of the delegation of Mali on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. Your election is a tribute to your eminent professional skills and is also an expression of the unanimous recognition given by the international community to the commitment of your country  Switzerland  a friend of Mali  to the ideals of our Organization. I assure you of my delegation’s constant support in fulfilling your mandate. Allow me also to express our deep appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  for his deep commitment and the remarkable manner in which he guided our work during the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. In turn  I commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his constant efforts and his commitment to meeting the aims and objectives of this Organization.  On 28 September 1960  only a few days after the proclamation of independence  my country  Mali  became a Member of the United Nations. Today  on 28 September 2010  50 years later  I  speaking to you from this selfsame rostrum  would like to reaffirm with force and conviction the commitment of the Republic of Mali to the promotion of the principles and purposes of the Charter  the establishment of friendly relations with all nations of the world and the promotion of international cooperation  and to contributing to the dawning of a world of peace  justice and progress.  Indeed  today a new Mali is on the rise. Under the leadership of President Amadou Toumani Touré  this new Mali continues to progress towards the development and well-being of its people  each day further building upon the gains of peaceful democracy  recognized worldwide as being exemplary  and further enhances its presence in Africa and on the international stage. Today  on 28 September 2010  I convey here and now to the peoples of the world  to the Governments of friendly countries  and to Mali’s development partners  the greetings and gratitude of my country and reaffirm the solidarity and commitment of the Republic of Mali in our shared quest for a better world. This general debate has opened by setting out to tackle a timely subject  the reaffirmation of the central role of the United Nations in global governance. In this regard  Mali reiterates from the outset its faith in the capacity of the Organization to be a catalyst in the processes of global democratization and governance. In that connection my country  Mali  continues to call for a reform of the global economic and financial architecture  the only way to prevent the occurrence of even worse crises. In the same vein  Mali believes that just and equitable representation of all regions of the world must be guaranteed within our Organization  in particular through Security Council reform.  In that regard  Mali reaffirms its adherence to the Ezulwini Consensus and to the Sirte Declaration  adopted by the heads of State and Government of the African Union  and fully supports Africa’s demand for two permanent seats and five non-permanent seats. A reformed Council would better reflect the geopolitical realities of the world today  thus contributing towards repairing the historical injustices towards Africa  the only region of the world not to have a permanent seat on the Security Council. In the same spirit Mali  together with all other Member States  will strive to reinforce the effectiveness of the role of the Council and to promote the revitalization of the General Assembly.  With only five years now to the 2015 deadline set to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and in spite of the tireless efforts made by many developing countries  millions of people worldwide are still waiting for the Millennium Declaration to take concrete effect. The High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals  which has just concluded  would have been a useful opportunity for heads of States and Government to evaluate the progress made in various areas  draw lessons from the best practices and define approaches towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. For its part  the Republic of Mali is resolutely committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals in a sustainable manner through the adoption of a 10-year plan for the years 2006-2015  and through the implementation of a strategic framework for growth and poverty reduction and a project for economic and   21 10-55276  social development  all of which focus in particular on agriculture and food security  education and health.  From this rostrum I invite the international community to continue to support our efforts in implementing this range of economic and social development policies in Mali  as we are encouraged by the results achieved in previous strategies. Indeed  the implementation of such strategies has made it possible to increase the schooling rate from 64 per cent in 2002 to 80 per cent in 2008. Mortality for children under the age of 5 has fallen from 229 per thousand in 2001 to 191 per thousand in 2006  while HIV/AIDS prevalence has fallen from 1.7 per cent in 2001 to 1.3 per cent in 2006. Thus  Mali deems it essential to expedite the implementation of the commitments made at key international conferences  particularly the Monterrey International Conference on Financing for Development  the Brussels Conference on the Least Developed Countries  the Barbados Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States and the Almaty Conference on landlocked developing States.  Undoubtedly climate change poses one of the greatest challenges currently facing the international community. Today more than ever  the survival of our planet is threatened by natural disasters caused by this phenomenon  which seriously affects the living conditions in developing countries such as my own through — in our case — the encroachment of the desert  the silting up of the Niger river  the deterioration of our ecosystem  the shortening of the winter season and poor rainfall distribution. That is why Mali will spare no effort to make its modest contribution towards finding a global and binding agreement on climate change. To that end  in November 2010 my country will host a regional forum on sustainable development.  The AIDS pandemic continues to hamper development efforts in many countries and thus poses one of the greatest threats to the survival of humanity and global security. In keeping with the Abuja Declaration on HIV/AIDS  Tuberculosis and Other Related Infectious Diseases  the Brazzaville Commitment for universal access to treatment in Africa and the Lomé Declaration on HIV/AIDS in Africa  Mali has launched a vast programme of multisectoral reform  both at the institutional and operational levels. That programme compels all the sectors  in particular the public  private and civil society sectors  to become better organized in order to better coordinate their activities to combat AIDS effectively and be held accountable to the nation.  The new transnational threats of trafficking in drugs  arms  human beings and terrorism seriously jeopardize international peace and security. The international community must resolutely tackle those threats. That means acting quickly and effectively. As I underscored in the General Assembly during the second review of the United Nations global counter-terrorism strategy on 8 September 2010  Mali has adopted a new strategy to combat the lack of security and terrorism. On the one hand  this new strategy seeks to strengthen national capacities through robust actions in the field of security and community development and on the other hand it seeks to promote effective regional cooperation with the unified commitment of States of the Sahelo-Saharan region and with the support of the international community. Building on this same impetus  the President of the Republic of Mali  His Excellency Mr. Amadou Toumani Touré  has taken the initiative of organizing a conference in Mali on peace  security and development in the Sahelo-Saharan region.  The maintenance of international peace and security has been and will remain one of the most pressing concerns of the international community. Without peace there is no development or prosperity  nor will there be  and that is why Mali remains firmly attached to the ideals of peace and stability  both within and beyond its borders. In this regard  we welcome the progress made in national reconstruction and reconciliation  in peacebuilding and in the process of democratic transition  in particular in Guinea-Bissau  the Republic of Guinea  Côte d’Ivoire and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.   In the Middle East  we reaffirm our solidarity with our brother Palestinian people in their courageous struggle for the creation of an independent and sovereign State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital  and we have closely followed the evolving situation in that part of the world and continue to support the relevant resolutions of the United Nations in this area.  To conclude  I should like to reiterate our solidarity with the brotherly people of Haiti  as they seek to rebuild their country  and to express our deep sympathy to the victims of the natural disasters that have afflicted China  India  Pakistan  Russia and other    10-55276 22  countries  in particular in Africa. Millions of people worldwide continue to place their hopes in the United Nations  and  as the community of nations  we do not have the right to let them down. It is our obligation to guarantee sustainable development for future generations and to preserve them from the scourge of war."
"114",4682,"MLT",65,2010,"Mr. President  I would like to join other delegations that have preceded me in offering my congratulations and those of my delegation on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I am convinced that your political experience and diplomatic skill will assist and guide this Assembly in its deliberations  especially in addressing important and critical issues on the international agenda.  I also congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  for the excellent manner in which he presided over the sixty-fourth session of the Assembly. Through his commitment and leadership role  Mr. Treki successfully guided the Assembly in dealing effectively with a number of priority issues facing our Organization.  I also take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his dedication and untiring efforts to ensure that our Organization lives up to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. His comprehensive report on the work of the Organization (A/65/1) indicates in no uncertain terms the progress the United Nations has made under his leadership and guidance  for which Malta is extremely grateful.  During the past 12 months  the international community has been overwhelmed by the global and financial crises. The crises have been exacerbated by many humanitarian tragedies around the world. Natural disasters  terrorist attacks  armed violence and internal conflicts have continued to produce havoc  destruction  loss of life and the increased forced displacement of people worldwide. In the face of these negative realities  our Organization has continued to be the refuge of the most vulnerable and deprived of our societies  to address increasing inequalities  to respond cohesively and rapidly to disasters and calamities  and to seek to improve the very nature of the existence and survival of humankind. It is an accepted norm that there is no development without security  no security without development  and neither without respect for human rights.  Important achievements have been registered in recent months in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation. The new Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms  designed to replace the 1991 START I agreement and signed in Prague in April by the Presidents of the United States and the Russian Federation  created the appropriate political momentum for preparing the way for a successful outcome to the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).    10-55264 2   Malta is particularly pleased that among the agreed actions taken by the Conference was the endorsement by the NPT States parties of the convening by the Secretary-General  the Russian Federation  the United Kingdom and the United States  in consultation with the countries of the region  of a conference in 2012 to address the establishment in the Middle East of a zone free of nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction.  The General Assembly’s resolutions recognize that positive developments worldwide  but particularly in Europe  the Maghreb and the Middle East  can be enhanced by closer Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in all spheres. Thirty-five years ago  on 1 August 1975  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe — now the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) — meeting in Helsinki  Finland  adopted the Final Act  incorporating an important chapter dedicated exclusively to the Mediterranean that affirmed  among other things  that security in the Mediterranean is closely linked to European security  as well as to international peace and security.  Malta  a European country but nonetheless Mediterranean  has worked for many years  and even since becoming a Member of this Organization  towards a Euro Mediterranean foreign policy that embraces confidence- and security-building initiatives that further enhance dialogue and understanding in our region. Indeed  my country has been present at the creation of all the Mediterranean forums in existence today. Through its membership of the European Union  Malta has solidified these efforts in a manner that promotes the ever-increasing connectedness of the European-Mediterranean partnership.  Today  Malta is the host of the European Commission-League of Arab States Liaison Office  which has formalized relations between the European Commission and the Arab world in a way that has never been done before. Indeed  Malta has translated its character as an interlocutor with a European identity and Mediterranean characteristics into the role of a political and cultural bridge to our neighbours to the North and South  and even beyond.  But our commitment to the Mediterranean dimension does not stop there. Malta continues to seize every opportunity to contribute further to this dialogue of partners. This has certainly been the case within the Union for the Mediterranean  where Malta has played an active part in ensuring that the requisite momentum is maintained despite occasional political hurdles. In the institutional domain  Malta has nominated a Deputy Secretary-General  an honour accorded to six Union members. The Maltese Deputy Secretary-General has been entrusted with the portfolio covering social and civil affairs  an area undoubtedly of vital interest to all Union partners.  Next month  Malta will host the Mediterranean Conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  which will address  from a Mediterranean perspective  issues currently being debated within the OSCE in the dialogue on the future of European security. On 8 and 9 November  Malta will be the venue for the first regional conference for the Mediterranean of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations. The regional conference is expected to adopt a strategy document and an action plan expressing the commitment of the Group of Friends of the Alliance to advancing goals in concrete terms in a region where intercultural dialogue and cooperation have great potential for success in overcoming the big challenges the region faces.  In the first half of 2011 Malta  a member of the Western Mediterranean Forum since 1991  intends to host the second Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Forum  known as the 5+5. The convening of the Summit  the second of its kind in seven years  should  among other purposes  serve to reaffirm the relevance of the 5+5 dialogue in the current context. Malta continues to attach great value to this informal mechanism as a platform for open and frank discussion between North and South.  It is also of satisfaction to record the successful first joint International Meeting in Support of Israeli-Palestinian Peace  held in Malta last February  and organized by the United Nations Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean. In this context I would like to recognize the importance of resolution 64/124  adopted by the General Assembly in December 2009  whereby the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean  whose seat is in Malta  was granted observer status and invited to participate in the sessions and work of the General Assembly.   3 10-55264   That brings me to an issue that closely involves the Mediterranean region. I am referring to the situation in the Middle East  with the Palestinian question at its core. Malta joins other Member States in welcoming the decision reached last month between the Israelis and the Palestinians to resume direct negotiations to resolve all permanent status issues. The launching of direct negotiations on 2 September in Washington  D.C.  followed by the Sharm el-Sheikh and Jerusalem meetings  has renewed the sense of urgency and expectation for the resolution of an issue that has been on the international agenda for these last 62 years. The intense and unstinting efforts made during these past few months by the Quartet  the Secretary-General and the Arab League  as well as the Israelis and Palestinians themselves  in addition to the valuable contribution of the United States Administration  have opened new possibilities for the emergence of an independent  democratic and viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel. As a member of the international community  Malta will continue to play its part within the United Nations  the European Union and other international  regional and subregional forums to support the creation of the right conditions for all peoples of the Mediterranean and the Middle East to live in peace and prosperity.  This year has brought us stark reminders of the devastation and loss of life that we can expect from climate change if it continues unabated. Yet  despite such warnings  the international community has yet to adopt a sufficiently ambitious response strategy that would bind us all to contributing fairly to mitigating climate change  keeping it within manageable limits. Important steps have indeed been taken over the past two decades  but the great expectations of a decisive push forward in Copenhagen last year were not realized. Nevertheless  we must persevere on the road ahead — perhaps more pragmatically than dramatically. Copenhagen did produce several seeds of agreement that can be harvested in Cancún in December  where operational decisions could advance action on several fronts of broad interest to Member States.  Integrating the expected climatic impacts into our vision of the future is in fact a requirement for all of us  large and small. Yet the topic often lingers on the sidelines of policymaking. We must give adaptation the political and economic attention it deserves and ensure well-targeted financial support to vulnerable countries or communities most in need of it. I would also like to underline the potential of cooperative action on adaptation at regional levels  and it is in this context that Malta is supporting the Mediterranean Climate Change Initiative announced by the Prime Minister of Greece.  The protection of the human being continues to constitute a top priority for my country. In this regard  we have witnessed during the past year important developments within the United Nations that will significantly contribute to delivering results for a more just world and to putting system-wide coherence into practice. We note the progress  small but most welcome  on the discussion on the responsibility to protect. It will be recalled that five years ago  the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) called for an expansion of the United Nations capabilities for early warning and assessment of possible genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity  in addition to supporting the establishment of an early warning capability. Malta therefore highly commends the interactive dialogue that took place in July and commends the initiative of the Secretary-General to set up a United Nations joint office to deal with the prevention of genocide and the wider range of crimes and violations covered by the responsibility to protect.  Another important development has been the United Nations Global Plan of Action against Trafficking in Persons (see resolution 64/293  annex). Still another aspect of human trafficking is the smuggling of human beings. The phenomenon of illegal immigration  stoked by the greed and callous operations of organized criminal groups in the Mediterranean  is putting at risk the lives of hundreds of immigrants on the threshold of Europe. Malta has for some years now been a country of destination  attracting a disproportionate influx of illegal immigrants and asylum-seekers. Malta’s need for assistance in providing beneficiaries of international protection with a durable solution has been recognized by many. While Malta affirms its commitment to abiding by its international obligations  at the same time we reiterate our calls on the international community to continue to assist us in the process of resettling these unfortunate people.  While not new phenomena  piracy and armed robbery at sea against vessels continue to be an issue of grave concern for international navigation and the    10-55264 4  safety of commercial maritime routes. Malta  as one of the leading flag States in the world  is very much concerned about the increase in the frequency and ferocity of pirate attacks on merchant ships off the coast of Somalia. It is to address that concern that we intend to promote a debate within the international community on new issues  such as piracy  in the sphere of the law of the sea which have cropped up since the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982.  We intend to launch a fresh and constructive debate among like-minded States on the question of human responsibilities. Even though we are here treading on ground that may prove to be difficult  we believe that while the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual form the cornerstone of a free and democratic society  so do human responsibilities. Rights and duties are two sides of the same coin. Our commitment to duties should be as firm as that to rights. Stressing the rights of society and our duties towards others — which in no case should overshadow our attention to the rights of the individual — puts emphasis on that which keeps society together. Malta shall take up this matter to achieve a measure of progress in this field in the international community.  Before concluding  allow me to pay a tribute in memory to President Guido de Marco  one of my predecessors  who as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs  and as President of Malta  bestowed honour on his country and the people of Malta  which he loved dearly. His passing away last month left a great void not only among the Maltese population  but also for the many who worked with him for the betterment of those in the international community who are oppressed  weak and vulnerable.  Twenty years ago  this Assembly elected him to serve as President at the forty-fifth session. His strong belief in and steadfast support of the United Nations can be encapsulated in his own words at the opening plenary of the session on 18 September 1990 when  in referring to the enormous challenges that lay ahead  he stated that  “equally enormous is the political will to guarantee that mankind’s destiny is safeguarded not only by individual countries  but by a strong United Nations” (A/45/PV.1  p. 22).  His election as President ushered in  among other things  new initiatives for the revitalization of our General Assembly — a legacy that has continued and continues today. By following Guido de Marco’s vision for and love of the United Nations  my country shall continue supporting this Organization and its Secretary-General to make our world a better place for present and future generations."
"115",4728,"MMR",65,2010,"May I  on behalf of the Myanmar delegation and on my own behalf  begin by extending to the President our warm congratulations on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We are confident that under his wise and able leadership our deliberations will produce fruitful results. Allow me also to express my delegation’s appreciation to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.  There is no doubt that the United Nations is the best forum for practising multilateralism to address the challenges facing the world today. The near-universal participation of the world’s nations in this global body is a living testimony to that. At the heart of its Charter lies the maintenance of international peace and security as the main noble purpose of the United Nations  which all Member States are committed to strive for.  While the United Nations has been devoting the larger portion of its attention to maintaining international peace and security  new forms of global challenges such as climate change  poverty  hunger  water and energy insecurity have emerged and demand the international community’s urgent and careful attention. At the same time  humankind’s shared dream of making the world a prosperous  peaceful  just and   15 10-55264  secure place remains elusive. The world today remains full of inequality  injustice  conflict  instances of the use of force  interference in the internal affairs of States and attempts to impose domination on developing nations.  Against that backdrop  the pre-eminent role of the United Nations in advancing peace  security and development must be asserted and enhanced in order to effectively address those daunting challenges. We therefore wish to stress the pressing need for strengthening the United Nations with speedy reform measures  adapting it to present-day realities in order to make it more democratic and effective in meeting growing challenges.  Myanmar firmly believes that any reform effort must be aimed at strengthening the central role of the United Nations in global governance. We share the widespread view that the United Nations must be reformed to reflect its increasing membership and to push for internal reform measures  including revitalization of the General Assembly and reform of the Security Council. We share the view that the reform of the Council must be designed to make it more transparent  more efficient and more accountable. We also support the idea of expanding both categories of Council membership.  With only five years remaining before the target deadline  the international community must step up its efforts to realize the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. We therefore welcome the successful convening of the High-level Plenary Meeting on the MDGs and its sideline activities last week here in New York. While important improvements have been made globally  progress towards achieving our MDG targets is not sufficient as yet.  Progress remains uneven and varies from region to region. While national Governments have the primary responsibility to ensure progress  the international community must help by creating an environment that would enable developing countries to make greater strides on their road to development. International assistance plays an important catalytic role in the developing countries’ efforts to attain their development goals.  We therefore wish to emphasize here that fulfilment by developed countries of their official development assistance commitments  increased investment flows  market access and resolution of debt problems are essential to enabling the developing countries to realize their MDG targets. It is high time that the unjust and coercive economic measures and trade embargoes that are hampering the attainment of the MDGs and the development of the developing countries  and thus hurting the people  be removed.  We are pleased to report that despite challenges  Myanmar has made certain progress towards achieving most of the eight MDGs in varying degrees  especially in areas such as poverty alleviation  food security and the promotion of education and health.  As a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to the Treaty on the South-East Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone  Myanmar has all along recognized the legitimate right of every State to the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. However  we firmly oppose the proliferation or production of nuclear weapons and strongly support any efforts leading to realization of the vision of a nuclear-weapon-free world.  Therefore we heartily welcomed the signing of the New START treaty by the leaders of the United States and the Russian Federation with a view to reducing their respective nuclear arsenals. It gave us hope and expectation with respect to the elimination of nuclear weapons and further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms. We also join others in calling for the early entry into force and full implementation of the New START treaty.  In our noble fight against growing transnational crime and terrorism  no single country can act alone  as it requires a global solution and concerted action by the world’s nations. Myanmar unequivocally condemns all forms and manifestation of terrorism. We are working closely with the international community to strengthen our efforts and cooperation in regional and multilateral frameworks in order to prevent and combat terrorism and transnational crime  such as illicit drug trafficking  trafficking in persons and cybercrime. We are also working together with fellow members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to step up efforts to deal with prevention  control  preparedness and response to pandemic diseases in our region.  The issue of climate change has become a pressing global challenge that threatens humankind. The environmental problem knows no national boundaries; no country can be insulated from the consequences of climate change. The unprecedented    10-55264 16  frequency and severity of recent natural disasters  such as the earthquake in Haiti  floods in China and Pakistan and heat waves around the world  clearly testify to the consequences of global climate change.  Myanmar was also a victim of climate change in May 2008  when it was hit by the devastating Cyclone Nargis  the strongest ever in our history. After more than two years we are pleased to say that we have now passed the emergency relief stage and successfully rebuilt better in the affected areas through our massive reconstruction efforts  together with the United Nations  ASEAN and the international community. I wish to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to the international community for all the humanitarian assistance to Myanmar in response to that natural disaster.  In addressing the pressing global issue of climate change we must redouble our efforts not only to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions but also to provide financial resources and technology to developing countries so that they might take effective mitigation and adaptation measures. Although industrialized countries are mainly responsible for climate change  the developing countries are the most severely affected by its consequences. Myanmar therefore believes that any approach to address climate change must be based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.  We therefore look forward to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Cancún  Mexico  later this year. We hope the negotiations in that Conference will result in fruitful outcomes that will translate into concrete action on commitments made by the developed countries to reduce substantive emissions and to assist developing countries in their mitigation and adaptation efforts.  May I take this opportunity to briefly apprise this Assembly of ongoing political developments in my country  Myanmar.  Today  Myanmar is at a critical phase of its political transformation. The multiparty-democracy general elections are set to be held on 7 November 2010  as the fifth step of our charted political road map. A total of 37 political parties  including those representing various ethnic nationalities and groups  will take part. Over 3 000 candidates will contest for a total of 1 171 seats in the Peoples’ Parliament  the National Parliament and state/regional parliaments. Such a large participation has made it crystal clear that the elections have become virtually inclusive. Political parties have already started their campaign activities. The people will exercise their democratic right to elect the representatives of their choice who can best serve their interests.  Based upon its ample experience and lessons learned in holding multiparty general elections  Myanmar is confident of its ability to conduct the elections in an orderly manner. Whatever challenges may face us  we are committed to do our best to hold successful  free and fair general elections in the best interest of the country and its people.  As our new State Constitution subscribes to the present foreign policy  we believe that the new Government to emerge after the elections will continue to embrace the policy of maintaining and strengthening friendly relations with all nations and will work closely with the United Nations. Myanmar looks forward to strengthening closer engagements with the international community in the post election era."
"116",4739,"MNE",65,2010,"It is a great pleasure for me to address this distinctive forum  which continues to bring together the most responsible people  committed to achieving and protecting the common good  peace and stability. This meeting also confirms the irreplaceable role of the United Nations in the international community and the respect in which it is held.  Following the valuable contribution made by the previous President of the General Assembly  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  I would like to welcome the election of Joseph Deiss as the President of the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session  and to wish him every success. I also pay special tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his consistent reaffirmation of the United Nations as an indispensable player in solving crucial issues that have long been on the international agenda  which has become more complex and demanding than ever.  As the youngest Member of the United Nations  Montenegro has proved itself a reliable partner in the United Nations mission to strive for a world of peace  security and prosperity for everyone. At the same time  thanks to United Nations support  Montenegro has significantly enhanced its standing in international organizations  while ensuring the quality of reforms in its own State and society. The current improvement in global finances  albeit slight  shows that  in addition to the crucial role of the largest and richest countries  especially the Group of Eight and the Group of 20  the United Nations is essential to actions undertaken for the stabilization of the global economy.  Montenegro supports the pragmatic reform of the United Nations. We also welcome the recent adoption of General Assembly resolution 64/289 on system-wide    10-54965 28  coherence and the timely initiative of Assembly President Joseph Deiss to make the theme of this year’s general debate the reaffirmation of the central role of the United Nations in global governance.  The protection of international peace and stability continues to be a focus of the General Assembly agenda. Convinced that no progress or stability can be ensured without peace and security  Montenegro supports and contributes to the efforts of the United Nations in this regard  affirming the basic principles of the United Nations Charter relating to the peaceful settlement of disputes through diplomatic channels.  Mindful of our foreign policy priorities of European and Euro-Atlantic integration  when considering and taking any concrete action concerning conflict zones in the framework of the United Nations  Montenegro harmonizes its policy with European Union foreign policy  taking due account of specific national interests. We are best able to contribute by continuing to play a constructive role as a stabilizing factor in the international community  especially in the Western Balkans and South-East Europe.  We strongly support United Nations efforts in implementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  and we welcome the idea of more intensive activities in the preparation and drafting of a United Nations convention on international terrorism. Montenegro is of the opinion that only through the coordinated efforts of the international community can global terrorism be defeated. We support the various United Nations documents on the fight against corruption  organized crime  illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and trafficking in human beings.  Montenegro has fully committed itself to implementing all international legal instruments fostering disarmament and arms control. We support any new constructive initiative aimed at strengthening international cooperation for the reduction and elimination of all types of arms and lethal weapons.  Montenegro deeply appreciates the importance and role of the United Nations peacekeeping mission as a unique instrument for the creation and maintenance of peace and peacebuilding in conflict zones. Decades-long experience in peacekeeping operations confirms the validity of this concept and the strategic policy of the United Nations. Peacekeeping operations have been successful in reducing the negative effects of conflicts and preventing their further escalation and disruption of regional and international peace  stability and security.  Although a small country — and the youngest Member of the United Nations — Montenegro fully assumes its responsibility to contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability  as is demonstrated by our continuously enhanced participation. We will make further contributions in line with international efforts and in keeping with our tradition  the Principality of Montenegro having  as a sovereign State  participated in the international peacekeeping mission back in 1897.  Montenegro believes in the crucial importance of the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and of achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We are sure that this aim will be furthered by the exchange of views and recommendations at the recent High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals  and Montenegro supports the implementation of all relevant strategies  programmes and initiatives of the United Nations in this regard. The crisis has also brought home to us the necessity of further realizing the sustainable development concept  which requires a balance between economic and social development and environmental protection. To this end  we remain committed to the resolutions of the United Nations and the Commission on Sustainable Development  which have also been fully reflected in the Millennium Declaration of 2000.  Montenegro supports the ongoing efforts and attention of the United Nations to the current challenges in Africa. To this end  the fulfilment of the MDGs and the implementation of all United Nations documents  including the Millennium summit decisions  is of crucial importance.   As a country engaged in the process of European integration  Montenegro supports partnership relationships between the European Union and Africa  as well as efforts undertaken to solve development challenges and eradicate poverty on the African continent.  In the context of climate change and its adverse effects  we are fully committed to finding a common response in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We are deeply committed to this end  in view of the effects of the natural disasters that occurred in the past year causing heavy loss of life and enormous material   29 10-54965  damage  in particular the earthquake in Haiti and the floods in Pakistan. Therefore  a global response and action is required  and not only at the humanitarian level. Efforts aimed at reducing the effects of natural disasters and at the rebuilding and further development of affected regions and countries are also necessary.  In order to act responsibly with respect to the complex issue of climate change  we have established  together with neighbouring countries and countries from the region  a regional forum in Montenegro which deals with the prevention of climate change and related challenges at the national and regional levels.  Montenegro is fully dedicated to the promotion and universal protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms for everyone. We strongly support the activities of the Human Rights Council and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights  including their more intensive functional interaction with the General Assembly and relevant Committees.  We believe in the potential and capacities of the United Nations  especially when strengthened by the active participation and robust contributions of each Member State  to find adequate responses and take actions aimed at resolving the ever-increasing global challenges. As an institution dedicated to individuals and humankind collectively  which continues to affirm peace and prosperity  the United Nations remains of irreplaceable global value  and Montenegro is proud to belong to it.   I assure the Assembly that Montenegro will continue to give its strong support to strengthening and upholding the United Nations  so that the latter may improve its efficiency  responsibility and readiness to meet the needs of each Member State."
"117",4785,"MNG",65,2010,"This session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when certain signs of recovery are being observed in the wake of the global economic and financial crisis  and come on the heels of sharp spikes in food and energy prices. Although the world is still grappling with the effects of those multiple and interrelated crises  the call of last week’s summit on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for intensified collective action gives hope for optimism.  As the world plunged into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression  the best minds around the globe sought clear answers as to what went wrong and what needed to be rectified. Many argued that the economic theories referred to as neoliberalism or market fundamentalism  which have prevailed for the past quarter century  were flawed. Their main premise — based on the notion  for instance  that markets are self-correcting and that regulation is accordingly unnecessary — seems to have been proved wrong.  The experience of countries and regions that have achieved rapid growth and progress in poverty reduction has shown that the State can deliberately intervene in the economy and even correct market-based incentives in such a way as to promote inclusive growth and sustainable development. Hence  a new concept of development is emerging that envisions a reversal in the thinking on the roles of the State and the market.  As a generator of the new and innovative ideas and development notions that have changed the world in the past  the United Nations is  in our view  the right place to engage intimately in nurturing such fundamental concepts  which could have a huge impact on the development policies and prospects of its Member States. That could prove to be an important aspect of the deliberations that the President proposed as the theme for this debate — “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance”.  It has been widely recognized that today’s global challenges require global solutions. The underlying principles and characteristics of the United Nations make it an indispensable part of the evolving global governance system. The United Nations is the world’s most universal  legitimate and authoritative organization and a political centre for global cooperation. It represents a unique forum for synthesizing solutions to global problems  ranging from nuclear weapons to climate change  and development to human rights. It is at the United Nations that we see world leaders commit themselves to making the world a safer  fairer  more prosperous and greener place to live for this and future generations.  Yet  it is a fact that there are challenges that have found or are seeking to find solution outside the United Nations. A legitimate question would be: why? There may be many factors at play and many facets to cover in finding an easy answer to that question. But what has emerged as obvious from our deliberations is the fact that  if the United Nations is to reaffirm its central role in global governance  it will have to be efficient and its reform vigorously pursued.  The revitalization of the General Assembly must be further pursued so that our deliberations and decisions have a more practical and meaningful impact on the lives of the people in whose name we act here. The role of the Economic and Social Council in global economic decision-making must be enhanced. The reform of the Security Council  aimed at making it more representative of the world’s current reality  will certainly be a critical boost to reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance. Mongolia stands for a just and equitable enlargement of the Security Council by increasing the number of permanent and non-permanent seats and ensuring the fair representation of developing and developed countries alike.  Development  peace and security  and human rights are the three main pillars of the United Nations. Mongolia welcomes the revitalization of the United Nations development agenda  as attested by the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the   5 10-55128  Millennium Development Goals last week and  most importantly  by the vibrant international debate in the lead-up to the summit. As a result  we are clearly in a much better place today as regards world leaders’ commitment to intensifying the efforts towards the achievement of the MDGs by 2015.  On our part  my Government recommitted itself  at the Summit  to the acceleration of our efforts towards poverty reduction  gender equality and environmental sustainability  the three MDGs where we are lagging behind. We have committed ourselves to a multisectoral  participatory and people-centred approach to the implementation of the MDGs  to improved governance as a foundation for successful development outcomes  and to better monitoring and evaluation of our work as we move forward.  As we intensify our poverty reduction efforts at home  we plan to focus more on issues of gender equality and the empowerment of women as a critical part of success. My Government is confident that the newly created UN Women will be an important partner in this endeavour. This year  Mongolia presented its national voluntary presentation on gender equality and the empowerment of women to the Economic and Social Council and will proceed to improve the legislative framework enabling women to realize more fully their economical and political potential  have better access to health services for themselves and their children  and participate more visibly in democratic governance.  Attending to the needs of the most vulnerable is at the core of the United Nations development agenda. As a landlocked developing country  Mongolia  along with other fellow Members  strives to advocate the interests of that group of countries. Despite the progress in implementing the priorities of the Almaty Programme of Action  the landlocked developing countries continue to be marginalized from international trade. They still experience higher costs of moving goods across borders  which puts their products at a competitive disadvantage and discourages foreign investment.  With a view to maximizing our coordinated efforts for the full and effective implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action and the MDGs through enhanced analytical capability and home-grown research on our specific needs  Mongolia initiated the establishment of the International Think Tank for the Landlocked Developing Countries. I am delighted to inform Member States today that the multilateral agreement for that institution was endorsed by the ministers for foreign affairs of the landlocked developing countries last week at their ninth annual meeting. I extend my Government’s sincere appreciation to all stakeholders  including the Secretary-General  the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries  Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States  and our fellow members for their unwavering support.  Climate change is another critical area for global governance. Building on progress achieved in Copenhagen in shaping a broad political consensus  it is imperative now to invigorate global negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in the lead-up to the sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties in Cancún later this year.  The impact of climate change on Mongolia is undeniable. In less than 20 years  more than 70 per cent of our territory has been affected by desertification. Hundreds of rivers  springs and lakes have dried up  causing water shortages and biodiversity loss. Yet  climate change adaptation and mitigation techniques suitable for scaling up to meet the country’s needs have yet to be fully identified and introduced. The strategies and programmes in place have failed to yield the desired results  and the emergence of mining as a major industry has only heightened concerns over the environment. The sustainable management of natural resources and addressing the country’s ecological vulnerability will therefore need our sustained focus in the years ahead. Four issues — enforcement  dedication  financing and development cooperation — stand out as our priorities in addressing these challenges.  Last month  my Government held a special Cabinet meeting in the sands of the Gobi Desert. Desertification is an issue of vital concern to more than 1 billion people in over 100 countries. Continued land degradation  be it from climate change or unsustainable agriculture  is a serious threat to the food security and  ultimately  the human security of those affected. Through the message sent from Gobi  my Government expressed its firm resolve to effectively address desertification within the framework of the United    10-55128 6  Nations Decade for Deserts and the Fight Against Desertification.  In 2010  we have seen renewed international optimism with regard to the multilateral disarmament agenda. This shift in climate was reinforced by the new START agreement and the outcome of the Nuclear Security Summit  both of which were welcomed by my Government and reflected in the outcome of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The Conference agreed on forward-looking action plans that impart much-needed momentum to the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons. Mongolia welcomes this outcome and is proud of the contribution it made towards nuclear disarmament and nuclear  non-proliferation by declaring its territory to be nuclear-weapon-free. This status is fully recognized by the international community  as attested by the final document of the NPT Review Conference.  Mongolia welcomes the increasing role of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in contributing to freedom from fear and freedom from want. The achievement of the MDGs will depend to some extent on the contribution of nuclear applications in such areas as nuclear energy  health care  and food and environmental security. Mongolia is expanding its cooperation with the Agency  especially in human resource development and nuclear applications in health and agriculture. Our 2009-2014 country programme framework  signed last year with the Agency  added the development of nuclear energy infrastructure and the country’s uranium reserves as priority areas of cooperation.  This year  Mongolia has been designated one of the eight Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy model demonstration site countries. This will help Mongolia to most effectively address the increasing cancer epidemic and to share its experience with other developing countries. I would like  therefore  to take this opportunity to express my Government’s gratitude to IAEA and its Director General for their valuable support.  Mongolia welcomes the second review of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  which  while emphasizing national implementation  stressed the importance of assisting Member States in this task. Mongolia takes seriously its responsibility to contribute to the global counter-terrorism endeavour and is party to all anti-terrorism instruments. Last May  we hosted  together with the United Nations  a subregional workshop on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). We firmly believe in the vital importance of furthering development  democracy and respect for human rights in fighting terrorism and in building States’ capacities to combat it.  Peacekeeping is an important tool for global governance in the hands of the United Nations. Since its inception  United Nations peacekeeping has contributed to preventing and managing violent conflicts and supporting nations in protecting and building peace in a post-conflict environment. Over the past decade  it has undertaken important reforms to make peacekeeping stronger  more effective and comparatively cost-efficient. Mongolia wishes to see more coherent interaction between the peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts of the United Nations.  Over the past decade  Mongolia has taken deliberate steps to enhance its participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions. Mongolia now participates in six United Nations-mandated peacekeeping operations — including the most challenging ones in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Chad and Darfur — and stands ready to further expand its participation.  In the recent past  Mongolia has been an active participant in international activities aimed at strengthening institutions and processes of democratic governance  protecting human rights and promoting democratic consolidation. The 1992 Constitution of Mongolia guarantees the Mongolian people fundamental freedoms and human rights. Mongolia is party to all major international human rights instruments. An independent National Human Rights Commission was set up  and a national human rights action programme adopted in 2003 is being implemented. The programme is a main policy document that aims at improving the capacity and accountability of the authorities; enhancing the participation of civil society  mass media and the private sector; and encouraging public motivation for strengthening human rights protections and combating human rights violations. All in all  our efforts can be summed up by affirming that political commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights  along with the setting of standards  is in place in Mongolia.   7 10-55128   However  as has been rightly said  no human rights record is perfect. The implementation of human rights commitments in my country is hampered largely by two gaps  namely  a knowledge gap and a capacity gap. Furthermore  emerging transboundary threats  such as the spread of HIV and AIDS and other infectious diseases  human trafficking  migration and others  require an adequate collective response based on effective regional and international cooperation. Mongolia looks forward to constructive engagement with the Human Rights Council as it prepares to consider our national human rights report under the Universal Periodic Review in early November this year.  Direct civic engagement is essential to any type of governance  at both the national and the international levels. My Government endeavours to actively engage civil society and communities in policy development and implementation. We have a partnership agreement with civil society and  through our open Government website  citizens relay their views and comments to assist in drafting policy papers and laws prior to their consideration by the Cabinet.  Over the past two months  I have travelled extensively across the country to see first hand the development challenges being faced in the countryside and to hear views at the grass-roots level. This kind of direct interaction is essential to identifying people’s immediate and long-term needs alike and to reflecting their concerns in the Government’s activities. Earlier this year  through the Mongolia Economic Forum  we also had an extensive discussion on economic and development issues with businesses  civil society and media to set our priorities for the years ahead.  The President returned to the Chair.  To have people employed  educated and healthy — in other words  human development — is at the heart of the policies and activities of my Government. Towards this end  my Government is pursuing policies to accelerate inclusive economic growth through wide-scale industrialization and by undertaking mega-projects in mining and infrastructure development. National wealth will be distributed to each and every citizen of Mongolia through a newly established human development fund in the form of regular allowances  as well as through health care  education and housing benefits.  Mongolia has the honour and privilege to assume the chairmanship of the Community of Democracies next year  and looks forward to a strong collaboration with fellow members and other global stakeholders. In conclusion  may I reiterate Mongolia’s strong commitment to and support for the United Nations — a strong  inclusive and open United Nations as the guarantor of global governance."
"118",4826,"MOZ",65,2010,"Mozambique associates itself with previous speakers in congratulating you  Sir  on your unanimous election to preside over the sixty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly.

We reaffirm our commitment to support your presidency and pledge to fully cooperate with you and all the other members of the Bureau in the discharge of your noble mission.  We wish to express our gratitude to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  for his commitment to our Organization and for his strong leadership in carrying out the work of the United Nations  both productively and effectively during the previous General Assembly session.  Equally  I would like to commend the Secretary-General  Ban Ki-moon  for his engagement in promoting peace and justice and  in particular  for his tireless efforts to mobilize the United Nations family to adequately address the global challenges facing the world and humanity through concerted multilateral approaches.  Recognizing the steering role of the United Nations in global governance and highly appreciating the wise choice of reflecting this important and timely item during the present debate  I request your indulgence to seize this opportunity to share some information about developments in Mozambique. As we move steadily towards strengthening the democratic institutions in Mozambique  we are proud to see that   49 10-55128  there have been significant achievements in both the political and the socio-economic spheres of the country.  Indeed  thanks to the strengthened political stability that Mozambique currently enjoys  the Government is undertaking a comprehensive public sector reform and decentralization process in the area of public administration. Similarly  political and social stability and good macroeconomic management  supplemented by the attractive investment legislation already in place  have contributed immensely to creating conditions conducive to promoting economic growth and sustainable development.  Our main goal is to eradicate poverty  as it is one of the major challenges facing our people in their efforts to improve their living conditions. We are fully aware that in fighting poverty we need also to simultaneously address other related challenges  namely  climate change  the energy crisis  food insecurity and the global economic and financial crisis  whose impacts constitute an enduring challenge  especially for developing economies such as that of Mozambique. All those challenges are interrelated and have multiplier effects on our competitiveness and growth efforts.  The threats posed by the negative impact of climate change on our environment need to be continuously dealt with as a priority and should be comprehensively addressed at the national  subregional  regional and international levels. The devastation due to problems originating in climate change is degrading our environment at an astonishing pace. In fact  Mozambique and many other countries in sub-Saharan Africa are being ravaged by cyclical natural disasters that destroy major arable lands and thus reduce land productivity.  There is no doubt that small island developing countries face the risk of disappearing from the world map. At the same time  it is also important to recognize the plight of coastal developing countries like Mozambique  which are suffering from the rise in sea levels.  The heavy burden resulting from the adverse effects of climate change constrains the ability of our Governments to allocate the necessary financial and human resources to decisively address problems related to the environment. Hence  developing countries  particularly sub-Saharan countries  do not have the required financial resources to undertake the necessary steps to mitigate the impact of climate change. To that end  we are committed to continue working in a concerted manner with international development partners  especially the United Nations and other stakeholders with a focus on creating conditions for adaptation and local community resilience to the impact of climate change.  Bearing in mind the principle of common but differentiated responsibility  we would like to underline that our association with the Copenhagen Accord on climate change is based precisely on our understanding that the global nature of climate change demands a true multilateral response. In that regard  we look forward to a successful outcome of the sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change — COP 16 — to be held in Cancún later this year. We commend the active role of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to ensure a meaningful result of the climate change negotiations.  In addressing all the aforementioned challenges  strong and able global governance is of utmost importance to ensure the spurring of the political will needed for concrete actions. The United Nations is the only intergovernmental organization with a universal character and the ability to mobilize such a capacity. That is why we believe that concrete steps to strengthen the central role of the United Nations in global governance are required  through providing it with the adequate resources and authority commensurate with its global responsibility to fully respond to the growing global needs.  Mozambique will remain engaged in the ongoing process of reforming the United Nations to ensure its efficiency and effectiveness  to increase its credibility and legitimacy as a representative of the people of the world.  In that regard  the revitalization of the role and the authority of the General Assembly as the most representative and legitimate organ of the United Nations cannot be overemphasized. It is here where everyone is represented and every vote counts in deciding on matters of common interest. So it is here where all the most important decisions should be taken — from issues related to the maintenance of peace and security  the promotion of economic cooperation and social and humanitarian matters to the promotion of human rights.    10-55128 50  Everyone should abide by and implement all decisions and resolutions taken here. Therefore  we need a strong General Assembly  well resourced and with the necessary authority to assume its responsibilities on behalf of the international community.  Another important track of reform that we are very much attached to is the reform of the Security Council. Although there is no agreement yet on the level of attainment  we all agree that reform of the Council should be a priority in the whole United Nations reform process. It is clear that we need a more balanced representation in the Council. Moreover  we are of the view that a Council that is more fair and democratic in its decisions and actions would adequately meet the security necessities of the international community.  For a meaningful reform of the Security Council  it is imperative that the historic injustice with regard to the African continent be corrected. Indeed  today it is no longer acceptable that a continent that represents almost 30 per cent of the whole United Nations membership and whose concerns constitute more than 60 per cent of the Council’s agenda is not represented in the category of permanent member. In that light  Africa deserves to be allocated permanent seats in any Security Council reform  based on the Ezulwini Consensus.  There is also a need for a more coherent and effective United Nations system  capable of efficiently addressing and advancing durable solutions for the pressing economic  social and humanitarian problems currently facing the world. Member States should also continue to discuss and find measurable solutions on how to ensure coherence between policy decisions and the implementation of commitments agreed in United Nations international conferences and summits in the field of development.  In that regard  Mozambique is proud of the progress made by the General Assembly on system-wide coherence. In particular  we commend the Assembly for its recent major step in the establishment of UN Women. I seize this opportunity to reiterate our congratulations to Her Excellency Ms. Michelle Bachelet on her appointment as Under-Secretary-General of the new entity and pledge our full support for and readiness to collaborate on the successful accomplishment of the task of bringing gender equality and the empowerment of women to the forefront of the United Nations work.  It is also a fact that  although we are open to seeing the result of the independent evaluation of the One United Nations pilot country initiative  it is our strong belief that the progress made so far in the implementation of that initiative is extremely encouraging. Therefore we call on the United Nations to support all countries that voluntarily decide to embark on the process of making the United Nations system work in a more coherent manner at the country level.  With regard to the maintenance of international peace and security  Mozambique is committed to continuing to share its experience in the peaceful resolution of conflicts  particularly in southern Africa. In our subregion  we share important responsibilities in the promotion of peace and security  as well as with regard to regional integration as part of subregional and regional efforts to promote international peace and security and sustainable development.  We advocate international peace and security because we truly believe that they are part of the enabling conditions that allow countries to concentrate their attention on dealing with other pressing needs  such as the fight against HIV/AIDS  malaria and other diseases  the fight against international crime and drug trafficking  addressing poverty-related problems and the promotion of sustainable development.  It is worth noting that the political situation and stability in Southern Africa have improved. Indeed  the process of implementing the Global Political Agreement in Zimbabwe has made significant strides. We also remain committed  under the auspices of the Southern African Development Community  to finding a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict in Madagascar.  We are encouraged by the progress being made in stabilizing the political situation in Guinea-Bissau  especially the ongoing reform of the armed forces and the public administration. I take this opportunity to call on the international community to continue supporting the ongoing efforts of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries and of the United Nations to find a sustainable and lasting peace in that sister country.  Mozambique reiterates its support for the efforts of the international community to find a lasting   51 10-55128  solution to the problem of Western Sahara  and for the right of that country’s people to self-determination.  Mozambique is concerned that despite all continued international efforts  it has not been possible to bring about peace and stability in the Middle East. Mozambique is deeply concerned about the volatile situation in that region  where the conflict between Israel and Palestine continues to deprive the Palestinian people of the realization of their fundamental human rights  including the right to their own land and resources and to live in peace with all neighbouring countries  including  obviously  Israel.  We need a strong United Nations that can play a central role in mobilizing Member States and the international community at large to commit and fully contribute to regional and international peace and security and to an enabling environment for the promotion of sustainable development.  That is why we believe in multilateralism. We reiterate our commitment to work in collaboration with all States Members of the Organization in the pursuit of our common goals to make the world a better place for all humanity."
"119",4872,"MRT",65,2010,"At the outset  allow me to congratulate  on behalf of Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz  President of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania  and on my own behalf  His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session and to wish him every success in his new duties. I have great confidence that his diligent efforts will have a positive impact on our Organization  as did those of his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  whose praiseworthy labours strengthened the ties of cooperation  the bonds of brotherhood  and the universal principles of peace and dialogue within the General Assembly.  It also gives me great pleasure to express my thanks and appreciation to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his serious efforts to achieve   33 10-55103  the objectives of the Organization and to strengthen the pillars of peace  security and prosperity in the world.  Mauritania fulfilled its constitutional obligation by selecting Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz as President of the Republic through elections in which the Mauritanian people expressed their will freely  impartially and maturely. Today  for the first time in its history  my country has taken a comprehensive qualitative leap forward into a new era — which we call “the era of serious work” — to improve the living conditions of Mauritanian citizens  consolidate democracy and build a State that is on good terms with its citizens and its neighbours on the basis of justice  equality and the values of the Republic.  In this new era  there are no political prisoners in Mauritania and the pluralistic Parliament plays its full role in legislating and in supervising the Government. The press exercises its freedom without censorship or constraint  as do political parties  unions and civil society institutions.  Inspired by the electoral platform of President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz  the Government of Mauritania has devoted itself to implementing an ambitious development policy with clearly visible goals  including the elimination of corruption and its consequences; the promotion and use of the country’s resources in a rational  responsible and transparent manner; ensuring respect for the rule of law and the country’s prestige; providing security throughout society; offering basic services  and constructing essential infrastructure needed for the country’s development.  This policy has earned the confidence and support of Mauritania’s brothers  friends and development partners  who  at their round table meeting in Brussels in June  blessed our ambitious development programme and pledged financial support totalling $3.2 billion over three years. In this regard  we thank them sincerely for having made every effort to ensure the success of the round table and for all their support for our development programmes.  In the course of implementing these programmes  Mauritania became a hub of activity as roads and health and education facilities were built and integrated projects established for the purpose of empowering women and youth in order to contribute to the socio-economic development of the country and to improve conditions for the poor and the marginalized  who rejoiced at the election of our President and have granted him the nickname “President of the poor” for his great devotion to and care for the people.  Mauritania  like other countries  is confronted with terrorism and transnational organized crime. Terrorism is a global phenomenon that is not tied to a particular country  continent  religion or society. Any attempt to conflate Islam with this phenomenon is rejected  unacceptable and illogical. Those most affected by terrorism are  after all  the Muslims and the Islamic world.  We believe that the fight against terrorism requires progress in social justice  the training of young people and their integration into an active life. This will give them hope so that they do not become easy recruiting targets for terrorists and extremist organizations.  My country is making diligent efforts on all these fronts and promoting the role of our prominent scholars to debate in the best possible manner and to provide the correct image of Islam  which is a religion of tolerance  virtue and acceptance of others and one that rejects excess and extremism. Moreover  Mauritania  far from being at war with anyone  as His Excellency the President of the Republic has repeatedly said  will spare no effort to maintain peace and security for its citizens and ensure the necessary conditions for the development of the country in security and stability.  The establishment of a united Arab Maghreb is a strategic option for the peoples of the region  and failure to maintain such unity will reflect negatively on the future of that vital region of the world. There is no doubt that finding a timely solution to the issue of Western Sahara and obtaining the consent of the parties concerned would contribute to accelerating the pace of integration of the united Maghreb and enable it to play its full role as an indispensable and effective regional partner.  On the other hand  conscious of the importance of the United Nations as an irreplaceable forum for the voices of Member States and other members of the international community  big and small  powerful and weak  as well as for resolving difficult international issues and coordinating and supporting development efforts  Mauritania supports efforts to reform the Organization and its organs  especially the Security Council.    10-55103 34   We call for the expansion of the Council to include permanent representation for the African continent and the Arab Group  because democracy is an international requirement and not only a national practice or objective. Given their cultural  human and strategic significance  it is neither logical nor acceptable not to grant permanent seats on the Security Council to the African continent and the Arab world.  The Arab-Israeli conflict remains a source of tension and a threat to international peace and security in an extremely sensitive and vital area of the world. That region will know no stability until a definitive solution to the conflict is found. Such a solution must be just and permanent and in accordance with resolutions of international legitimacy. It must allow the brotherly Palestinian people to exercise their full right to establish their independent and viable State in Palestine  with East Jerusalem as its capital. It must also ensure the restoration of all occupied Arab territories  including the Syrian Golan Heights and the Lebanese Shab’a farms.  Mauritania hopes that the direct negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis  sponsored by the United States  will conclude in tangible results and an acceptable time frame. There is no people in the Middle East that needs peace more than the Palestinian people. My country has called for the lifting of the unjust siege on Gaza and for an end to its collective and inhumane punishment. Restoring rights and justice to their owners and between nations and cultures is the best means to achieve peace and security in the world.  Before concluding  allow me to reiterate what I stated a few days ago — the development challenges before us all will be exacerbated unless we all assume our responsibilities and fulfil our commitments. Developing countries require the urgent attention of the international community if they are to achieve the stability  development and progress that will enable them to integrate into the global economic system."
"120",4918,"MUS",65,2010,"I congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session  and I thank your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Ali Treki  for his excellent stewardship of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I seize this opportunity to convey to you the warm greetings of the Honourable Dr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam  Prime Minister of Mauritius.  We are meeting this year against the backdrop of the triple blow of food  fuel and financial crises  which have significantly slowed the social and economic progress of many  particularly developing  countries. Although we are now witnessing signs of gradual recovery  we are nonetheless aware of the fact that the world is still mired in the consequences of the recession.  These crises have exposed the deficiencies of the international financial and governance structure and made us realize that the pre crisis status quo has to be challenged  if we are to ensure a better future for our people. While we acknowledge the pre eminent role that the Group of 20 is playing in addressing the financial and economic crisis  the widening and acceleration of global integration and interconnectedness dictate the necessity of democratizing the international economic and financial decision-making processes in order to ensure that the future development of our global economy is balanced and equitable.  It was therefore reassuring to hear the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund  Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn  stating last Monday   “To regain momentum  we need a sense of shared responsibility among the various actors — the developing countries themselves  the advanced   29 10-55264  economies and  in part  the international financial institutions.” (A/65/PV.3)  The statistics are eloquent regarding the negative impact of the multitude of crises on the progress achieved on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). As global economic output has declined  the ranks of the poor have swelled with the newly poor.  A week ago  from this very rostrum  an impressive number of world leaders reaffirmed their commitments to the Millennium Development Goals. In our drive to enable the less fortunate to lead a dignified life  it is imperative that we have closer cooperation and collaboration between Government  civil society and the private sector  supplemented by innovative thinking  cutting-edge knowledge and path-breaking initiatives.  Success in achieving the Millennium Development Goals is inextricably linked to the broader agenda of climate change. The effects of climate change and global warming threaten the very implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. While climate change is affecting all countries  it is abundantly clear that the small islands and low-lying and coastal States are the most affected by its consequences.  We therefore urge that the small island developing States be given simplified access to financing from the $30 billion of fast-start funding pledged in the Copenhagen Accord and similar access to the longer-term funds proposed for the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund. That adaptation funding should be in the form of grants and not loans.  We hope that the forthcoming Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Cancún later this year  will build on the 2009 Copenhagen Accord to ultimately arrive at a legally binding agreement on limits to greenhouse gas emissions based on the principle of common but differentiated capabilities and responsibilities and the establishment of mitigation and adaptation funds. Let us therefore join our efforts and not miss the opportunity  because a world that is climate-smart is within reach  if we act now  act together and act differently.  In its effort to contribute towards the global momentum to attain a low-carbon future  Mauritius is implementing the Maurice Ile Durable project  which aims at protecting the environment and minimizing dependence on fossil fuels through increased utilization of renewable energy and a more efficient use of energy in general.  The High-level Review Meeting on the implementation of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States re emphasized the fact that  owing to their inherent specificity  small island developing States should be recognized as a distinct category of countries and should be granted special treatment  particularly in accessing official development assistance and concessionary funding. The present gross domestic product criterion applied in graduating least developed countries to middle-income status is most unfair to small island developing States  since it does not take into account the unique vulnerabilities of those States.  The time has come for a shift in how we think of development. We need to articulate strongly a new development paradigm  one where developing countries are part and parcel of the solution to create a more vibrant world economy in this truly multipolar world.  We therefore look forward to the successful conclusion of the Doha Development Round at the earliest possible date. It is also crucial to close the gaps in the provision of Aid for Trade so as to support the building of supply capacity  which lies at the core of development.  At the subregional level  Mauritius  in its capacity as the new chair of the Indian Ocean Commission  will continue to lay greater emphasis on the creation of an economic and commercial space  the implementation of a regional strategy on fisheries and aquaculture  the promotion of tourism in our region in traditional and emerging markets  and the development of a comprehensive regional anti-piracy programme.  A fundamental precondition for socio economic development can be found in a process of social inclusiveness  with human rights at its core. As a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council  Mauritius is firmly committed to the safeguarding and protection of human rights  at both the national and the international levels. In this regard  we unreservedly condemn the serious human rights violations committed by warring factions in conflict zones  where    10-55264 30  vulnerable members of the society  particularly women and children  are being targeted. At the national level  a truth and reconciliation commission has started the challenging task of compiling a report on slavery and indentured labour in Mauritius during the colonial period.  Mauritius continues to be preoccupied with the fate of pro democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi  whose heroic and unbreakable determination and steadfastness to free her people from years of subjugation compel all of us who are strong advocates of democratic values to stand and speak up. Depriving Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi of the right to stand as a candidate in the forthcoming general elections scheduled in November this year is considered by my delegation as the deprivation of the basic rights of the people of Myanmar to freely choose the leaders to whom they wish to entrust the destiny of their country.  Democracy and the rule of law are essential elements for the development  stability  security and prosperity of any country. The world has made significant strides in this respect. Nonetheless  it is regrettable that conflicts in certain parts of the world continue to undermine progress. The imperatives of a globalizing world require the international community to remain seized of these issues and not to shirk its responsibilities.  In the Indian Ocean region  Mauritius is particularly concerned with the current political impasse prevailing in our neighbouring sisterly country — Madagascar. We are actively engaged in the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  the African Union (AU) and the Indian Ocean Commission  working to assist Madagascar to find a peaceful solution to the political crisis.  In this regard  we wish to state that we are supportive of the initiative led by the Coordination National des Organisations de la Société Civile to organize an inter Malagasy dialogue in order to find a solution designed by all Malagasies to the crisis in Madagascar. And we sincerely hope that the dialogue will be credible  transparent and include all sections of Malagasy society in the search for durable peace in the interest of both the country and the region. Mauritius has offered its assistance in setting up an SADC liaison office in Madagascar in order to provide support in moving the Malagasy-Malagasy dialogue.  Two decades of civil unrest have inflicted untold miseries and difficulties on the Somali people and rendered governance of the country almost impossible. We commend the Intergovernmental Authority on Development for its efforts to promote peace and security in Somalia through the Transitional Federal Government. We believe that the people of Somalia deserve greater commitment from the international community towards restoring law and order inside the country and also towards putting an end to the piracy problem off the coast of Somalia.  In order to promote a more proactive engagement of the countries of the region in the fight against piracy  Mauritius will host the Second Regional Ministerial Conference on Piracy on 6 and 7 October  in collaboration with the European Union  the Indian Ocean Commission and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa. Mauritius is also envisaging the possibility of trying piracy suspects caught in the Indian Ocean in its courts  if the logistical  infrastructural and financial support of the international community is adequate.  The current process for talks between Israelis and Palestinians has given renewed hope for lasting peace through the creation of an independent sovereign Palestinian State existing side by side with the State of Israel within secured and recognized borders. Mauritius has always supported the legitimate and inalienable right of the Palestinian people to live in peace and security in an independent Palestinian State. We therefore commend President Barack Obama for his initiatives and leadership in enabling the direct talks between President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu.  Global governance in the maintenance of international peace and security will remain incomplete until we achieve a comprehensive reform of the United Nations Security Council — a reformed Security Council that meets and responds to the geopolitical realities of the twenty-first century. In this respect  Mauritius fully supports the Common African Position  as enshrined in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. We reiterate our support for India  the largest democracy  obtaining a permanent seat in a reformed Security Council. We also support the rightful aspiration of Latin America and the Caribbean for a permanent seat in the Council.   31 10-55264   We have in no uncertain terms drawn the attention of this body every year to the fact that Mauritius has sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago  including Diego Garcia. The Chagos Archipelago was illegally excised by the United Kingdom from the territory of Mauritius prior to our independence. This dismemberment was done in blatant violation of General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and 2066 (XX) of 16 December 1965. We have raised the issue of the sovereignty of Mauritius over the Archipelago with successive British Governments and initially pursued the matter as a friendly dispute. In view of the lack of progress  we suggested that the issue be addressed in bilateral talks. Although the process of bilateral talks was initiated in January 2009  the issue of our sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago has yet to be addressed.  We are deeply concerned that the British Government decided on 1 April 2010 to unilaterally declare a marine protected area around the Chagos Archipelago — our territory — allegedly to protect the marine environment. The unilateral establishment of this marine protected area infringes the sovereignty of Mauritius over the Archipelago and constitutes a serious impediment to the eventual resettlement there of its former inhabitants and other Mauritians  as any economic activity in the protected zone would be precluded. The Government of Mauritius has decided not to recognize the existence of the so called marine protected area.  The illegal excision of the Chagos Archipelago from the territory of Mauritius has indeed a tragic human dimension. All the inhabitants of the Archipelago were at that time forced by the British authorities to abruptly leave their homes there  in total disregard for their human rights. Most of them were moved to the main island of Mauritius. The Government of Mauritius is sensitive to and fully supportive of the plight of the displaced inhabitants of the Chagos Archipelago and to their desire to resettle in their birthplace there.  Mauritius greatly appreciates the unflinching and unanimous support it has consistently received from the African Union and the Non-Aligned Movement for the assertion of its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. The last AU Summit held in Kampala last July and the last Non-Aligned Movement Summit held in July 2008 in Sharm el-Sheikh both reaffirmed that the Archipelago  including Diego Garcia  forms an integral part of the territory of the Republic of Mauritius. They also called upon the United Kingdom to expeditiously put an end to its unlawful occupation of the Chagos Archipelago with a view to enabling Mauritius to effectively exercise its sovereignty over it.  We urge the United Kingdom once again to take the necessary steps for the unconditional return of the Chagos Archipelago  including Diego Garcia  to Mauritius without further delay. In our annual statement  we also reaffirmed the sovereignty of Mauritius over Tromelin Island. The Governments of Mauritius and France reached an agreement earlier this year on the co management of the island and its maritime zones without prejudice to the sovereignty of Mauritius over Tromelin. This is considered to be a first and positive step towards the resolution of the sovereignty issue. The Republic of Mauritius is a crucible of civilizations and cultures. We are proud to be a haven of peace  where people of various backgrounds and traditions live together in harmony. The people of Mauritius are inspired by the philosophy of multiculturalism and consider their diversity to be a rich human resource. Based on the vision expressed in our motto  “Unity  equality and modernity”  we have committed to place humanity at the centre of all development in our pluralistic society — a society based on diversity  respect for cultural individuality  non-discrimination and sharing common values.  The United Nations is the pre-eminent forum for intercultural dialogue. My country will fully play its part in the combined global effort for all human beings to enjoy the consideration and respect that are their birthright.  Finally  I should like to reaffirm Mauritius’ unwavering faith in the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace  security and development. "
"121",4955,"MWI",65,2010,"I am delighted to address the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly as Chairman of the African Union.   I offer my personal congratulations and those of the African Union to you  Sir  on your election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I assure you  Sir  of Africa’s support in your work.  I pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session for his leadership during his tenure of office.  I also commend our Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his exemplary leadership of our Organization and the excellent manner in which he continues to discharge his responsibilities. Africa is particularly grateful for his continued support of Africa’s development agenda.  I am happy to say that Africa welcomes the theme for the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly that reaffirms the role of the United Nations in global governance. African leaders believe that the United Nations  with its universal membership  is well placed to build political consensus for global governance. They hold the view that the United Nations has the potential to bring about solutions to common governance problems that our global village continues to encounter  such as managing diversity and combating terrorism and conflict. I believe that now  more than ever before  the United Nations needs to strengthen its institutions to enable it to promote peace and stability and facilitate balanced growth and prosperity between developed and developing countries.  Africa also wishes to remind the United Nations not to lose sight of its commitment to fight poverty. Poverty reduction must remain the central focus of the United Nations.    10-54827 16   As we reflect on this year’s theme  the central role of the United Nations in global governance  I am fully aware that the Africa the world hears about is that of incessant calamities and natural disasters. International media report on the Africa of extreme poverty  widespread endemic diseases and human suffering. They constantly portray the Africa of civil wars  genocide  terrorism and piracy. They glorify the Africa of underdevelopment and hopelessness.  But in their reports we do not hear about the success stories of a number of African Governments. We do not hear about the successes in participatory democracy and good governance. We do not hear about the peaceful multiparty general elections. We do not hear about the high rates of macroeconomic growth in some African countries. We do not hear about the successes in food security in some of them.  That is why I now want to present another Africa to the General Assembly. It is the Africa of new hopes and new possibilities  the Africa of industrial  mineral  and agro-processing opportunities  the Africa with new job creation prospects  and the Africa that can produce enough food for all.  Yes  this is the Africa I want the Assembly to know. This is the Africa of the new beginning.  I want the world to know that we African leaders have a clear vision of a new Africa free of hunger  disease and poverty. We have the vision of a new Africa that is prosperous and full of hope. We have the vision of African nations determined to contribute more to global economic prosperity  peace and stability.  I want to inform the world that the leaders of the African Union have decided to unlock Africa’s combined huge natural resources and human capital to establish new industries to create new wealth for our people. That is why this year I have chosen to address the Assembly on the subject of “Africa of the new beginning”. I want the United Nations to share our belief that Africa is not a poor continent; rather  it is its people that are poor.  This year  I have come to inform this world body that Africa has decided to shift from Afro-pessimism to Afro-optimism. We are going to make Africa better.  Now  turning to global issues  I want to say that the world today faces the challenge of producing enough food to feed the over nine billion people living on this earth  and it must do this against the backdrop of rising food prices  global warming  climate change and environmental degradation. I am pleased to inform this world body that African leaders fully recognize these problems and have unanimously agreed to institute new measures to ensure that five years from now  Africa will be able to produce enough food to feed its people. They have also decided that  five years from now  no child in Africa will die of hunger or malnutrition.  In order to meet these targets  the African Union decided to turn the continent into an African food basket whose main aim is to encourage allocation of increased budgetary resources and private sector investment to agriculture and food production. For that to happen  African leaders have agreed to redesign their policy efforts to focus on three priority areas  namely  agriculture and food security  transport and energy development  and climate change. It is envisaged that effective transport structures and adequate energy supply will enhance agricultural production and food processing as well as improve human mobility and the marketing of food and agricultural products from surplus countries to deficit countries across the African continent.  The African food basket concept envisages full cooperation between Africa and Governments of the Group of Eight. The United Nations  the Food and Agriculture Organization  the World Bank  the European Union and other multilateral institutions will also cooperate in this effort.  I now want to briefly raise some issues of major concern to Africa: the adverse effects of climate change  fragile peace and security  terrorism and piracy  maternal  infant and child mortality  and slow reform of the United Nations.   African leaders recognize that climate change and environmental degradation are among the most serious global challenges that affect Africa negatively. All countries in the world share the adverse effects of climate change. All countries in the world are  to varying degrees  experiencing the adverse impacts of climate change such as severe cyclones  hurricanes  rising sea levels and water salinization  prolonged severe droughts and overall global warming.  There is enough evidence to show that most countries in Africa  Asia and Latin America are the least able and equipped to cope with those challenges.   17 10-54827  The global nature of climate change therefore calls for an effective  immediate and appropriate international response. We need to act  and act now.  The international community has acknowledged that climate change is a real threat to humanity  and yet the performance of the major players at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen disappointed Africa and developing nations elsewhere by their intransigency. The leaders of Africa therefore would like to see the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol be urgently implemented as essential interventions to address climate change. Those conventions spell out in detail what is to be done to mitigate climate change. On behalf of Africa  I call for immediate implementation of those decisions in order to avert impending human catastrophe.  I am glad to note that maternal  infant and child health and welfare are among the underlying issues of the theme of the General Assembly this year. That calls for concerted action for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.   I am pleased to say that the African Union has reaffirmed its commitments to the reduction of maternal  infant and child mortality in Africa. African Governments have undertaken to launch the four-year Campaign for Accelerated Reduction of Maternal Mortality in Africa. We also agreed to call on the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria to create a new window to fund maternal  newborn and child health. Let me  therefore  take advantage of the General Assembly to appeal on behalf of Africa to our development partners and donors to replenish the Global Fund during next month’s meeting and to increase resources for maternal  newborn and child health.  Another global governance issue of major concern to Africa is the lack of movement on international trade under the Doha Round multilateral trade negotiations. Members of the United Nations agree that trade is a conduit to development in every country. Therefore we in Africa appeal for an urgent conclusion of the Doha Round  for we believe that that is essential to revive global trade and to aid in global economic recovery. Any outcome of the Doha Round negotiations must lead to clear benefits for farmers  producers  exporters and consumers in developing countries  including in Africa. Nations of the world must redouble efforts to resolve all impediments to the successful outcome of the trade negotiations.  The advancement of women and gender equality continues to be the cornerstone of the Africa of the new beginning. Women have played and continue to play a decisive role in the global  continental and national agendas for democracy  transition and development. I am happy to inform the General Assembly that African Governments have intensified the fight against gender-based violence  sexual abuse  discrimination and trafficking in women and girls. The ultimate objective is to have more coherent and meaningful interventions that will adequately increase the number of women in high decision-making positions in the advancement of growth and development.  On peace and security  I wish to underscore that the African Union considers that democracy  good governance and development cannot be sustainable without peace and security. African countries have made significant progress in ensuring that peace and security prevail on the African continent. Several countries have conducted peaceful elections  and there is growing tolerance and accommodation between the ruling and opposition parties in many countries. That is encouraging.  However  Africa has of late witnessed the re-emergence of coups d’état and other unconstitutional changes of government. The African Union has taken a strong collective decision that those negative trends will not be allowed to continue.  The African Union is also gravely concerned that Somalia has had no stable or functioning Government for a long time. That continuing volatile situation is being compounded by increasing organized piracy in the Indian Ocean. That negatively affects not only Somalia and her immediate neighbours  but the entire African continent and the rest of the world. I believe the situation calls for a new approach and new intervention. More countries should be directly involved in seeking a lasting solution to the Somalia crisis.  The situation in the Sudan presents a special challenge to the African Union and to the United Nations. Although some progress has been achieved towards the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  the African Union eagerly awaits the holding of the referendum in January 2011 and the post-referendum structure of relations in the Sudan.    10-54827 18   One of the most immediate options in the Sudan is to consolidate the prevailing peace and stability there. The African countries are concerned that while efforts to secure lasting peace in the Sudan are ongoing  the International Criminal Court seems to push for a pound of flesh by insisting on arresting President Omer Hassan Al-Bashir. There is general consensus in Africa that that would have a negative effect  polarizing the different positions of the stakeholders and thereby driving them away from a peaceful settlement. The African Union therefore strongly appeals to the General Assembly to amend Article 16 of the Rome Statute to enable it to assume the powers of the Security Council to defer the case against President Al-Bashir for one year to allow ongoing negotiations and dialogue to succeed.  On behalf of the African Union  I wish to express appreciation for the contribution of the United Nations to the promotion of peace  security and stability in African countries. The United Nations has performed very well in many parts of Africa  including the Democratic Republic of the Congo  the Sudan  Chad and West African countries. Those efforts in the search for solutions to the ongoing conflicts on the continent are highly commendable.  The sanctions against some members of the African Union and the Non-Aligned Movement have caused great economic hardship  especially to the poor and more vulnerable people in those countries. The African Union feels that the ideological justifications  if there ever were any  have outlived their time. Sanctions are also inconsistent with the emerging dialogue for the reform of the United Nations. Sanctions are also inconsistent with the obligations of United Nations Member States to promote social progress and better standards of life  as promulgated in the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations.  The African Union therefore appeals for the immediate lifting of sanctions against the Republic of Zimbabwe and the Republic of Cuba. We believe that would enable ordinary poor Zimbabweans and Cubans to begin a life of new hope and new prospects.   As to the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes  the African Union supports the position taken by the Non-Aligned Movement calling for justice and equal treatment for all nations concerned. With regard to the reforms of the United Nations and the Security Council  the African Union believes that for the Organization to be effective in fulfilling its mandate as an honest broker  the proposed reforms must be implemented in the spirit of equity and fairness. In this regard I would like to reiterate the African Union’s request for two permanent seats with full veto powers and five non-permanent seats. The African Union should also have the right to determine the selection of Africa’s representatives on the Council. Once implemented  that would enable Africa to effectively participate in the global governance that the United Nations is now propagating.  In conclusion  I wish to reaffirm Africa’s strong belief that a reformed United Nations and specialized agencies are likely to play a more effective role in global governance and in a more equitable global trading and financial system. I believe that the United Nations in its new governance role should support the Africa of the new beginning. A strong Africa — industrially  economically and politically — is a better trading partner for the G8 countries and the rest of the world than a weaker one. I also believe that the Africa of the new beginning with its combined vast mineral  agricultural and human resources will provide the safety valve for a boiling international monetary and financial system. Think about these things."
"122",5001,"MYS",65,2010,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Deiss on his election as the President of the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I am confident that under his very able and astute leadership  the sixty-fifth session will be able to complete its proceedings successfully. Let me assure him of Malaysia’s full support for his presidency.  Let me reaffirm Malaysia’s unwavering and continuing support for the United Nations and the multilateral principles  based on international law  that it embodies. Let me also reiterate Malaysia’s commitment to doing our part in our collective endeavour. We do so in the strong belief that all nations  no matter how large or small  rich or poor  strong or weak  have a common responsibility towards creating a better world for tomorrow.  It is my firm belief that in order to create a better world for our future generations  we need to take into account today’s realities and learn from the lessons of yesterday.  Among the most important challenges confronting the international community today that need to be addressed collectively is that of ensuring a just  equitable and durable peace — peace not just during our time  but peace for all times. It is imperative that we achieve peace based on a covenant of the willing  and not one enforced by way of hegemony through fear and coercion. Such peace can be achieved only if we are willing to constructively engage with each other through dialogue. Such discussions would help in creating a deeper understanding as well as appreciation of and respect for each other in our determination to create a better future for all citizens of the world.  As a trade organization  the World Trade Organization remains relevant in today’s economic climate. Malaysia believes that the Doha Round must return to its original objective of ensuring free  fair and equitable trade. Let us join efforts and focus on moving the process forward and building on the progress and achievements to date. It is urgent that we conclude this matter as soon as possible.  Since the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals a decade ago  which galvanized the world into collective action  there has been a lack of efforts on joint endeavours towards the betterment of humanity. The missed opportunity at last year’s climate change meeting in Copenhagen is a wake-up call for all of us. We need to bridge the gaps in resolving and addressing the issue of climate change  which affects the lives and livelihoods of the peoples of the world and our future generations.  On 7 June 2010  the Malaysian Parliament unanimously passed a resolution condemning the brutal Israeli attack on the humanitarian convoy in international waters. That resolution was based on humanitarian grounds and demanded that the Palestinians be given their basic rights  and that was why the members of the Parliament  regardless of their    10-55122 20  political alignment  stood together in full support of it. We reaffirm today our solidarity and sympathy with the people of Turkey and the families of the victims for their tragic loss.  Malaysia understood the necessity of letting the multilateral system work. We were happy to see the establishment of the United Nations panel of inquiry and the international fact-finding mission of the Human Rights Council. We are pleased with the findings of the fact-finding mission  whose report (A/HRC/15/21) has found that the conduct of the Israeli military and other personnel towards the flotilla passengers was not only disproportionate but also demonstrated levels of totally unnecessary and incredible violence. That inhuman attack constituted a grave violation of human rights law and international humanitarian law. The Malaysian Parliament feels vindicated by those findings.  We are now waiting for the panel of inquiry to complete its work. We want to see the perpetrators of the attacks brought to justice and adequate compensation provided to the innocent victims of the attacks. We want the United Nations to act justly and decisively  without fear or favour  in a manner that would ensure that transgressions of blatant international laws are dealt with and that justice is done and seen to be done.  On the Middle East peace process  Malaysia is encouraged by the recent developments  especially the active role by the Obama Administration and the Quartet in seeking a comprehensive and lasting solution  a solution not only to the problem between Palestine and Israel  but also in the wider region. We welcome the recent initiative by the United States to host direct peace talks between Palestine and Israel. We also call on all parties to support  and not to be distracted from  these efforts to achieve the aspiration of creating two sovereign States  living side by side in peace  within secure and recognized borders. For this to happen  the following prerequisites should be addressed.  First  Israel must heed the high expectations of the international community to end this long-standing conflict. We call on the United States and other members of the Quartet to persuade Israel to end the construction of new settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem.  Secondly  reconciliation efforts must bear fruit. The achievement of political unity among the Palestinians is vital in moving the peace process forward and in the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip.  Thirdly  both parties must eschew violence and ensure the protection of civilians and respect for international humanitarian and human rights law.  While harnessing our efforts to promote international peace and harmony  we are concerned about the growing trend in some parts of the world to perpetuate or even fuel Islamophobia. Attempts to demonize Islam offend the one and a half billion adherents of the religion. It widens the divide between the Muslim world and the West.  The real issue is not between Muslims and non-Muslims  but between the moderates and the extremists of all religions  be it Islam  Christianity or Judaism. In all religions  we have inadvertently allowed the ugly voices of the periphery to drown out the many voices of reason and common sense. I therefore urge us to embark on building a global movement of moderates from all faiths  moderates committed to working together to combat and marginalize the extremists who have held the world hostage with their bigotry and bias. We must — I repeat  must — urgently reclaim the centre and the moral high ground that has been usurped from us. We must choose moderation over extremism. We must choose negotiation over confrontation. We must choose to work together and not against each other  and we must give this effort top priority  for time is not on our side.  In this regard  we are heartened to note that a group of American evangelical Christians worked tirelessly to prevent the threatened burning of the Koran  with the compelling argument that it is in fact un-Christian to burn the Koran. This is a clear example of what can be achieved when moderates in each faith stand up to the extremists who are trying to hijack the universal values of our religions. We commend President Obama and Mayor Bloomberg for rising to the challenge by affirming the rights of supporters of the Cordoba House to be located near the site of the World Trade Center. This project will include a mosque and a multi-faith community centre open to all. We support the objectives of the   21 10-55122  Cordoba Initiative  an organization that focuses on promoting peace  understanding and moderation  both between Muslims and non-Muslims and within the Muslim community.  All countries should encourage and support initiatives that promote mutual respect and peaceful coexistence and reject the extremists who divide us all with issues that have in the past brought about untold misery and hatred.  Allow me to share my own country’s experience in managing issues of diversity. Malaysia is a multiracial  multi-religious  multicultural and democratic society that has benefited from positive interaction and synergy between the various communities. Mosques  temples  churches and other places of worship coexist in harmony. Although Islam is the official religion  we honour other religions — Buddhism  Christianity and Hinduism — by making their religious and cultural celebrations national holidays and celebrating them as national events. It is this equilibrium that leads to moderation or what is called wasatiyyah in the Islamic tradition of mutual justice.  Malaysia stands at the geographical crossroads of the major civilizations and religions of the world. We are therefore well poised to play our part in promoting religious understanding  harmony and tolerance. To further strengthen our process of national unity  I have introduced a philosophy known as One Malaysia. One Malaysia is a vision that seeks renewal and rejuvenation to bring all our people together in a just and harmonious relationship. One Malaysia calls for the acceptance of diversity as a source of greater unity. We seek to celebrate our multiethnic and multi-religious society for strategic strength and harmony.  It is time for the moderates in all countries and in all religions to take back the centre  to reclaim the agenda for peace and pragmatism and to marginalize the extremists. This global movement of the moderates will save us from sinking into the abyss of despair and depravation. This is an opportunity for us to provide much-needed leadership  to bring hope and to restore dignity for all. With greater will and collective determination  we will build a more peaceful  secure and equitable world."
"123",5028,"NAM",65,2010,"I wish to congratulate Mr. Deiss on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We are confident that he will discharge the responsibilities of his high office with wisdom. I assure him of Namibia’s cooperation and support. I would also like to commend his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam  Treki  for the able manner in which he presided over the sixty-fourth session.  The Secretary-General of the Organization  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  and his staff have done a commendable job in overseeing the ongoing efforts to improve the working methods of the Organization and for better interaction with Member States. We commend them for their dedication and hard work.  The theme for this year’s session  “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance”  is both timely and appropriate. In that spirit  Member States should reaffirm the central role of the United Nations in global governance. Namibia shares the views expressed in the outcome document of the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development (resolution 63/303  annex).  We believe that because of its universal membership and legitimacy  the United Nations is well positioned to participate in the reform processes to improve and strengthen the effective functioning of the international financial system. In that regard  we must reaffirm our commitment to a universal  rules-based  open  non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system and also work together for a speedy and equitable conclusion to the Doha Round.  Although Namibia is currently classified as a high middle-income country  it still bears the scars of social and economic inequalities inherited from its colonial past. As a result  we carry the unenviable distinction as the country with the most unequal distribution of income and economic resources in the world. Ironically  our country also faces declining international development assistance due to that very classification  which has negatively impacted our ability to mobilize resources for national development efforts.  In that light  I appeal to the international financial institutions to create special mechanisms to enable middle-income countries to access financial resources for development on concessional terms  as called for by the 2008 Windhoek Declaration on Development Cooperation with Middle-Income Countries.  Our recently concluded High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) gave world leaders and other stakeholders a unique opportunity to review progress made towards    10-54965 14  the achievement of the MDGs and to share valuable experiences. It is also evident that more work remains to be done. The challenges encountered should encourage us  and the successes recorded should inspire us all to work relentlessly for the noble and common objectives of achieving all of the MDGs.  At the global level  climate change is one of the major challenges facing humanity today. The devastating impact of natural disasters around the world has affected most of our countries. Although Namibia does not significantly contribute to the emission of greenhouse gases  it is one of the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In recent years  we have experienced increasingly severe floods and droughts that have destroyed crops  livestock and wild animals. We thus call upon industrialized countries to take practical steps and demonstrate greater political will to bring about drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. We also urge them to give meaningful support to the efforts of developing countries to mitigate and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.  It is our hope that the industrialized countries will meet their commitments to provide adequate resources  in line with the undertakings made at Copenhagen in 2009. Namibia looks forward to a successful outcome of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Mexico later this year.  In 2000  while serving as a member of the Security Council  Namibia initiated and introduced a theme on women  peace and security  which resulted in the adoption of the  resolution 1325 (2000). Our objective was to highlight the plight of women in conflict situations and to recognize the vital role that they can play in peacemaking efforts for the effective resolution of conflicts. As we commemorate the first decade of that resolution  let us recommit ourselves to the protection of women and girls in conflict situations in all parts of the world.  We welcome the Assembly resolution on system-wide coherence and the establishment of UN Women as an entity dedicated to dealing with gender-related issues (resolution 64/289). We hope that that new entity will strengthen the institutional capacity of the United Nations for the support of gender equality and the empowerment of women. My delegation wishes to congratulate Ms. Michelle Bachelet on her appointment as UN Women’s first head.  In August  Namibia assumed the chairmanship of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). In that capacity  we will work to promote cooperation with other regional economic communities in Africa  as the building blocks for intracontinental integration. SADC strives for political stability in the region as a prerequisite for sustainable development. In that connection  we have taken proactive steps to resolve the political crisis in Madagascar  through the facilitation efforts of former President Joachim Chissano of Mozambique.  The recent African Union (AU) summit  held in Kampala in July  focused on maternal  infant and child health and development in Africa. African leaders reaffirmed their commitment to mobilize and direct resources to check the deaths of women and children from preventable diseases.  Namibia has consistently urged the international community to fulfil its obligation to help the people of Western Sahara in their quest for self-determination. We therefore call for immediate and unconditional implementation of the United Nations Settlement Plan for Western Sahara and for the holding of a free and fair referendum  based on the terms of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly.  Namibia is deeply concerned about the ongoing suffering and humiliation of the Palestinian people under Israeli occupation and the denial of their fundamental right to self-determination. It is encouraging  however  that direct negotiations have been resumed between the parties. We hope that a durable solution will be found without further delay and on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions.  Namibia is also concerned about the prolonged and extraterritorial economic embargo imposed on the people of Cuba. We fully support the decision of the AU summit in Kampala calling for the embargo’s removal. We believe that the economic blockade is unjustifiable and unfair and should therefore be lifted.   Similarly  Namibia calls for lifting the economic sanctions imposed  directly or indirectly  on the Republic of Zimbabwe by some Western countries. Those sanctions have caused enormous suffering  not   15 10-54965  only to the people of Zimbabwe  but also to other countries in the SADC region.  For many years now  we have been calling for comprehensive reform of the United Nations system  particularly the Security Council. The process must be finalized to render the Council more representative  democratic and accountable. It is unjust that Africa remains the only region of the world without permanent representation on the Security Council. In that connection  we reiterate our support for the African common position on Security Council reform  as articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.  The maintenance of international peace and security is our collective responsibility. Namibia believes that peace  security and stability are the cornerstones of sustainable development  and thus we will continue to participate in United Nations and AU peacekeeping missions. We urge the international community to support conflict prevention and peacebuilding efforts around the world.   Recently  States parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty reaffirmed their commitment to nuclear disarmament  non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. We welcome that positive step  in the belief that multilateralism is the most viable option for achieving a world free from the danger of nuclear weapons.  Namibia believes in the effectiveness of collective action under the auspices of the United Nations to resolve conflicts by peaceful means and to address the challenges facing the world. My delegation is optimistic that together we can successfully work for the common good of all humanity. Let us join hands to achieve our common objective of building a better world for present and future generations."
"124",5073,"NER",65,2010,"At the outset  on behalf of the Republic of the Niger  I would like to extend to Mr. Joseph Deiss my sincere congratulations on his outstanding election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. His country  the Swiss Confederation  is known for its long tradition in the area of international relations  and his own career reveals proven skill and a wealth of personal experience. Because of that  we believe that under his leadership the work of this session will be crowned with success. I can assure him of the full support and complete cooperation of my delegation in carrying out his noble and lofty mission.  To his predecessor  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  representative of the great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  I would like to pay particular and fully merited tribute to him for the exemplary way and the talent with which he led the work at the Assembly’s last session.  Finally  with consideration and admiration  I commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  a promoter of peace  for his tireless investment in the search for the most appropriate solutions to the many challenges that assail the world today and cry out daily to the individual and collective consciences of its leaders. The particular attention he gives to the situation of the most vulnerable countries  his constant advocacy for achieving the Millennium Development Goals and his recent journey to Africa deserve to be commended.  The world will recall that on 18 February 2010  in the face of an anti-constitutional drift imposed on democratic and republican institutions of my country by the Government in place  and the grave and certain risk of the disintegration of national cohesiveness  the defence and security forces of the Niger were obligated to intervene on the political scene.  This was not the intervention of an army hungry for power  but that of officers who were concerned with safeguarding the unity and integrity of their country  which had been endangered by the Head of State at the time  who  through sheer self-interest  had decided to ignore  by undertaking a civilian coup d’état  all of the laws of the Republic  beginning with the Constitution itself  which was replaced with another that would have generously extended the presidential mandate for three years  which was to have ended on 22 December 2009. It was therefore for good reason that our arrival was welcomed by national and international opinion.  Having headed the country since 18 February 2010  the Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy  over which we have the great honour to preside  immediately set itself the primary goal of taking all decisions necessary to bringing peace to the socio-political life of the country. It was precisely to that end that it drew up its programme for governing on the basis of three pillars: the restoration of democracy; cleaning up the country’s political and economic situation by fighting against impunity     10-54833 44  corruption and bribery; and the reconciliation of the people of the Niger.  With a view to restoring a normal constitutional regime  the National Independent Electoral Commission  which was created to that end  drew up and proposed a schedule for general elections and a draft budget for organizing seven planned elections to the Government and the Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy  which accepted them after slight modifications. According to that timetable  the electoral process will take place from 31 October 2010 to 6 April 2011 and will include a constitutional referendum as well as local  legislative and presidential elections.  I am pleased to recall here that  by an ordinance of 11 March 2010  we decided to make ineligible members of the defence and security forces  as well as members of the transitional Government. I should therefore like to take this opportunity to make an urgent appeal to the international community to continue to assist the Niger and its National Independent Electoral Commission in the organization of the programme of elections that I have just elaborated. This assistance is crucial if we are to achieve within the established time frame the core goal of the Supreme Council and the transitional Government of restoring constitutional order in the Niger  following the outcome of the electoral process.  Moreover  with a view to guaranteeing free  fair  transparent and credible elections  the Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy and the Government of the Niger  solemnly request through me the participation of the United Nations and all interested international institutions in observing the various elections.  I was determined to make this trip to New York  despite the many urgent needs and constraints associated with the transitional agenda under way in the Niger  to solemnly reaffirm before this august and honourable Assembly that the commitments we made following the events of 18 February 2010 are now at a very advanced stage of implementation and that  God willing  they will be upheld within the established time frame and with international support. In this respect  I note and welcome the fact that  in the report he represented to the Security Council on 13 July 2010 (S/2010/324)  the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for West Africa stressed that the transitional authorities in the Niger have fully respected their commitments.  In accordance with the second commitment made by the Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy  on 11 May 2010 we established a commission to combat economic  financial and fiscal crime and to promote good governance  which is currently implementing a programme to restore the rule of law in the Niger. In parallel  a high authority for reconciliation and consolidation of democracy has been created. This new institution is working with all the necessary care to achieve the third goal  which is to consolidate our national unity.  Finally  at the international level  since 18 February we have clearly reaffirmed the Niger’s commitment to the universal values of peace  security  good-neighbourliness  human rights  the rule of law  democracy  international solidarity  strict compliance with the Charter of the United Nations  the Charter of the African Union  the statutes of the Economic Community of West African States and all other relevant international legal instruments.  Poor economic and financial governance and the political and institutional crisis were  unfortunately  not the only threats facing the Niger. Sadly  there was another scourge that was even more dangerous and called for urgent countermeasures  but whose existence was long concealed by the authorities of the time. I refer to the very serious situation of food insecurity in which my country finds itself.  On 10 March  an urgent appeal was made to the entire national and international community for major support to be given to our country in its efforts to address this disaster. With the prompt and concrete support of the Niger’s development partners and through the national mechanism for the prevention and management of food crises  action to mitigate the crisis has been diligently undertaken. Of particular note among these efforts are the cash-for-work operations  the sale of reasonably priced grain  the free distribution of food  seed and livestock feed assistance  and care for malnourished children.  I take this opportunity to convey to all our generous donors the profound gratitude of the people of the Niger  the Supreme Council and the transitional Government for that commendable and unforgettable show of solidarity. We hope to see it continue so that we can address the emerging situation resulting from   45 10-54833  floods wreaking havoc in several regions of our country. We are also pleased to see that food security is high on the list of issues on which the General Assembly will focus during its current session and among the priorities set for the Organization in 2010 by the Secretary-General.  At this stage  I welcome the initiative of Under-Secretary-General John Holmes to come to the Niger and visit isolated rural areas in order to see for himself the desperate situation into which the people and their livestock have been plunged. During his visit  he was able to assess the scale of the crisis and its impact on people — in particular on children — and livestock. The appeal he made to the international community  advocating the mobilization of $130 million to provide urgent assistance to the populations affected  remains highly urgent. We know  however  that we can count on the understanding and ongoing concern of our development partners  which have already been reflected in the gradual resumption of their cooperation with the Niger.  It is obvious that my country has serious socio-economic problems  but the people of the Niger are determined to overcome them with the support of the international community. My country is young. It has just celebrated its fiftieth year of independence without fanfare because of the food crisis. Its people are young  but they are also dynamic and resolved to begin their march on the path to development.  This sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly is taking place in an international context of strong contrasts. Indeed  while tangible progress continues to be made daily in many areas of concern  we face many numerous and varied challenges in many other areas.  In Africa  positive developments have been recorded. I welcome the holding of free  transparent and fair elections  in particular in the Sudan and Burundi. I welcome the decision of the authorities of Côte d’Ivoire to organize presidential elections very soon. It is my hope that the electoral process under way will be a success. Indeed  that is the only way that Côte d’Ivoire will restore the stability and calm that will allow it to fully play its role as a driving force in West Africa.  Finally  I note that the peace and security architecture of our continental organization is being strengthened with the support of our partners  such as the European Union and the United Nations  in particular with imminent operationalization of the African peace force and the early warning mechanism. It is my ardent hope that significant progress shall soon be made on the political front in other friendly countries  such as the Central African Republic  the Comoros  Somalia and Madagascar  in the Great Lakes region and Darfur.  In the Middle East  the launch of direct bilateral negotiations should  we hope  lead to comprehensive peace based on the two-State solution  with an independent and viable Palestine living side by side in peace and security with Israel and other neighbouring countries. From this rostrum  I wish full success to the direct negotiation process among officials of those two countries  sponsored by President Barack Obama of the United States of America.  Other threats to international peace and security continue to confront us on a daily basis. I refer above all to terrorism  drug trafficking and the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. West Africa — and in particular the Sahelo-Saharan region  of which the Niger is an integral part — is currently suffering the bitter nexus of terrorism and trafficking of all types. In spite of the efforts made  it must be recognized that national and regional authorities continue to have difficulty neutralizing these armed groups. The abduction last week of foreign nationals in northern Niger reminds us of the gravity of the situation and of the urgent need for the measures necessary to deal effectively with this threat to peace  security and development in our country.  Indeed  with each passing day  terrorism grows in scale in our subregion and threatens to tarnish the image of the Sahel countries  compromise tourist revenues and exacerbate our people’s poverty and insecurity. We all know that poverty and desolation are fertile grounds for terrorists. We must therefore recognize the urgent need to promptly strengthen international cooperation and economic and social development programmes in these areas in order to eradicate these scourges. The response to all these evils must be coordinated. That is why the countries concerned created a mechanism to coordinate counter-terrorism activities following a ministerial meeting held in Algiers on 16 March. With respect to drug trafficking  the Economic Community of West African States has adopted a plan of action to combat it  and urgently appeals to the international community to assist in its implementation.    10-54833 46   It has been widely understood since the 2005 World Summit that peace  security  development and human rights are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. In other words  peace  security and human rights cannot be effective in a context of underdevelopment and poverty. It is clear that the Secretary-General fully shares this view because he has made sustainable development one of his highest priorities throughout 2010 through the achievement of internationally agreed development goals. In this respect  the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  held from 20 to 22 September  was a real opportunity for the international community to address many subjects of major concern more thoroughly.  As the participants in the High-level Meeting firmly highlighted and I would note  there is a clear link between the availability of resources and the achievement of the MDGs. From my point of view  the achievement of the MDGs remains possible for the Niger  as I emphasized at the Meeting  but only to the extent that substantial financial resources are made available  in particular through an expanded and enhanced partnership with the international community. That is why I appeal for the mobilization of the resources necessary through compliance with commitments made in the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2)  the Monterrey Consensus (A/CONF.198/11)  and in the Outcome Document of the Doha International Conference on Financing for Development (A/CONF.212/L.1/Rev.1*).  The terrible earthquake that struck Haiti with such force on 12 January; the deadly floods that continue to affect Pakistan  India and the People’s Republic of China; the terrible droughts and floods in the Sahel; and the heatwave in Russia have all made us aware of our collective vulnerability to natural disasters and their underlying causes  such as environmental degradation and climate change.  In this respect  as highlighted by the participants at the 20 September high-level meeting on the International Year of Biodiversity  the protection of the environment should be everyone’s priority. It is necessary to follow up on the voluntary commitments made in the Copenhagen Declaration  in particular with respect to financing adaptation and mitigation measures.  With respect to United Nations reform  it is encouraging to note the significant progress made in the empowerment of women  governance and financing activities to operationalize development. Let us not forget that  on 30 June  the General Assembly established the composite Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women  which  as of 1 January 2011  will be responsible for addressing gender issues in place of the four institutions that have hitherto worked to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women. This is an important act which we dare to hope will lead Member States to advance in other sectors of United Nations reform  in particular reform of the Security Council.  I am convinced that this will strengthen the Organization’s legitimacy and capacity for action in the service of international peace and security. Indeed  if it is to be up to this immense and delicate task  the United Nations must be just  representative and democratic."
"125",5119,"NGA",65,2010,"I welcome this opportunity to address this Assembly for the first time since I was sworn in as President of my country  Nigeria  on 6 May this year.  I extend sincere congratulations to Mr. Joseph Deiss on his well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. Allow me also to congratulate his predecessor on the skilful way in which he conducted the affairs of the Assembly during its sixty-fourth session. I also commend the Secretary-General for the quality of his leadership. I assure the President of the General Assembly of the support and cooperation of the Nigerian delegation throughout his tenure.  This session coincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the independence of 17 African countries  including my country  Nigeria. It is true that the United Nations played an important role in the acceleration of decolonization  in part through the adoption of many resolutions supporting the right of nations to self-determination. The independence and subsequent admission of many of these countries into the United Nations has greatly enhanced the Organization’s legitimacy  thereby advancing the noble goals of its Charter.  Nigeria was one of the countries to emerge from colonialism in 1960 into a whole new world of independence and sovereignty to take on the task of nation-building and to play the international role that destiny had conferred on us. Our participation in the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the Congo seven days after gaining our independence was the direct and deliberate fulfilment of the international role that we had set for ourselves as a people. Since then  we have participated in numerous United Nations peacekeeping missions  as well as in similar regional endeavours. Nigeria has been and will continue to be an active participant in the work of the United Nations  striving therein to promote national  regional and global objectives.  Despite many years of independence  many countries still face the daunting challenges of nation-building. It is in this connection that the Millennium Summit of 2000 adopted a set of goals to be realized by 2015. The outcome of the events related to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that took place recently here in New York inspires a real appreciation of the enormous scope of the task ahead for many countries  including ours. The urgency of the action needed to address the situation has been clearly    10-54959 24  and unambiguously underscored in the intervening discussions.  Even though we have achieved significant improvements in the eradication of polio and other child-related diseases  Nigeria still has its own fair share of challenges to overcome. Progress on MDGs 4 and 5  which relate to the reduction of maternal and child mortality  has been relatively slow. The weakness of the primary health care system and limited referral institutions remain crucial challenges in the health care sector.  On the positive side  Nigeria has recorded remarkable progress in the provision of universal basic education  and we are also in the process of harmonizing baseline data that will assist us in the proper monitoring and evaluation of all MDG projects.  The Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria continues to be a prime mechanism for addressing Millennium Development Goal 6. Accordingly  Nigeria will remain both a donor nation to and a recipient of the Fund. Having actively participated during the first and second replenishments with total contributions of $20 million  Nigeria will make further contributions of $10 million during the third replenishment. We will also call for the Muskoka commitment to be met now  and the Global Fund to be expanded to include MDGs 4 and 5 in support of the Secretary-General’s Every Woman  Every Child initiative.  Good governance  strict adherence to the rule of law and respect for human rights remain fundamental tenets of my administration. The consolidation and safeguarding of our democracy are a task on which we are beginning to see positive results. The smooth succession of power since Nigeria’s return to democratic rule in 1999  including my own ascension to the presidency of our country after the demise of my predecessor  is evidence of the commitment of all stakeholders to democratic governance in the knowledge that political stability is imperative to the economic development of any nation.  As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of our independence in a few days  we remember the sacrifices of the founding fathers of our nation  as well as our own responsibility to present and future generations. In fulfilment of these aspirations  we are firmly committed to holding free  fair and credible elections during the 2011 general elections. In this regard  we have taken the steps necessary to ensure the success of the process. I assure the Assembly that every vote will count in Nigeria.  We are also working to strengthen our institutional structures for combating corruption  financial crimes  and other vices  such as human and drug trafficking. We are reforming the financial sector to make it more accountable and transparent. This will ensure that our country enjoys political stability  social harmony and economic growth.  In support of our commitment to the global effort to combat terrorism  we continue to strengthen and expand our institutional capacities to tackle all forms of extremism. In fact  we currently have two bills — a counter-terrorism bill and an anti-money laundering bill — before our National Assembly  and I am confident they will be enacted into law before the end of the current legislative year.  Soon after I assumed the leadership of my country as acting President  I was invited by the President of the United States of America to a mini-summit on nuclear disarmament in Washington  D.C.  in April this year. Like all previous Nigerian leaders  I share the American President’s vision of a world free of nuclear weapons  and I will continue to collaborate with him and all humankind for the realization of this laudable goal. Our support for and active participation in the adoption of the Pelindaba Treaty is evidence of our commitment to the total elimination of nuclear weapons. This conforms with our status as a signatory to the major treaties on nuclear disarmament.  At the same time  small arms and light weapons have destabilized the African continent  fuelled and prolonged conflicts  and obstructed relief programmes. They have also undermined peace initiatives  increased human rights abuses  hampered development and  perhaps more worrisome  fostered a culture of organized crime and violence. We note  however  that the illicit trade in and proliferation of small arms and light weapons do not receive adequate attention. Nigeria calls on the United Nations to take firm action to control the proliferation of small arms and light weapons by adopting an arms trade treaty.  It is estimated that there are approximately 100 million of these weapons in sub-Saharan Africa alone. These weapons have been identified as having killed more people in the African continent than any other type of weapon. However  unlike for nuclear  chemical   25 10-54959  and biological weapons  there are no global treaties or legally binding instruments for dealing with the challenges posed by small arms and light weapons. It must be underscored that the dumping of these weapons in Africa and their free use are among the greatest challenges facing African leaders today. These weapons encourage impunity  transborder crime  armed robbery  piracy  kidnapping and the rape of innocent women. In general  their presence hampers economic growth because no one wants to invest in a nation or region that is prone to crisis. We know of approximately 300 companies that produce and trade such small arms and light weapons in approximately 50 countries around the world. And we believe that it is time for the United Nations to come on strong if it truly wants to help Africa get out of the woods.  In my capacity as Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States  I am pleased to report that we have made substantial progress in bringing peace and stability to countries in the Community that were until recently embroiled in political crises. This has greatly improved the situation across the subregion  which in turn has enhanced the peace and security that are critical to development. We will continue to build on these achievements to consolidate stability and engender prosperity in the subregion.  Nigeria chose the theme of preventive diplomacy for an open debate it convened during its presidency of the Security Council in July 2010 (see S/PV.6360) to highlight the importance that it attaches to conflict prevention. It is obvious that preventing conflicts is a cheaper option for maintaining peace and security than peacekeeping. I urge the United Nations to devote renewed attention to preventive diplomacy. The increasing financial burden of peacekeeping and the high human cost of conflict are good reasons for the United Nations to pursue with vigour the adoption of preventive diplomacy in the spirit of the provisions of Chapters VI and VII of the Charter of the United Nations.  For Nigeria  a major contributor of troops to peacekeeping operations around the world  it is essential that the rules of engagement be reviewed to prevent high casualty rates among contingents. It deeply saddens us to see troops wearing the United Nations colours being waylaid and murdered because of the rules of engagement.  The theme for the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly — “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance” — is timely and appropriate. The need for the United Nations to provide leadership in addressing problems and challenges of a global nature is imperative. We urge the Organization to quicken the pace of reform  not only to better reflect current global realities  but also to ensure that it enjoys genuine legitimacy. Good governance requires participation by all nations and all peoples of the world.  The early reform and  in particular  expansion of the Security Council will accord the United Nations greater effectiveness in global good governance. The exclusion of the African States from the Council’s permanent membership category can no longer be justified.  I would like to reaffirm Nigeria’s abiding faith in the role of the United Nations in the pursuit of our common goals for the benefit of all humankind. We therefore pledge our continued support for the Organization  in order to strengthen it  as a way of identifying with the ideals for which it stands.  In conclusion  I wish to thank all Member States for their kind words of condolence and sympathy in honour of the late President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua at an Assembly meeting last May (see A/64/PV.86). Even though he is gone  his legacy lives on  as my Administration continues to implement the programmes we had jointly designed during his time as President of our country and while I was second-in-command. May his soul rest in peace."
"126",5164,"NIC",65,2010,"In the name of the Nicaraguan people and of Comrade President Commander Daniel Ortega Saavedra  I convey my warmest brotherly greetings to you  Sir  and to each and every one of the peoples and Governments represented in the General Assembly.  As the shadows of apocalyptic threats darken the world stage  we begin to doubt the capacity for reason and the strength of the most noble sentiments of human beings to face up to the serious problems confronting humanity. Various types of information are manipulated by the global communications media in order to continually discredit the independence efforts of the Governments of the South. They disseminate the idea that humanity is impotent in the face of the present state of disaster and that we must prepare for the worst. Furthermore  what is worse is that they tell us that no one is responsible and that it is a faceless disaster  seeking thus to exonerate the industrialized countries of the North.  However  we know full well that the underlying cause of the serious crises we are experiencing is the nature of the system of economic  political and social relations established by global capitalism and the effort to have that system accepted as a universal paradigm.  In this regard  the poor countries  which are referred to by the euphemism “developing countries”  can strip away the masks of those who — driven by greed  selfishness and the desire for absolute power in the name of manifest destiny or of divine reason — have brought humankind to the brink of extinction.  Nicaragua  which has experienced the pain and injustice of war first-hand  is against war. We do not accept the failure of reason. We do not accept war as the obligatory language among peoples. Nicaragua rejects war as a solution to conflicts between States. We reject war as a means for appropriating the planet’s natural resources or for imposing the hegemony of a few over the majority of the world’s nations. War will never lead to solutions partial or full  much less definitive. The invasion of Iraq by foreign troops under false pretexts has brought neither peace nor stability to that country. On the contrary  it has left that country in ruins and failed to bring greater stability to the region.  The war in Afghanistan has become a dead end for the occupiers. At the same time  it has also had negative effects on its neighbours. Security Council resolution 1929 (2010)  which imposes new sanctions on the Islamic Republic of Iran  has only served to increase the possibility of a large-scale military conflict with unforeseeable consequences. The war games on the Korean peninsula increase tensions in that region  jeopardizing the gains achieved between the two Koreas. Neither Europe nor the Persian Gulf has escaped the expanding zone of militarization. Similarly  the establishment of military bases and the deployment of naval and air power on Latin American soil threaten the political stability of our nations.  “Among individuals  as among nations  respect for the rights of others is peace”. This saying of Benito Juárez  President of Mexico and the first indigenous president in the Americas  clearly reflects the conception of and will for peace among the peoples of the world. This apothegm should guide our Organization  and in particular the Security Council  ensuring that their actions adhere strictly to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.  Moreover  Nicaragua believes that there is a close relation between disarmament and development. Our commitment to security includes a commitment to the promotion of human rights  which we interpret as    10-55128 30  tantamount to sustainable development centred on the human being and implemented in an environment of good governance with direct citizen participation and social equality  which are indispensable to real development.  From our point of view  the resources freed up as a result of disarmament efforts should be directed to ensuring the attainment of the national social development goals of each of our countries. One only has to take a brief glance at the trillions of dollars spent on war to realize how many human problems could be solved with these funds  alleviating the pain caused by poverty and exclusion. The global economic and financial crisis has had little or no effect on global military spending.  Nicaragua remains actively committed to the cause of general and complete disarmament. Nicaragua believes that only a climate of fundamental trust and solidarity can guarantee strict compliance with arms control and disarmament accords with a view to attaining complete disarmament — and especially nuclear disarmament — as the only option for achieving real and lasting world peace. Nicaragua supports the inalienable right of the parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and without discrimination. Nicaragua encourages actions to promote the exchange of material resources  equipment and technology for the peaceful use of nuclear energy in order to guarantee the sustainable economic development of every nation and the world.  Precisely because of this belief  Nicaragua demands that neither Iran nor any other nation be taken to task for developing nuclear programmes for peaceful purposes. It is possible to build trust based on dialogue and negotiation. In this context  Nicaragua joins the general support expressed for the tripartite declaration of Brazil  Turkey and Iran  which constitutes an alternative for promoting regional and world peace.  That which was a warning yesterday is today a reality. The present international context is leading to a global political crisis. The entire political model constructed and articulated around the paradigm of neo-liberalism  globalization and the free market is in question. At the global level  we need more decisive action to affirm multilateralism as the new paradigm. Such multilateralism must listen to the voices of peoples living in extreme poverty and underdevelopment. It must take the new political realities into account and effectively democratize the world order  beginning with this Organization  including the Security Council and the United Nations as a whole; re-establish the representational and democratic rights of its 192 Member States; and identify the rights and obligations that are common to all States without undermining their sovereignty  independence and self-determination  regardless of their size.  In Latin America and the Caribbean  this trend is manifest in the process of integration and unity taking place among our peoples. We have already made the historic decision to create the Latin American and Caribbean Community of States  whose institutionalization will begin next year and conclude in 2012. This is further and unquestionable proof of the profound changes taking place in the world.  The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America has become the vanguard of this process of change. The struggle against intervention of all kinds  including military intervention  and for the maintenance and re-establishment of peace is an essential component of the Alliance’s action in its relations with the world  and strengthens its capacity to guarantee the national sovereignty of its peoples.  Nicaragua joins the brotherly people of Puerto Rico in waving the flag of its independence which has been unjustly trampled. The criminal economic blockade by the Government of the United States of America against the brotherly people and Government of heroic Cuba must stop immediately  and the five Cuban heroes  counter-terrorism combatants imprisoned in United States jails  must be released now.  We express our solidarity with the brotherly people of Argentina in their demand for sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands and with the brotherly people of the Democratic Arab Saharan Republic in their quest to be recognized as an independent State.  The war and State terrorism against the people of Palestine must immediately cease. All Security Council and General Assembly resolutions concerning Israel must be respected and complied with. We must tie the hands of those who fan the flames of hatred and war and are capable of attacking a humanitarian flotilla — an act that has been denounced by the Human Rights Council commission of inquiry.   31 10-55128   We salute the invitation extended by the international community to Taiwan to participate in the work of some United Nations specialized agencies directly related to the well-being of the 23 million Taiwanese. In this regard  we call on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the International Civil Aviation Organization to adopt a similar position.  Never before have we had so much information or  I hope  been so conscious of the severity of the environmental crisis affecting our planet. Our awareness of the gravity of the situation makes it indispensable that we forge a coalition of forces based on the common values and inspiring principles that serve as the ethical foundation and catalyst for practices to promote a sustainable way of life. The Earth  with its minerals and sources of energy; with its land  water  forests and marine life; with its ecosystems and micro-organisms  must be recognized as our supreme and universal benefactor and an integral part of humankind  and not only as a source of survival.  Global capitalism  with its logic of competition and unlimited growth and its unsustainable modes of production and consumption  separates human beings from nature and establishes a relationship of dominion over it. This situation must change and be restored to the right track before it is too late for us all.  The meeting in Copenhagen demonstrated the power of the interests that block decisive action on climate change and the rights of Mother Earth. It left us with the unpleasant feeling that we had wasted our time and that those who impede the urgent solutions needed to address the critical state of Mother Earth are uncommitted to change. With our eyes fixed on hope  we continue to promote our commitments based on the fundamental principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. These should be proportional to the greenhouse gas emissions accumulated since the onset of the Industrial Revolution and not since last year. Those who have historically caused the damage should assume most of the responsibility.   In that hope  Nicaragua was the first country of the world to have signed the Universal Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth  and calls on all the countries of the world to sign it. It was also in that hope that Nicaragua signed the People’s Agreement adopted in Cochabamba in April during the World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth. It is in that hope that Nicaragua trusts that  when we arrive in Cancún  we will be united in seeking agreements that will at least partially reverse the harm  and in taking a path that re-establishes the lost or gravely endangered balance between humankind and Mother Earth.  Although it is proclaimed without much support that the worst of the global economic and financial crisis is behind us  its most serious effects remain and continue to greatly affect our peoples. We should not continue to accept the imposition of economic models based on the pillage and exploitation of our riches.  For all of those reasons  Nicaragua and most of the Latin American nations are dedicated to building an alternative model of economic sovereignty  a sphere of interdependence and solidarity that will enable us to face global capitalism’s profound crisis and to recover our capacity to determine our own paths to development. We reaffirm that the development strategies of each country are their own responsibility  that they should have national ownership and leadership  and that foreign cooperation should be in line with the strategies  plans and objectives of the country that receives it.  In connection with the urgent need to create a new model  we reiterate our support for the outcome of the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development of June 2009 (resolution 63/303  annex). There can be no economic recovery or balance in the inequality with the present model  which concentrates the income and wealth among and within nations.  All of this should take place in a framework of mutual respect  devoid of punitive political conditions against our peoples that would block and stifle the development of the countries of the South.  Besides the hundreds of millions of people in the world who suffer from hunger  we have before us the terrifying reality that in developing countries   10.9 million children under the age of five die every year. Malnutrition and hunger-related diseases cause  60 per cent of those deaths. The cost of malnutrition to national economic development is estimated at between $20 and $30 billion per year. That intolerable situation must stop. The developed countries must fulfil their commitments to eliminate the suffering of millions of human beings.    10-55128 32   Nicaragua reaffirms its decision to confront  with the means available to it and in the context of its national sovereignty  the different forms of transnational organized crime  which have become a permanent threat to domestic and international security. Similarly  Nicaragua reiterates its position of combating terrorism in all its forms and whatever their source.  There are several processes that are hampering necessary and urgent changes. The most prominent is the suppression of information — not saying anything in order to perpetuate ignorance. And when information is made available  it is distorted and always against the peoples’ interests and their legitimate aspirations and experiences  thus converting lies into truths and vice versa  converting a smile into a sneer  words into noise and an objective fact into virtual reality.  The universal citizen is witness  through global communication  to a real war for truth and freedom  forced to confront a permanent  slanderous campaign against change  against hope and against the proper evolution of history. That campaign has far-reaching implications and has the goal of destroying the process of direct popular democracy and of the profound and revolutionary social transformations that are taking place in our countries as a result of the triumph of revolutionary political forces  as is the case in Nicaragua with the Sandinista Front. We must denounce the campaign waged by hegemonic and selfish interests in a few countries in an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of our political system and our people’s Government.  Nicaragua proclaims its right to live in peace and to combat the poverty  illiteracy  hunger and malnutrition generated by historic exclusion and the imposition of an economic and political model that is alien to our reality. Nicaragua declares its dignity  sovereignty  self-determination  respect  unity and solidarity with all the peoples of the Earth  as guaranteed by the United Nations Charter. Nicaragua is working to develop a social awareness of solidarity identified with the ideals of humankind  justice  freedom and democracy for all  without exception.  From this forum  Nicaragua makes a vehement call for world peace  for the survival of the human species  for the dignified future of the noblest aspirations of men and women. That is the only possible future."
"127",5211,"NLD",65,2010,"The Headquarters of the United Nations is currently undergoing a major renovation  and that is a good thing. It is good because the building no longer meets the requirements of the new century. In the meantime  work goes on as usual    27 10-55103  and here we all are  discussing the big issues of the day.  Of course  the parallel is obvious. The United Nations system itself has now reached a certain age and is also in need of renovation. And in this sense  too  the day-to-day work of the United Nations must go on  for we cannot afford to take a break from tackling the global problems we face. The United Nations may be under renovation  but it still has to stay open for business.  It was 65 years ago that the United Nations was established in San Francisco. There  and at Bretton Woods  the world’s leaders laid the foundations for a multilateral system that would be built upon the smoking ruins of the Second World War. This system has demonstrated its usefulness  but it is based on post-war realities  not on the international balance of power and the global problems of today.  I use the word “renovation”  because we do not need to build from scratch. Over the past 65 years  the system has more than proved its worth. There is nothing wrong with the foundations or the basic structure. Besides  experience has taught us that a practical step-by-step approach is a more effective way to reform a large organization than reliance on a “big-bang” strategy. Or  as Dag Hammarskjöld  one of the great leaders of the United Nations  put it  “Constant attention by a good nurse may be just as important as a major operation by a surgeon”.  Today  I would like to look briefly at three of the core tasks of the United Nations in order to show how the Dutch Government views various concrete reforms in practical terms. Those tasks relate to human rights  the international legal order  and peace and security. Let me begin  however  with the background to these renovations  using my own experience as a guide  starting with the question of why they are necessary.  In human terms  65 years is often an age at which we start to take things easier. Unfortunately  that is not an option for the United Nations  for despite all our efforts  peace  security  legal certainty and development are still not guaranteed for everyone. In fact  since the United Nations was established  the global challenges facing us have only grown larger. Consider the climate crisis  or the energy and food crisis  or the international economic crisis that has shown so clearly how closely connected everything is in our time. We need each other more than ever before  and we need the United Nations as the organization uniting us more than ever before.  In this light  I applaud the choice of theme for this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly: “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance” — although I must confess I would have replaced the word “reaffirming” with “recovering”  because ground has clearly been lost  as has become especially apparent in the last few years. The Group of 20  and not the United Nations  has taken the lead in tackling the economic crisis  for example. The United Nations Climate Change Conference could have delivered more if the world had been able to unite behind the tough decisions. And where the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are concerned  we see mixed results. A lot has been achieved  but on some Goals we are lagging far behind  thanks to a fragmented and defective international aid architecture. We discussed this earlier in the week at the MDG summit.  What these examples show is that the United Nations is losing its position — and its convening power — as the obvious global platform for discussion and decision-making. It pains me to say that. However  I also have every faith that the United Nations can continue in the future to claim its vital role as the world’s overarching governance organization.  In my view  the end of the cold war freed the United Nations from a long period of confrontation and stagnation. In its wake the international agenda was redefined with great speed and vigour. Relatively new topics like the environment and climate change  social themes and gender issues began to claim our attention. The international legal order was strengthened by new international tribunals  the International Criminal Court and a growing number of peace missions under the United Nations flag — and of course  in setting the MDGs at its Millennium Summit (resolution 55/2)  the United Nations showed how ambitious it can be.  The United Nations is only able to achieve such things because every country is involved and everyone has a voice. That is the power of the United Nations  but also its greatest weakness. Inclusion does not only foster legitimacy — the unique selling point of the United Nations. It also leads to sluggish decision-making  politicized relationships and a bureaucratic structure that lacks transparency. I believe that anyone    10-55103 28  familiar with the international circuit over the past 10 years will recognize this picture.  It is often said  “If the United Nations did not exist it would have to be invented” — and indeed  a global organization with universal membership is essential. Still  no matter how representative an organization may be  it will lose its relevance if it does not deliver sufficient results. In short  legitimacy and effectiveness are two sides of the same coin.  The Dutch Government is convinced that the United Nations can improve its effectiveness and decisiveness and so increase its legitimacy and public support. This can be done by utilizing the United Nations and its process to solve problems and by putting practical considerations first when problems are tackled. The Netherlands wants to see that happen and will work to make it happen. We will do so as a founding Member of the United Nations but also together with our partners in the European Union  of which we also are a founding member. The European Union is strongly committed to the United Nations  and we subscribe to its contributions to secure the future of the United Nations.  That brings me to the first of the three core tasks I mentioned at the start of my speech: human rights. This  without question  is an area in which the United Nations has achieved great success in setting standards  with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as an unshakeable basis. Unfortunately  though  it still falls short in enforcing those standards. We still hear reports every day of torture  unfair trials  curbs on freedom of expression and other human rights violations. The Dutch Government considers it unacceptable that people  often women  are still being stoned to death in 2010. We must continue to resist this practice with every ounce of our being.  The Dutch Government urges that the capacity of the human rights machinery  and particularly the Human Rights Council  be strengthened. To start with  a clear division of tasks between the Human Rights Council and the Third Committee of this General Assembly is needed. Overlap and lack of clarity make it too easy for some regimes to distract attention from human rights violations. The Netherlands will press for clarity.  Of course  human rights are closely related to the international legal order  the second area I want to touch on. As you know  this is a subject very close to the Netherlands’ heart. The city of The Hague is not only the centre of Dutch democracy  it is also known as the legal capital of the world — and we are proud of that. More important  though  of course  is the fact that the international institutions based in The Hague are sending a clear message with the work they undertake. The international community will not allow human rights violations and crimes against humanity to go unpunished. That applies to the various ad hoc tribunals  such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. It also applies to the International Court of Justice and of course the International Criminal Court (ICC).  Over the last 20 years international criminal law has developed at an impressive rate. Today  those who commit the most terrible crimes  wherever in the world they may be  know that their chances of being called to account are growing by the day. Now we must act boldly. We must strengthen these institutions’ visibility  credibility and authority. We can do that by improving international cooperation on investigations and prosecutions  by increasing compliance with the relevant Security Council resolutions and by pushing for as many countries as possible to sign the Rome Statute and to conduct themselves according to both its letter and its spirit. With that in mind  I say that it is unacceptable to the Dutch Government that someone like President Al-Bashir of the Sudan  against whom an arrest warrant is outstanding  should be allowed to move freely in a country that is an ICC partner.  In closing  I would like to say a few words about the broad topic of peace and security. At this moment  there are some 100 000 people taking part in United Nations peace missions around the world. So no one can deny that the United Nations plays a leading role in this area — and rightly so  because it is precisely in matters of war and peace that legitimacy and resolve are most essential. Such legitimacy and resolve can only be provided by the United Nations and the Security Council.  We saw only recently  in the incident involving the Republic of Korea’s naval ship  the Cheonan  how difficult and shaky the position of the Security Council can sometimes be. On the one hand  the Council condemned the attack unanimously and in strong terms  and that has to be applauded. On the other hand  the Council remained silent on the question of blame  which is an extremely hard thing to bear for the survivors and the victims’ loved ones.   29 10-55103   It is precisely in order to guarantee the legitimacy and strength of the Security Council in the future that the Dutch Government continues to support reforms of the Council that reflect the geopolitical realities of today and not of 1945. Naturally  the exact substance of those reforms is still open to debate. But it is clear to the Netherlands that there should be more room for more countries to join the discussions and exert influence: room for large countries that in 1945 were not yet large enough or were not yet Members of the United Nations; but also room for smaller nations that  as troop-supplying countries or as interested parties in a particular region  should have the right to speak. I would add immediately that countries that want influence should realize that this entails financial  political and moral obligations. Or  in the words of Winston Churchill  the price of greatness is responsibility.  I have briefly sketched why the United Nations is in need of renovation. I hope I have made clear that its relevance is tied not only to its legitimacy but also to its effectiveness. And I have suggested the direction the renovation might take in three specific areas. One thing I have not yet done  however  is to reaffirm that the Netherlands  in keeping with its long international tradition  will continue to work for quality in the United Nations system. Together with others  together with all represented in this Hall  we will work in the knowledge that this renovation  like all our activities  requires us to pool our resources. Or  as the United Nations Charter says: “unite our strength” and “combine our efforts”. Let those words inspire us in the work that lies ahead."
"128",5256,"NOR",65,2010,"Last week we reaffirmed our commitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We agreed to accelerate our efforts. Developing countries themselves have the main responsibility for achieving the MDGs  and the international community has the responsibility to assist by means of development and debt relief where appropriate. Norway is and will continue to be a solid and reliable partner in development. We will keep our development aid at its present substantial level  including our significant support to United Nations funds and programmes.  This year in particular  we are heartened to see strong support for improving maternal health and reducing child mortality  the Goals on which we are lagging behind the most. Norway will work with the Secretary-General to ensure that his Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health is transformed into action on the ground.  The many successful and inspiring meetings last week also illustrate that the challenges facing the world  which are increasingly global in character  require inclusive global forums to address them. That means engaging in dialogue with others  often with those who have different views. The United Nations is not designed to comfort different leaders in their own convictions; it is the place to confront and surpass differences. It is therefore highly inappropriate when this rostrum is abused to promote extreme views or unfounded claims. The challenges before us are too great to allow us to be derailed by attempts to incite conflict. We must never forget that we are a global community by virtue of the shared risks that stand before us  the shared threats that challenge us and the shared values that bind us together.   15 10-55408   Climate change threatens all our social and economic aspirations. Let me point to two important and dynamic processes that are among the most promising as we look for potential results in Cancún: limiting emissions from deforestation  and financing.  The Secretary-General’s High-Level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing  which the Prime Minister of Norway chairs together with the Prime Minister of Ethiopia  is working hard to identify sources that can enable us to raise the funds we committed to in Copenhagen. We need to define workable and acceptable sources  both private and public  and help pave the way for a new international climate agreement. We urge all Members to study the report we will receive this fall with an open mind and to build on this important work taking place at the initiative of the Secretary-General  as we prepare for Cancún and the period beyond.  Norway is leading support schemes for reducing emissions from deforestation. In Bali in 2007  Norway pledged to provide up to $500 million on an annual basis to halt deforestation. We are working with key partners such as Brazil  Indonesia and Guyana to develop concrete methods to do this in practice. Such measures are effective as a means of mitigation and provide strong leverage for new and additional financing for developing countries. They take effect immediately. I call on other countries to join in this great endeavour.  Ten years ago  we reaffirmed the connection between the three pillars of the United Nations: development  security and human rights. Human rights are an integral part of the United Nations vision and Charter  and should be mainstreamed in the work of the United Nations in all areas  as previously called for by this Assembly. Norway will continue to be active in the Human Rights Council and promote a human rights-based approach in United Nations development work. We will continue to work with partner countries from the North and South to this end  as we successfully did last week at the Trygve Lie Symposium on Fundamental Freedoms  focused on business and human rights.  This year also marks the 10-year anniversary of another major United Nations building block — Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security. Women’s empowerment is a crucial factor not only in sustainable development  but also in sustainable peace. It is time to make good on the commitments made and follow through on promises that will enable women to take an active role in situations that are a matter of life and death  not only for them  but for their families  communities and even nations. When we do take stock in October  we should focus on action taken  and above all on action that needs to be taken.  Norway would like to echo the vision and hope voiced by President Obama in this Assembly that we may in the near future have an agreement that will lead to the entry of a new Member into the United  Nations — an independent  sovereign State of Palestine.  The Ad Hoc Liaison Committee  which is chaired by Norway  has called for assistance to the Palestinian Authority in implementing the Programme for the Thirteenth Government for completing the task of building a Palestinian State  with regard to institution-building and the development of a sustainable Palestinian economy. The donors have been encouraged by recent reports that the implementation of the reform agenda accelerated significantly in the first half of 2010. The World Bank stated that if the Palestinian Authority were to maintain its current performance  it is well positioned for the establishment of a State at any point in the future.  It is crucial that this progress be mirrored by progress in the peace negotiations. Norway welcomes the relaunching earlier this month of direct bilateral negotiations to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We regret that Israel’s settlement moratorium was not extended. Norway reaffirms its strong commitment to the two-State solution and to supporting the negotiations by ensuring full compliance with Road Map obligations and maintaining their assistance to the Palestinian State-building effort.  Allow me to underline another process with enormous importance for regional peace  security and development. Supporting the parties in the full and timely implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for the Sudan must be on our agenda. We cannot afford to end up in a situation where we all regret that we let peace slip in the Sudan.  For over 60 years  the United Nations system  including the Bretton Woods institutions  has been the global intergovernmental framework for cooperation on joint challenges. Current trends in global    10-55408 16  cooperation may point towards a looser  more fragmented structure of global governance. There is a fine line between such strategic alliances as complementary to traditional multilateralism  and as alternatives for global multilateralism with the direct or indirect representation of all States. This is why Norway attaches great importance to the ongoing discussion on how to best facilitate constructive cooperation between the Group of 20 and the United Nations.  United Nations reform has been a topic of many statements during this debate. In order to remain relevant  the United Nations must continuously reform and adapt to a changing environment and new challenges. As Member States  we have the responsibility to ensure that the Organization is equipped to respond to the task it is given. Therefore we must continue to push for United Nations reform  but with a view to improving and strengthening the United Nations. We must build on what is already in progress and seems to be yielding results. Delivering as one is showing progress at the country level. It now needs to be followed up at Headquarters. The establishment of UN Women is a system-wide coherence success story. We congratulate Ms. Bachelet and pledge to support her in delivering on the promises made to UN Women. Beyond new panels and processes  we now need to finalize work on proposals that are already on the table.  For Norway  commitment to the United Nations also means commitment to reform — to strive for a United Nations that is efficient and able to live up to the expectations that we  the Member States  place on it. We owe it to each other and to future generations to maintain and strengthen the United Nations as a unique  inclusive and global meeting place where we  the peoples of this world  come together to solve the global challenges of our time. This is our common responsibility. "
"129",5302,"NPL",65,2010,"I wish to extend our sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on your election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I also thank the President at the sixty-fourth session for his excellent stewardship of that session. His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  Secretary-General of the United Nations  deserves our sincere appreciation for his commitment and dedication.  The message of the High-level Plenary Meeting of last week is still reverberating around this Assembly: the continuing poverty and hunger in today’s world  where we have made great strides in all our endeavours  is unacceptable and must be brought to an end without delay. It is quite disheartening to note that the number of poor has surpassed one billion and that they are concentrated in certain regions and groups of countries  mostly in least developed countries (LDCs).  The commitments expressed by the leaders attending the High-level Plenary Meeting last week rekindled our hope that it will be a different world in 2015. Otherwise  the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and many other vital documents will remain only a compilation of lofty promises. Let us hope that we match our commitments with our deeds.  International peace and security are our shared desire and a common responsibility. The challenges are multiple and complex. In an ever-changing world  the sources and the threats are varied  and so are the actors. Political and social conflicts have been aggravated by abject poverty and disparity. Therefore  the stabilization of global peace and security also demands ensuring freedom from want and hunger as a basic human right and enabling people to realize their full human potential. Thus we believe that development  peace and security are inextricably linked with one other.  Nepal has consistently and unequivocally called for general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction  under effective international control. Nepal stands for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons in a time-bound manner. The operationalization of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the early conclusion of a fissile materials cut-off treaty should be our priority. We support efforts for the non-proliferation of small arms and light weapons.  We welcome the signing in April this year of the New START treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation on strategic offensive arms. We welcome the successful outcome of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the  Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. However  we call for reinvigorating the Conference on Disarmament as a multilateral body  to start discussions on substantive issues. We also appreciate the efforts of the Secretary-General to advance nuclear disarmament on the basis of the five-point action plan he has proposed.  Nepal strongly believes that regional mechanisms complement efforts to promote the global disarmament agenda. The United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific  which we are proud to host  must be strengthened in order to revitalize the Kathmandu process to facilitate dialogue and deliberations on confidence-building in the region.  In today’s world  devastating conflicts are a constant threat to international security. Despite progress on many fronts  violence and civil wars    10-55128 52  continue unabated. It is a matter of concern that intra-State conflicts and extremism have steadily grown over the years. We should work collectively. In accordance with the principles and Charter of the United Nations  we should all contribute to resolving such conflicts through peaceful means and should help stabilize situations through peacebuilding efforts.  In the Middle East  we are encouraged by the recent direct dialogue between the Israelis and the Palestinians. We look forward to the success of the dialogue leading towards an independent Palestinian State alongside a secure Israel. We would like to see a peaceful resolution to disputes in the Korean peninsula through dialogue.  Terrorism is a threat to all and knows no geographical boundary. We unequivocally condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and call for resolute international actions to fight it. Nepal has been implementing the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and is party to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism of 1987 and its Additional Protocol.  Legitimacy  universality and common ideals have been the defining features of the United Nations. Continued adherence to its core principles and purposes will reinforce sovereign equality  territorial integrity  non-interference and the peaceful settlement of disputes. The inspiring values and the lofty ideals that underpin the United Nations Charter remain as relevant as ever.  We live in an era of continuous change. The economic landscape is also changing with the emergence of new  yet vibrant  poles of growth. Globalization has changed the pattern of economic relations  although its benefits are not widely and equitably distributed.  The effectiveness of the United Nations depends on our collective will to act and to deal with global issues resolutely. In the face of new and emerging challenges  it is urgent that the ideals of the United Nations be translated into action effectively and in a coherent manner. The theme of this year’s general debate — “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance” — captures that essence.  We underline the centrality of the United Nations not only in maintaining peace and security  but also in promoting international cooperation for development. Its role in shaping policy debate on and establishing global norms for economic and financial matters must not be sidelined. The reform agenda needs to strike the right balance to promote stability in the broadest sense. Just as security and peace are critical for the international community  so is the development agenda. It must be given a focused priority within the United Nations system.  United Nations reform should be pursued in a systematic and holistic manner to further enhance the Organization’s global standing.   The realities of the contemporary world call for a change in the composition and working methods of the Security Council. We support the expansion of membership in the Council in both categories to reflect the current realities of the world. We also call for transparency in its working methods. We welcome recent efforts to structure the debates with a view to starting negotiations by taking into account the views of all Member States.  We welcome the ongoing discussions on the revitalization of the General Assembly in the context of the balance between the various organs of the United Nations  as envisioned by the founders. The role of the Economic and Social Council must be enhanced in promoting global economic relations and in advancing the development agenda  in close cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions and other relevant institutions. The Development Cooperation Forum and the annual ministerial review are a welcome change in that body.  We need to make the United Nations more effective in ensuring coherence and consistency in the global economic  financial and trading systems. We call for special support for counter-cyclical measures  social safety nets to protect the vulnerable  and fiscal space to mitigate the crisis. We should make all these steps particularly responsive to the needs and concerns of vulnerable countries  such as LDCs.  Nepal welcomes the adoption of the resolution on system-wide coherence by the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  with a view to strengthening and streamlining the operational activities of the United Nations in the field of development (resolution 64/289). We also welcome and strongly support the   53 10-55128  establishment of UN Women as a single consolidated entity to deal with issues pertaining to gender equality and the empowerment of women.  Global peace and stability are our cherished goal. Guided by that principled objective  Nepal has extended unflinching support to all major United Nations initiatives for the maintenance of international peace and security through its active and consistent participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations around the world. In 2008  we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of our association with United Nations peacekeeping operations with a view to further consolidating our contributions to the cause of international peace and security. Today  more than 5 000 Nepalese peacekeepers work in 13 different peacekeeping missions around the world. Nepal’s involvement in United Nations peacekeeping missions has been one of the remarkable features of its international engagement. We continue to participate with dedication.  In line with our solemn commitment to the United Nations Charter and our contribution to promoting its ideals  I have the pleasure of announcing at this Assembly that the Government of Nepal has put forward the candidacy of Mr. Kul Chandra Gautam  adviser to the Prime Minister of Nepal on the peace process and international affairs  for the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session.  The gradual increase in the number of peacekeeping missions is an indicator of the sombre fact that the number of conflicts around the world has increased in recent years. The sustainable way to resolve conflicts is to look at them comprehensively and remove the factors that generate and sustain them.  Nepal’s commitment to human rights is resolute. We are party to major international human rights instruments. We are fully aware that the protection and promotion of all human rights and fundamental freedoms strengthen the sustainability of peace and progress. The National Human Rights Commission  an independent judiciary  a vibrant civil society and the media have all played an important role in promoting awareness and protecting human rights in Nepal.  Our fellow South Asian country Pakistan recently suffered tragic loss of lives and destruction due to unprecedented floods. Similarly  fellow LDC Haiti faced a devastating earthquake. Those disasters have wiped out hard-earned gains  and therefore we call for full sympathy and support to them in their hour of need.  Climate change has become a challenge to human existence  a multidimensional threat to human lives and all living things  the global ecosystem and human civilization. It has a direct impact on our efforts to eradicate poverty and hunger and to preserve the ecological balance.  My country  which is a least developed landlocked country with mountainous terrain  is highly vulnerable to climate change. The Himalayas remain the perennial source of freshwater for over a billion people living in South Asia. Global warming has precipitated the melting of snow in the Nepalese Himalayas  and about two dozen of our glacial lakes could burst their banks any time  causing a huge loss of lives and property. Moreover  we face extreme weather events  floods  soil degradation and desertification. Because of their fragility  mountain countries face special vulnerability to climate change.  Countries like Nepal contribute the least to climate change  yet we bear a disproportionate impact  and it is the poor and vulnerable people among us who face its severe effects. We cannot wait for action forever. At the national level  we are pursuing afforestation programmes and promoting the use of alternative sources of energy  as well as hydropower generation.  There is an urgent need to make progress on climate negotiations through an ambitious and comprehensive outcome in Cancún  Mexico  later this year. The international community should agree on new  predictable  transparent and substantially enhanced resource mobilization and a fast-track provision to ensure resources for mitigation  adaptation  technology transfer  reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation — REDD-Plus — and capacity-building in the least developed countries. LDCs must be given priority so that they may withstand the sweeping impact of climate change on their people’s livelihoods.  International responses to the special needs and concerns of LDCs have had limited success. The implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action has produced mixed results. The overall performance of LDCs in the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals stands well below their expectations  despite some progress.    10-55128 54  That is primarily because we continue to face structural handicaps and constraints  as well as a critical resource gap in our development efforts.  Mutually reinforcing and exacerbating food  energy  economic and financial crises  together with the adverse and disproportionate impacts of climate change  have further worsened the conditions of LDCs. Limited economic activity  stagnant growth  the early stage of industrialization  heavy reliance on subsistence agriculture as the mainstay of the national economy and a lack of employment opportunities in other sectors have made poor countries highly vulnerable to external shocks.  Such challenges cannot be overcome without a renewed and scaled-up global partnership for development. The fulfilment of all commitments to official development assistance in a predictable  transparent and accountable manner  the enhanced provision of duty- and quota-free market access for all LDCs  and the early conclusion of the Doha Round with an ambitious  balanced  equitable and development-oriented outcome and early results in provisions aimed at LDCs will help generate economic growth through equitable trade. Enhanced debt relief measures  an increased flow of foreign direct investment  technology transfer and investment in building long-term productive capacity will be critically important in order to ensure resources for the financing of sustainable development in LDCs.  The United Nations will host the fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries in Istanbul next year. The Conference must aim to have an ambitious  comprehensive  forward-looking and results-oriented outcome. As the Chair of the LDC Coordinating Bureau  I call upon the international community to make the Istanbul outcome a turning point in addressing the multidimensional challenges and constraints that LDCs face today. The success of the Conference will be measured by its contributions to making a difference in the conditions of the millions of poor in our countries.  Nepal is also a landlocked country. Therefore  our development challenges are further compounded by that reality  which increases the cost of our international trade substantially. Therefore  specific support measures to improve infrastructure and trade facilitation in line with the Almaty Programme of Action for landlocked developing countries will be critical to promoting their development needs.  I will now touch on the political situation and the ongoing peace process in my country. Nepal is passing through the arduous transition from a 10-year conflict to sustainable peace and stability with a nationally driven peace process. We have come a long way since June 2006  when the peace process started  with some ups and downs  which is only natural for a complex peace process. Yet our national determination remains strong and unwavering  and we are fully committed to bringing the ongoing peace process to a meaningful conclusion by resolving all outstanding issues.  From a longer-term perspective  Nepal has achieved some remarkable progress since the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord on 21 November 2006. The promulgation of the interim constitution  the election of the Constituent Assembly and  subsequently  the declaration of Nepal as a federal democratic republic stand as notable achievements.  Today  the 601-member Constituent Assembly of Nepal  a third of whom are women  is one of the most inclusive assemblies. The Assembly comprises representation from different ethnic groups  backward regions and traditionally marginalized communities  among others.  Historic and unique as it is  Nepal’s peace process is not confined only to the issue of signing the Peace Accord and the elections to the Constituent Assembly. The next important task is to write a new constitution for the newly born republic. That will consolidate the gains made over the years in establishing the people as the real source of sovereignty and State authority and in guaranteeing multiparty democracy  human rights  a federal structure and inclusive governance. Therefore  the process encompasses a much broader agenda  leading towards the historic transformation of Nepal’s political  economic and social structure.  The people of Nepal nurture the hope of a better future  which they rightly deserve. Political transformation needs to be complemented by social transformation and economic prosperity. While ensuring political stability  we are making efforts to revive the economy with new and focused initiatives for the acceleration of economic activities  including through the celebration of Nepal Tourism Year in 2011. We hope that visitors will enjoy the flora and fauna of   55 10-55128  Nepal  including tours to Lumbini in Nepal  the birthplace of Lord Buddha. To that end and to revitalize and accelerate our economy  we look forward to ambitious recovery measures with support from the international community.  Recently we have made some progress in addressing the core issues of the integration and rehabilitation of the former Maoist combatants. In that context  I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the Government and the Unified Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist have agreed to complete the process within four months  under the monitoring and supervision of the Special Committee  formed on the basis of national consensus  as per the Constitution.  We anticipate accomplishing the outstanding basic tasks in the peace process within the coming four months  with the positive contributions of national stakeholders and the goodwill and support of the international community. Earlier this year  we also achieved remarkable success  with the help of the United Nations  in releasing the disqualified minors living in cantonments  based on the action plan signed on 16 December 2009.  The United Nations Mission in Nepal has been involved in support of Nepal’s nationally driven peace process. We express our appreciation to the United Nations for its consistent support of our peace process.  Nepal’s commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter is total and unflinching. For us  the United Nations is the best expression of multilateralism. It has served the international community in the past and continues to work as a linchpin of international relationships today. We have no doubt as to its indispensability.  However  it needs to do more in this globalized world. Global problems require global solutions. That is possible only through multilateralism  based on inclusiveness and equity. We look for an enhanced and coherent role of the United Nations in dealing with all global issues  but in particular those that affect the lives and livelihoods of the poor around the world. "
"130",5319,"NRU",65,2010,"I would like to offer my heartfelt congratulations to the President of the Assembly on his assumption of the presidency of this body at its sixty-fifth session. Also  allow me to commend his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  for his capable leadership during the sixty-fourth session.  This week is vitally important for my island nation of Nauru and for small island developing States generally. This week we will complete the high-level reviews of the Millennium Development Goals and the Mauritius Strategy  two programmes that are central to the sustainable development prospects of my country.   We gather here on this occasion to reaffirm the central role of the United Nations in global governance. However  the centrality of the United Nations system must derive from its ability to help bring about positive outcomes for all of its membership. In that regard  the United Nations report card is mixed.  While this body and others have brought attention to the unique and particular vulnerabilities of small island developing States  they have not always succeeded in delivering concrete benefits. There is a proliferation of global action plans but a paucity of action. For this reason  Nauru has relied more on its domestic institutions and bilateral partners than on multilateral governance solutions.  Nauru turned a corner in 2005 when it adopted its National Sustainable Development Strategy  commonly known to us as our NSDS. Under that plan we have made significant progress across most sectors. Our financial system is now more transparent and Government more accountable. Most importantly  we have restored some measures of security for our citizens: expanded public health programmes  new and refurbished schools  updated curriculum and more teachers. Power is more reliable and its usage more efficient. Regular air and maritime travel has been restored  and we have seen major improvements in our communications system.  Most of the gains in the past five years have been the result of our own efforts  largely supported by bilateral development partners targeting our national plans. However  our journey is far from over. Our NSDS lays out a clear path forward to aid independence based on our national circumstances and capacity. Its medium- and long-term milestones are fully consistent with  and complementary to  the Millennium Development Goals and Mauritius Strategy programmes. It is my hope that the United Nations can play a more significant role in this next phase of our development.   Five years after our initial request  I am pleased that the United Nations has opened its joint presence office in Nauru. It is my hope that that will enable United Nations agencies to be more familiar with  and responsive to  our unique development challenges.  The future of all my people depends on an effective United Nations system  but none more so than the future of our youth. Not long ago  my country    10-54965 34  suffered a devastating economic crisis. It was followed by the explosion in global fuel and food prices and then by the global economic downturn  which many of us are still grappling with today. Those crises were exacerbated by virtue of Nauru being a small and isolated island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. As a country  we will overcome. However  some impacts will be felt longer than others.  Perhaps the cruellest legacy of our economic crisis is the impact it had on the youth who grew up during that trying time. Advantages that my generation took for granted — a good education  basic health care and abundant job opportunities — were simply not available for many of our youth during a critical period in their lives. In the absence of such advantages  substance abuse  illiteracy  delinquency and lifestyle-related illnesses became commonplace. As we progress as a nation  we must ensure that we do not leave one segment of our community behind. Our collective future will not be secure unless we invest in the community and business leaders of tomorrow.  It is for this reason that Nauru appreciates the importance of the International Year of Youth  which commenced in August 2010. This United Nations tradition began 25 years ago when this body recognized the profoundly important role that youth should have in shaping a new international economic order based on equity and justice.  My Government has made investing in our youth a top priority. Nauru is on track to reach our Millennium Development Goal of universal primary education by 2015. We have been successful despite the significant shortage of quality Nauruan teachers.   Of equal importance to the development of our primary and secondary education systems is the need to develop technical and vocational training  recognizing and certifying skills and job-oriented training. Only by continued investment in human resource development will the next generation of Nauruans be prepared for the challenges of the twenty-first century.  Our health sector  too  has made gains in curative services and preventative health programmes. However  around 75 per cent of people in the Pacific suffer from non-communicable diseases. That is not sustainable. Investments in public health must be accompanied by investments in improving food security. It will be difficult to change that alarming statistic for the better unless my people have a reliable supply of affordable and nutritious food. Health education must also receive more emphasis in our educational programmes.  Education and public health are obviously two areas that are fundamental for the well-being of our youth  but alone they are not enough. Our youth must also be given the opportunity to use their skills in productive ways  lest those skills wither on the vine. For that we need a growing economy  and for a growing economy we must look to our development partners and multilateral institutions for assistance.  Aid should be deployed so as to build a foundation for sustainable development in all economic sectors  including basic infrastructure  in which to date there has been less progress than in health and education. The re-establishment of banking and financial services continues to elude us despite all our urgent efforts to obtain assistance. Nation-building and youth development must run parallel to each other if either is to succeed. Investments in basic infrastructure will enable us to expand our economic base  increase exports and also reduce the costs of imports.  The United Nations system must also be enhanced in order to avoid the mistakes of the past. That is why we are joining others in calling for the creation of a formal small island developing States (SIDS) category within the United Nations system.   The international community has consistently recognized the unique vulnerabilities of the small island developing States  yet that recognition has not been translated into effective action. The preparatory work for the five-year review of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States found that the vulnerabilities of SIDS remain and that progress towards sustainable development is far below expectations. It is clear that business as usual is not working and that a new approach is long overdue.  The creation of a new SIDS category would make the United Nations more responsive to the particular needs of small islands. This new category should be accompanied by structural support mechanisms in the areas of development assistance  financial support and trade. Only by dealing with the vulnerabilities of SIDS can there be any realistic prospect of SIDS attaining sustainable economic growth.   35 10-54965   The most important test of our commitment to our youth is the state of the world that we leave to them. We have long been aware of the environmental crises currently facing our oceans and our climate  but we have done precious little to address them. Without immediate and aggressive international action on both fronts  we will bequeath to our children a world that is far poorer than the one we ourselves inhabited.  Nauru takes these threats very seriously  which is why my country  along with other island countries in the Pacific  recently strengthened the Nauru Agreement. That multilateral agreement on oceans governance is a major step in strengthening an effective regime for managing and protecting regional tuna stocks. The preservation of that resource is essential to our region’s food security and to our economic development. Regrettably  the sustainability of the tuna stocks and other marine resources that we rely on is threatened by actions beyond our control. Illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing and overfishing by large fishing nations is rife in the Pacific  and we lack sufficient resources to respond to that criminal activity. One of the pillars of our economic future is literally being stolen from our children.  With regard to climate change  my island and many others like it face an existential threat far beyond our capacity to adapt. Rising sea levels and extreme weather may one day render my home uninhabitable. But an island can die long before it has disappeared beneath the sea. All that is required is to deprive its youth of hope. What incentive will they have to invest in their home if it will not be there for when they are older? We have an opportunity to change course later this year at the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Cancún. We must act as if our children’s future depended on the decisions we make.  Climate change is a global issue and demands the full participation of all. We therefore call on the immediate inclusion of Taiwan in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process. We must also recognize that climate change poses many threats — security threats — that are not addressed under the UNFCCC process. That is why the Pacific small island developing States introduced in the General Assembly a resolution on climate change and its possible security implications (resolution 63/281). The Security Council  as the primary body of the United Nations entrusted with preserving international peace and security  must also play its role.  Lastly  we must ensure that the views and perspectives of all nations and peoples are incorporated into the decision-making of the United Nations system and its specialized agencies. In that context  Nauru strongly supports Taiwan’s campaign for meaningful participation in the International Civil Aviation Organization.  I would like to conclude by thanking our development partners for their long-standing commitment to Nauru  particularly our major partners — Australia  Taiwan  the Russia Federation  New Zealand  the European Union and Japan — as well as our many other active partners  including Cuba  Italy  India  the Republic of Korea and Israel. We further recognize the international and regional organizations that have continued to stand by our side during a difficult period in our history  and I look forward to our continuing cooperation.  I would also like to commend the United Nations for beginning a difficult process of reflection and reform so as to be able to more effectively respond to the global challenges we all face. Nauru looks forward to participating in this important discussion so that the United Nations can continue to play a central role in global governance.  May God bless the Republic of Nauru and may God bless the United Nations."
"131",5366,"NZL",65,2010,"It is an honour to lead New Zealand’s delegation this year. The opening of the General Assembly’s new session is the best example there is of the capacity of the United Nations to bring us all together. Our discussions here will be wide-ranging  but inevitably settle on two main issues: global security and sustainable economic development.   We want to make our world safer  more secure and more prosperous. These goals will require strong collective action with a focus on practical outcomes. New Zealand is seeking every opportunity to contribute. We are a young  small and fair-minded country. We depend upon a United Nations that is effective and credible.  New Zealand takes pride in its diversity. In addition to our indigenous Maori population  we are a mix of people from Europe  Asia and the Pacific. Our links with Europe are built on history and tradition. Within Asia  we are developing ever-stronger economic and security relationships. Our future is closely tied to both of these regions. We have an equally strong focus on our closest neighbours in the South Pacific. New Zealand is a Pacific country. Auckland is the largest Pasifika city in the world  and a number of Pacific countries have more citizens living in New Zealand than at home.  The security and development of the region is New Zealand’s constant preoccupation. It is a matter of grave concern that the South Pacific is second only to sub-Saharan Africa in terms of lack of progress towards the achievement of some of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We want to see the MDGs achieved  and we want to see the wider Pacific prosper through good governance and sustainable economic development. That is why New Zealand is increasingly deploying our development resources within its region  since that is where they are most needed and where they can be most effective.  The development challenges in the Pacific are extremely complex  with vulnerable economies and challenging environmental circumstances. New Zealand has increased and will continue to increase our overall level of development assistance  despite challenging times for our domestic economy. A higher percentage of that larger budget will be focused on our region.  But money alone is not enough; aid effectiveness and donor coordination are vital. Progress will also depend on good governance within the region.  Next year we will mark the fortieth anniversary of the Pacific Islands Forum  the central body for regional engagement in the Pacific  which held its first meeting in New Zealand in 1971. We will welcome leaders from around the region back to New Zealand next September to celebrate our achievements over 40 years and to take stock of the challenges we must face in the future.  The past year has reinforced the need for better disaster management. Just three weeks ago  residents in Christchurch woke to the most destructive earthquake in New Zealand in 80 years. Miraculously  there was no loss of life  but the damage runs into billions of dollars and people’s lives and livelihoods were affected. Significant aftershocks are still affecting the   51 10-54965  population. But less than a month after the earthquake hit  roads and buildings have been repaired  tourism infrastructure is at almost full capacity  and people’s lives are being rebuilt.  Others have not been so lucky. The earthquakes in Haiti and Chile and the recent flooding in Pakistan are reminders of the devastating scale of such disasters. The Pacific has been hit hard  too. This month will mark the first anniversary of the Pacific tsunami that took the lives of 184 people in Samoa  American Samoa and Tonga.  These events and others demonstrate the importance of disaster preparedness  management and recovery. New Zealand’s experience with major earthquakes has taught us how to mitigate risks  enforce strong building codes  and implement effective recovery plans. But there will be lessons we should learn from this recent experience. We will work with the United Nations system  non-governmental organizations and other international agencies to ensure that those lessons are shared and help others to prepare.  While development and disaster management are crucial to our quest for a safer world  underpinning both is security. Peacekeeping is a key responsibility of the Organization. Indeed  it is its peacekeeping operations that shape perceptions of the United Nations for many people around the world.  New Zealand is committed to supporting global security and United Nations peacekeeping. That is why we have been engaged in peacekeeping and peace support operations since the 1940s. New Zealand’s soldiers  police  engineers  corrections and customs officers  doctors and other personnel are today involved in 12 operations that span the globe from Africa  Afghanistan and the Middle East to Asia and the Pacific.  One of the clearest examples of New Zealand’s commitment to the principles of collective responsibility is through the United Nations effort in Timor-Leste. Since 1999  New Zealand has been a part of every United Nations mission that has served in Timor-Leste. We have played a major role in the United Nations-sanctioned international military operations that restored order there in 1999 and again in 2006. Over 6 000 New Zealanders have served in Timor in the past decade — a significant undertaking for a country of only 4.4 million people.  Of course  helping ensure peace and stability in our region alone is not enough. New Zealanders are among those who have been affected by terrorism  killed in the attacks that took place just a few blocks away from here in September 2001  and more recently in Bali  in London and in Jakarta.  The need to respond decisively to those who perpetrate such atrocities is a key reason why New Zealand has led the provincial reconstruction team in Bamyan  Afghanistan  since 2003. We have redeployed our special forces to work alongside the Government of Afghanistan and the international community to ensure that that country does not return to being a safe haven for Al-Qaida. We must address the conditions in which terrorism thrives. We are increasing our development spending in Bamyan and recently placed the Provincial Reconstruction Team under civilian leadership for the first time.  New Zealand is also strongly supportive of peacekeeping reform. The expansion in peacekeeping since 1990 has been dramatic. Never before has this Organization deployed so many missions to such complex environments. This expansion has opened up discussion of the way the United Nations conducts its peacekeeping operations. Clear and achievable mandates are needed  progress needs to be better monitored  and efficiency needs to be improved.  We are also contributing to United Nations efforts to strengthen peacebuilding in practice  including the need for better participation of women in peacebuilding. Of course  the response of the United Nations to crises has not always been successful. It is for this reason that New Zealand has strongly supported the responsibility to protect (R2P). We were pleased to contribute to the proposed joint Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide/R2P office and look forward to the more comprehensive implementation of R2P throughout the United Nations system.  Effective pursuit of these goals — countering terrorism and maintaining peace and security — demands coordinated  collective action. The United Nations is the best vehicle for that action. New Zealand has been  and remains  proud to be a part of that community of collective action. In line with that commitment  New Zealand is seeking a seat on the Security Council for the 2015-2016 term. In doing so     10-54965 52  we will work with others here who want the world to be a safer and more prosperous place.  This year significant gains have been made in global disarmament. New Zealand welcomes the action plan adopted at this year’s Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference  the groundbreaking nuclear security summit  and the entry into force of the Convention on Cluster Munitions. These are tangible and practical successes. But we still face some significant challenges. New Zealand is concerned by the continuing inertia of the Conference on Disarmament. The Secretary-General’s High-level Meeting on disarmament this morning was a valuable step in acknowledging this problem and trying to find a way forward.  As a country that prides itself on sustainable development  New Zealand is also greatly concerned about global environmental issues. As well as working towards an outcome in Cancún  we are involved in practical projects for addressing climate change. One such project is the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases. Fourteen per cent of worldwide greenhouse-gas emissions come from agriculture. At the same time  there are projections that world food production needs to increase by 50 per cent in the next 20 years  and to double in the next 40 years  to feed a growing world.  Clearly  we need a scientific breakthrough to help meet the challenge of producing more food while reducing emissions. New Zealand formed the Alliance  which now includes more than 30 agricultural nations  to find ways to address this problem. Scientists and researchers are now linking up across the world to try to balance the need for increased agricultural production with the need to address climate change. This is just one example of how countries can come together to address climate change in a very real way.  When I was here a year ago  we were watching to see whether the world would be able to climb out of the global economic recession. Much progress has been made and key economic indicators are generally pointing in the right direction. The rapid and coordinated international response  including by the Group of 20  has been effective. The World Trade Organization’s rules-based trading system has held up well. But  like many countries  New Zealand is frustrated that the conclusion of the Doha Development Round still eludes us.  Over these last few days  especially in the context of discussion of progress towards the Millennium Development Goals  I have heard many fine words spoken in support of the world’s disadvantaged. I take this opportunity to remind those speakers and countries that the single most effective step that could be taken to advance the position of the world’s disadvantaged would be to create a framework within which they can trade themselves to a better future.  I want to strongly endorse President Obama’s statement  made yesterday  that there is no viable alternative to the resolution of conflict in the Middle East other than two States  Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace and security. We believe that direct negotiations  with both parties at the table  are the only way to resolve the conflict. We congratulate President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu on having the courage to negotiate in very difficult circumstances. We ask that Israel heed the international community’s unanimous call to extend the moratorium on settlements and create the enabling atmosphere that will allow direct negotiations to continue.  We also agree with President Obama that resolution of the Middle East conflict is not just the responsibility of Israel and Palestine. Countries in the region especially  but also countries elsewhere  must work towards Middle East peace. New Zealand  as a friend of both Israel and Palestine  will play its part. I recently visited the Sinai  where a New Zealand officer has command of the Multinational Force and Observers. I was reminded that there has been peace between Israel and Egypt for more than 30 years  a prospect once unthinkable. With the commitment of the two parties and the support of the international community  Israel and Palestine can enjoy the same freedom from conflict. We all have a huge stake in achieving that objective. Resolution of the Palestinian question would tear out the fuse that threatens to ignite conflict in the Middle East and beyond.  So today we add our voice to that of President Obama and of others who believe that this dispute can  and must  be solved. And we call on all Members of the United Nations to lend their support to this process in the critical weeks ahead."
"132",5410,"OMN",65,2010,"It gives me great pleasure to offer you  Sir  and your friendly country  Switzerland  our warmest congratulations on your election to preside over the sixty-fifth session of the General assembly. I also wish to express our appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  for his fruitful efforts in conducting the deliberations of the previous session.  For more than 65 years  since its inception  the United Nations has registered tangible achievements. It has offered assistance and expertise in the socio-economic and environmental spheres  as well as in the cause of international security and peace  and has contributed to the establishment of stability in a number of regions of the world.  The Sultanate of Oman hopes that at this session the Assembly will make unprecedented progress in our shared pursuit of international peace and security  as well as prosperity.  The international community meets today in challenging times  faced with a whole range of thorny issues  from ongoing political instability to security challenges  financial crises  economic and environmental problems  the nuclear question and non-proliferation. It may be useful to recall here the lesson that such challenges can best be met through dialogue and positive participation by all  aimed at arresting threats to international peace and security.  The floods in Pakistan led to the dislocation of more than 20 million Pakistanis  who have lost their homes and are still experiencing tragic suffering  despite the continuing international rescue efforts. More outside assistance  expertise and capabilities are needed to help Pakistan overcome this tragedy and mitigate its consequences on the ground  as well as push ahead with the reconstruction process.  Those floods  the volcanic eruption in Iceland and the H1N1 epidemic  for example  are recent phenomena that have highlighted how interconnected the States of the world are and the need for international cooperation. What affects one corner of the world can truly have sweeping impacts across the globe.  The United Nations  its specialized agencies and legal organs were established after devastating wars  in the aftermath of the First and Second World Wars. Although the international community has not yet been able to find the means to resolve complex political problems  the United Nations offers multilateral mechanisms and goals that have played an enormous part in the reduction or neutralization of many crises. In addition  it plays key roles in helping developing countries in numerous specialized fields related to socio-economic development and the protection of the environment.  We believe that the effectiveness of the United Nations must reach a new level. This requires that the permanent members of the Security Council accept a reorganization of the United Nations  including an expansion of its administrative base  with fair management of world trade interests  in a way which makes Member States feel that it is an Organization for all.  We look forward to seeing the international community conduct a comprehensive review of the requirements for international peace and security  in view of all the lessons learned from wars in the past century and in this century.  We also look forward  Mr. President  along with you and all Member States  to a world of lasting security  characterized by good intentions and confidence in the future  a world where all peoples enjoy shining freedom and the beauty of life. We look forward to the day when dialogue prevails on the basis of accepting the other  regardless of social and cultural variations between human communities. We believe that dialogue between Governments  which differ in their perspectives on issues  will lead to a clearer system of global partnership and coexistence  in which development  welfare and prosperity prevail.  The Sultanate of Oman believes strongly that part of its responsibilities in the context of development is to make the Omani person the effective mover of the wheel of development. Therefore  my country has dedicated all resources towards that goal  especially with regard to education at all levels and medical care for every individual.  The people of Oman and their Government play their roles in society and participate effectively in everything concerning the life of the Omani citizen through the Council of Oman  with its two chambers: the Council of State and the Consultative Council. The role of the Omani citizen along the path of his country’s development is central and indispensable  stemming from the firm conviction of the leader of Oman’s renaissance  His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said  that life is created for mankind  male and female  that    10-55276 4  freedom is the core of life  and that free positive expression is the seed of creativity  which is the fuel for development. With that insightful vision of His Majesty  the Sultanate of Oman is moving towards the future with firm determination.  We wish to stress our strong belief in the absolute necessity of finding a solution to the chronic conflict in the Middle East. Although we support the direct negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis  sponsored by the United States of America  we still feel that the Israeli policy is vague with regard to accepting Israel’s responsibility towards the requirements of peace: the establishment of an independent  sovereign and viable Palestinian State  with East Jerusalem as its capital  and Israel’s withdrawal from all Arab lands to the borders of 4 June 1967.  We look forward to an active  positive and continuing role by United States President Barack Obama in order to reach a just and comprehensive settlement. We call upon Israel to grasp this historic opportunity to establish partnership in peace and security with the Arab countries. "
"133",5457,"PAK",65,2010,"I wish to congratulate the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session on his election. As one of the Vice-Presidents at this session  we assure him of our full support and cooperation. I also take this opportunity to convey profound gratitude and appreciation to my brother  Ali Treki  the outgoing President  for his able leadership during the sixty-fourth session. Pakistan owes him gratitude for his timely initiative to convene a plenary meeting of the Assembly on the humanitarian emergency arising from the floods in Pakistan (see A/64/PV.110).  I come to the Assembly at a difficult time in Pakistan’s history. The recent flash floods — the worst in living memory — have left behind a trail of death and destruction. Precious lives have been lost  millions of acres of crops have been washed away  homes have been destroyed and livelihoods have been lost. We are grateful to the United Nations  our development partners and other friends in the international community for standing up with us in this difficult hour and for their important contribution in supporting rescue and relief operations in Pakistan.  The Government remains focused in its resolve to address the challenges posed by that humanitarian crisis. We are determined to rebuild a better and vibrant Pakistan and to do so in a transparent and accountable manner. The resilience of our people should enable us to achieve that.  We live in an ever more interconnected and interdependent world  a world where our fate and destinies are interwoven like never before  a world where it is increasingly difficult to maintain islands of peace and prosperity while conflicts  oppression and adversity fester. We live in a world where dividends of peace are shared as easily as the fallout of adversity or instability.  Today  we face an integrated onslaught of a series of new and emerging challenges that seriously threaten economic growth and development  social cohesion and environmental protection in our countries. We clearly have reached a decisive moment. We will have to make wise and well-considered choices that bring peace and prosperity to our world at present while protecting and preserving it for future generations.  The response is simple: global problems require global solutions. The world needs a new multilateral approach that truly subscribes to the values and principles that we  the peoples of the United Nations  signed on to 65 years ago.    10-55264 24   The United Nations Charter envisages a world where equity is valued as much as entitlement  where inclusiveness replaces exclusiveness  where dialogue and collaboration define engagement  where transparency and openness guide business and decision-making in global institutions. Full and unconditional adherence to those values and principles is what will put us on the road to durable peace and security and sustained economic growth. As the primus inter pares  the United Nations is the only and truly universal multilateral Organization that enjoys the credibility  legitimacy and universal acceptability to realize that — which is also its raison d’être.  Pakistan supports comprehensive reform of the Security Council to make it more representative  equitable  transparent and accountable. Council reform must be guided by the principles of equality and democracy  which could conform to a dynamic future  one not entrenched in the historical mistakes and individual privileges of the past. We should look for an outcome that unites and does not divide the membership  one that strengthens and does not weaken the Organization. Our collective search should culminate in a consensus solution that corresponds to the interest of the entire membership  particularly small and medium States  developing countries and Africa.  Pakistan  as a leading troop-contributing country for United Nations peacekeeping  is playing its due role in the maintenance of international peace and security. Our peacekeepers have laid down their lives in missions that were operationally demanding and geographically difficult. The unique status of the United Nations brings acceptance to its peacekeeping activities  and the success of peacekeeping operations  in turn  brings credibility to the world body. For those suffering in a conflict zone  the sight of a blue helmet provides a beacon of hope  which has illuminated the lives of millions by bringing peace and alleviating their pains and sorrows.  Our commitment to the promotion of peace  security and stability  the development of friendly relations with other nations  respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and the promotion of economic and social development is unwavering. It is that firm conviction that has enabled our democratic Government to remain steadfast in its resolve to fight terrorism and extremism  even as we have to deal with the massive destruction caused by catastrophic floods. Our national consensus and resolve to fight extremism and terrorism remains unshaken.  The world recognizes and applauds the important successes achieved by our security forces against terrorists. Those successes have come at a heavy cost. More than 20 000 innocent civilians have fallen victim to terrorism  and more than 2 500 personnel of the security forces have offered the ultimate sacrifice. Our material losses are nearly $50 billion. The Pakistani nation will persist in its efforts to eliminate terrorism.  The issue has both regional and global dimensions. It is imperative that all countries do more to combat that menace. It is also essential to address the root causes of terrorism  which are often found in poverty  deprivation  injustices and oppression. Terrorists recognize no borders; they have no religion and no creed. It is therefore absurd to malign a whole people or a region or any religion on that account. We cannot accept the stereotyping of Muslims as terrorists. Islam is a religion of peace  compassion and brotherhood. Terrorism is a complete antithesis to Islam’s humanistic outlook and noble values.  Pakistan supports the just cause of the Palestinian people for restitution of their inalienable national rights  including their independent Palestinian State with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.  The brazen use of force against the humanitarian freedom flotilla on 31 May 2010  which resulted in the killing of humanitarian workers  was a flagrant violation of international law and norms. We look forward to a prompt  impartial and transparent inquiry of the incident by the Secretary-General’s Panel of Inquiry.  The dispute over Jammu and Kashmir is one of the oldest on the agenda of the United Nations. It is about the exercise of the right to self-determination by the Kashmiri people through a free  fair and impartial plebiscite under United Nations auspices.  Pakistan views the prevailing situation in Indian-occupied Kashmir with grave concern. Over the past two months  more than 100 Kashmiris have been killed by Indian security forces in Kashmir. We strongly condemn that brutality. The human rights of the Kashmiri people must be respected and their voices heard to create an enabling environment for a peaceful solution to the long-standing Jammu and Kashmir dispute. Pakistan reaffirms its complete solidarity with   25 10-55264  the Kashmiri people and urges the international community to persuade India to end its repression in Kashmir.  Pakistan is willing to engage India in a comprehensive dialogue to normalize relations between the two countries by finding amicable solutions to all outstanding issues  including the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir. A peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute  in accordance with United Nations resolutions and taking into account the aspirations of the Kashmiri people  would create an atmosphere conducive to durable peace and stability in the South Asian region.  In the spirit of global solidarity and good-neighbourly relations  Pakistan has hosted the largest concentration of refugees anywhere in the world for the past 30 years. We continue to host our Afghan brothers as a moral and humanitarian duty. No country has suffered more than Pakistan from the direct and indirect consequences of decades of conflict in Afghanistan. We thus have an abiding stake in peace and stability in Afghanistan. Our commitment to that objective remains firm. The time has come to transform Afghanistan from the centre stage of proxy wars  interference and confrontation into a hub for international cooperation and development.  Pakistan believes that the restoration of societal equilibrium in Afghanistan is an Afghan responsibility and cannot be imposed externally. We support all efforts for national reconciliation that are Afghan-owned and Afghan-led. We congratulate the Government of Afghanistan on holding successful parliamentary elections. They will strengthen President Karzai’s initiation of national reconciliation and reintegration.  Disarmament and non-proliferation are important pillars of the international peace and security architecture. We remain committed to both objectives and believe that they should be pursued in an equitable and non discriminatory manner. The asymmetric build-up of conventional weapons and the espousal of aggressive doctrines have a negative impact on regional security.  The pursuit of discriminatory policies and disregard for the security interests of States seriously erode globally the moral authority that must underlie equitable approaches to promoting the goals of nuclear disarmament and non proliferation. We have consistently pursued a policy of conventional and nuclear restraint  along with conflict resolution in South Asia. We reaffirm our proposal for a strategic restraint regime as an important way to promote the cause of peace  stability and security in our region.  Pakistan  with the fifth largest population in the world and only 0.4 per cent of the world’s total greenhouse-gas emissions  is one hundred and thirty-fifth on the global list of greenhouse-gas emitters. Despite such a low contribution  climate change is causing irrevocable damage to Pakistan  with tremendous social  environmental and economic impacts. While the world continues to discuss climate change and its scientific basis and to seek a fair and equitable outcome of the ongoing negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  climate change has already become a reality for 170 million Pakistanis.  The present situation in Pakistan reconfirms our extreme vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change. It also complicates the post-flood reconstruction and rehabilitation scenario in Pakistan. It is in Pakistan’s interests to work vigorously and creatively for an early and successful conclusion to the ongoing climate-change negotiations under UNFCCC auspices. Any lasting solution will have to respect the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the respective capabilities of countries.  With an active and empowered Parliament  a vigilant and well-informed civil society  free media and an independent judiciary  Pakistan’s democratic Government is putting in place mechanisms to ensure good and accountable governance at all levels in the country. The democratic Government  inspired by the vision of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto  attaches special attention to the promotion and protection of the human rights of all segments of society  particularly women  children and minorities. In May  Pakistan ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Pakistan is now a State party to all 27 human rights conventions.  We welcome the creation of the new composite gender entity  UN Women. We hope it will lead the efforts to promote rights  empowerment and equality for women throughout the world.    10-55264 26   Pursuing peace and forging close regional economic partnerships is an important pillar of our strategy to pursue economic growth and development in Pakistan. We are working through both the Economic Cooperation Organization and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation to further deepen regional collaboration and expand people-to-people contacts  including through inter-parliamentary cooperation.  Our strategy and actions at the national level stem from a firm belief that the primary responsibility and central action in our pursuit for economic growth and development is vested in our nation. Despite a challenging economic and security environment  we are pursuing an aggressive reform programme. That agenda focuses on pro poor growth  boosting rural economy and agriculture  affirmative action for women and minorities and expansion of social safety nets. We are conscious that that requires enhanced fiscal space  for which we have introduced economic and tax reforms in close collaboration with international development partners. We have to work together to make this world a safe and secure place for our children. We have to make strenuous endeavours to achieve the ideals of the United Nations Charter. We have to make this world a prosperous place free from hunger  want and poverty. We owe all this to our future generations. We cannot afford to fail in this endeavour."
"134",5500,"PAN",65,2010,"I congratulate you  Sir  on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We fully endorse your proposal to analyse the central role of the United Nations in global governance. The United Nations is the international forum in which to exchange ideas and adopt measures that strengthen the pillars upon which our governance stands.  Panama’s geography has allowed my country to serve as a bridge between and meeting point of the most diverse cultures and civilizations. Thanks to the discovery of our special privileged position in 1513 and the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914  today we connect Europe  the Americas and the East. That is how our story has been written. Five hundred years later  we are still working for the benefit of the world’s maritime commerce.  Our ethnic diversity is a symbol and example of our national unity. Panama is committed to promoting economic growth and social justice. We make possible the peaceful coexistence of all ethnicities and creeds. We Panamanians love peace  and we manage our canal with scrupulous careful neutrality. Our foreign policy is defined by respect  the defence and promotion of democracy  human rights  and international peace and international security  all within the framework of the doctrine of human security.  Panama has played an active role in favour of the international community at important United Nations forums. Among these are the Security Council  the Commission on Human Rights  the Human Rights Committee  and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. Our pacifism does not   21 10-54833  imply passivity in the face of situations that affect international security and the governance of peoples. Change is in the air all over the globe. People demand even more of their public servants. Our political and diplomatic activities are founded on the principles of international cooperation and the strengthening of global multilateralism.  Trafficking in drugs  weapons  human organs and persons — associated with illegal migration — as well as money-laundering  banditryism and terrorism are the work of criminal organizations that seek to destabilize our democracies. The trafficking and illegal possession of weapons have a devastating effect on human security and governance in our countries.  For Panama and the Central American region  drugs are our weapons of mass destruction and are a vital issue. Drug traffickers filter through our land and sea borders  polluting our young people with their poison. Additionally  our region is being used by networks of human traffickers that steer mixed migratory flows of persons from other continents through our borders.  In the face of these challenges  my country and the other members of the Central American Integration System have decided to create a regional security coordination centre. These regional efforts to fight transnational organized crime  based in my country  are already yielding encouraging results.  We understand that it is vital to work jointly to improve the functioning of international institutions  for the benefit of humanity. In this regard  I find it a very positive sign for the region that President Porfirio Lobo of Honduras is participating fully in this Assembly. In order to count on a world that is more stable and secure  we must set aside our differences. Stability requires us to work together to strengthen human security  both regionally and globally.  Globalization has entered a period of convergence among the diverse various economies; this  will continue for some years. While the previous stage of globalization lasted some 60 years  we believe that the one that began in 1990 will conclude its readjustments by mid-century. It is also necessary to note that as a result of this process of convergence  we have suffered during the past two years the effects of a significant crisis.  This global crisis demands newer and better forms of government for our societies. This global crisis demands the expansion of our markets and better management of our intergovernmental relations. In this context  we appreciate the efforts towards developing the exchange of goods  workers  tourists and investments across the China Straits  which offer a new thrust to achieving the full potential of our trade relations with that region.  For its part  Panama is also expanding its trade relations through the negotiation of free trade agreements with Peru and Colombia. We are also actively pursuing free trade agreements negotiated with Canada  and the United States of America and an association agreement between Central America and the European Union. Accordingly  I wish to take this opportunity to ask for the support of all Governments involved  with a view toward their approval and ratification of all these treaties.  We are on the threshold of an era of economic growth and opportunity in Latin America. Thus  we renew our commitment to a more just and inclusive free trade that offers economic opportunities and prosperity to all our peoples. With change and reform sweeping the region  we have more than enough reasons to promote a new age of cooperation and working together. Together  we can seize this opportunity and successfully face our common challenges.  Panama enjoys very healthy and strong relations with its main partner  the United States of America — a partner that is committed to our region’s success. Such an engaged partner is crucial for the region’s success. On both trade and security issues  the United States is and always has been an ally and a willing friend.  Additionally  we understand that for the comprehensive development of trade relations and the strengthening of our economies  more measures are required to ensure effective tax collection. To this end  Panama has signed agreements to avoid double taxation and prevent tax evasion. This is part of a national strategy that seeks to strengthen transparency and the competitiveness of our country’s international services. We have already signed agreements with Mexico  Barbados and Portugal  and a while ago with the State of Qatar. We have also concluded negotiations with Italy  Belgium  the Netherlands  Spain  France  Luxembourg  the Republic of Korea and Singapore.    10-54833 22   We want to offer the Panamanian experience as an example to the world. It is an economic story of reform at home along with strong international trade and business relations across the region; these have had excellent results and have proved fruitful.  The Government of Panama welcomes the adoption of resolution 65/1  entitled “Keeping the promise: — united to achieve the Millennium Development Goals”  and  at the same time  we reaffirm our commitment to that document.  In a little less than a year in Government  we have developed structural reforms and programmes to meet the needs of our people  focusing particularly on society’s most vulnerable groups. Among these programmes  allow me to highlight one that consists of grants to elderly people who lack retirement funds or pensions. Additionally  we have established a system of universal scholarships to support our young people with a monthly stipend from the first to the twelfth grades. Whether the student attends a public school or a private school with modest tuition fees  the State is reducing the dropout rate and strengthening relationships among teachers  parents and students.  Moreover  in December 2009  we decreed the highest largest minimum wage increase in the past 50 years. We are thus helping workers in the private and public sectors who were earning very low wages. Additionally  we established a solidarity fund to assist Panamanians of limited means in buying their first home.  Panama will invest more than $13 billion in public infrastructure over the next five years. This effort will include the building of hospitals  the development of roads  the expansion of Tocumen International Airport  the building of other airports  and the establishment of the MetroBus  as well as the construction of a modern subway system in Panama City. That first subway line will raise the quality of life for Panamanian families  who will thus have more time to share and strengthen family values.  These projects  together with the expansion of the Canal and the responsible and sustainable exploitation of our natural resources  will cost more than $20 billion in the coming years and will generate thousands of jobs that the country so sorely needs. All of these public works projects will be developed with the highest environmental standards and will contribute to a more dynamic economy for Panama and the region as a whole.  The theme chosen for this debate could not be more appropriate; we concur that the United Nations has a calling to play a central role in global governance. To that end  we need to deepen the process of reforms begun within the Organization. Panama is committed to making its contribution to this process  placing its geographical position and its logistics infrastructure at the service of the Organization.  In this regard  my Government has two key projects  namely  the establishment of a United Nations inter-agency centre for Latin America and the Caribbean and the creation of a regional logistics centre for humanitarian assistance  both to be located in Panama. The first will promote more coherence and synergy between all regional offices  with greater efficiency in the use of resources. The second will improve the regional capacity to respond to natural disasters and humanitarian crises  and will be the site of warehouses for the United Nations  and the Red Cross and Red Crescent.  We reaffirm our conviction that the United Nations is the international forum for the exchange of ideas and for adopting measures that strengthen the pillars upon which world governance rests. The United Nations is also a forum of goodwill where nations can work together on shared goals. In our region that means jobs  opportunity and security for our peoples. It also means modernizing economies  reforming the Government  and ensuring social well-being.  Panama is a good example of this success. Today  my country reaffirms its belief in and solidarity with the United Nations system. I say this unambiguously and with great certainty. We are fully prepared and willing to offer all the peoples of the planet the best possible service and utility and  as a product of that  to develop our citizens. That is Panama’s mission  and we will accomplish it."
"135",5547,"PER",65,2010,"This is the second time in 25 years that I have come to this podium as head of State of Peru to address the representatives of all the countries of the world.   First of all  I would like to begin by congratulating the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. Peru will constructively support his actions because we are sure that his experience will help us to achieve the results we hope for.  The first decade of this century has already been marked by the bloody attack of 11 September 2001 and again by the greatest economic crisis of the last 80 years. That shows that we face enormous challenges that know no borders and require a joint  united response from the entire international community. Hence  in this most important forum on our globe  Peru reaffirms its resolve to cooperate with the United Nations and other States to tackle the challenges of climate change  terrorism  extreme poverty  the economic crisis  drug trafficking  weaponization and xenophobia  which is rearing its head again.   For Latin America  the first decade of the twenty-first century has also meant confronting a choice between two different models of social and economic development.   The first is social democracy exercised through institutions. This is a democracy that recognizes market policy and that attracts global investment with clear rules  but which also has public policies for   35 10-54827  productive infrastructure. This is a democracy that does not just wait for a trickle-down effect to reach the poorest  but neither does it resort to the facile approach of subsidizing everything or raising wages in the public sector. This is a democracy that is open to the world and that acknowledges the immense power of cybernetics and communications and that  therefore  embraces a global market policy and aims to reach outward in the world through fairly negotiated free-trade treaties that preserve the rights of workers and the environment. But this is also a democracy of education  teaching people that the path to development is one of effort and of individual and collective merit.  In the face of that model of social democracy  another path was proposed in America at dawn of the twenty-first century. That was a model of State ownership  advocated by countries with great natural resources  who trust their development to administer their resources and reject global investment. That model aims to control the political direction of the economy and rejects global reality. It suggests growing the domestic market  administering international trade by State authority  using subsidies and wages in the public sector instead of promoting productive infrastructure and assuring the peoples’ future. Moreover  instead of affirming democratic institutions  this alternative path affirms the politic will and personal agenda of leaders  which always culminate in an aggressive downward spiral  destroying freedom of the press and expression and taking people down the path of weaponization.   That second path does not seem to us a responsible one  because it avoids reality and offers no sustainable solution to social problems  nor does it create jobs that people need  because poverty cannot be diminished and true employment created without modern technology and integration into the global economy. Therefore Peru opts for a realistic and global approach.   After four years  I am proud to share the progress and successes that we have achieved in our social agenda and in the Millennium Development Goals that the United Nations has put forward. I can say that Peru is today a more stable  independent and egalitarian country than it was years ago; and all this means that we are better able to contribute to the defence of world freedom and democracy and to play a stronger role in fostering regional and international peace and stability.  Peru has been one of the proving grounds for realistic  global development  for modern  democratic development that follows a global markets policy for sustained development while pursuing social policies that ensure increasing stability and equity for our citizens. In the past five years we have achieved annual growth of 6.5 per cent  and even in the year of the great crisis we maintained employment growth and poverty reduction. All the forecasts for this year indicate economic growth of 8 per cent  which will enable us to reduce further the poverty that still exists in our country.  We have given priority to public spending on infrastructure projects in the areas of health  education  water and sanitation  electrification of thousands of towns and roads  in accordance with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) established by the Assembly.  As a middle-income country  over the past four years Peru has achieved an annual rate of public investment of 6 per cent of output  double previous rates  and has invested $24 billion in more than 130 000 specific projects aimed at raising the living standards of our poorest populations and improve their participation in the economy. However  besides public efforts  and thanks to the stability of our economy and to the rules we follow  the private sector has invested and reinvested $72 billion over four years  creating 2.1 million new jobs. All international projections indicate that we will continue to grow at an annual rate of 6 per cent for the next six years  since we are already assured of $38 billion in investments to be made  in addition to investments in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors.  Peru has succeeded in reducing its poverty rate from 48 to 34 per cent of the population  and we shall reach our goal of lowering it to 30 per cent next year. We feel sure that when Peru celebrates the bicentenary of its independence  in 2021  the rate will have fallen to 10 per cent.  As I remarked yesterday at the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (see )  Peru has achieved many of the MDGs ahead of schedule and will continue to work to meet all the goals of poverty reduction  improved nutrition  literacy  health and education  among others  which are the true objectives that every good Government must aim for. Suffice it to say that our    10-54827 36  infant mortality rate has already been cut to half of what it was at the beginning of the MDG period  and by a third compared with five years ago.  All this has been achieved thanks to a stable economic policy and an increase in basic services and employment. Moreover  our currency reserves have tripled in the last five years and now stand at $42 billion. Peru’s financial system is one of the most sound in the world  without debt or credit exposure that might put it at risk. But the most important thing is that the political discourse of politicians that constitutes an essential element in driving and guiding our countries has consistently advocated democracy and investment  and has been fully in line with a broad path of expanded trade and global investment. I believe that it is this alignment that has granted us the results that we can illustrate today.  As opposed to this  some countries in the Americas which chose the second route — that of State ownership  political management of the economy  inward-looking growth and State administration of trade or confrontation rather than productive cooperation with other countries of the world — cannot show similar results. Thus  we can now say that Peru has laboured on the progressive path of history in moving towards the purposes of the United Nations. Moreover  the crisis has shown us that the free market does not mean an absent State  and that we who govern must not wait for wealth to expand without knowing when and how to steer it in order to benefit those who need it most.  Besides doubling our exports over four years and tripling our reserves  we have also signed trade agreements with most of the world’s countries — the United States  China  the European Union  Canada  Korea and many others — providing us with the necessary base to maintain and drive growth and improve our competitiveness  thus providing jobs for the people. In this way Peru will be greater and will be able to better contribute to international cooperation — and cooperation  along with maintaining peace  is the great purpose of our Organization.  We are aware  however  that we live in a multipolar and interdependent system  and that none of Peru’s achievements will be sustainable in the long term unless we unite our efforts to combat common threats. Peace  security and cooperation are inseparable parts of globalization  and we must promote them through coordinated strategies.  Twenty-five years ago I spoke from this rostrum for the first time  and I see that  20 years after the end of the cold war  we have still not built the stability that is a new multilateralism  based on the power of international law. We are still in a situation of uncertainty  where instability encroaches on peace and new threats arise  testing the agility  creativity and political determination of this Organization and the countries it comprises.  Peru believes that in this globalized world  security is the result of the interaction of internal and external factors. We are thus deeply concerned about the proliferation of nuclear arms  which must be halted at all costs. There is also  however  the issue of conventional weapons  since in practice it is they that produce the death and destruction suffered in many parts of the world. Moreover  arms and the arms trade limit social development  foster poverty and inequality and feed the threat of instability. Peru has therefore proposed to all countries of South America  the adoption of a protocol on peace  security and cooperation to bring about permanent peace and reduced arms expenditures.  In our view — and this has been said a thousand times here — it is not possible that  since the establishment of the integrated  reliable Union of South American Nations  its 10 member countries have invested $25 billion in new weapons and spent another $150 billion on maintaining military operating expenditures. This is shameful  because with that sum  more than 50 million people in South America could have ceased to live in poverty. Over the next five years  if we do not halt this absurd arms race  we will have spent another $35 billion on new weapons and $200 billion on regular military expenditure  thus fueling an irrational race which will always find justification to continue.  But the absurdity we see in South America is even more serious on the global scale. It is not possible for our countries to continue to allocate so much money to the buying of weapons when there are so many poor people in the world. It is as though the cold war had not ended and was continuing to the benefit of arms traders.  We say once again  as we did in the Union of South American Nations and the Organization of   37 10-54827  American States  and as we say in all international forums in which we participate  let us allocate less to the buying of weapons and more to combating poverty. Let us raise the flag of the martyr of pacifism Jean Jaurès or our great friend  the Olof Palme of Sweden.   Let us demand that multilateral financial institutions include anti-armament clauses in their contracts and conditions  just as they do environmental provisions. Why should they lend belonging to all the citizens of the world to countries that use them in a race to death? It is a serious matter to produce and consume harmful drugs  but it is also a serious matter for the richest countries of the world to produce weapons for poor countries to buy  curbing their development and road towards justice. We appeal to the leaders of the world: stop buying and producing arms; feed the disadvantaged; develop land; and create employment.  Real strength  real leadership of nations and peoples is found in intelligence and the ability to help the least developed  not in the capacity for arms production or its nuclear power. We know it is difficult to make this appeal over and over again  but we shall keep doing it because one day clarity and acceptance of these ideas will prevail among world opinion and among the world’s peoples.  For all those reasons  we call for this world forum to act. It is important for us also to think of regional integration  because we are not a cluster of asteroids. But we believe in a modern  different integration. In this world of computers  satellite communication  trade without borders and human rights without national restrictions  this new integration does not mean just joining those who are already geographically joined  but also using the tools of technology to ensure that the furthest off are also integrated. This is the new space of freedom that science and technology are creating for human beings and nations.  We must get beyond the primitive idea that there is not enough to go around and realize that when the wealth of information is distributed  those who distribute it are no poorer for having done so. Rather  they have lost nothing by sharing with others. Similarly  integration is a form of wealth which sooner or later will reach all united peoples.  Here  I can provide a fine example of the path followed by Ecuador and Peru after two centuries of confrontation  hatred and war. Thanks to the determination and political will of the Government of Ecuador headed by President Rafeal Correa  and its agreement with the Peruvian Government  we have taken a quantum leap forward in fraternity  integration and development.  Barely 15 years ago  we were divided by war  but now we have a permanent joint binational Cabinet thanks to which we have built bridges and thousands of kilometres of roads  improved our agricultural systems and integrated our social security systems for workers in our two countries. We have binational consulates and embassies  representing both our countries in many parts of the world. Ours is an example we would like to show to the United Nations as proof of our genuine and active devotion to integration; we believe in integration and in fraternity among peoples.  The need for greater integration was tested when the worst international crisis of the past 80 years broke out. This financial crisis  which began in developing countries  has had consequences that we still cannot predict. Our understanding of this crisis is the following: the beginning of globalization and the increase in world trade were possible only with the new information and communications technologies which  at the infrastructure level  have developed new forms of production and policy.  Information is now the fundamental fuel driving the economy and political change. It is gradually displacing fossil fuels as the essential form of energy. So we see the structure of world trade becoming increasingly dematerialized  but information and communication  by means of e-money and computers  are able to work at such speeds that they have outstripped the human capacity of our banks  our financial wizards and existing institutions to manage the new economy.  This is the dawn of a new  much swifter  digitalized economy in crisis. But if this speed brings crisis and chaos  the same speed of technology will also bring solutions to problems engendered by the crisis. We must trust in human beings and their creative abilities. Never in human history have we had so many means of payment and so much capacity to consume; never have we had so much technological creation and transformation; never have we had such an interactive digital market that allows people  even the poorest  from their homes to instantly stimulate production in other parts of the world.    10-54827 38   This enables us to look with human optimism to the future of the world and to believe that after a slight rise in inflation in 2012  which will come about because of the expansion of the means of payment to overcome the crisis  world trade will accelerate and help us emerge from the present circumstances.  However  we must be prepared for this greater speed brought about by digitalization and by creativity. We must strengthen our peoples’ and communities’ ability to integrate  strengthen exchanges among our countries through transportation  communications and electronic interconnection  strengthen education and eradicate weaponization.  Our message is one of optimism about the world situation. Despite ourselves  we are building a better world  without borders  without tyranny  with more freedom. We must act  employing policies which are successful against the crisis. We must employ democracy  sound institutions and realism  using capital and international technology and mobilizing investment in small and micro businesses.  Of course  our response to the crisis must always be a collective one. The Group of 20 (G-20) is now the prime forum of international financial cooperation and coordination  and we must support its role to support its role in reforming the system. We need a greater regulation given the growing speed with which financial and economic instruments can be manipulated. Peru commends the efforts that have been made  but proposes that the work of the G-20 gain in legitimacy by establishing fluid lines of communication with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  and by involving other countries in this work.  But just as in the financial crisis  all nations must coordinate our efforts to properly confront terrorism  drugs  the illicit arms trade  money laundering  trafficking of persons  xenophobia and climate change.   With respect to this last theme  I must note that Peru is vulnerable to the environment and is at very serious risk due to climate change. But at the same time  my country is strategically placed to mitigate and adapt to the effects of global climate change because it ranks fourth in terms of the quantities of tropical forests.   We want to change our discourse. We have not come with hand extended to demand cooperation from the rich of the world but to demand that they fulfil their commitments in their own countries. We have come to say that we will do the same in our own countries.   In Peru  our forest sequesters 21 billion tons of carbon per year. We have 84 biospheres and are one of 17 megadiverse countries on the planet.   I offer — if necessary  with hand extended to the insensitive world of the rich countries — our budgetary and humane commitment to protect  unscathed  Peru’s 54 million hectares of forest  thus controlling climate change at the global level. As a tropical glacier country in danger  we appeal to the world to implement specific goals for cooperation and technology transfer and to provide resources to develop programmes to combat the effects of climate change.   We want an agreement that is comprehensive  binding  fast and effective  and I reiterate to the Assembly my country’s desire to strengthen joint action through development of a clean and sustainable growth economy with low carbon emissions. With that intention we will voluntarily reduce to zero the deforestation of the primordial natural forests and will alter our present energy matrix so that by 2021 renewable non-conventional energy  hydropower and biofuels will account for at least 40 per cent of the energy consumed in the country. And we will make annual reports to the Assembly.  However  we must not forget that much of the pollution is still produced by poverty. Hundreds of millions of households in the world continue to use wood-burning stoves  thus driving deforestation and at the same time polluting the environment and causing serious bronchiopulmonary and nutritional problems among children. We propose to reduce the number of wood-burning stoves in Peru by 20 per cent by 2021 and to replace them with better stoves  and we want that issue to become part of the Millennium Goals.  A final point is something of particular interest to Peru — the situation of migrants. The globalization of capital  services and products cannot be accepted without also accepting the free movement of people or facilitating their mobility. Peru actively promotes the defense of the human rights of migrants and their families  because it is a country built by European migrants  as is the United States and many other rich countries today — which they forget when they expel today’s migrants and deport them by plane.    39 10-54827   Peru believes that migration is a development tool that has enriched and continues to enrich universal culture and the social life of countries. That is why we condemn any type of regulation  whether in Arizona or elsewhere  or any kind of xenophobic or discriminatory expressions. It is a paradox that the countries governed by the children of migrants are today those that most vigorously deport migrants  unwittingly creating a new form of domestic violence that could have very serious consequences in the short term.  We reiterate that the best way to avoid unregulated migration is by means of unhampered free trade and investment from the most developed countries that helps to generate employment and improve the quality of life of people in the developing countries.   Peru has an ongoing commitment with the United Nations  a commitment with humankind without races  colours or distinctions. We would like  as we proposed a few years ago  to strengthen the entire system in order to consolidate ourselves as a modern  strong and free organization  free of the contradictions or delays of the past  one that can ensure peace with less bureaucracy and with greater resolve and stronger political fortitude.   Let there be peace and well-being for all peoples of the Earth; let there be bread with freedom for all human beings. "
"136",5594,"PHL",65,2010,"Allow me to convey the greetings of the Filipino people to the President of the General Assembly and the representatives gathered here for the sixty-fifth session of the Assembly.  The United Nations was founded on the belief that in collective action lies collective security. It is when nations reach across their borders that the immense problems of our age begin to be manageable. In a world that has become increasingly globalized  the challenges that we face have become globalized as well. Climate change; pandemics; terrorism and weapons of mass destruction; transnational organized crime such as human trafficking and the illicit drug trade; the continuing vulnerability of migrants  women  persons with disabilities and the poor; and the challenges posed by increasingly interconnected economies — all call for a further strengthening of international cooperation.  All of us here  representing our respective nations  are stewards entrusted with the well-being of our respective peoples. We are also required to be responsible and responsive members of the community of nations. Clearly  we are already aware that the problem of one poses a problem for all. Any solution  then  depends on us recognizing that each one of our nations exists  not in a vacuum  but rather in an increasingly interdependent global milieu.  The central revelation here is that for humanity to progress  all nations must progress as one. The quest for universal human dignity should not be defined by geographical  racial or cultural boundaries  nor should it be set back by our desires to move our own nations forward. Global progress means equitable progress. The industrialized nations of the world can look with pride on the living standards their peoples enjoy. But  as one of my distinguished predecessors once said: “Those who have less in life should have more in law”.   This basic principle of social justice is also the most basic humanitarian challenge of our times. The wealth of nations must become an instrument to move the world further along the straight and righteous path of compassion and communal responsibility. The message is clear: there are those who need help  and acting with compassion towards those who need help is a response that is both humane and necessary. This idea has been trumpeted for decades  and yet combating inequality remains one of the greatest challenges of our times. The chasm between the powerful and the powerless  the haves and the have-nots remains to be bridged. The past century has demonstrated  in terms so stark that it inspired the creation of this Organization  that when the mighty clash  those who have less end up trampled. This is true where conflict exists and true where markets exist; true in our nation and true in an international context.   The concept of vulnerability and inequality is all too clear in the global effort to address climate change. Those who stand to lose much  if not everything  from the effects of man-induced climatic conditions are those who did little to cause it. There is an enormous need to ensure  as a matter of justice  that countries  particularly those that are vulnerable  are assisted in their adaptation and disaster risk-reduction efforts and are provided the necessary resources to build climate-resilient communities. This should go hand in hand with ambitious commitments by major economies to significantly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.  Many of you may say that you have already given mightily of your resources. But surely we do not need flood and famine to remind us that there is so much more that must be given  because there are so many more who deserve the hope of a better life.  The most immediate focus of cooperation demanded of us today is to collectively ensure that the eight Millennium Development Goals will be achieved by all in the remaining five years. That is a daunting task  and we are all aware that national resolve has to be complemented by bilateral  regional and multilateral cooperation.  Rising to the challenges of our era requires  within each of our countries  a strengthened regulatory system. This does not mean a cumbersome  intrusive Government  but rather a Government that allows private enterprise to thrive  while ensuring that it remains cognizant of its social responsibilities and empowers it  in turn  to fulfil those responsibilities. Many Governments are tackling this challenge  including the Government of the Philippines. Our Administration pledges to channel any gains we reap   27 10-54965  from public-private partnerships into social services  like those in health  education and poverty alleviation.  Across boundaries  the battle against inequality requires a balanced approach from those in authority. We should be conscious of our responsibilities to our own people and of our duties to regions and the globe. Already we are witnessing a rethinking of traditional paradigms  a shifting of our focus towards ensuring that the global system does not leave anyone behind.  And while my nation continues to benefit from the compassion of those who are able to help  this does not mean that we or our friends in the developing world will be entirely dependent on the largesse of the developed world. We will not be passive players in our quest for development. My nation remains active in the Group of 77 and in other efforts aimed at enhancing South-South cooperation and articulating and promoting our collective economic interests.  This is what our people put us in power for. This is what the world expects of us as leaders — to be exemplars of what it is to be compassionate human beings and vanguards of hope for our common humanity. For is not this hope also the hope that unites us as human beings? It is the same hope that allows us to break down walls of mistrust  which may take the form of intolerance  fear or violence. It is the same hope that leads us to gather in this Hall as our predecessors did. It is the same hope that will give our generation of leaders the strength to elevate this global Assembly to a place where  collectively  the nations of the world are able to find ways to make a better life possible for all.  There have been many times in our history when my people have shown that  united  nothing is impossible. We call it “people power”. It is my earnest hope and in the greatest interests of humanity that we harness the energies of dialogue  solidarity and communal responsibility so that a global “people power” towards equitable progress may be achieved."
"137",5613,"PLW",65,2010,"Last September  I had the privilege of addressing this Assembly for the first time as Palau’s Head of State (see A/64/PV.7). It is an honour for me to do so once again this year.  Palau’s national story is one of achievement and success. Palau was the last country to emerge from United Nations trusteeship. The Constitution of our new country incorporated the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and is a testament to the efficacy of the United Nations. The United Nations also helped us form a strong partnership with the United States of America  our former Administering Authority. This partnership was renewed on 3 September when the United States and Palau entered into a new agreement that will assist Palau in its efforts to achieve economic self-sufficiency  and for this we express our profound gratitude to the United States of America.  Palau is also proud of our role in the international community  joining international conventions and meeting our international obligations. Our officers are helping to maintain peace in fragile States. We have deployed peacekeepers to Darfur  Timor-Leste and Solomon Islands.  For Palau  environmental sustainability is not a recent construct. Respect for the environment and its preservation is Palau’s most deeply ingrained tradition and is at the heart of our culture. Palauans have always known that caring for the long-term health of the environment is the foundation of our progress and survival.  With our traditions as our bedrock  I am pleased to say that Palau has virtually achieved our Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets  according to the United Nations-sanctioned report. Palau has succeeded in achieving universal literacy  gender equality  maternal health and access to education. We have eliminated poverty and hunger and reduced child mortality to a degree comparable to even the most advanced developed countries. We thank  among others  our closest friends and allies: first the United States  then Japan and the Republic of China on Taiwan for helping us reach this point.   We consider the MDGs to be a minimum  and we will continue to strive for higher goals  including the goal of combating the ever-increasing spread of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes  cancer  heart disease and obesity  which the Pacific Islands Health Officers Association has declared a regional epidemic in the Pacific.  We are a small country  but blessed in many ways. I reiterate that we have risen to achieve the MDGs by caring for our God-given resources. We have put in place a system domestically to conserve and preserve our terrestrial and marine biodiversity. We have also joined with our Pacific neighbours to address the health of our oceans together through the Pacific Oceanscape programme.   19 10-54959   Palau  and indeed the entire world  is connected by a web of life that is in peril. For too long  we have focused our attention primarily on commercial interests. We have abused nature and must change our thinking. We must reorient our priorities to put biodiversity and the welfare of our ecosystems first. In so doing  we can serve both our long-term commercial interests and protect the natural bounty that sustains us.  One issue that symbolizes the threat to our biodiversity succinctly is the fight to conserve our oceans. Last year  I declared the world’s first shark sanctuary from this podium. It was a good first step. I also advocated for an end to unsustainable  cruel and wasteful shark finning on the high seas at the resumed Review Conference on the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement. We cannot accept the loss of 73 million sharks a year for a pot of soup.  Palau is doing all it can  but this work cannot stop at the boundary of any one country. We are all connected. This is why I am proud that President Lobo Sosa of Honduras and I signed this week a joint declaration calling on all other nations to stop unsustainable shark fishing.  Moreover  according to scientific studies  such as that entitled “Patterns and ecosystem consequences of shark declines in the ocean”  the health of sharks is linked directly to the health of tuna. Palau and other countries rely on tuna as their principal fisheries resource  and the world community relies on it as an important food source. We must work together to ensure the continued viability of this important stock. This past year  I hosted a summit of the parties to the Nauru Agreement to take steps to ensure that tuna remains plentiful. Along with other leaders of countries parties to the Naura Agreement  we limited purse seine fishing  agreed to close the doughnut holes between our jurisdictions  and implemented a vessel day scheme. These are steps which we believe are vital to ensuring the continued viability of our stocks.  When Palau and other Pacific small island developing States (SIDs) joined together at the sixty-third session of the General Assembly to initiate resolution 63/281  “Climate change and its possible security implications”  we did so recognizing that not only is climate change a development issue  but has now risen to the level of a security issue. The successful adoption of resolution 63/281 by consensus was a landmark occasion for Pacific SIDs and a step forward for the international community. The accelerating conflict and dislocation caused by climate events warrant an urgent response from the Security Council. We repeat our call for Security Council action on this resolution.  After personally visiting the Pacific islands earlier this year  His Highness Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan  Foreign Minister of the United Arab Emirates  convened an historic summit between the Arab League and the Pacific SIDs. The summit was a success. Our two regions  which had never before engaged bilaterally  found a new understanding of shared goals  culture and traditions. Palau is grateful to the League of Arab States for being the first regional group to recognize the potential of the Pacific SIDs as a strong  viable and cohesive unit.  We are hopeful that this is the year when we will make substantive progress on Security Council reform. Our position on the issue has been stated clearly and continually in the negotiation room. If we as an organization are to maintain our relevance  we must reform the Council so that its membership reflects the ever-evolving membership of the General Assembly. Palau strongly supports expanding Security Council membership  particularly by adding Japan as a permanent member.  On the issue of security  Palau is hopeful that the return of Israelis and Palestinians this month to the negotiating table will bear fruit. The crucible of the world’s Abrahamic faiths should not be the land of so much turmoil. The resolution of this intractable problem is of the utmost importance so that the region and its reality may reflect its historic message of peace on Earth. Palau can only add its voice to the chorus of support for a just  comprehensive and regional solution in accordance with the Road Map  the Arab Peace Initiative and the relevant Security Council resolutions. We welcome the opportunity to actively support the process in the General Assembly this fall. Indeed  world peace hinges on peace in the Middle East.  Palau also supports the efforts of the international community on disarmament and the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Palau’s was the world’s first nuclear-free Constitution  and so the elimination of nuclear weapons is of special concern to us. Having experienced the horror and devastation of war  we and our neighbours long for the day when the entire world is free of nuclear weapons. We therefore    10-54959 20  welcome all efforts to add the Middle East to the list of nuclear-weapon-free zones.  The SARS pandemic shone a bright light on the gaps in our collective ability to prevent the spread of diseases internationally. With the participation of Taiwan  we can now help to fill those gaps. We congratulate the world community on making itself healthier by granting Taiwan observer status at the World Health Assembly. Given the importance of a universal approach to global problems  Palau advocates for Taiwan’s inclusion in the activities of the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The world needs its input to ensure civil aviation safety and security  and to effectively tackle climate change for the benefit of all.  When I began my address  I related the success story that was Palau’s emergence from trusteeship. As I wind down my remarks  I will speak candidly about our challenges. Today  Palau still feels the pain from the wounds inflicted during our colonial days. Damage was done to our islands. One  for example  was stripped of much of its resources  making it difficult for those who live there to sustain the livelihood they once enjoyed. This happened to our once phosphate-rich island of Angaur. We call on the international community for appropriate relief for this historic and lasting injury — a relief that will heal the gaping wounds on our island  ease our pain and bring justice to our people.  In addition  as a result of the fierce battles fought over our islands during the Second World War  explosives were rained down on our land. Some of those explosives still lie there  live  and pose an extreme danger to the lives and limbs of our people. We appeal to the conscience of the world  especially those responsible  to remove this danger from our midst.  As a developing nation  Palau is thankful for the grants provided to us by our allies  friends and partners. They have been invaluable. But our developing economy faces a crisis that grants alone cannot address. Without a strong local economy based on private enterprise and the free market  our young people will continue to leave our shores to pursue better employment abroad. We need more than just humanitarian grants; we need private investment to spur and sustain our economic development. I therefore invite investors and entrepreneurs from all over the world to come to Palau to invest and establish partnerships with our talented people  so that we can create a vibrant economy for now and for our future."
"138",5654,"PNG",65,2010,"First of all  let me join other delegations in offering congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election to the post of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. With your guidance  Sir  my delegation is confident that we can discuss  in the spirit of cooperation  the different global challenges confronting us in order to further the common good of humankind.  We are meeting at a time when the world is going through some mixed developments. While  on some parts of the globe  countries are experiencing relative peace  in other parts they are embroiled in armed conflict. While some countries are enjoying economic growth and budget surpluses  others are experiencing economic stagnation or contraction.  The focus at this session of the General Assembly on reviewing the progress on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is most appropriate. The achievement of the eight cross-cutting Goals we set for ourselves would improve the quality of life of all of our peoples. Just last week  we concluded a stocktaking of the progress in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. While the results on the scorecard are mixed  the commitment of Member States to continuing to implement measures to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 is unequivocal.  Papua New Guinea  like many developing countries  has had measured success. As many noted last week  the global economic crisis has had an adverse bearing on the implementation of the MDGs. I would add  however  that had the resources promised in 2000 for implementing the MDGs been made available  the assessment sheet for many developing countries would have looked more positive. Papua New Guinea applauds the commitment of $40 billion for poverty alleviation  especially to improve the health of children and women. It is our hope that this will be a new resource envelope and not repackaged old commitments.  We have noted the calls for countries to take greater ownership of the implementation of the eight Millennium Development Goals. Papua New Guinea has accepted these challenges. We will continue to do    10-55128 2  all we can to meet the obligations we assumed when we joined others in 2000 to adopt the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2).   The Permanent Representative of Papua New Guinea to the United Nations outlined in detail last week our country’s efforts to achieve the MDGs by 2015. Allow me to reiterate some of the main actions we are taking. Papua New Guinea has adapted and localized the MDGs by establishing 15 targets and 67 indicators within our medium-term development strategy for the period 2005 to 2010. We have calibrated our 2011-2015 medium-term development plan and designed our development strategic plan to achieve the MDGs. In addition  we have drafted our 2050 Vision Statement to be consistent with the Millennium Development Goals.  Our official development assistance programmes with our donor partners are being gradually realigned to enable Papua New Guinea to eventually meet its MDG targets. On a wider scale  we urge donor partners to abide by the principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action. In the Pacific  we have adopted the Cairns Compact to better coordinate development assistance and to ensure effective delivery. Developed countries also need to raise their official development assistance to 0.7 per cent of their gross national income  in line with their commitments.  In line with our commitment towards MDG 3  my Government has submitted proposed legislation to the Papua New Guinea legislature to reserve 22 seats for women in the national Parliament. With respect to MDG 2  we have introduced a universal primary education policy and aim to achieve free primary-level education for all of our children by 2015.  Papua New Guinea is under no illusion that the achievement of the MDGs is a unilateral undertaking. This is a joint undertaking between developed and developing countries  just as it is a cooperative effort between the Government and civil society organizations. It is for this reason that my country is disappointed that MDG 8 on a global partnership for development appears to attract little serious interest from the developed countries. We note that the real value of aid has remained constant and that the Doha Development Round remains an unfinished affair.  Also of concern to us is the inability of many developing countries to enjoy equitable treatment from the Bretton Woods institutions. Our efforts to reduce deforestation in tropical rain forest countries  which I will touch on later  have met with the same apathetic response. Despite the best of efforts within the World Trade Organization and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum processes  the international trading environment continues to be characterized by inequalities. Often less visibly but still harmfully  global trade continues to be encumbered by trade protectionist measures.  In the area of international peace and security  the world  unfortunately  is no safer today than it was when the United Nations was established. War continues to be waged in Afghanistan. Iraq continues to suffer from regular suicide bombings. The Korean peninsula continues to be a flashpoint in the Asia region  and the Middle East continues to be a hotbed of tension.  Likewise  regional conflicts and ethnic tensions continue to erupt in many parts of Africa  Latin America and Eastern Europe. The international community needs to do more to address these conflicts  especially the Afghanistan and Iraq issues. The fragile peace and global security environment is further exemplified by the continued presence of Blue Helmets in many parts of world.  Papua New Guinea commends the efforts of United Nations peacekeeping forces  many of which have to operate in very trying circumstances. We wish to thank the troop-contributing countries for bearing this onerous responsibility on all our behalves. For our part  I am pleased to announce that my Government has enacted the International Obligations Bill to provide the legal framework for Papua New Guinea’s participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations.  Acts of terrorism continue and the threat of another terror attack on a scale similar to that of 9/11 remains real. The international community must continue to strengthen its cooperation to address this scourge.  Nuclear weapons continue to cause anxiety in our security considerations. While some may argue that nuclear weapons are the reason why the world has not fought another world war  my Government believes that these weapons of mass destruction are unnecessary and need to be eliminated. As part of that process  we support efforts to strengthen the mechanisms aimed at the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.   3 10-55128   As for other countries of the Pacific region  climate change is of great concern to Papua New Guinea. We need no scientist to tell us of the negative impact of climate change. We live it and we suffer from it. Many of our islands  such as the Carterets  and coastal habitats like my own home area of the Murik Lakes are being gradually submerged by rising sea levels. The result is that people living in these areas are becoming environmental refugees. Lowland diseases such as malaria are now occurring in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. Unusual weather patterns  such as increased incidences of cyclones  frequent heavy flooding and mudslides  are causing havoc in our economies and exacting untold suffering on our people.  All these attendant climate change challenges are taxing the budgetary resources of our countries and undermining our development plans. The international community has rightly recognized the insidious effects of climate change and agreed to take concerted action under the ambit of the Kyoto Protocol  the Bali Road Map and the Copenhagen Accord to address the issue.  Papua New Guinea urges our developed partners to shoulder greater responsibility for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and for assisting developing countries  particularly small island States  to adapt to climate change and its effects.  Resources for adaptation and mitigation measures  particularly those committed in Copenhagen  must be made more readily available to developing countries. We note the initiative announced by Japan last week during the MDG review and look forward to further details of what it constitutes. We also applaud the financial commitments and policy initiatives that China announced to assist developing countries to implement the Millennium Development Goals. As for Papua New Guinea  with our colleagues from the Coalition for Rainforest Nations  we have committed ourselves to a programme of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation  more commonly known as REDD-plus. As this is the International Year of Biodiversity  let me say that the REDD-plus initiative will assure the protection of important biodiversity.  In addition  at the national level Papua New Guinea has adopted an action plan for climate-compatible development and established the Office of Climate Change and Development explicitly to oversee our actions on climate change issues. As part of our strategy to reduce our carbon footprint  we are now aggressively seeking to develop more hydropower and geothermal sources for our energy requirements. We have also embarked on a major commercialization exercise of our gas reserves to deliver a cleaner energy alternative to the world.  Many of us here have recognized the need to reform the United Nations in order to take account of the changed circumstances under which it operates  as well as the new and emerging challenges that it must address. We note and commend the Secretary-General for the ongoing administrative and institutional reforms he is undertaking to improve the efficiency of the United Nations in better serving Member States. We urge all stakeholders in the Security Council reform agenda to demonstrate courage and leadership so that the composition and workings of the Council can be reformed in ways that are equitable and reflect the current geopolitical and economic realities.  Papua New Guinea has previously stated at this Assembly that we believe that the expansion of the membership of the Security Council is logical to allow for representation from certain developed and developing countries. In that regard  I wish to reaffirm Papua New Guinea’s support for Germany and Japan to be included as permanent members in an expanded Security Council.  Finally  the inequities that exist in the global trading system today are daunting  but they can be resolved. With genuine partnership  we can and shall overcome them. The world may not be any safer today than it was when the United Nations was established some 65 years ago  but having been able to avert another world war is ample testimony that the international community has the political will to address tensions and discord in a measured way. The United Nations and the international legal architecture that it has achieved  developed and promoted have played a significant role in that regard  thus underscoring the continuing relevance of this body.

"139",5700,"POL",65,2010,"I wish you success during your presidency  Sir.  This year began with a tragic earthquake in Haiti that took the lives of more than 200 000 people  including United Nations staff and peacekeepers. Unfortunately  several months later  Pakistan was affected by floods with catastrophic effects. I would like to pay tribute to those women and men who lost their lives while working for the United Nations. I would also like to salute those who provided assistance to the victims. Those dramatic and very painful events highlighted the essential role that the United Nations is capable of playing in our lives and the extraordinary performance of an Organization that many seem to take for granted.  The universal character of the United Nations enables Member States to carry out activities and achieve agreed goals  regardless of their form of Government or culture. One cannot underestimate the contribution of the United Nations to peacekeeping and peacebuilding  its role in the promotion of the rule of law and human rights  or its contribution to the codification of international law.  Poland has always been a firm and reliable supporter of the United Nations. Effective multilateralism is an objective reflected in the policies of my Government and a guiding principle of the European Union (EU). We note both the heightened expectations and the criticism with respect to the United Nations and other international organizations. We are therefore raising the issue of reform  as we want the United Nations to be more efficient and better adapted to the new global environment. If it fails to meet the hopes and expectations of its Members  it will suffer marginalization  which might negatively affect multilateralism  as well as certainty and predictability in international relations.  Poland has been participating in the ongoing process of reflection on the accommodation of the United Nations to contemporary and foreseeable risks and challenges. In our opinion  the United Nations should improve its ability to cooperate with other institutions and organizations  particularly on a regional basis.  Poland supports efforts aimed at reforming the Security Council  an organ tasked with preserving peace and security. We need to take into account changes in the international system brought about after the end of the cold war and  at the same time  preserve the Council’s cohesion and the feasibility of its decision-making process. We favour an additional  non-permanent seat for the Eastern European group. We also find interesting and worth discussing the idea of EU representation. In general  we attach much   17 10-55408  importance to the role of the EU in the United Nations system. That is why we would encourage non-EU Member States to support our efforts to ensure a proper place for the EU  an observer in the General Assembly  in the form of a resolution.  We attach great importance to the enhancement of the credibility of United Nations action in the field of democracy and human rights. Let me remind the Assembly of the successful meeting of the Community of Democracies in Krakow in July 2010. Poland is convinced that promoting universal respect for human rights throughout the world contributes to security and to social and economic progress.  In this respect  we applaud the establishment of the new consolidated gender entity of the United Nations  UN Women. We also believe that the review and reform of the Human Rights Council  of which we are a member  will strengthen the effectiveness of that body.  Our planet is exposed to an increasing number of existential threats. Experience shows that no country can solve the world’s problems alone. A global response is therefore necessary to meeting global challenges. The United Nations has the capacity to justify and  in many instances  generate such a response. We expect excellence as a standard feature of the United Nations. In the final analysis  it is only with the consent and support of its Member States that the United Nations can deliver such excellence.  The latest world economic crisis demonstrated the need for globally coordinated economic and financial policies. These are currently being debated by the General Assembly’s Second Committee and by the specialized agencies and United Nations-related organizations  such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Poland expects the United Nations to be the key forum for multilateral debate on the issues pertaining to the crisis. We hope that the current crisis will not hinder United Nations Member States from achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  Various political  economic  social and environmental problems are making States increasingly open to deepened cooperation. The complicated nature of new challenges demands sophisticated expertise and the integration of efforts. The United Nations safeguards both. Poland deems the United Nations to be an appropriate body to address the global issues of security and economy.  Peace and security are a fundamental issue. Our goal is a world without nuclear weapons and other arms of mass destruction; a world without terrorism; and a world capable of diffusing the threats of war and conflict. The United Nations should strengthen its involvement in meeting these objectives  anticipate and prevent conflicts  where possible  and develop the capacity to resolve them effectively once they break out.  The engagement of the United Nations in peacekeeping operations continues to produce visible and desirable effects  especially in its political and humanitarian dimensions. The experience we have gained from the increased engagement of recent years allows us to better understand its complexity and limitations and the challenges ahead. We believe that peacekeeping reform must continue. We support efforts that will bring new quality to peacekeeping  and in this regard we are committed to working towards achieving a wider consensus on its strategic aspects through a renewed partnership among all stakeholders.  This year will  we hope  be associated with major progress in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation. The success of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) proved that a consensus is possible in this specific area of international cooperation. Efficient and practical implementation of the outcome of the NPT Review Conference remains a crucial task. We are convinced that the initiative launched recently by Australia and Japan  which involves the participation of Poland and 10 other countries  will contribute to this goal.  We perceive the NPT Review Conference  the New START treaty and the Nuclear Security Summit as significant steps forward  but regard the implementation of their decisions as a challenge.  Among issues related to nuclear disarmament  there is one that clearly stands out: the status of  sub-strategic nuclear weapons  the reduction and elimination of which have not yet been covered by any legally binding international instrument. A world without nuclear weapons cannot be achieved if this challenge is not dealt with.    10-55408 18   The Conference on Disarmament requires our special attention. We applaud the efforts of the Secretary-General  who convened a few days ago a special summit devoted to disarmament. Poland attaches considerable importance to that body and calls on all States to redouble their efforts to invigorate the Conference as a platform for multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation negotiations.  The impact of the economic and financial crises continues to affect most countries. The scarcity of high-quality jobs has become an issue of primary importance. Efforts are necessary to mobilize resources and provide opportunities for the benefit of the most vulnerable segments of society. Satisfying basic needs is once again at the forefront of global concerns.  The energy sector has become an area of major attention. Costs  security of supplies and reducing pollution are some of the sensitive issues. We face the challenge of making clean energy not only a social preference but also a market choice.   We need a shift in our thinking about the North-South dichotomy in order to allow the international community to move effectively forward. Allowing ourselves to be defined by our differences is a recipe for disaster. It is therefore important to focus on common elements and on the diversity of conditions and situations of States and to move away from a claims mentality.  The pace of market globalization exceeds the capacity of many Governments to ensure global economic stability. The growing interdependence of national economies increases the risk of the transmission of destabilizing shocks between countries. Economic activities within the United Nations are today scattered among many institutions. This often leads to overlapping powers between them. The role of the United Nations might be to coordinate the objectives and ensure coherence between the activities of major international organizations  to provide the necessary political leadership and long-term strategic policy framework  and to promote stable and sustainable development.  The High-level Plenary Meeting on the MDGs that ended on 22 September reconfirmed the importance of development cooperation and restated the commitment of the international community to attaining the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. The Meeting recognized the crucial role of the United Nations and the United Nations system in the field of development cooperation and commended their continued engagement and efforts.  Poland reiterates its support for implementing the MDGs. They constitute a primary point of reference for our programme of foreign assistance. We are also bound by the provisions of the Paris Declaration and the principle of aid effectiveness expressed therein. We strongly support coordination among all development partners.  Our official development assistance is oriented to serve the pro-growth policies of our partners. The mobilization of domestic resources  foreign direct investment and good economic policy are the basic drivers of development. Development policies should therefore be implemented in accordance with the principles of sustainable development and good governance. We welcome the progress on the MDGs  which is largely a result of continued efforts by developing countries. With regard to development assistance  it is extremely important that the principles of national ownership and leadership  as well as of mutual accountability  be strengthened and fully respected. Poland is actively involved in promoting global development cooperation.   We are committed to United Nations activities in the field of poverty reduction and the promotion of sustainable development. We note with satisfaction the positive results of the One United Nations reform and the increased efficiency of assistance provided by the United Nations. We support the activities conducted by the agencies of the United Nations agencies  in both the development and the humanitarian fields.  Poland expects an ambitious  forward-looking and action-oriented outcome of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012. We look forward to attaining all the principal aims of the Conference  which should also bridge the trust gap between developed and developing countries evident in the climate change negotiations. Its outcome should be a focused political document  universal in nature  aimed at identifying concrete actions for all countries. It should be linked to the MDGs  taking into account the specific needs of developing countries. We call for a redoubling of the efforts to ensure that institutions involved in implementing the sustainable development agenda become more effective and efficient through   19 10-55408  improved synergies and the provision of adequate resources.  Poland  which played host to the fourteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the fourth meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol  will continue its efforts aimed at building international consensus on a comprehensive global post-2012 agreement. The role of the United Nations system is essential to maintaining an effective and efficient response to challenges posed by climate change.  In this regard  we would like to thank the Secretary-General for putting climate change at the top of the agenda of the United Nations system and for his numerous efforts to address the negative impact of such change. Climate change is a global challenge that can be addressed effectively only through a global effort within the UNFCCC framework.  Poland believes that the international community should continue to focus its attention on improved and enhanced implementation and monitoring of the three Rio Conventions  developing synergies among them  and on increasing the efficiency and coherence of the United Nations system. The consultative process inaugurated at the eleventh special session of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme on the reform of the international environmental governance system was an important contribution to the debate on environmental governance in the context of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. While being realistic and pragmatic  we should also be ambitious.  In conclusion  I wish to say a few words about solidarity. It is necessary to understand the relevance of international solidarity  working closely together  building new coalitions and bridging old divides to arrive at common objectives. Our common future is at stake. There is no guarantee of success  but surely we risk failure if we do not take action. New partnerships  building confidence in policy objectives  and positive engagement among partners are the necessary elements. "
"140",5726,"PRK",65,2010,"Mr. President  on behalf of the delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  I would like  first of all  to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. In the same vein  I believe that your able leadership will bring success to this session.  This year marks the sixty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. The founding of the United Nations laid down an international legal basis for preventing the recurrence of catastrophes  such as the two World Wars that inflicted immeasurable sufferings on humankind  for safeguarding world peace and security and for achieving socio-economic progress. The most important meaning of the founding of the United Nations is the establishment of the principle of sovereign equality in international relations  which has enabled all States on this planet  large and small  to join their efforts for peace and development.  The history of the United Nations  spanning 65 years  is the history of continued challenges to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. The logic and politics of power  which seek to negate sovereign equality  still remain in sight in international relations  even today after the turn of the century. International law and order are trampled on by the arbitrariness and high-handedness of individual Powers. Military invasions of sovereign States  arms build-ups and threats of use of force continue    10-55396 28  unchecked and  what is more  a series of pretexts are used to justify them.  Despicable trickery and attempts to overthrow other countries’ socio-political systems have become ever more rampant. The banner of human rights protection and the institutional mechanism of the United Nations General Assembly are abused to that end. To deny the right of other countries to choose their own systems constitutes in itself a violation of the human rights of their people. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is one of those victimized countries.  That reality requires a strengthening of the role of the United Nations  in conformity with the changed times and situation  which  in our view  is possible only after a more dynamic and appropriate reform of the United Nations. The composition and the rules of procedure of the Security Council should be restructured and revised in such a way that the representation and will of the entire United Nations membership are correctly reflected  in particular  by the full representation of the non-aligned countries and other developing countries. The representation of a new group of United Nations Member States that achieved independence after the founding of the United Nations should also be ensured.  The authority of the General Assembly should be enhanced decisively. The General Assembly  which is the most democratic organ in the United Nations  has less power than the undemocratic Security Council. That abnormal situation should no longer be allowed to continue. In addressing key issues such as peace and development  the broad and active participation of the developing countries and their interests should be duly promoted.  The Korean peninsula  like the Middle East  has long been a chronic hot spot seriously affecting world peace and security. The United Nations has included the Korean issue as a major item on its agenda for over 30 years. This led to the adoption of resolution  3390 (XXX) in 1975  calling for the dissolution of the United Nations Command in South Korea  the withdrawal of all foreign forces there and the replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement  as a measure to reduce tension and maintain lasting peace on the Korean peninsula.  Another 35 years have elapsed since then. The Korean peninsula is nevertheless still in a state of armistice  which means that there is neither war nor peace. While the aforesaid resolution is yet to be implemented  the sovereignty and the efforts of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea towards peaceful development are constantly threatened and undermined  as explosive situations leading to the brink of war are created periodically on the Korean peninsula. The most recent example is the farcical huge sabre-rattling arms build-up and threat of use of force waged on a massive scale by the United States and South Korean authorities on the Korean peninsula and its surroundings by taking advantage of the Cheonan incident.  The touch-and-go situation created some time ago in North-East Asia  including the Korean peninsula  proved once again without a doubt that the United States is not a defender  but a disruptor of peace. As long as the United States nuclear aircraft carriers sail around the seas of our country  our nuclear deterrent can never be abandoned  but should rather be strengthened further. That is the lesson we have drawn.  The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea regards it as its noble duty as a Member State to safeguard peace and security and promote socio-economic development and common prosperity in and around the Korean peninsula. Had it not been for the powerful war deterrent built by the Songun politics of the great leader of our people  General Kim Jong Il  the Korean peninsula would have already been turned into a battlefield scores of times  thus destroying regional peace and stability.  A peaceful environment is most urgently needed for the Government and people of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  as they are now concentrating all efforts on economic development in order to open the gate for a powerful and prosperous State in 2012  which marks the centennial anniversary of the birth of the great leader  President Kim Il Sung. This year  which falls on the sixtieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea again proposed respectfully to the parties to the Armistice Agreement to begin talks as early as possible with a view to replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement. If that proposal is realized  the General Assembly will see the implementation of its historic resolution adopted 35 years ago. The conclusion of a peace agreement will represent the most effective confidence-building measure for removing distrust among the parties to the Armistice and serve as a powerful driving force   29 10-55396  guaranteeing the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.  There is no change in the position of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in its opposition to nuclear war  the nuclear arms race and nuclear proliferation. The denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is the policy goal maintained consistently by the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea for peace and security in North-East Asia and the denuclearization of the world. The denuclearization of the Korean peninsula  referred to in the Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks issued on 19 September 2005  means the process of turning the whole Korean peninsula into a nuclear-weapon-free zone by completely eliminating the real external nuclear threats on the Korean peninsula in a verifiable manner. As already clarified  our nuclear weapons do not serve as a means to attack or threaten others  but as a self-defensive deterrent  for all intents and purposes  to counter aggression and attacks from outside.  As a responsible nuclear-weapon State  we are willing to join in the international efforts for nuclear non-proliferation and the safe management of nuclear material on an equal footing with other nuclear-weapon States. It is the long-cherished desire of the entire Korean nation to put an end to the history of disgraceful division forced upon it by foreign forces and to live peacefully on a reunified land.  In the new century  important progress towards reconciliation  common prosperity and reunification has been achieved in inter-Korean relations. The historic inter-Korean summit between the North and the South in 2000 and its resultant adoption of the joint declaration of 15 June  followed by another inter-Korean summit in 2007 and the publication of the declaration of 4 October  constitute a good programme for reunification  unprecedented in our national history. Those historic declarations were welcomed and warmly supported by the United Nations General Assembly.   Unfortunately  the present South Korean authorities reject this grand reunification programme and are driving inter-Korean relations towards a rupture by bringing forward the so-called “three-phase unification proposal”  which is anti-reunification and confrontational. They are stepping up an atmosphere of war against their fellow countrymen in collusion with foreign forces with a view to rationalizing their confrontational policy against the North. The  anti-reunification forces have no place on the Korean peninsula and  as such  the anti-peace forces should not be offered a place in the international community. In the future  the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will thoroughly implement the joint declaration of 15 June and the declaration of 4 October  and thus achieve the reconciliation and unity of the nation  which will surely open a new era of independent reunification  peace and prosperity.  The ideal of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s foreign policy is independence  peace and friendship. It accords with the ideas of the United Nations. In accordance with that ideal  the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will further strengthen and develop friendly and cooperative relations with all Member States and fully discharge its responsibilities for ensuring peace and security in the Korean peninsula and the rest of the world.  In conclusion  my delegation totally rejects the provocative statement delivered by the South Korean delegation on 25 September (see )  which referred to the Cheonan incident again and distorted the presidential statement of the Security Council of  9 July 2010 (S/PRST/2010/13 and S/PV.6355). The truth of the Cheonan incident is still under cover. The results of the unilateral investigation of South Korea  have raised one doubt after another since its release  following scientific military analysis and growing manifold criticism inside and outside South Korea. The South Korean authorities have persistently refused to accept our proposal to send a field inspection group for scientific and objective verification of the truth of the incident.  The Security Council  in its presidential statement dated 9 July 2010  took note of responses from other relevant parties  including the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  which has stated that it had nothing to do with the incident and encouraged the settlement of all outstanding issues by peaceful means to resume direct dialogue and negotiations. South Korea is advised not to create tension on the Korean peninsula by waging war exercises with outside forces and pursuing a confrontational approach in defiance of the concerns of the international community. It should immediately embark on North-South dialogue so as to find solutions to all outstanding issues  as recommended by the presidential statement of the Security Council."
"141",5771,"PRT",65,2010,"I wish to begin by congratulating you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly. The Assembly is the central body of the United Nations architecture. Here  all Member States are truly represented and each has a vote  irrespective of its size  population or economic power. Here is where the central decisions that determine the functioning of the other bodies are made. Here  we are all permanent members  embodying the principle of the sovereign equality of all States.  Here in the General Assembly  Portugal is guided by the objective of doing its best to strengthen the United Nations. There are no true alternatives to the Organization. Its unique role in managing international relations is more evident than ever  and it is our duty to further enhance this role in order to attain a progressive and solid strengthening of the United Nations. I repeat  there are no alternative mechanisms to the United Nations. For this reason  all Member States should work to reinvigorate the Organization.  Portugal is guided by the principles of national independence  respect for human rights  equality among States  peaceful solutions to conflicts and international cooperation as the main elements that drive development and the progress of humankind. These principles are all inscribed in the Portuguese Constitution.  These are also the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. Allow me to underline some of them  which today are more important than ever: maintaining international peace and security  the development and progress of all peoples  friendly relations among all nations based on sovereign equality  international cooperation in solving economic  cultural and humanitarian crises and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The maintenance of international peace and security  is surely one of the noblest of our objectives. The Charter defines the way we  the United Nations  should act together to prevent or remove threats to peace and how to respond to acts of aggression or other violations of our universal principles.  Portugal has been an active contributor to United Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations in Europe  Asia  Africa and Oceania. Our efforts have always been global and generous. Tens of thousands of Portuguese have participated in peace operations. We are now present in places as diverse as Afghanistan  South Lebanon  Timor-Leste  the Western Balkans  Chad and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  We participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations and other missions according to our means and  quite frequently  above and beyond what our size  would require. Nevertheless  we continue doing it with the firm conviction that collective security calls for collective efforts. Moreover  the United Nations can continue to count on the Portuguese contribution to this collective endeavour.  Looking at the present challenges to international peace and security  allow me to refer to the situation in the Middle East  a conflict involving many negative influences in the relations between several peoples and cultures. The coming year will be critical to the peace process. The choice is clear: peace or a return to instability.  We welcome the return to direct negotiations aimed at reaching a two-State solution. We all have to   25 10-55103  join efforts for the creation of an independent  democratic  contiguous and viable Palestinian State living side by side  in mutual peace and security  with the State of Israel.  I would also like to mention Afghanistan where the international community has assumed a firm commitment to support reconstruction and development. The results of the Kabul Conference will have to be complemented at the upcoming NATO summit in Lisbon  with a view to ensuring a sustainable transition process  mainly led by the Afghans themselves.  International peace and security require effective multilateral action among United Nations bodies. Effective multilateralism needs to be based on working structures with which every Member State feels comfortable. The United Nations is indispensable. It alone is capable of confronting global threats  it alone has the capacity to respond to acute natural disasters  as we have seen in several recent situations  like the Haitian earthquake or the Pakistan floods  and it alone can effectively shelter and feed millions of refugees worldwide  thanks to the outstanding work of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees  led by António Guterres  one of the most distinguished Portuguese political leaders.  It is especially urgent to reform the United Nations and to adapt it to today’s international realities. Any reform must be based on the objectives that inspired its creation. Its pivotal place at the centre of the international architecture has to be preserved  for the United Nations is the only forum where no one feels excluded  the only body where all States  including small and medium-sized countries  have their own voice and their own say in solving global problems.  The establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission — an idea put forward by Portugal — was a significant step in the reform process. But we also have to look at the Security Council with a view to its enlargement. I sincerely believe that we can all succeed in reshaping the Council and making it more representative  more efficient and more transparent.   Mr. Ould Hadrami (Mauritania)  Vice-President  took the Chair.   In our view  it is illogical that countries like Brazil or India  which have an irreplaceable role in today’s international economic and political life  are still not permanent members of the Security Council.  Africa  as well  has to be considered in this enlargement of the permanent membership. It is of the utmost importance that Africa be fairly treated  given the remarkable political and economic progress we all have witnessed on that vast continent — continent with which Portugal feels a permanent affinity. It is only natural that we have been so closely linked to the strengthening of relations between Africa and the Europe Union (EU)  having hosted the summit in Lisbon where the Joint Africa-EU Strategy was designed. We are now looking forward to the third Africa-EU summit.  The implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is urgent. Let me congratulate the Secretary-General and the members of the General Assembly on the results achieved at the recent High-level Meeting. We are firmly committed to applying the agreed political vision to mobilize efforts to meet the targets over the next five years.  International stability cannot be achieved and maintained without economic and social prosperity worldwide. The present economic and financial situation shows that we all benefit from common solutions to global problems. In this context  I call for a reinforced participation of developing countries and regional groupings and communities in ongoing debates  including the reform of the international financial organizations and their interaction with the United Nations system.  Another field where interdependence urges us to act jointly is climate change. It is a matter of survival. We shall do our part to ensure that the Cancún summit is a step in the right direction. Portugal has consistently worked to reduce its carbon footprint by investing solidly in renewable energy. I am proud to be able to announce that we have already met the target that my country announced here last year. Portugal is already producing 45 per cent of its electricity from local renewable sources  and by 2020 it intends to reach 66 per cent. It now holds the fifth place in Europe — and in the world — in terms of use of renewable energy. It has the largest wind park in Europe — and the second largest in the world — and it holds the record for the highest amount of wind energy    10-55103 26  generated. It has the largest photovoltaic park in the world and is a leader in the area of electric vehicles. Portugal is now considered one of the 10 most promising countries for energy investment.  Portugal has been sharing this experience and this knowledge with a number of developing countries  and we continue to intensify this cooperation through concrete partnerships and technology transfer and knowledge  supporting efforts towards adaptation and mitigation  in accordance with the commitments made in Copenhagen. Some of our partners are least developed countries and small island developing States. They are among those that pollute the least but suffer the most from climate change. It is urgent that the international community take the necessary measures to reduce their vulnerability.  This year marks the beginning of the United Nations Decade for Deserts and the Fight Against Desertification. Portugal recognizes the right to water  as well as the right to education  adequate housing and health. Ensuring that every human being has access to drinking water and adequate sanitation is also a good way of accelerating the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.  My country  an independent State for almost 1 000 years  commemorates this year the centennial of the Portuguese Republic. We are today a democracy with solid credentials in terms of human rights and their promotion worldwide. We firmly believe in the rule of law and have learned through our own experience that peace and prosperity are attainable only when they are truly and freely shared by all States.  Portugal is also a country that is accustomed to listening to its partners. We are members of the European Union  the Atlantic Alliance  and the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries  currently presided over by Angola  which I congratulate. Portuguese is the fifth most widely spoken language in the world and is present on all continents. Portugal also participates in the Alliance of Civilizations  a forum that is at the forefront of the much-needed intercultural dialogue among regions  which is ably led by Jorge Sampaio  former President of my country.  Portugal’s action at the United Nations is rooted in our capacity for open dialogue with every Member State and in our ability to build bridges and forge consensus. We always seek to defend our values through dialogue  not by imposing our views. Our attitude is not driven by any temporary need to please some constituencies. We aspire to be judged by our actions. This is our motivation for seeking active participation in all United Nations bodies for which the composition is rotational.  This universal vision of dialogue and openness to the world characterizes our current candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council.  We belong to the United Nations because we strongly believe in its values  objectives and universality; because we maintain that mutual respect should be the cornerstone of international action; and because we think that the strengthening of the United Nations and its activities is surely one of the most noble and idealistic objectives of all those who  like the Heads of State and Government participating here  strive each and every day to achieve a better world."
"142",5817,"PRY",65,2010,"Mr. President  let me first convey on my own behalf and on behalf of the Republic of Paraguay our wishes for every success in your sensitive and important function at the helm of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I would also like to express my delegation’s recognition of Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  President of the Assembly at the sixty-fourth session  for the significant achievements made.  Paraguayan democracy has completed its transition  begun 21 years ago  with the transfer of    10-55396 14  power from one political force to another in recent elections held under international observation. In that way we have consolidated a process of strengthening public freedoms  thereby affirming that those freedoms are fully guaranteed in my country today.  Paraguay comes to this general debate reaffirming its importance and calling for progress in strengthening the United Nations as the body capable of representing the interests of all Member States in the urgent quest for a fairer  more united and equitable world  guaranteed by the full force of international law.   We are very pleased that some great Powers have returned to the path of multilateralism  for some of the problems that afflict mankind can be resolved only with the involvement of every State. It has been demonstrated again that in the search for a better civilization  the solution has not  cannot and will never be found by a handful of nations. Thus the recent financial crisis can be resolved satisfactorily only through measures that are universal and taken with the agreement of the great majority. Once again  it is the General Assembly that will have to make its guiding voice heard on this issue.  We also applaud the Secretary-General’s timely decision to hold the High-level Meeting for review of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Republic of Paraguay believes that while achievements have been made with regard to the MDGs  we cannot avoid the fact that there are still inequalities all over the world and millions continue to live in abject poverty. The situation has been exacerbated by sudden increases in food prices and the consequences of climate change.  In Paraguay we are betting on the globalization of democracy with social development. We are betting on the universalization of security based on respect for human rights as an unwavering commitment and on dignifying human life. In that spirit we celebrate the recent designation of a Paraguayan citizen as a member of the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. We appreciate the support she received  which further strengthens our commitment to ensuring the inclusion of women in all areas of public life.   We would thus like to create a regional community in the context of a global union that in solidarity and together devotes its efforts to eradicating hunger and abject poverty  cooperating effectively to promote the participation of all in building sustainable prosperity through quality education and the provision of a social protection system that excludes no one.  The Republic of Paraguay reiterates its commitment to prioritize the implementation of programmes for economic development with social justice. The national Government is approaching with dedication the development and implementation of social policies to address needs in this area  with special emphasis on the most vulnerable and most needy of our population. That effort at the national level also requires international solidarity  enhanced through the processes of regional and sovereign integration of the people  as well as through a new international financial architecture whose institutions contribute to job creation and to fairer  more equitable trade conditions among the world’s nations.  We note with great concern that many citizens of our countries have had to migrate to other parts of the world  particularly Europe and North America  in search of new opportunities for happiness and personal fulfilment. We take this occasion to show our solidarity with the peoples who at this moment are suffering from the consequences of mistaken discriminatory and violent immigration policies  particularly as applied by countries of the so-called first world.   Migration policy is not a domestic issue but rather a question that must respect international human rights norms and standards. Therefore we call on all countries that receive migrants to deal in a spirit of humanitarianism  fraternity and hospitality with all our fellow citizens who today seek to share in the right to work and to a life of dignity far from their respective countries. We propose a deepening of dialogue on the issue in international forums to highlight the human dimension of migration processes and find a just and equitable solution to that reality of globalization.  Full employment and decent work are universal goals  and to reach them requires focusing national efforts and improving international cooperation to address macroeconomic and trade issues involved in the solution to that problem. Bilateral and multilateral institutions for development assistance should insist on employment taking a place of prominence in their policy decisions and implementation.   Disarmament  non-proliferation and arms control are not only essential factors to ensure international peace and security  but they also guarantee sustainable   15 10-55396  economic and social development for the most vulnerable countries. Only through a sound multilateral system with strict adherence to international law and respect for the sovereignty and self-determination of peoples can we guarantee our mutual security.   In that vein  we condemn coercive economic measures that prevent countries from exercising their sovereign right to choose their own political  economic and social systems. We reject the unilateral application of measures against the Republic of Cuba  and we reiterate our support for the General Assembly resolutions to put an end to the economic  commercial and financial blockade against that nation. The blockade against Cuba undermines the fundamental norms of international law  the principles of sovereign equality among States  non-intervention   non-interference in domestic affairs  freedom of trade and international navigation and the self-determination of peoples  as enshrined in instruments of international law.   We also demand that the Government of the United States adopt necessary measures to put an end to the irregular situation of five Cuban citizens who are currently deprived of their liberty as they sit in United States jails and who have denounced the violation of their human rights.  The Republic of Paraguay reiterates its commitment to international peace and security. In that context we reaffirm our political will to increase our contribution to peacekeeping missions and to continue our efforts to train and equip forces in accordance with the standards of this Organization  so as to progressively increase our participation in those operations.  My country is aware of the serious and complex threats of climate change around the world. We have watched with concern the growing negative effects of irregular climate phenomena that produce drastic consequences that contribute to increased poverty and displacement of persons  among other irreparable effects that must be urgently and uncompromisingly addressed. We subscribe to the Declaration of the Cochabamba summit on climate change and call for an urgent  coordinated and responsible global response to find ways to mitigate  lessen and reverse the tragic  devastating consequences of climate change. Likewise  we proclaim the sovereign rights of peoples over their natural resources  interpreted in the broadest sense.   A new international financial architecture is needed  one that seeks a system of fair trade and efficient regulation mechanisms. We also need new paradigms for integration that attack the root causes of obstacles to integration  such as inequitable exchange rates and the unequal conditions of international relations  the weight of unpayable debt and the imposition of structural changes that undermine the bases of social and political assistance. We are convinced that the United Nations  as a global institution  should play a central role to guarantee the success of our efforts to achieve better international coordination and coherence in the economic and financial spheres.   The issue of landlocked developing countries is fundamental to Paraguay’s foreign policy. The asymmetries and disadvantages created by and still being created by that geographical situation can be offset only to the extent that they are internationally recognized and that there be special  individualized treatment for such countries on the part of developed economies on their integration into the globalized world.   It is essential that the United Nations implement the needed reforms with the goal of adapting its structure to the current needs of global society. With that desire for evolution  the Republic of Paraguay supports the process of reform of the Organization so as to strengthen the General Assembly and recover the functions conferred on it by the Charter  as the most representative organ of the Organization.   Paraguay has also been watching with great interest the recent rounds of intergovernmental negotiations about equitable representation on and increasing the membership of the Security Council and other related issues. We advocate full adherence to multilateralism  the sovereign equality of States and inviolable respect for the rule of law. Accordingly  we need a Security Council that is more democratic  and thus its expansion cannot be put off in order to make it more equitable and inclusive.  As a contribution from Paraguay to promoting respect and fraternity — values that strengthen any organization made up of individuals and nations — we have proposed to share with the world our tradition of celebrating friendship. To that end  Paraguay has presented to the United Nations a proposal to proclaim    10-55396 16  30 July as World Friendship Day  in order to renew appreciation and recognition among our peoples.   Sixty-five years ago we said  “We the peoples of the United Nations”  and Paraguay was among them. Hence we reaffirm each and every precept enshrined in the remarkable Preamble to our Charter. We will be at the side of all  because we believe in the equality of nations large and small  which will allow us progressively to improve the conditions under which justice can be maintained and thereby better the standards of life in larger freedom. That is our mandate. We are committed to fulfil it.  "
"143",5836,"PSE",65,2010,"It gives me pleasure to congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election to the presidency at this session and to wish him every success in fulfilling his important tasks. We would also like to convey through you  Sir  our thanks to His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his valuable efforts during his presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session.  We would like also to express our thanks and appreciation to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts in strengthening the role and work of the United Nations and its bodies in various fields. In particular  we greatly appreciate his efforts  and those of the United Nations entities  especially the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East  which continues to work to provide essential services to Palestinian refugees  who have been waiting for more than 60 years for redress of their plight and the realization of their right to return to their homes and properties.  I am well aware that the agenda of the General Assembly is filled with matters and issues of pressing concern to the entire human race and to our planet  particularly those relating to armed conflict  wars and the struggle of people under foreign occupation to realize their right to self-determination  as well as climate change  global warming  natural disasters and the global economic and financial crises.  All of this is happening at a time when we are witnessing rightful demands for the revitalization of the United Nations  particularly reform of the Security Council aimed at making it more representative and truly reflective of the current international situation. This is especially important in the light of the    10-55103 30  emergence of new Powers  which should be represented in the Security Council in order to enhance its role and effectiveness in maintaining international peace and security.  There is also significant discontent over some States’ non-compliance with Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. This demands that the international community take vigorous  effective measures to compel those countries to respect and implement these resolutions; to end colonization  occupation and exploitation in our world so as to promote the values of freedom  justice  tolerance and coexistence; and to combat extremism and terrorism. Indeed  the United Nations has a fundamental role to play in promoting cooperative relations among peoples and guiding them towards investment in the development of societies and infrastructure  as well as in fighting poverty  unemployment  desertification  disease and epidemics and the lethal human and environmental risks they pose for humanity and the future of our planet.  Our people  our homeland  Palestine  and our region  the Middle East  are facing extremely serious problems that continue to push them towards violence and conflict  wasting chance after chance to seriously address the issues faced by the peoples of the region and to arrive at comprehensive and bold solutions. This is the result of the expansionist and hegemonic mentality that still prevails in the ideology and policies of Israel  the occupying Power  whose standard policy is non-compliance with internationally legitimate resolutions  including those of the General Assembly and the Security Council. Such disrespect has rendered those resolutions ineffective  undermined the credibility of the United Nations and bolstered the prevailing view that double standards are in effect  particularly regarding the Palestinian question  and that Israel is a State above the law  flouting all these resolutions and engaging in oppression  arrests  detentions  killings  destruction  demolition of homes  blockades  settlement expansion and the establishment of the annexation apartheid wall  violating and undermining the existence and the rights of our people in their own homeland.  The ancient city of East Jerusalem  capital of the independent State of Palestine and designated by UNESCO as a world heritage site requiring protection  is being subjected by Israel  the occupying Power  to actions that alter and distort realities on the ground. Such actions destroy landmarks  cemeteries and the religious  spiritual and historical identity of the holy city in every aspect and as quickly as possible  aiming to erase its historical character and pre-empt final status negotiations. This is in addition to the continuous excavations under the Al-Aqsa mosque  the demolition of homes  the deportations and revocation of the residency rights of its population and the imposition of a siege on the city in an attempt to isolate it from its natural Palestinian Arab surroundings and to control it geographically and demographically.  This situation is a provocation to our people. It antagonizes them and gives rise to anger  especially in the Arab and Islamic world. It creates instability in our region and constitutes a serious obstacle to the achievement of peace and security. All of these illegal Israeli measures and practices must cease.  This is also the case with regard to the situation in the Gaza Strip  which has been subjected to an unjust  illegal and unprecedented land  air and sea blockade in violation of international law and United Nations resolutions. It is also the target of harsh Israeli military aggression that has severely damaged its infrastructure. This illegal blockade and aggression have resulted in the destruction of the infrastructure and productive capacity of Gaza and destroyed 25 per cent of its homes and nearly 75 per cent of its jobs  leading to widespread unemployment and dependence on international aid. The Israeli blockade is preventing our people in Gaza from rebuilding their homes  even though the international donor community has pledged some $5 billion to finance reconstruction. The blockade against the Gaza Strip must be lifted immediately and completely  and the tragic suffering being inflicted on our people there must be ended as soon as possible.  We welcome the efforts of the international independent fact-finding mission established by the Human Rights Council concerning the Israeli attack on the Freedom Flotilla  which was carrying humanitarian assistance for our people in the Gaza Strip. We welcome the conclusions reached by the mission  and we also look forward to the submission by the Panel of Inquiry established by the Secretary-General of its findings to the Security Council.  To all of this I must add the fact that thousands of Palestinian prisoners and detainees remain in Israeli jails and detention centres. They are all fighting for   31 10-55103  freedom. They must be released and an end must be put to their suffering. This is essential for creating a positive environment for the attainment of peace. We cannot reach a peace agreement that does not liberate all of them from their chains and their imprisonment.  In spite of all of this and despite the historic injustice that has been inflicted upon our people  their desire to achieve a just peace that guarantees the realization of their national rights in freedom and independence has not and will not diminish. Our wounded hands are still able to carry the olive branch picked from the splinters of the trees that the occupation forces uproot every day. Our people aspire to live in security  peace and stability on their Palestinian national soil  to build the lives and future of our generations.  We are willing and ready to reach a comprehensive  just and lasting peace  based on rights and justice and on the resolutions of international legitimacy. Such a settlement must lead to the withdrawal of Israel  the occupying Power  from all the Arab and Palestinian territories occupied since 1967  including East Jerusalem  so that the State of Palestine  with East Jerusalem as their capital  can enjoy independence and sovereignty and so that peace can prevail throughout the Middle East.  Because of our genuine desire to attain a comprehensive peace in the region  we have decided to enter into final status negotiations. We will exert every effort to reach an agreement for Palestinian-Israeli peace within one year  in accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy  the Arab Peace Initiative  the road map and the vision of the two-State solution. On behalf of the Palestine Liberation Organization  we have reaffirmed our commitment to the option of just peace and our determination  seriousness and sincere intention to make these negotiations succeed  in spite of all the difficulties and obstacles before us.  The international community should draw lessons from the reasons for the faltering of the political process and the inability to achieve its goals in the past. Restoring the credibility of the peace process mainly requires compelling the Government of Israel to comply with its obligations and commitments. In particular  the Government of Israel must cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory  especially in and around East Jerusalem; dismantle the apartheid annexation wall; and put an end to the policy of blockade and closures that restrict the lives and movement of our people and deprive them of their basic human rights.  Our demands for the freezing of settlement activities  the lifting of the blockade and an end to all other illegal Israeli practices do not constitute preconditions that are alien to the political process. Rather  they are consistent with the implementation of previous obligations and commitments which have been repeatedly reaffirmed in all the resolutions adopted since the start of the political process.  Israel’s implementation of these obligations and commitments will lead to the creation of the necessary environment for the success of the negotiations and will give credibility to its pledge to implement the final agreement. Israel must choose between peace and the continuation of settlements.  From this rostrum  I reaffirm that we will continue  as we have always done  to make every possible effort so that these negotiations will achieve the desired objective of realizing peace by addressing all final status issues  namely Jerusalem  refugees  settlements  borders  water  security and the release of all prisoners and detainees. This must be done in a manner that will achieve freedom  independence and justice for the Palestinian people in their homeland  rectify the historical injustice inflicted upon them  achieve security and safety for all their neighbours  lead to a just peace throughout the Middle East  including on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks  and thus usher in a new era of stability  progress  prosperity  coexistence and good-neighbourliness.  The political process will be put back on the right track only if the international community assumes the main responsibility for ending the Israeli occupation  the longest occupation in modern history; ensures our people’s right to self-determination in their independent sovereign State based on the borders of 4 June 1967  with East Jerusalem as its capital; and finds a just and agreed solution to the plight of the Palestinian refugees. This must all be carried out through the implementation of the principles of the Charter  the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions  the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice  and the provisions of international law  including international humanitarian and human rights law  on the ground in the occupied    10-55103 32  Palestinian territory  including East Jerusalem. All of these measures constitute the legitimate political terms of reference for any successful negotiation leading to a final peace settlement.  Our people  despite the profound and continued suffering they have endured  hold steadfast to their rights  their land and their national soil. At the same time  they are determined to restore national unity and the bonds between the two parts of our homeland. We are making every effort to restore unity through dialogue and the good  honourable efforts of our brothers and friends  especially the Arab Republic of Egypt. On our part  we will spare no effort to end the division resulting from the coup against Palestinian legitimacy and to establish democracy as an essential foundation of our body politic.  We will also assume our responsibility for building national institutions for our independent State and national economy  and for ensuring the security and safety of our citizens under a national authority based on the rule of law  accountability  transparency and justice. We will also continue to fulfil our obligations under the road map and the agreements reached between the two sides.  In conclusion  it is imperative in this context to express our appreciation to all those who have contributed to sponsoring and supporting the peace process. Here  I would like to express my special thanks to His Excellency Mr. Barack Obama  President of the United States of America  who affirmed in his statement before the Assembly (see ) two days ago the two-State solution and the need to freeze settlement activities and establish the independent State of Palestine with full membership in the United Nations next year. On this occasion  we reaffirm our readiness to cooperate fully with his country’s efforts for a successful political process to achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the region.  We must also pay tribute to the United Nations for preserving our cause and extending a helping hand to our people through its resolutions and decisions  which constitute an unshakeable foundation for peace. From this rostrum  we call on the United Nations to continue its pivotal role until justice is upheld  our people have regained their usurped rights and peace prevails in our entire region. We reiterate our appreciation for the Organization’s tireless efforts to stand in solidarity with the just cause of Palestine  and we reaffirm our faith in the peace to which we and all the peoples in the region aspire. We ask God to bless us with a future in which we will all enjoy peace  security and stability."
"144",5882,"QAT",65,2010,"When I stood on this platform in September last year  I addressed the issue of the threats that beset our world. Unfortunately  these threats are still present and have even increased and diversified  and we are not any closer to achieving the Millennium Development Goals  which we set for ourselves ten years ago during the Millennium Summit. We believe that the malfunction that our world suffers from is due  not to a lack of resources  but to mismanagement and lack of justice and equity.  The global economic  financial and food crisis and the persistence of hunger  poverty and other challenges facing humanity today prompt us to rebuild our institutions and formulate our strategies to better respond to the challenges and crises facing the international community. The time has come to reformulate the global economic system in order for it to achieve justice and equal opportunities for all. Among the important international conferences and forums that Doha hosted this year was the World Economic Forum Global Redesign Summit  which resulted in many proposals for improving the existing international structures and cooperative arrangements  in order to create an international system conducive to meeting the challenges of the twenty-first century. I call on decision makers to discuss the proposals and adopt those that are appropriate.  You may all know that our region is still experiencing the highest degree of tension in the world. The question of Palestine has been awaiting a just solution for decades  the situation remains precarious in Somalia  Afghanistan and Iraq  and the Iranian nuclear crisis requires a solution. We have repeatedly    10-54827 28  stressed the importance of reaching a solution through peaceful and diplomatic means  and  in our view  a fruitful  direct dialogue between the United States of America and the Islamic Republic of Iran would contribute to the resolution of this crisis.  The strategic importance of the Arabian Gulf region stems from its geostrategic position and the fact that it is sitting on half of the world’s oil and natural gas reserves and is the source of one quarter of the world’s production of these two primary driving forces of the global economy. Let this be yet another consideration that prompts the international community to recognize the importance of achieving political stability and security in the Middle East. This is a difficult goal that can only be achieved by renouncing the use of force  freeing the region of weapons of mass destruction  without exception  and settling bilateral disputes and regional conflicts on the basis of international law  the United Nations Charter  the resolutions of international legitimacy and the principles of justice and equity.  Israel’s persistence in violating international law and humanitarian values was reflected in the acts of piracy committed against peace activists who tried to break the unjust and inhuman siege imposed on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip. This prompts us again to call upon the international community to stand as one in demanding that Israel lift the blockade immediately and fully.  We are now at a historic juncture in the process of the settlement of the question of Palestine. For everyone should realize that the Arab countries will not accept the peace that Israel wants to impose as it pleases and outside international legitimacy. A lasting  acceptable and secure peace must guarantee the rights of the Palestinian people  especially the establishment of a Palestinian State  with Jerusalem as its capital.  For reasons some of which we can understand and some of which we fail to understand  this first decade of the twenty-first century has been blighted by the blind attack that has come to be known as the war on terrorism. Thus the fresh start of a new century has been hamstrung by a quagmire of distortions and damage  some  if not all  of which could have been avoided. We recognize the existence of certain practices that clearly fall within the scope of terrorism  but in this regard we emphasize two premises.  First  we disagree with the attribution of this so-called terrorism to the Islamic religion  because — in addition to being incorrect — that ascription is historically unjust and is refuted by evidence from recent history. In the twentieth century  including the second half thereof  unjustifiably violent actions occurred in the United States of America  Europe and Asia  but no one has characterized those acts of terrorism as American  European or Asian. Rather  those acts of violence are attributed to their underlying political  economic  social and even ideological causes  without reference to any religion  country or idea. By contrast  what we have seen and suffered in the first decade of this century — what is called the war on terror — is a phenomenon unprecedented in international politics. It has plunged us into a kind of war with no limits  end  logic or legal or moral conditions. Some of this is still happening and  although we note that the current United States Administration has discontinued the use of the term “war on terror”  we are still looking forward to clearer and bolder initiatives.  The other premise that we disagree with is that we believe that even though the phenomenon of terrorism does exist it should not be addressed by waging wars. That approach has not achieved security  peace or prosperity. On the contrary  it has spread destruction everywhere  deprived millions of people of their livelihoods  spread fear  caused the displacing and killing of millions of people as well as economic and financial crises that have shaken the stability of the world  and undermined efforts aimed at dialogue among cultures.  I do not want to take up too much of the Assembly’s time  but we believe that the situation in which we find ourselves after the first decade of this intriguing century should not be allowed to continue  and its corrosive ramifications should not go unchecked. What we fear is that the war on terrorism may turn into a series of financial transactions concluded with armies of mercenaries who are given free rein to kill outside of any international or human legitimacy. That is a very dangerous prospect.  In this first decade  we have faced major challenges. We should resolve that war is not the way to deal with such challenges. Rather  we should come to terms with ourselves  with this era and with its concomitant progress  and determine to turn the new decade and the decades that follow into an era in which   29 10-54827  major challenges are addressed with more in-depth understanding and knowledge.  Proceeding from our belief that dialogue is the most effective way to resolve conflicts  we have set out to seek a resolution to several political crises in our region by promoting dialogue between the concerned parties  whether in Lebanon  Yemen  the Horn of Africa or the Sudan.  At the national level in the State of Qatar  we pursue human-centred development policies based on a holistic approach in dealing with human development. We have set ourselves the goals of modernization  reform and development in order to build a modern constitutional State of law-based institutions that guarantee citizens their freedoms  rights and responsibilities. We have taken concrete steps towards enhancing our development capabilities  including our health  educational and cultural institutions  which we hope will reach international standards  as well as enhancing national industrial enterprises to utilize natural resources in our country. God has granted our country an abundance of hydrocarbon fuel reserves. We have endeavoured to make the best use of this wealth  employ its revenues in the service of Qatari citizens and improve our various human development indicators because we  like other inhabitants of planet Earth  are anxious to address the impact of climate change. Our interest in clean energy  particularly natural gas  is on our list of priorities. And to contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions  we have developed policies that aim to benefit from clean and renewable energy sources.  Through this approach  we hope to contribute nationally  regionally and internationally to the establishment of peace  stability and security  as well as to the development that comes with them. Thus  we hope to assume our part of the collective responsibility for the common good."
"145",5928,"ROU",65,2010,"It is my honour to speak here and to participate for the first time in the Assembly’s general debate. The moment is all the more significant for us because Romania is celebrating 55 years of membership in the United Nations. My country and its people have always been firm believers in the ideal of countries working together for peace  prosperity and a better life for humankind. Nicolae Titulescu  one of the great Romanians of the twentieth century  once said that hardship creates the true brotherhood of nations. He said those words in September 1931  as President of the League of Nations  in a time of crisis. Today we are burdened again by immense challenges and have to live up to great responsibilities placed upon us by present and future generations. Communities all over the planet face mounting threats  which are often interrelated. Climate change exacerbates food and energy insecurity  health and population issues increase migration  while poverty puts pressure on regional security and stability.  At the same time  we are heartened to see an ever increasing commitment on the part of the world’s nations to act collectively and to share vision and willpower to overcome difficulties.   Climate change must be our next mobilizing issue. We must not let differences and the enormous complexity of interests define our drive. Negotiations in Cancún and thereafter  building upon the Copenhagen Accord  must pave the way for the timely adoption of a comprehensive and legally binding post-Kyoto agreement. Romania  including in its capacity as Chair of the Commission for Sustainable Development  will provide its unrestrained support and attention to international efforts to alleviate our planet’s environmental perils.  While climate change will hit us ever harder  a global recession has just battered us. The crisis revealed the flaws of our national and international financial and economic systems. It has become obvious that the world’s financial system is no longer compatible with the realities of global competition  nor    10-54965 44  can it handle the misuse of free market principles. Indeed  the system needs to be revised.  Sometimes  with sufficient resources  development can be achieved quickly. But development without good governance is less likely to be lasting. A country whose citizens do not enjoy equality and dignity can never be wealthy. From its own past Romania knows very well the negative impact that the lack of genuine democracy  human rights and freedom has on long-term development prospects. That is why we must never lose track of a milestone document — the Universal Declaration of Human Rights — adopted by this very Assembly  62 years ago  in Paris. The principles  the values and the generous ideals enshrined in that Declaration must remain the underlying foundation of our governance efforts. Romania plays an active role in promoting those fundamental values in our part of Europe and wherever its experience can prove useful and needed.  One must not forget that democracy starts with a basic step: free and fair elections. Electoral processes can be improved  including in the most advanced countries. States must be ready to accept that improvements are sometimes needed and be able to listen to and understand the calls for change  from within our societies or from outside.  Out-of-country voting is a sensitive and challenging issue  including in my country. Romania works in cooperation with the United Nations Electoral Assistance Division  European institutions and the Community of Democracies to develop knowledge and codify best practices in the field of out-of-country voting. We hope that the results of a first seminar on this topic  hosted by Romania this summer  will be multiplied and shared by many countries and regions.  Conflict prevention and peacebuilding are priorities in today’s world. Neither of them can be isolated from efforts to stabilize and reconstruct areas and societies affected by conflicts. To be successfully put into practice  that conceptual framework needs the complement of a consolidated United Nations operational instrument to which all Member States must contribute to the best of their ability. For this reason my country has taken a keen interest in  and offered substantial contributions to  civilian and military missions under the United Nations mandate and has started to develop dedicated capacities  of essentially civilian nature  in the area of stabilization and post-conflict reconstruction.  Just a couple of weeks ago  Bucharest hosted an international conference to officially open the Romanian Training Centre for Post-Conflict Reconstruction. The Centre will be open to international participation  and we hope to develop enhanced cooperation with the United Nations Office for Partnerships.  Today  Romania is honoured and proud to have consistently contributed to the management  through international cooperation  of a number of conflict situations and areas of instability. I pay my deepest respect to the men and women of Romania who have lost their lives and those who are risking their lives in conflict areas  as well as to all the military  police  gendarmes and civilian personnel serving all over the world to bring peace and security.   We must reaffirm our determination to accomplish the commitments made at the outset of the United Nations-mandated international mission in Afghanistan. While we welcome the results of the latest conferences in London and Kabul and note the progress in ensuring the stability  security and development of that sorely tried nation  we look forward to the moment when the Afghan authorities will be ready to assume the entire spectrum of responsibilities incumbent upon them.  Romania firmly supports the continued involvement of the United Nations and the international community in the reconstruction of Iraq and is ready to carry on helping. The success of the sovereign development of Iraq depends on national reconciliation and the development of harmonious relations with its neighbours.  As regards the issue of Kosovo  Romania continues to uphold politically and practically the essential United Nations mandate there  as well as the roles of the European Union and NATO in ensuring the progress  stability and security of the area. While respecting the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice  Romania considers that the opinion does not examine the core of the issue  which is the legality of the creation of an alleged new State. Romania maintains the view that unilateral secession is not possible under international law. Accordingly  Romania will maintain its position of non-recognition of Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence.   45 10-54965   We continue to be concerned with the protracted conflicts in the extended Black Sea area and South Caucasus. While solutions to these conflicts continue to be explored in the agreed formats  they must also be monitored by the larger United Nations membership  as a way to encourage dialogue and to ensure that developments remain within the boundaries of international law and United Nations resolutions.  In Georgia  which is among Romania’s top priorities  the United Nations must continue to play an important role  along with other actors such as the European Union  which through its Monitoring Mission contributes immensely to the stability of the area.  Furthermore  we support the Middle East peace process on the basis of the principles and provisions of the relevant Security Council resolutions and of the road map. We express our hope that the current direct discussions will lead to the goal of two States living side by side in peace and security. We also hope that Israel and Syria and Israel and Lebanon can identify the means needed to find solutions to improve their respective relations.  Concerning the crucial role of the United Nations in the area of disarmament  non-proliferation and arms control  I would like to underline the need to both strengthen the relevance of international law and to fully implement it.  Romania welcomes the new United States-Russian Federation treaty on nuclear arms reduction and the adoption of the Final Document of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  which contains concrete actions to advance international cooperation in the field of nuclear disarmament  non-proliferation and peaceful use of nuclear energy. The entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and future negotiations for a fissile material cut-off treaty continue to be issues of high interest for my country.  The efforts evoked in my address require a vibrant multilateralism with a strong United Nations at its core. That premise demands  in turn  improved functional relations between the United Nations and other international organizations with a global or regional vocation.  The roles of the European Union  NATO  the African Union  the International Organization of la Francophonie and others in working jointly with the United Nations in the field and at Headquarters must be supported and reinforced by all Member States. At the same time  the wide-ranging process of realignment and reform of the United Nations and its bodies must maintain the same pace.  In that context  I would like to warmly welcome the creation of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women as a significant step in United Nations reform. We congratulate Madame Michelle Bachelet  former President of Chile  for her appointment as head of that entity and wish her every success. At the same time  I would like to commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the entire Organization for their exceptional dedication and commitment to the advancement of women.  The sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly gives us another year in which we must accelerate the Assembly’s renewal and work out historic decisions on Security Council reform. Romania shares the view that the overarching goal of Security Council reform must be to create a more effective  transparent and representative body  and my country will join any pragmatic move in this direction. We strongly believe that the Eastern European Group deserves better representation on the Security Council in any enlargement format.  Let me conclude by saying that our role and position in the world’s affairs are not defined by our greatest achievements  but by how we use those achievements to strengthen the most vulnerable among us. That has been and still is the noblest mission and vocation of the United Nations  and of us all."
"146",5974,"RUS",65,2010,"The current  sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly has started with an unprecedented number of events covering the full range of the most topical international issues. It is encouraging that  in the light of the numerous challenges facing mankind  a positive unified platform for collective action has been taking shape  with the United Nations playing the central role. Having learned from the dramatic events of recent decades and having realized that attempts to cut the Gordian knot by force in violation of the Charter will only lead to deadlock  the international community has concluded that there is no alternative but to address political  economic and other problems through joint efforts based on international law. And the United Nations provides a universal platform to strengthen this positive trend in international relations.   The Security Council is a key instrument of this Organization to maintain international peace and security. The high-level Security Council meeting held on 23 September (S/PV.6389) reaffirmed its members’ intention to enhance that body’s efficiency  not only through direct involvement in conflict settlement but also by creating prerequisites for the non-recurrence and prevention of crises. This proves that the comprehensive approach to ensuring international security is gaining ground  as it reflects modern realities and is based on the principles and provisions of the United Nations Charter.  The United Nations faces unprecedented  serious and multifaceted tasks in the key area of peacekeeping. While paying tribute to the efforts and sacrifice of thousands of men and women Blue Helmets  joint efforts should continue to refine the theory and practice of peacekeeping under United Nations auspices and to improve the quality of planning and the conduct of peacekeeping operations with adequate political control by the Security Council.  It is encouraging that the United Nations is working towards this goal on a truly collective basis. Member States have quite a few constructive ideas on their table  which include Russia’s initiative to revitalize the Military Staff Committee in order to improve the military expertise of Security Council decisions.  This year has been marked by progress in nuclear disarmament. The 2010 Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms  signed by the Presidents of Russia and the United States in Prague  is a real contribution by our two countries to strengthening international security and strategic stability. It is also the result of positive changes in the relations between Russia and the United States that have placed Russian-American interaction in world affairs on a qualitatively new level.   We hope that the strong impetus provided by Moscow and Washington to the nuclear disarmament process will be followed similarly by all nations  primarily by nuclear-weapon States.  Pursuant to Russia’s policy towards strengthening the United Nations role in global security  disarmament and confidence-building  we intend to table three draft resolutions during the current General Assembly session: one on transparency and confidence-building measures in outer space activities  co-sponsored with China; a draft resolution on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security; and a Russia-United States co-sponsored draft resolution on bilateral strategic offensive arms reductions and the new framework for strategic relations. We call for their adoption by consensus.  The universalization of the Treaty on the  Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and its guaranteed strict implementation comprise the cornerstone of a strengthened international  non-proliferation regime. In that context  the search must continue for an effective solution to the Iranian nuclear problem on the basis of NPT provisions and the norms of international Law. The Iranian side must ensure the requisite level of transparency and cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  which is acting on behalf of the international community with the Security Council’s support.  Clarifying the outstanding questions about the Iranian nuclear programme would not only meet the goal of strengthening the non-proliferation regime but would also quite obviously promote the interests of Iran. Russia sees no reasonable alternative to a political and diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear   31 10-55396  problem through constructive dialogue between Tehran and the six countries involved. The meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the six countries in New York helped to consolidate the shared intention to ensure the earliest resumption of such a dialogue. We will continue to do our utmost to achieve this goal.  As far as the sanctions instrument is concerned  sanctions are not a goal in themselves. The objective of the sanctions regime established by the Security Council is to signal to Iran that it must fully cooperate with IAEA  and to give an impetus to the negotiating process. All members of the international community must show solidarity based on mutual responsibility. We strongly reject a situation in which unilateral decisions — including ex-territorial ones that undermine the very foundation of further joint efforts — are made with regard to sanctions in parallel to collective efforts by the United Nations Security Council. We must put an end to that practice  which runs counter to international law and has negative political effects.  Even more obvious  the economic and financial trade blockade of Cuba  whose lifting the General Assembly has demanded for a number of years  is clearly an anachronism. The codification of the principle of equal and indivisible security is indispensable to productive international efforts in this field  which is the precise goal of President Medvedev’s initiative to conclude a treaty on European security. The proposal targets the complete transition of Euro-Atlantic policy from its old Cold War agenda to a new one  as well as a firm legal foundation for the principle of indivisible security for all in the  Euro-Atlantic region proclaimed in the 1990s. We welcome the substantive dialogue on this important Russian initiative  which has started in various international forums.  A comprehensive settlement in the Middle East would make a crucial contribution towards strengthened global stability. The parties must demonstrate political will and extend every effort to promote the success of the resumed direct Palestinian-Israeli talks. The results of the ministerial Quartet meeting of major international mediators held on  21 September demonstrated that appropriate support to the Israelis and Palestinians will continue  but the ultimate responsibility for a successful outcome rests with them.  In this connection  the decision by the Israeli authorities to not extend the moratorium on Israeli settlement activities has raised serious concern. A way out of the current impasse should be found so as to ensure that negotiations continue. Our proposal to hold an international conference on the Middle East in Moscow is aimed at advancing the Middle East settlement. This proposal has gained the support of all interested parties and the United Nations Security Council. If the direct Palestinian-Israeli dialogue becomes stable  the preparations for the Moscow forum can get under way  which should also substantively examine the Syrian and Lebanese tracks  as well as the prospects for the multilateral aspects of the Middle East settlement.  The development of a comprehensive strategy to address the interconnected problems of the Middle East is on the agenda. It is necessary to continue working towards an international conference in 2012 on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery in the Middle East  pursuant to the decision of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  Russia supports the international strategy for a comprehensive settlement and for post-conflict rehabilitation of Afghanistan adopted by the Kabul Conference  which envisages a stage-by-stage transfer of responsibility for the situation in that country to Afghan authorities  as effective governing structures are established in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The future of Afghanistan must be determined by the Afghan people themselves. The international community must continue to provide its assistance  with an important role being played by the United Nations.  Lasting stabilization in Afghanistan and throughout the region will be impossible without resolving the drug problem. The dimension of the danger posed by narcotics emanating from Afghanistan represents a clear threat to international peace and stability and requires more resolute actions throughout the entire chain of the production and proliferation of narcotics — from the destruction of drug crops to the suppression of precursor supplies  including drug traffickers on the sanction lists of the Security Council. It is also necessary to move to a new level of international cooperation. Russia’s initiative to establish financial and counter-narcotics security belts    10-55396 32  along the perimeter of Afghan’s borders is consistent with those goals.  The regional dimension of the long-term stabilization of Afghanistan is becoming ever more topical. To that end  we must fully engage the potential of relevant organizations that are actively working in close contact with Kabul on Afghan issues  including the Collective Security Treaty Organization and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.  The settlement process in the Sudan is approaching an important milestone. As the date of referendum on the self-determination of the South of that country draws closer  the parties to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement must redouble their efforts to overcome the problems that still divide them. We should also give new impetus to the Darfur settlement process. At stake is the stability of conditions in the Sudan and throughout the vast African continent. We welcome the constructive attitude demonstrated by the Sudanese and other participants in the high-level meeting on the Sudan that was held here recently.  In Somalia  the confrontation continues between the Transitional Federal Government  supported by the international community  and extremists and terrorist groups linked with Al-Qaida. The lack of a settlement on land is fuelling the problem of piracy off the coast of Somalia. A more resolute pursuit of the political process and stronger assistance to the peacekeeping operation of the African Union and further counter-piracy efforts  including the criminal prosecution of pirates  are priorities in international efforts on the Somali track  as reiterated during the recent  mini-summit on Somalia  which Russia fully supports.  The results of the Millennium Development Goals summit have reaffirmed the important role of the United Nations on development matters and must help mobilize political support and financial resources for the timely achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). That requires joint efforts by Governments  international financial and trade institutions  the private sector and civil society  based on the principles of global partnership and shared responsibility.  It is obvious that most global problems  including the achievement of the MDGs  cannot be resolved without engaging innovations  advanced technologies and modernization solutions. The same is valid for such challenges as climate change  energy and food security and the fight against diseases. The engagement of the enormous potential of the United Nations  its family and system of specialized agencies in this area will allow the Organization to become a catalyst in the establishment and development of multilateral modernization alliances. Russia is prepared to participate actively in that work.  To live up to expectations  the United Nations must continuously renew itself. The reform of the Organization is progressively moving forward. This year  the negotiations on strengthening system-wide coherence were completed successfully. In particular  the new important United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women has been established.  Negotiations will continue at the current session of the General Assembly on the expansion of the composition of the Security Council. This is an extremely important issue on the reform agenda of the Organization  involving the interests of the overwhelming majority of States. For that reason  the final formula for Security Council reform should be based on compromise and the broadest possible agreement in the United Nations. This requirement is also fully applicable to all other aspects of United Nations reform.  This year marks the sixty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations  as well as that of the end of the Second World War  from the ashes of which the world Organization was born. For the sake of the memory of the millions of victims and in order to prevent a repetition of such scourges  we must suppress attempts to falsify the events associated with that historic calamity. That is the aim of a well-known Russian initiative in the United Nations. We count on the broadest support for a draft resolution on the topic.  The United Nations is our common and unique Organization. It is up to all of us to determine how productive and really useful its future work will be for humankind. By pulling our efforts together  we will be able to renew the United Nations effectively and provide it with all the necessary resources. We are convinced that reasonable resources spent on that goal will bring tangible dividends to all members of the international community in the form of durable peace  security  cooperation and prosperity all over the globe."
"147",6021,"RWA",65,2010,"At this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly  it is right that we re-examine the role of the United Nations in global governance  as we strive to help it adapt as fast as our times are changing  so that it serves all its Members equally.   In my understanding  global governance recognizes the inevitable and welcome interconnectedness of nations  the unique circumstances and contributions of each and the principle of mutual respect. I say “welcome” because  as we have seen  major threats of a global scale — like the financial crisis  climate change  terrorism  poverty and other challenges to world peace — need the concerted efforts of all nations if they are to be addressed effectively.  The just-concluded High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals has provided us another opportunity to assess the role of the United Nations  measure the progress we have made and consider the hurdles that remain in meeting the various Goals we set for ourselves. It is evident that the United Nations is uniquely placed to play a crucial role in mobilizing and galvanizing all nations for the common good  driving forward our collective initiatives and coordinating actions that foster the social and economic development of all.  Still  the United Nations is the sum total of Member States  and it can only be as good as the constituent Members want it to be. If there were a common understanding and shared values among all Member States  the Organization would deliver more efficiently on its mandate. But it has become clear that the United Nations has evolved into a two-tier organization  reflecting a world that seems to be divided into two major categories: one considered to have inherent  laudable values  rights and liberties  and another that needs to be taught and coached on those values.  My country and many in the developing world seem to fall into that second category. Not only marginalized and disenfranchised  we are also considered chronic violators of our own human rights. The implication is that the United Nations holds a certain standard for some countries  and another for others  especially on international issues concerning which every single Member should be treated equally under the law.   In my view  a debate between those two categories is urgently needed within the United Nations membership so as to regain the noble founding ideals of the Organization. No entity is better placed than our common United Nations to bring equality and respect  despite disparities in economic status.  The same situation pertains in the realm of international justice and the rule of law. Rwanda subscribes to the principle that everyone and every State is accountable to laws and that the rule of law should govern us all. But these laws must truly be equally enforced and independently adjudicated.  Reaffirming the role of the United Nations in global governance presupposes strengthening and reforming it to make it more effective and efficient in its response to global challenges. The impetus to reform our global governance structures  however  is the desire to ensure that they are equipped to deal with those challenges and secure a brighter future for all the citizens of the world.  When there are no avenues for appealing international rulings  when there is an accountability deficit in key global institutions and when ordinary citizens feel that the United Nations cannot deal adequately with the issues affecting their daily lives  the United Nations cannot be seen as credible  relevant and democratic. We should make sure the Organization does not become a tool for the powerful to protect their interests and enhance their influence or use it in subjugating others.   13 10-54965   Rwanda believes in multilateralism and understands that global challenges can be effectively resolved only through international cooperation. The United Nations must continue to be at the centre of that agenda and play its role without bias or prejudice.  As we in Rwanda continue to rebuild our country  we have become acutely aware of the need for lasting peace and security in our region and have worked hard to achieve it. We know that stability is the key prerequisite for our development and the improved lives of our citizens and our neighbours  and we have unreservedly committed ourselves to attaining it. We will continue to work in partnership with our neighbours  international and regional organizations and the African Union to ensure that peace and security prevail and that Africa fully realizes its potential.  Lastly  let me say that each of our countries  separately and collectively  has a duty to the people of the entire world  especially the most vulnerable."
"148",6103,"SDN",65,2010,"It gives me great pleasure at the outset to extend warm congratulations to you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I am confident that your election was the right choice.  I would also like to commend the outstanding manner in which Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki conducted the meetings of the previous session. His statesmanship and experience reflected positively on the work of the session.  We would also like to extend our thanks and appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the Secretariat for their ongoing and appreciated efforts.  We followed with keen interest and actively participated in the preparations for the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We have reviewed our achievements and identified obstacles and challenges in a way that will enable us to meet our obligations. There is no doubt that the success attained and the constructive recommendations submitted will encourage Member States to make further progress in this respect.  We would like to underscore the great importance of development aid in achieving the MDGs and of the need to maintain such assistance even in the current situation of successive global crises and in the context of the increasing burden of foreign debt on the economies of the developing countries and their ability to achieve the MDGs.  I would like to take this opportunity to give the Assembly a brief review of the recent political developments in my country  especially regarding the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) signed in 2005  which was the subject of a high-level meeting on the Sudan held three days ago at the invitation of the Secretary-General and attended by a number of leaders and Heads of State. I note the concluding communiqué citing positive developments in the implementation of the CPA and the steps to establish peace in Darfur. It also commended the holding of public elections in the Sudan last April in an atmosphere of tranquillity and peace. International observers were witness to the credibility and integrity of the voting process.  Arrangements are now under way for the holding of the referendum in Southern Sudan on schedule concerning the options of unity or separation. For our part  we are determined that our fellow citizens in the South shall have their say without coercion and in an atmosphere of freedom  integrity and transparency. We also hope that unity will be the voluntary choice of the citizens of Southern Sudan. We therefore call on all people to support and consolidate the unity of the Sudan and to participate in observing the referendum. We also welcome the Secretary-General’s decision to ask former Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa to chair the United Nations panel mandated to observe the referendum.   13 10-55122   We also recall my Government’s efforts to consolidate peace in Darfur  which has undergone several positive changes that continue to promote the normalization of the situation. Lasting peace would restore to Darfur the vitality that has faltered in the past years due to conflicts fuelled by the proliferation of arms and by regional and international interventions. The recent positive developments have enabled the holding of elections throughout Darfur  helped to consolidate democratic legitimacy and led to the establishment of new elected institutions.  These positive transformations  which have created new conditions on the ground  have encouraged the Government to develop a new strategy for Darfur  concerning which we have conducted broad discussions with the people of Darfur at the individual  collective and institutional levels  and with all the national political forces. We have also conducted consultations on Darfur with our partners in the peace process  first and foremost the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and the African Union High-Level Implementation Panel ably and skilfully led by President Thabo Mbeke.  Many of our partners in the peace process and the international community have also supported and encouraged this strategy. The new strategy is based on five key components: the establishment of security; the consolidation of development; the resettlement of internally displaced persons and people affected by the war so they can lead a life of dignity; the encouragement of internal reconciliation that would promote social peace; and the pursuit of negotiations with a view to drafting a settlement document agreed by the people of Darfur. The strategy envisages the completion of the negotiations currently under way in Doha through the sincere efforts and under the auspices of the sister State of Qatar.  With a view to achieving the strategy’s development goals  the Government has appropriated from its own resources the sum of $1.9 billion over the next four years to cover the costs of development projects  in addition to what it hopes to raise from partners and donors.  The strategy is designed to work closely with UNAMID  the Joint African Union-United Nations Chief Mediator for Darfur  and the African Union Executive Council in order to facilitate and arrange consultations with the people of Darfur so as to universalize reconciliation and establish justice for all through national mechanisms and in close consultation with all sectors of Darfurian society.  It is worth noting that the strategy adopts a practical approach to implementation based on two pillars. The first is the adoption of the idea of partnership. In that context  the Government has endeavoured to establish partnerships with all States and organizations that wish to engage with it on the basis of the strategy. Foremost among those partners are UNAMID  the United Nations and its agencies and organizations  the African Union Executive Council  the African Union itself and its institutions  the League of Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic Conference.  The second pillar is the exertion of special efforts to involve the citizens of Darfur — particularly at the grass-roots level and including elected representatives  civil society organizations and the internally displaced — so that the centre of gravity of the peace process will not be far removed from Darfurian society. Thus  the prescriptions for peace will be entrenched in the conscience of the people  which will facilitate their acceptance of them. This vision of peace has gathered powerful momentum from the positive changes in our relationship with Chad  in addition to our vigorous efforts to strengthen our regional relations in the interest of promoting peace in the Sudan.  With a view to bolstering stability in the various regions of the Sudan and eliminating the causes of potential armed conflicts  in October 2006 the Government concluded  in the Eritrean capital  Asmara  an agreement with the Eastern Front. The agreement provided for security arrangements that led to peace and security throughout the territory. In order to reinforce our efforts to implement the agreement  it was agreed to convene an international conference on the development and reconstruction of Eastern Sudan on 1 December 2010  which the State of Kuwait has graciously agreed to host. Preparations for the conference have been jointly undertaken by the United Nations Development Programme  the Islamic Development Bank in Jeddah  the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic Development and the Arab Development Bank  in addition to the Sudanese Government. The conference will focus on three topics: infrastructure  services and investment. From this rostrum  I appeal to Member States to participate    10-55122 14  actively in that important forum in order to establish stability in that part of the Sudan.  We are committed to combating impunity  which is part and parcel of the principle of international justice and does not admit politicization  discrimination or selectivity. However  selectivity and politicization are prevalent in what is known as the International Criminal Court  which has become a tool to break the will of the people of the third world and to impose hegemony over them. We have all witnessed the hasty steps taken to subject a State non-party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to its powers and jurisdiction  as a result of which the established principles of international law fell victim to crude and unjust political intervention.  Over the past six years  the Sudan has made progress towards negotiated political settlements with armed movements in the South  East and West. The involvement of the International Criminal Court  in this context  directly jeopardizes the peaceful settlement process that the country seeks. Therefore  we completely reject this intervention  which has no place in international law  logic or policy  and is wholly unjustified.  We appreciate and commend the position of the African Union and other regional organizations to which the Sudan belongs  and of countries committed to the rule of international law that have condemned and strongly rejected the claims of the Court. Therefore  we call on the Security Council to reconsider its decision and to withdraw the file completely from the Court. In the light of the high-level meeting attended by representatives of all members of the Security Council and many other countries  and of the Secretary-General’s communiqué of 24 September commending the efforts of the Sudanese Government to fight impunity (see SG/2165)  the Council should refer the entire file to the Sudanese justice system so that it can deliver justice pursuant to the established rules of international law and national legislation.  After the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  we hoped that the international community would show cooperation commensurate with the Sudan’s many accomplishments. We hoped to be included in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative and to resume receiving much-needed development aid  like other States emerging from conflict  as reflected in relevant international recommendations and resolutions. That should be in addition to the special treatment that the Sudan should enjoy as a least developed country.  Similarly  we believe that the announcement by creditors of their intention to cancel the Sudan’s foreign debts would dispel concerns about the referendum on Southern Sudan and the negotiations between the two parties regarding the post-referendum arrangements. We therefore call for cancellation of the Sudan’s debts  on the basis of the same standards applied to other least developed African countries. That would help fight trends that lead to confrontations and instability and the deterioration of development in developing countries.  The African continent has continued to suffer from the repercussions of the global economic and financial crisis  as well as from the adverse effects of climate change  including their impact on the prices of food and energy. That has widened the scope of poverty and hunger and has increased social tensions  migration  displacement  armed conflict and the inability of African States  especially the developing countries  to cope with the humanitarian consequences of natural disasters.  In that regard  we would like to draw attention to the need to accord priority  through the New Partnership for Africa’s Development  to questions pertaining to the continent on the United Nations development agenda; to build the capacity of African and African Union institutions to maintain peace; to take affirmative action in financing the continent’s plans for combating poverty  the AIDS pandemic and malaria; and to provide humanitarian assistance and upgrade the capacities of African States in order to strengthen their efforts in realizing the Millennium Development Goals.  The question of Palestine has been inscribed on the United Nations agenda for many decades  while the Palestinian people have continued to suffer. They are deported  displaced  killed  and driven away from their homeland  despite the fact that the United Nations has adopted numerous resolutions that Israel has refused to implement  in clear defiance of the will of the international community. We call upon Israel to implement all international resolutions and return all occupied Arab lands in Palestine  the Golan Heights and Lebanon. An independent Palestine is a noble   15 10-55122  demand and is the legitimate right of the people of Palestine  supported by the calls of all peace-loving peoples and countries.  We call for a Middle East free of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction. We underline the right of States to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful uses and to settle disputes through dialogue and negotiation. We also stress the need to renounce harmful propaganda and the sowing of fear  panic and tension in the region.  We pinned great hopes on the success of an international consensus on the issues of the environment and climate  in view of the direct and severe effect of climate change on the life of people in my country and in many others  as confirmed by studies prepared by experts in this Organization and its specialized agencies. That has prompted the Secretary-General to draw attention to the close link between climate change and a number of armed conflicts on the African continent and elsewhere  in particular over Darfur.  We therefore hoped that the efforts to address climate change would be crowned with success at the Copenhagen Conference and that the developed countries would pledge  on the basis of their historical responsibilities  to adopt strategies and programmes with clearly defined goals and principles aimed at addressing the root causes of climate change. We hoped they would pledge to provide the necessary financial resources for sharing responsibility for the preservation of this planet  while fully respecting the principles agreed on in the 1992 Earth Summit Declaration in Rio de Janeiro. I am pleased to recall the laudable attention my country has given to the problem of mitigating the effects of climate change through numerous programmes  plans and institutions  as well as by promoting the necessary awareness of the gravity of the problem among wide sectors of the population. However  that remains a moral obligation and a humanitarian mission and responsibility that demands joint international efforts."
"149",6148,"SEN",65,2010,"The delegation of Senegal welcomes the election of Mr. Joseph Deiss to lead the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We are aware of his personal qualities and are confident that his presidency will bear the hallmark of his country’s traditional neutrality. I warmly congratulate him and wish him every success.  I would also like to pay homage to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his outstanding work in guiding the work of the Assembly’s sixty-fourth session. I also express our great gratitude to our Secretary-General  Ban Ki-moon  for his tireless devotion to his delicate task in the service of our common ideals.  The state of the world has improved little since the Assembly’s last session. We continue to face the same urgent issues: the ongoing economic crisis and continued environmental degradation. Unfortunately  with regard to the latter  the Copenhagen Conference was unable to provide a satisfactory response — not because of a lack of will  but rather because the question has been inappropriately framed  as I said at that meeting. To that list we must add persistent issues such as transnational organized crime  international terrorism and illicit drug trafficking.  As we meet here to consider and act together on those major challenges  we are giving hope to our people with regard to finding concerted answers to those many and complex problems  which no country can face alone. It is therefore altogether fitting that we turn to the world Organization to find a collective response  or at least to exchange experiences.   The theme of the Assembly’s sixty-fifth session — “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance” — is therefore quite timely. Perhaps we ourselves have been tardy in launching this debate. In my view  it is not a matter of determining whether the Organization has contributed to improving global governance  but rather a question of how to make its efforts more useful and effective in the face of the unprecedented upheavals that the world has experienced in recent years.   International relations have accelerated considerably in a very short time. Much of what was taken as certain is no longer true and accepted notions have been shaken. What we call the established order has been turned on its head by the emergence of new forces arising from globalization and economic competition.   The changes that have taken place call for a new state of mind and another way of perceiving and managing world affairs by adapting the system to the new realities of the twenty-first century. Are we prepared to define a new world order in which Africa and emerging Powers fully play the role that the ongoing changes are conferring upon them? The answers we provide on those issues will depend  at least in part  on the role of the Organization in global governance.   13 10-54959   After 65 years of existence  the United Nations system continues to bear the legacy of a bygone historical era  with the Charter of the United Nations itself bearing post-war stigmas and colonial prejudices. For instance  the Charter still refers to the idea of an enemy State  in the sense of a Power defeated in war. Also  Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice refers to general principles of law recognized by civilized nations — as if uncivilized nations still existed. In themselves  such anachronisms from another time demonstrate the need to reform the system.  Moreover  the nature of the issues now addressed by the Organization has become quite diverse  just as its composition and the volume of is work have increased considerably  while some of its mechanisms  including that for collective security  have remained nearly unchanged.   In 1945 the Organization had 51 Members; today it has 192. The composition of the Security Council  a body which is supposed to reflect the will of Member States  has been altered only once  in 1965  when the number of seats increased from 11 to 15 with the inclusion of additional non-permanent seats. And 17 years since we began negotiations on the Council’s reform  there are still no prospects for consensus.   Maintaining the status quo at all costs means ignoring the radical changes that have taken place in the world  thereby making the Council susceptible to greater mistrust  defiance and criticism. That inertia may prove to be dangerous owing to the lack of representation  legitimacy and credibility that could result. If today many of the Council’s decisions are being called into question and not properly implemented  it is because they are perceived by the great majority of Member States as being more expressions of national interest than the carrying out of a mandate on behalf of the community of nations.   I am not personally in agreement with the eminent observer of the United Nations who has written that “the organization of the Security Council belongs to the nineteenth century”. I believe that it bears the hallmark of our times  but it needs to be improved and delivered of its shortcomings.   How can we preserve a credible role in global governance for the Organization if Africa — which makes up more than a fourth of its Members and accounts for more than 70 per cent of the issues on the agenda — does not have a permanent seat on the Security Council? Several years ago in this Hall  in order to put an end to that anomaly and to right an historic injustice  Senegal proposed that — independent of the ongoing reform  which will take time  given that it began 17 years ago — Africa be given a permanent seat with veto power.    Meanwhile  the same grievances that have been levelled against the Security Council have also been raised with regard to international criminal justice. Twelve years ago  the common need for international criminal justice that was universal  permanent and neutral led to the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to complement national jurisdictions in punishing and preventing the most serious crimes.   Because Senegal has faith in the ideals of peace and justice for all  it reiterates its commitment to the Court. It was the first country to ratify its Statute  on 2 February 1999. Nevertheless  the Court will never be credible if the President of the Sudan is the only one to be pursued  with suspect eagerness.   While the setting up of the ICC represents a significant advance in the fight against impunity  it is in its practice that the Court itself will be judged. And for that practice to be free of suspicion and questioning  we must ensure that it reflects the principles agreed by the United Nations with regard to human rights: universality  objectivity  non-selectivity and impartiality. On the basis of those principles  the Court should deal with all situations within its jurisdiction in the same way  whoever the perpetrators and whatever their nationality.  Given the deep and multifaceted crisis  global economic governance remains a pertinent issue. Consultative frameworks such as the Group of Eight (G-8) and the Group of Twenty (G-20) are trying to address it in order to lay the foundations for a new world order. Those efforts are praiseworthy.   Today  there are a number of us who would like to establish an independent circle of very high-level specialists so as to put ourselves upstream of the G-8 and the G-20 and to provide heads of State and Government with our thinking on the topics that they are considering. We would even like to go beyond the technical nature and address more fundamental issues. The job of setting all that up has been entrusted to me  and I am dedicating myself to the task.    10-54959 14   With regard to the unchecked increase in the price of oil  which penalizes non-producing countries  I have already proposed a mechanism that would make it possible to bring together the corporate superprofits  the income of producing countries and the surcharges on non-producing countries  to serve as the basis for a policy which I call “oil against poverty”  using a fund financed by the contributions of the first two categories  which share the oil revenues.  In order to parry the fierce rise in agricultural prices  I suggest that we consider that issue again at a conference in Dakar — the second Dakar Agricultural Fair. We propose a mechanism that fully integrates producers in order to establish world governance of agricultural prices  taking into account the interests of producers and consumers. That will be the aim of the conference  which will be held in our capital in January and February 2011.  In the same spirit  we continue to contribute to efforts to protect the environment  in particular in the context of the project to build the Great Green Wall. It is a barrier of trees the length of the Sahel-Saharan region  from Dakar to Djibouti  7 000 kilometres long by 15 kilometres wide  and that project is already being implemented. It has earned us the support of the Global Environment Facility  which has granted the countries involved the sum of $119 million.  With regard to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  the assessment that the Assembly’s High-level Plenary Meeting has just made clearly shows that  despite our progress  we must remain mobilized in order to meet the agreed commitments by the 2015 deadline.   In Senegal  thanks to the national assessment that we carried out last May  we have gauged the work to be done by 2015. Our main conclusion is that a quantitative approach that sees development only in terms of money is insufficient. We must show more creativity and more imagination in our own country. For its part  Senegal has implemented the following innovations.   First is the GOANA Strategy — the Great Agricultural Offensive for Food and Abundance  which enabled us to go from an importer of food products in 2008 to self-sufficiency and even net exporter in 2010.   We have introduced the Neighbourhood Godmother initiative  which empowers women in the fight against maternal and child mortality so as to speed up implementation of the MDGs related to health. It is based on the sociology of our African societies. In every neighbourhood or village  there is always a woman who is the focus of all the others  and  by giving her a role  we empower her to watch over the pregnant women and attend to them  even at the child’s birth. That requires only very little equipment  such as a mobile phone. That supervision  we believe  will make it possible to reduce maternal and child mortality.   Next is the Modern Daras initiative — daras means studying in Arabic — which introduces the teaching of Arabic  French and English and vocational training in madrasas in order to progress towards the complete disappearance of those students who graduate from madrasas very learned and able to recite the Koran  but who are jobless. That initiative is supported by Senegal’s religious leaders. And we simply think that it is possible to provide children with spiritual training and further education at the same time. We have introduced Christian and Muslim religious education into schools.  Another initiative is the scheme to allocate 40 per cent of the national budget to education and training in order to ensure sufficient quality human resources  able to take up the challenge of development. If I am not mistaken  Senegal is the only country to have agreed to that sacrifice — to put 40 per cent of the budget into education.   The Bac Minus One initiative means that we take the young people who have failed the baccalaureate examination and have them help school teachers promote primary education  in order to address the criterion of universal primary education.   Naturally  we have launched a policy to promote rural women. Today there are facilities that enable them to retain the added value that was previously in the hands of factories and producers  that is to say  those who control the money.   We have also proposed a new definition of poverty  which is not the fact of having less than $1 a day. Poverty is a combination of deficiencies  such as in housing  decent food  access to school and health care. We are dealing with that by creating villages in which all those fundamental needs can be met.   The Assembly knows about the Digital Solidarity Fund initiative  which we launched a few years ago to   15 10-54959  help bridge the digital divide between developed countries and underdeveloped countries.  I would also like to report that we have launched the Eco-villages Strategy  which involves converting traditional villages to energy self-sufficiency by using clean energy such as solar or wind in order to lessen the degradation of our environment.  Lastly  the initiative for complete equality between men and women in Senegal in all fully or partially elected bodies is a way for us to marshal women’s abilities  which are fully acknowledged. The law of March 2010 fully assimilates women into the nation’s decision-making circles. I think that we should perhaps stop talking about the advancement of women. We must raise women to the decision-making level  which will happen at the same time and on the basis of equality with men.   I could continue  but those examples are enough to demonstrate the pressing need for innovation.  In my capacity as current Chair of the Organization of the Islamic Conference I must once again draw the attention of the international community to the resurgence of Islamophobia in certain sectors. In recent years outbursts of Islamophobia  as if in a process of escalation and provocation  have multiplied: profanations of tombs and of the Holy Koran  hate speech and blasphemous caricatures. All these incidents in fact give expansive proof of the small-mindedness  ignorance and intellectual and moral bankruptcy of their authors. On behalf of the Islamic umma  I strongly denounce and condemn these irresponsible and absurd acts. In any case  with regard to the Holy Koran  God himself has made himself infallible protector of his holy word  as it is said  “Surely We have revealed the Reminder and We will most surely be its guardian” (The Holy Koran  XV:9).  I would like everyone to understand that Islam and Muslims are no one’s enemy. Islam is a religion of the golden mean  which teaches moderation  which exhorts us to do good  which preaches respect for diversity and peaceful coexistence among peoples  whatever their religion. Still today it is in strict observance of these rules that nearly 2.5 billion Muslims throughout the world practice their faith. If there is a tiny minority that descends to violence in the name of the Koran  we say: No  that is in keeping neither with the letter nor the spirit of the Koran.  I reaffirm the openness of the Islamic umma to dialogue and joint effort. In the face of extremists of all sides  who want to take religions and believers hostage  I invite world leaders  opinion-makers  men  women and young people to join us to converse  explain  inform and educate  to promote the choice of wisdom  knowledge  reason  logic and doing good against obscurantism and confrontation. I hope that from that choice will come mutual understanding and peaceful coexistence between peoples  civilizations and cultures  respecting each other’s beliefs and diversity.   At Dakar  we have organized the Conference of African Ulema  a group of Islamic scholars who are responding to those who want to use our religion for political ends. That African conference will culminate in a conference of all the countries of the umma  to be held in Medina  Saudi Arabia.  Right now I direct my hope towards the establishment of a Palestinian State with internationally recognized borders. That is why I support President Obama’s initiative on Palestinian-Israeli dialogue and renew my long-standing support for the legitimate demand of the Palestinian people for a sovereign  independent and viable State. We support the vision of a Palestinian State that will be a full member of the United Nations  which has been promised here by President Obama.   Faced with the tragedy that has struck the Haitian people  Senegal has joined its efforts with those of the international community to provide emergency assistance. In October we will be receiving some 160 Haitian students who wish to study in Senegal  and next year we expect to be hosting Haitian families. From this rostrum I appeal to all  and in particular to African heads of State  to help Haiti. Those who want to host students should speak to us: I have sent commission to Haiti  and I have tasked a minister to be in charge of Haitian affairs. We have a roster of 3 000 young people who have been chosen by university teachers  about whom we have all the necessary information  including health information.   In Africa  Senegal notes with satisfaction the progress of our brother people of Côte d’Ivoire towards national reconciliation and the upcoming holding of elections in peace and calm. In Guinea  another neighbour of Senegal  where I have visited many times to help normalize the situation  I salute the efforts of the facilitator  President Blaise Compaoré. I invite once    10-54959 16  again all Guinean stakeholders  in particular the two candidates in the second round  to complete the electoral process  so that there can be a permanent return to constitutional order  in national peace and harmony — which are essential conditions for development.  Senegal is also pleased with the progress made by the Niger to re-establish the country’s political institutions. Guinea-Bissau  another neighbour of ours  has made significant progress since its election last year of President Malam Bacai Sanhá. But its democratic institutions remain fragile and therefore need more resolute support from the international community. In line with the conclusions of the extraordinary summit of the Economic Community of West African States held on 17 September  Senegal is prepared to take part in the efforts of our regional organization for the establishment of a programme for security and defence sector reform in Guinea-Bissau.  In the Sudan  Senegal remains committed to the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur. We hope that the referendum on self-determination of the south will be held in the best conditions possible in order to prevent a domino effect that would be harmful to the whole of Africa. Perhaps a group of heads of State could help to work towards that goal.  I would like to conclude by recalling that Senegal will host  from 10 to 31 December  the third World Festival of Black Arts  after the first two  which were held in Dakar in 1966 and Lagos in 1977. This gathering is a reaffirmation of the artistic  cultural and intellectual identity of the black world  and it carries a message of openness  dialogue and fraternity from Africa and its diaspora to the whole of humanity  for the respect of all cultures and civilizations. All are cordially invited."
"150",6195,"SGP",65,2010,"Although the global economic situation has improved considerably  it is still fragile. Much of the relief has come from the massive liquidity that has been pumped into the global financial system by national Governments. That bought us time to restructure our economies and correct the underlying imbalances that led to the crisis in the first place.  Whether the restructuring is happening fast enough is  however  still an open question. The economist Joseph Schumpeter viewed economic downturns as the system renewing itself  a process he described as creative destruction. In theory  that sounds good. In practice  it is difficult for political leaders to stand idly by when companies go bust and jobs are lost. Everyone likes the creative part. Destruction  however  can mean losing an election  which politicians invariably try to avoid.  The repricing of production factors such as real estate and labour is politically sensitive in any country  and Governments get blamed for it. Adjusting relative factor costs through the exchange rate is usually easier to achieve  although currency devaluation can create   17 10-55264  other problems such as inflation. The argument over fair exchange rates in the world today reflects competing domestic pressures to ease the pain of restructuring in different countries. Thus the United States wants China to revalue the yuan renminbi  while China protests that it is being blamed for the economic weaknesses of other countries.  Of course  if the whole world were to use the same currency  the only way countries would be able to adjust would be through improved productivity and repricing. Exchange rate adjustments can facilitate structural adjustment  provided that the deeper economic problems are also tackled. With the world becoming multipolar  global macroeconomic coordination has become more complicated. Recognizing the inability of the Group of Seven or the Group of Eight to achieve such coordination  the Group of 20 (G-20) was formed two years ago when the global economy stared into an abyss after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Without the G-20 acting in concert  the economic crisis could well have led to a global depression. The G-20 — the members of which collectively account for some 85 per cent of total global gross domestic product — is therefore a vital grouping in the community of nations.  Going forward  the G-20 has to go beyond the reform of international financial institutions and better coordination of fiscal  monetary and exchange rate policies. Without fundamental restructuring of the real economy  we may experience a double dip. Without fundamental restructuring  increased liquidity in the global system will end up creating new asset bubbles  some of which we already see forming in Asia. For this restructuring to take place  the international trading system must be kept open. Only then can markets make adjustments and prices find their right levels. In fighting protectionism in all its forms  the leadership of the G-20 is critical. If  for lack of political will  the G-20 is unable to avert the crisis of a second dip  crisis will in the end force it to act  and by then it will be at much greater human cost to all of us.  For precisely that reason  we must not allow interest in the Doha Development Agenda to flag. When the Doha Round was launched in November 2001  a key consideration was development. For many of us who were in Doha during the negotiations  the Millennium Development Goals were uppermost in our minds. I remember Tanzanian trade minister Iddi Simba insisting  on behalf of the African  Caribbean and Pacific countries  that the word “development” be explicitly incorporated into the name of the new round.  It has been 10 years since the Millennium Development Goals were launched. While some countries have done well  many others have not. The G-20 countries must take into account  in their deliberations  the interest of all countries  not only of their own. The G-20  which together accounts for 80 per cent of international trade  has to play a leadership role in breaking the current impasse in the Doha negotiations. In particular  we must ensure that the needs of developing countries  especially the needs of the least developed countries (LDCs)  are met. Freeing up agricultural trade  for example  will make a huge difference to their welfare.  With those concerns in mind  a loose grouping of countries calling itself the Global Governance Group  or 3G  was established more than a year ago. Its objectives were spelled out in a document circulated to the Members of the United Nations on 1 March. The basic stance of the Group is to support the work of the G-20 and hold it accountable to the general membership of the United Nations. Permanent Representatives within the 3G Group meet regularly in New York  including before and after G-20 meetings  to present views and make suggestions  which are circulated to everyone at the United Nations. Depending on the subjects discussed  we invite individual members of the G-20 to join us at our meetings. For example  in preparation for the coming G-20 Summit in Seoul  the 3G Group had several meetings with senior Korean officials  including their G-20 “Sherpa”  to convey some of our views and concerns.  A major concern of the countries of the Group is development. In this regard  we have prepared inputs to be submitted to the G-20 working group on development. It is good that both Korea as the current Chair of the G-20 and France as the incoming Chair are pushing development on the agenda.  Let us be clear at the outset that development is not principally about aid. Whether a people is able to lift itself from the depths of poverty depends more on internal than external factors. Good governance is  of course  paramount. Investing in the inherent potential of citizens and creating a favourable environment for that potential to be realized are central to good governance. We would like to commend President    10-55264 18  Deiss on his decision to make “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance” the theme of this General Assembly. It is most timely.  A critical element in good governance is education. With education  individuals are able to acquire the information and knowledge they need to add value to the world. Aid that helps a people to build up its internal strength is valuable. Aid that creates dependency is harmful. With education  a citizenry is more able to insist on democratic safeguards against the abuse of power and corruption. Taking full advantage of globalization and information technology  we can now spread education into remote corners of the world.  One of the most important developments in the world today is the widespread availability of cheap mobile phones  often with built-in cameras. Mobile phones have altered traditional power relationships everywhere where they are available. No longer can individuals be kept ignorant and exploited for long  because they have alternatives. As smart phones fall in price — which they are bound to do — social networking infrastructures like Facebook  which already has half a billion users in the world  will radically change the world we live in. Without being planned for or financed by any national Government  Facebook is arguably the most important social infrastructure in the world today. It is an astonishing phenomenon. Yet  it is only one wave of many more waves to come.  Whether we like it or not  the revolution in technology — not only information technology but also in genetics  material science and other fields — will cause the creative destruction that many politicians dread. Communities and Governments that work with technological change will surge ahead  while those fighting change will be left behind. In this new age  those who are wedded to dogma and ideology become stuck in the past. Therefore  when we talk about development  the key is education.  We must make sure that basic conditions are met  that children are fed and healthy and that no group is discriminated against on the basis of ethnicity  religion or gender. The knowledge needed for development is already available in the world  and delivery systems can be readily put into place.  Unfortunately  there are many obstacles impeding the flow of knowledge. Protectionism is a major obstacle. It slows the spread of education and knowledge. Throughout history  every time a new trade route is established  knowledge flows along it  enabling the relatively backward to catch up. Our inability to move the Doha Development Agenda forward is particularly injurious to LDCs.  An important way to help communities acquire more knowledge and use information better is to foster the growth of liveable cities. To develop  countries have to urbanize  and in the coming decades large parts of the world will be urbanized on every continent. China during Mao Zedong’s time was 20 per cent urban. Today  it is almost half urban. In 20 years’ time it will reach the same level of urbanization as Taiwan or countries like Korea and Japan  which are over 90 per cent urban.  Urbanization as an organic process of development can be healthy or unhealthy. Cities can be energy-efficient  knowledge-intensive centres of production  education and sustainable living  or they can be hellholes festering with poor education  unemployment  inequality  crime and pollution. Because of the specific challenges that we had to overcome in our own development  Singapore has been promoting the sharing of urban developmental experiences as a practical way to help countries develop in areas such as public administration  low-cost housing  water management  transportation planning and better logistics. Developing countries that are urbanizing rapidly — and they have to do so in order to develop — should not have to repeat the mistakes of those who have gone before them.  All of us have a vested interest in the growth of liveable cities in the third world. For example  carbon emissions cannot be reduced without healthy urbanization. We hope that fostering liveable cities will become a major objective of the G-20 countries. The best form of aid we can provide is knowledge and training. Two years ago  Singapore signed an agreement with the World Bank to establish an urban hub for the dissemination of knowledge about liveable cities.  A basic requirement for healthy urban development is good water management  which has become a major challenge in various parts of the world. We should do much more to learn from one another’s experiences  especially in the face of growing weather volatility. Last Friday  Slovenia convened a   19 10-55264  Green Group meeting involving a small group of countries to discuss the subject of water management  which we hope will be given more attention in the future.  Despite the concerns about the global economy  never before have the prospects of bringing development into every continent been so promising. This is not to say that outcomes will be equalized. Human beings as individuals and in groups are competitive by nature  and we must expect that some will do better than others at any point in time. Indeed  by learning from the successes and mistakes of front-runners  human communities often leapfrog over one another  and this is a historical process. Competition  however  should be conducted in a civilized way and within an overall global framework and value system that recognizes our global humanity and destiny."
"151",6228,"SLB",65,2010,"It is indeed an honour for me to congratulate you  Sir  on behalf of the Government and people of Solomon Islands  as President of the General Assembly at our sixty-fifth session. Your term in office coincides with economic turmoil  the impacts of climate change  growing social and security concerns and threats of unilateralism that are challenging multilateralism from all fronts. My delegation is pleased with the manner in which you have convened and concluded three high-level meetings  on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  biodiversity and the Mauritius Strategy. That is a clear indication of why we are confident in you and of your vast experience as you oversee this principal body of the United Nations for the next 12 months.  My delegation takes this opportunity to acknowledge as well the leadership and contributions of your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki. His support for multilateralism has placed us on firm footing in preparing for this session.  We see around us the growth of democracy  corporate power and the emergence of new powers  all offering new perspectives and opportunities. New international cooperation is linking development  finance  raw materials and markets. That development calls for increased collaboration and a new framework to facilitate the emergence of a new economic order. Solomon Islands  under its new foreign policy  will establish relationships with all six regions of the United Nations.  Solomon Islands believes in multilateralism and acknowledges the importance and value of having a closer working relationship between the United Nations and Member States. My Government stands ready and committed to work with the United Nations in enhancing its presence in my capital. In that connection  we renew our call to upgrade the United Nations Sub-office in Honiara and appoint a resident representative as its head.  My delegation acknowledges United Nations outreach to Solomon Islands this year by convening the   33 10-55128  United Nations national competitive recruitment exam in December. We welcome that engagement  as it provides an opportunity for successful citizens to fill our national quota of international civil servants serving our family of nations.  Democracy is one of the core principles of the United Nations Charter. People continue to be the source of the legitimacy of this Organization and remain the basis of authority of this Assembly.  Solomon Islands registers its appreciation of the Secretariat’s Department of Political Affairs and the United Nations Development Programme for their role in coordinating some 400 local and international observers who monitored last month’s general election. We are equally pleased to note the positive pronouncement by the various local and international monitors that Solomon Islands’ national election was conducted in a free and fair manner. A number of electoral reform recommendations were made  and my Government will act on them with a view to improving our national electoral system.  The essence of progress and prosperity lies in having a clear and firm leadership  an obedient bureaucracy and a sense of vision. My Government is committed to providing those  and we will work tirelessly to offer our people a life of normality  dignity and freedom.  The challenge of nation-building is huge and costly for any developing country. For that reason  each country has to define for itself the type and form of democracy it wants to adopt  for democracy cannot be imposed. In that connection  Solomon Islands continues to advocate genuine dialogue and engagement with Fiji over confrontations and sanctions and to support Fiji’s effort to determine its destiny.  Solomon Islands joins the international community in calling for the lifting of the 49-year-old economic embargo against Cuba. Such an embargo belongs to a different time and era. It is our hope that the power of reaching out to our neighbours will break down artificial ideological barriers.  Solomon Islands will be undergoing the universal periodic review during this session. My delegation takes this opportunity to reaffirm the commitment of Solomon Islands to the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter  including respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. Solomon Islands finds it regrettable to see those principles sacrificed by some who continue to divide this Assembly. Solomon Islands recognizes the Geneva-based Human Rights Council and its role and impartiality as the appropriate institution to deal with issues of human rights.  This year marks the seventh anniversary of my country’s relationship with the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). The current partnership framework promotes greater coherence and predictability in enhancing the quality of the cooperation to meet the country’s development needs. The relations between Solomon Islands and RAMSI have brought political and financial stability. However  the underlying causes of conflict remain unaddressed. Issues of tolerance and respect for our diverse cultures have placed much stress on our road to peace. My Government remains committed to addressing those issues.  In June this year  the Foreign Minister of the United Arab Emirates  His Highness Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan  brought together Pacific small island developing States and our Middle East brothers to discuss cooperation  including the Arab Peace Initiative in the Middle East. Solomon Islands supports all peace initiatives  including proposals to normalize relations between the entire Arab region and Israel. The complexity of the Middle East conflict needs a regional solution  and we strongly feel that parties to the conflict will need to sow conditions for peace as we work to have a two-State solution. We are heartened to see negotiations proceeding. However  we would like to see all stakeholders involved in the process.  My delegation welcomes the outcome of this summer’s Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. The existence of nuclear weapons continues to pose a significant threat to humanity. History has shown the deep horror and devastation of nuclear weapons. Solomon Islands supports the total elimination of all nuclear weapons as the only absolute guarantee for a safe and secure world.  The urgency of agreeing to a legally binding agreement on climate change in Cancún  Mexico  cannot be overemphasized. It is a common concern that binds the world together. Our planet is already absorbing more heat and getting warmer. The global temperature has risen by 0.7°C in the past century. Under current trends  science tells us that the    10-55128 34  temperature will further increase by 4 to 7°C by the end of this century  threatening the survival of many States  including Solomon Islands. It is critical that we have a clear plan for stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions. Solomon Islands supports the call of the small island developing States to restrict the temperature rise to below 1.5°C and to bring down greenhouse gas concentration to well below 350 parts per million.  Noting that there is limited atmospheric carbon space left  a carbon-budget approach is an option for a just and fair way to prevent the global temperature from reaching irreversible levels. It takes into consideration the development needs and space concerns of developing countries and our shared responsibilities and rights in meeting the demands of the health of our atmosphere.  On the issue of United Nations system-wide coherence  the General Assembly in July established a new gender entity  UN Women. That body will further strengthen United Nations capacity and effectiveness in advancing the status of women worldwide. Solomon Islands looks forward to cooperating with the new entity.  As regards Security Council reform  my delegation is pleased to see informal intergovernmental negotiations carried forward into this session. Negotiations are now focused on a common text  which we hope will be further streamlined in achieving our goal of making that principal United Nations organ more representative  efficient and responsive to the emerging global threats of this century.  The Pacific Ocean covers a third of the world’s surface and accounts for a quarter of the world’s tuna industry. In May this year  eight Pacific small island developing States  including Solomon Islands  set up the secretariat of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) in the Marshall Islands. The PNA countries agreed to coordinate the management and conservation of their tuna resources  so as to guarantee sustainability and greater economic benefits from their resources. The closing off of the high seas pockets within the respective countries’ exclusive economic zones is to prevent illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing and to provide a safe haven for fish to breed.  On the issue of the establishment of a regional marine scientific centre  in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  my delegation is pleased to note that the matter is reflected in the Secretary-General’s report. The Pacific subregion values such a centre  which my Government offers to host. We will pursue this regionally and internationally  in the spirit of the Convention and the Mauritius Strategy Initiative.  This year Papua New Guinea  the Federated States of Micronesia and Solomon Islands made a presentation on our joint submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. We hope to do the same with our remaining submissions at an appropriate time.  Solomon Islands is encouraged by the further growth of positive developments and engagements with regard to the Taiwan Strait. That must be internationally recognized  commended and supported. The moderate and pragmatic path adopted by both the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan about the Taiwan Strait contributes to international peace and security.  Solomon Islands continues to support Taiwan’s meaningful participation within the United Nations system. My delegation is heartened to note Taiwan’s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly in both 2009 and 2010. That is a gesture of the improved cross-Strait relations. Taiwan has registered its interest in participating in two United Nations treaty organizations this year: the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International Civil Aviation Organization. My country supports such participation. The two organizations deal with two global issues that are of common concern to all the world. Climate change and aviation issues need the participation of all countries for aviation safety and the health of our atmosphere. My delegation finds it regrettable that the UNFCCC secretariat has adopted a narrow position on a matter that requires the parties to the Convention and to the Kyoto Protocol to decide on.  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are internationally agreed development benchmarks. The Solomon Islands scorecard remains mixed  uneven and generally off track in terms of meeting our 2015 Goals. The international programme for the Solomon Islands for achieving the MDGs is defined in the Mauritius Strategy and the Brussels Programme of Action. Both frameworks outline the Solomon Islands’ special   35 10-55128  situation  one that requires special international attention.  The review of the Mauritius Strategy held last week revealed that international commitments to the Barbados Programme of Action remain wanting and disappointing. The vulnerability of small island developing States (SIDS) has worsened. To address this partnership gap  Solomon Islands calls for a special category for SIDS within the United Nations system. There is also a need for a firmer link between the SIDS Programme and the United Nations Development Assistance Framework  to ensure that support is received from within our Organization.  This session will also see the convening of the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  in May 2011. We are equally pleased that the General Assembly launched a process of national  regional and global reviews during the last session. We look forward to working with all in achieving a comprehensive  action-oriented and meaningful outcome to the Conference. My delegation wishes to acknowledge our new partners Luxembourg and Portugal  for their support  respectively  for the Melanesian Spearhead Group and Solomon Islands external students. We remain grateful to all partners from the South and North  including Cuba  Italy  Papua New Guinea  Taiwan and our traditional partners the European Union  Australia  New Zealand  Japan and my regional neighbours.  In conclusion  I would like to assure the President of the support and cooperation of the Solomon Islands during his term in office."
"152",6274,"SLE",65,2010,"Once again  it is a great honour and pleasure for me to address this distinguished Assembly. Let me start by congratulating Mr. Joseph Deiss on his assumption of the presidency at the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly and assuring him of my delegation’s full support and cooperation. I would also like to convey my sincere appreciation to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  for his efficient and effective conduct of the previous session. My gratitude also goes to the Secretary-General for his comprehensive account of the work of the United Nations and his analysis of the challenges facing our global community.  In my statement I would like to talk both about the successes that my country has achieved with the help of the international community and about the reforms we now need to make in the way we interact and govern ourselves globally. My Government is sincerely grateful for the international community’s engagement with Sierra Leone’s efforts to put the country on a path to sustained economic growth and development. Building on this engagement  our country has significantly improved our international standing in many areas.  The Global Peace Index now ranks Sierra Leone as the fifty-third most peaceful country in the world. The Mo Ibrahim Index records that we are one of the five crisis-affected countries that have made a significant leap forward in democratic governance. A recent International Monetary Fund review shows improvement in our public finances  with our 4 per cent annual economic growth rate higher than the average rate of 2 per cent for sub-Saharan Africa. We have also made steady progress in our rankings on doing business  corruption perception and democracy. In addition  earlier this year I was the proud recipient on behalf of the people of Sierra Leone of a peace prize awarded by ACCORD  the African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes. And only last week my country received a Millennium Development Goal Award for showing outstanding leadership in the fight against HIV/AIDS  malaria and other diseases.  My Government has also continued to emphasize the protection of the basic rights of the people of Sierra Leone. We have put in place comprehensive justice sector reforms in response to both national and global demands  to ensure that the rights of citizens are preserved  and that they have access to justice for all. And the Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone   39 10-54833  has assumed a lead role in advising my Government on building a culture of human rights. It ensures that the Government ratifies international treaties and protocols and fulfils its reporting obligations. A case in point is our recent validation of the common core document that forms the basis for all reporting on international treaties.  Sierra Leone is among the few countries emerging from conflict that have formulated a comprehensive action plan for Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008). My Government is determined to ensure effective implementation of the action plan  particularly in addressing gender-based violence as well as enhancing women’s participation in politics and the public sector.  My Government’s commitment to free media is equally strong. No journalist has been imprisoned in my country since I assumed office. We have transformed the Government-owned broadcasting services into what is only the second independent public service broadcaster in Africa  the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon witnessed the launch of this historic  groundbreaking initiative in June. It is the beginning of a new era of access to independent  unbiased and impartial information in our country.  My Government is also delivering results on the key priorities in my Agenda for Change to improve the lives of all Sierra Leoneans. We have launched free health care for pregnant and lactating women  as well as children under five  for the first time in our history  improving access to around 300 000 women and more than a million children. We have also begun the serious commercialization of agriculture  the mainstay of our economy  particularly through smallholder farmers  for whom we are facilitating improved mechanization  irrigation and the establishment of farming cooperatives. We have successfully made significant progress on road construction and the rehabilitation of electricity supply in key provincial cities and towns  to generate economic activity across the country. We have made great strides in attracting large-scale private sector investors from international companies  following the Sierra Leone Trade and Investment Forum in London last year. Furthermore  to maintain macroeconomic stability and make those achievements sustainable  my Government also remains firmly committed to the fight against corruption.  Despite that progress  many challenges remain. I am proud of what Sierra Leone has achieved so far. But we need to further enhance our capacity to promote and protect human rights  establish good governance and managerial capacity across the whole public sector and fight corruption and trafficking in narcotic drugs. For all that  our country will need further technical assistance and cooperation  private capital investments and technology transfer.  Most importantly  we are not oblivious to the imperative of consolidating peace through enhanced political dialogue  tolerance and ensuring a free and fair electoral process. With those elements and our political resolve  we will make further progress towards peace  security and a stable and open democracy.  I shall now turn to the theme of the Assembly’s sixty-fifth session: reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance. It could not have been better timed  at a moment when the global community is grappling with myriad challenges facing the international system. The end of the cold war  together with an explosion in information and communication technologies  gave rise to a new paradigm of flexible or loose functional coalitions involving State and non-State actors. A new configuration of interdependent relationships  economic  social  political and ethnic in nature  has emerged from those historic circumstances.  There are fears that globalization nurtures the dominance of power politics  a growing disparity between the North and the South  intolerance of different values  a tendency to resort to force to solve international conflicts  and neglect of the environment. At the same time  globalization has led to a multilevel system of governance that is beginning to address global issues ranging from economic interdependence  migration  financial crises and drug trafficking to the pandemics of tuberculosis  avian flu  HIV/AIDS and malaria.  It is in recognition of the imperative to promote multilateralism and build synergies with both State and non-State actors that I commend the choice of theme. We support the United Nations more than any other organization as a centre of global governance. It has the unique characteristics of a global mandate and universal membership. Those characteristics make it an indispensable and neutral catalyst for the achievement    10-54833 40  of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural or humanitarian character. The centrality of the role of the United Nations in global governance cannot be overemphasized.  The recently concluded High-level Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals revealed that progress has been uneven and that developing countries  particularly those in Africa  continue to be most vulnerable to the effects of globalization. The prevailing global recession resulting from the economic and financial crisis that struck developed economies has further compounded that challenge. In this context  my Government believes that the United Nations remains the crucial hub for norm-setting and harmonizing the actions of nations for the maintenance of international peace and security and for the attainment of our development goals.  The Assembly  meeting at the turn of the millennium  decided that reforming the Security Council and making it more accessible  transparent  equitably representative and accountable was long overdue. That brings me to the crucial issue that has led us in Africa to consistently reiterate that there can be no meaningful reform of the Council without allocating permanent seats to the continent.  No one continent should have an exclusive monopoly over membership of the Security Council. There is no justification for a discriminatory allocation of seats  nor can we debate endlessly and ignore the realities of our rapidly changing global circumstances.  While the fifth round of talks has not truly led to a compromise-oriented solution  distilling all positions into a single negotiating document has been a significant step in the right direction. We in Africa look forward to and support a process that will allow the text to evolve during the next session of the General Assembly in an open  inclusive and balanced manner  towards a solution that can garner the widest possible political acceptance by Member States. We urge all delegations to muster the political will required for progress.  I wish to conclude my statement by saying that the moment has come for us to address the historical injustice inflicted on Africa by allocating the continent no less than two seats  with all their attributes and privileges  and two additional seats in both the non-permanent and permanent categories of the Council. I do not need to emphasize that at the inception of the United Nations  most of Africa was not represented and that as a result Africa remains to this day the only continent without a permanent seat in the Council. To ensure greater relevance of the Security Council within a revamped United Nations system  Africa demands permanent representation on the Security Council  with all the requisite attributes."
"153",6321,"SLV",65,2010,"It is an honour and a great responsibility to address the   21 10-54965  Assembly today. It is a responsibility because we need to make the right analysis of the serious problems we face and  in my particular case  of the difficult reality in my country. El Salvador is one of many nations on this planet beset by the problems of poverty  backwardness and  above all  injustice. The more a leader is weighed down by the tragedy of his people  the greater the responsibility  as we know well.  When the Assembly reviews the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the struggle against poverty in the world  and we look at the reality in Central America  we can say that the efforts made have not yet yielded the expected results. It is not easy for me to be so blunt in my assessment  but that is the reality and the international community must be sensitive to the plight of the vast majority of the world’s population. For many years now  the agenda of the United Nations and other multilateral forums has included the struggle against poverty. The hoped-for improvements  however  cannot be discerned. As far as social justice is concerned  far from achieving the desired progress  the gap between rich and poor countries  and between the rich and poor within individual countries  has widened. Injustice has prevailed over our good intentions. That is the truth.  The recent massacre in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas of 72 migrants  of whom 14 have been identified as Salvadorans — and we continue to try to identify others — reveals the magnitude of the tragedy that  while centred on Mexico and Central America  affects the whole world. Those 72 murdered desperate young men and women  who lost their lives trying to find a future in the United States or Canada  are an expression of the tragedy in the region  as well as a metaphor for global injustice. This tragedy was not the result of a plane crash or climate change. It was the result  essentially  of three factors that point to the lack of positive results in the fight against poverty and injustice.  I am referring first to the lack of opportunities  exclusion  backwardness and widespread injustice that affect Central American societies and account for the mass emigration of their young people. The second is that of migration  a consequence of the first. The third is violence  crime and the shadow business of organized crime  which exploits the breeding ground of poverty and the transit of dispossessed migrants for its illicit purposes.   El Salvador has 6 million inhabitants in its territory and 3 million more living elsewhere  mainly in the United States. Migration has grown year by year in the wake of Governments’ lack of response to the aforementioned problems. Our migrants — indeed  the migrants of the entire world — leave their civil rights behind when they leave their country and arrive in new lands that do not recognize those rights. As experts on migration have said  the migrant is a pariah  a human being without rights. For the more than 200 million migrants around the world  mostly young people  human and social rights  such as those embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  are not guaranteed. Another reality in our region is the very high incidence of violence against women  which also calls for our special attention.  We note the close relationship between poverty  injustice and migration. Furthermore  another  closely related factor in our region is the strong presence of organized crime and the extremely high incidence of violence and criminality. We can say without exaggeration that the map of poverty and injustice is the same as the map of migration; of the traffic in drugs  humans and weapons; civic insecurity; money-laundering and crime on a major scale.  I mentioned the lack of positive results in fighting poverty and injustice on a global scale  especially in Central America. I will now offer an example of the failure of policies implemented in my country over the past decade. According to a report of the United Nations Development Programme  the wealthiest segment of the population in El Salvador received 23 per cent of the State’s social spending. The lowest segment — the poor and marginal population — received only 18 per cent of that social spending. The State actually promoted and expanded injustice and contributed to greater poverty. It is obvious that the neoliberal policies implemented in recent decades have run counter to the desire of the international community to reduce poverty  as expressed in the Millennium Development Goals.  Let us therefore keep in mind the wise words of Albert Einstein  who said that an insane person is he who does the same thing over and over again and expects different results. I am not speaking of my country alone. I believe that everyone has to undertake profound changes in the way social policies are designed in order not to perpetuate failure. It would be naïve  for example  to think that a coercive  repressive    10-54965 22  State that invests more and more in its security forces or that mobilizes its army to support the police to combat crime — as I have ordered done in El Salvador  given the rise in crime that I inherited upon assuming office — can in and of itself resolve the problem of insecurity. We would be making a historic mistake if we did not address the root causes of violence and crime. The indolent State that has prevailed in recent times must be transformed into a social State that wages as its chief battle the reduction of poverty and injustice.  In this regard  I would like to lay out some thoughts based on that reality. First  the righteous battle against organized crime and on behalf of the human rights of migrants does not fall exclusively to Mexico and Central America. Here  I would like to say that we must not leave it to Mexico or to Central America alone. Our region is not the main consumer of drugs. Our countries are not the major recipients of the uninterrupted flow of laundered drug money  the product of the failure of stricter controls. It is not only our people who will be hurt if the drug cartels continue to grow stronger and to endanger our countries’ survival. This battle is not irrelevant to anyone. It would be a mistake to believe that Mexico and Central America can defeat crime alone. The territory of criminal violence today is the border between the United States and our small countries  but tomorrow it will be in the major cities of the developed world  the capitals of America  Europe  Africa and Asia. So let us not leave it to Mexico alone  and let us not leave it to Central America alone.  This is my appeal to the international community. The help our countries need is economic; it is intelligence; it is support for training and equipping our law-and-order forces to combat crime and control money-laundering. But we also need help with the new social and regional policies that the Central American Integration System has prepared  because those investments will address the causes of our tragedies.   For these reasons  I wish to bring two proposals to the General Assembly. First  we should establish  under the auspices of the United Nations  a Central American commission to investigate organized crime. The establishment of such a body would be based on the good experience of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala known as CICIG  which was established with the support of the United Nations  the United States  Canada and Spain. Such a commission would no doubt contribute to strengthening institutions. We must recognize that State organizations have been infiltrated by organized crime and that all means must be made available to recover them and to wage the war against crime.  My proposal is based on an implicit acknowledgement of the obvious truth that organized crime does not recognize borders or respect States. Our response must therefore also transcend these boundaries; our response must be integration. Until the establishment of such a commission  my country shall work along these lines and has launched dialogue and action with neighbouring countries with a view to coordinating policies to prevent and punish crime.   My second proposal concerns the establishment of an international alliance to support the priorities of regional integration  which are the fight against poverty and inequality and the creation of opportunities that will allow our populations to stay in their communities of origin.  Central Americans understand this  and are willing to give battle to poverty  exclusion  and organized crime. To that end  we have started joint work by relaunching our integration organization  the Central American Integration System. Central Americans are striving to create strong  democratic and just societies. In the specific case of El Salvador  my Government is moving forward with the building of a social State that reformulates social policy  taking into account the failure of past mechanisms that I mentioned earlier.  Gangs have become veritable criminal organizations coordinated with organized crime. We shall not overcome this reality with mere assistance policies or improvements in the standards of living. This phenomenon is found among young people who  from earliest childhood and adolescence  join gangs  and is so widespread that gangs have become a complex subculture. Our response must be equally so.  Within the framework of a social State  we must deepen democracy and strengthen republican institutions. We know that corruption is one of the worst enemies of the democratic system; therefore  working for transparency has become a fundamental aspect of our national and regional strategies.   Throughout Central America  this struggle is a matter not only of ethics  but also of democratic   23 10-54965  survival. In other words  we must oppose the potential emergence of a drug State by building strongly democratic and transparent States. It has been proven that the more corruption there is  the less economic development there is. Corruption poisons public policies  especially those that assist the poor; it reduces citizens’ trust in their system and makes markets inefficient.  My Government has created a specialized body to fight corruption. The Under Secretariat of Transparency and Anti-Corruption is the first body in America to submit itself to the in situ control by the Inter-American Program of Cooperation to Fight Corruption of the Organization of American States  and has been commended as such. According to the Government of the United States  El Salvador is also the Central American country with the best performance in fighting organized crime and drug trafficking. Thus  it is not on the high-risk map which that Government has just published. Without transparent institutions  strong and independent institutions and without a true vocation to fighting organized crime  it will not be possible to meet the great challenges before us.   We are waging a war. It is a new war unlike those of the past. We are not waging it against another nation or standing army. We are facing a powerful  sophisticated  diffuse enemy that has blended in with our society  and we must fight it with new weapons  creativity  intelligence  and the cooperation of our societies and the global community. Only thus will our efforts be commensurate with the circumstances. Only thus will we be able to meet today’s challenges. Only thus will we provide sound responses to the needs of the majority of our peoples  who await opportunities to believe once again in democracy  institutions and politics.   Once again  I appeal to the conscience and sensibility of the international community. In conclusion  I wish to do so by quoting President John F. Kennedy’s 1961 inaugural speech  which reflects what I have tried to convey today. He said that “if a free society cannot help the many who are poor  it cannot save the few who are rich”."
"154",6346,"SMR",65,2010,"I wish to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We are confident that your considerable expertise in the field of foreign policy and economics will be decisive for the success of all sectors of United Nations activity. I also wish to thank the outgoing President  His Excellency Ali Abdussalam Treki  for the excellent work carried out during the Assembly’s sixty-fourth session.  I would like to express special thanks to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his energy and extraordinary determination in leading this Organization. In particular  San Marino appreciates the interest he has shown towards all Member countries  without any distinction  regardless of their size. My Government has particularly appreciated the Secretary-General’s commitment in the field of reforms and his constant presence in all international politically relevant situations and in emergency situations. His presence in Haiti and Pakistan in the days following the terrible events that we all witnessed demonstrates not only the determination to affirm United Nations presence during crises  but also a personal and particular sensitivity towards tragedies deeply affecting people.  At a time characterized by major global challenges that the international community is called upon to face  the United Nations reform process   29 10-55122  becomes fundamental for future world stability and must remain the target of all our efforts. We have the duty to guarantee the full effectiveness of the Organization’s activities  with a view to preserving and strengthening its essential value as a point of reference for the international community and for any individual. We cannot afford to see the role of the United Nations weakened through inability to reach agreement on the measures to be taken to improve its functioning.  I have the pleasure to reiterate again this year the support San Marino grants to the revitalization process of the General Assembly. In that regard  I wish to thank Argentina and Slovenia  Co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the revitalization of the General Assembly  for the Group’s recently approved report (A/64/903)  which is the outcome of considerable efforts and many informal meetings with the States Members of the United Nations.  This reform is particularly important for my country  since the General Assembly is the most democratic body of the United Nations and  as such  the most effective and sometimes the only forum where a small State can express its opinions. San Marino therefore hopes that through this reform  the Assembly may work more efficiently and improve its relations with the other main bodies of the United Nations to avoid duplication of activities and effectively implement its resolutions.  The Republic of San Marino has been following with interest the Security Council reform process since 1994  and it is grateful to the Afghan Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations on Council reform for the important work he has carried out this year and for the wisdom and impartiality with which he has presided over negotiations aimed at reaching the broadest possible agreement. San Marino believes that the reform should lead to a more democratic  responsible  transparent and efficient Security Council. The reform should also bring about a more balanced relationship between the Security Council and the General Assembly  as well as more effective cooperation with the Secretariat. Those objectives can be achieved only through a permanent dialogue among States and increased flexibility in the respective positions.  I wish to congratulate you  Mr. President  on the choice of the theme for this year’s session — the role of the United Nations in global governance. That is a particularly complex subject  since it concerns the global threats that affect the destinies of our peoples in an increasingly direct way: climate change and biodiversity  the economic  financial and employment crises  food security  public health  disarmament and the proliferation of weapons  and the fight against terrorism.  Today  the theme of global governance is inevitably linked to a new way of conceiving multilateralism and to a new form of international cooperation  one that acknowledges the interdependence of the problems we face at the international  national and regional levels. We have learned from the crises of the last few years that it is necessary to adopt an integrated and comprehensive approach  more efficient mechanisms for coordinating our policies  and a global and coordinated course of action.  San Marino believes that the United Nations has a duty to be at the core of that process and to play a leading role in managing global governance  not only because of its deeply democratic nature  with universal participation and undisputed legitimacy  but also because — thanks to the richness and diversity of cultures and traditions represented here — it can adopt an approach that harmonizes the interests of the entire international community and aims at sustainable development for all peoples.  Last year  the world economy suffered a devastating financial crisis  the consequences of which are still evident to all. Today  unemployment has reached extremely high levels in many countries. Increases in the prices of food products and persistent inequalities contribute to higher poverty rates and cause high social tensions and violence. The global economic and financial crisis has severely hit every country in the world  with no distinctions  thus becoming one of today’s major challenges for our Organization as well. Some have been able to withstand the crisis  while for many others it is unfortunately still a very immediate problem  influencing all decisions.  Despite the gradual recovery of the global economy this year  it is fundamental that we always coordinate policies  and coordinate them effectively  with a view to guaranteeing balanced  inclusive and substantial growth. In that regard  San Marino recognizes the essential role played by the Group of 20 (G-20)  which in 2009 was able to prevent a global    10-55122 30  economic depression by taking coordinated and timely action. However  the G-20 decision-making process should be even more inclusive and transparent  so that its decisions can translate into effective action at the global level. That requires developing specific mechanisms through which the interests  concerns and aspirations of countries outside the G-20 can be taken into account  with particular reference to developing countries  in order to favour G-20 actions complementary to those of the United Nations.  Over the last two years  the Republic of San Marino  well aware of the interconnectedness of global economic and financial policies  has intensified its efforts to make its legislative instruments and practices relating to transparency and international cooperation compliant with international standards established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and MONEYVAL. Within a short period  laws to combat money-laundering and terrorist financing were adopted  banking and financial supervision services were reorganized and amendments were made to company legislation  eliminating anonymous companies.  The San Marino Government expresses its satisfaction with resolution 64/289  on United Nations system-wide coherence  which the General Assembly unanimously adopted on 2 July. That resolution  the result of year-long negotiations  is an historic achievement for the reform process of the United Nations  in particular for strengthening the entire system. It provides for a higher degree of coordination  efficiency and transparency  while avoiding fragmentation  waste  duplication of tasks and effort.  A fundamental element of that resolution is the establishment of the new United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women  to be known as UN Women  which will become operational on 1 January 2011. The mandates of four existing bodies concerned with the promotion of women’s rights will be transferred to this new entity  which will strengthen  in terms of capability  efficiency and responsibility  the United Nations system in the field of gender equality and the empowerment of women.  The Republic of San Marino pays special attention to this subject and over the last few years has promoted several national initiatives making women in San Marino aware of their rights and of the State protection mechanisms available to them. At the international level  San Marino has joined several campaigns aimed at raising awareness of women’s rights among the public and national authorities  such as the Unite to End Violence Against Women campaign  launched by the Secretary-General in 2008.  I would like to underline on this occasion the fundamental importance of the efforts of the international community  as well as pressure exerted by civil society  to achieve higher standards of human rights protection. Moreover  we cannot forget that women and children are always the most vulnerable section of society in situations where rights and fundamental freedoms are violated. In several countries  women have to face very difficult situations: many of their rights are often violated and the authors of the violations go unpunished. The international community must spare no effort to ensure that the dignity  rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings are duly protected.  San Marino also believes that the international community should be responsible for working as effectively as possible to combat human trafficking. Today that modern form of slavery still affects millions of people  the majority of whom are also women and children. The Republic of San Marino attaches the utmost importance to the adoption last July of resolution 64/293  which contains the United Nations Global Plan of Action against Trafficking in Persons.  The collective commitment to combating trafficking in persons led to the adoption of that resolution  the result of long consultations and complex negotiations. San Marino guarantees its support for this initiative and will cooperate with all Member States in order to implement the Plan of Action. This initiative is particularly important to us  since this year we ratified the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime  its Protocol to Prevent  Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons  Especially Women and Children  and its Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land  Sea and Air.  As underlined in the Secretary-General’s report “Keeping the promise” (A/64/665)  the Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals have brought about a slow but progressive improvement in the fight against extreme poverty  hunger and disease and in the promotion of gender equality  education and environmental sustainability.   31 10-55122  However  the report outlines that progress has been discontinuous and uneven from one region to another.  We have recently witnessed a series of severe and unprecedented crises  including the world economic and financial crisis  the food and energy crisis  the one related to climate change  humanitarian crises — including the recent earthquake in Haiti and the huge floods in Pakistan — and those caused by the increased number of conflicts. After having obtained good results  we are now experiencing a severe setback  and an even more structured commitment will be necessary to overcome those obstacles and achieve the Goals by 2015.  The Republic of San Marino expresses its satisfaction with the General Assembly’s High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals  which recently concluded. The outcome document of that meeting (resolution 65/1) aims at developing effective strategies for action and  most of all  at renewing the commitment and responsibility of each country to achieving the Goals set.  In conclusion  I would like to reiterate the strong commitment of the Republic of San Marino in favour of the implementation of the ideals of the United Nations and of the principles enshrined in its Charter. We will guarantee our support to all initiatives necessary to reach such an aim."
"155",6383,"SOM",65,2010,"On the grand occasion of the general debate of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly  I congratulate the new President of the Assembly  Mr. Joseph Deiss  who is known for his political skills and wise leadership. I would also like to extend my appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  for the able manner in which he led our work.

I further thank the Secretary-General for his strong and genuine interest in and commitment to addressing the critical international issues facing the world  and Somalia in particular.  This annual gathering brings together world leaders and their representatives in order to highlight positive and praiseworthy accomplishments and developments  and to identify common global challenges  emerging problems and their causes  and consequently to discuss and seek appropriate solutions for them.  This meeting comes at a critical moment  when our contemporary world faces a series of challenges ranging from economic crises to natural disasters and bloody wars that threaten international peace and stability  as well as other international issues that require timely resolutions and serious work from the    10-55103 18  General Assembly to design strategies to avoid them in the future.  In our world today  known for its technological advancement and modern science  we are confronted by many challenges resulting from climate change  global warming and their effects  such as devastating floods  drought  forest fires  landslides  desertification  earthquakes  snow storms and so on. Such environmental problems have occurred recently in many countries  including the violent floods in Pakistan and China and the destructive forest fires in Russia  alongside other problems worldwide. We feel great compassion for the countries affected by these natural disasters  and we must cooperate with and provide them the assistance they need while we express our grief and condolences for their suffering.  A few centuries ago  the peoples of the world suffered from the horror of colonial slavery  injustice and oppressive cultures in which the strong preyed on the weak  as well as from horrific wars that spared nothing. It was through the collective will of victorious nations around the world that this fine institution was established in 1945 in order to ensure lasting peace and security and to protect human rights  the sovereignty of nations and the rights of people to self-determination  as well as justice  freedom of thought and expression.  However  65 years since its inception  we must ask ourselves whether the world is more secure or nations are more at peace with one another. Has humankind attained its ambition of a good life  development and sustainable prosperity? The answer  clearly  is no. We see destructive wars being fought throughout the world  causing the suffering of millions  as well as the horrors of global terrorism  especially in the developing world.  Somalia is the weaker link in this scenario and therefore suffers from the worst kinds of international terrorism perpetrated  inter alia  by Al-Shabaab  Al-Qaida and the foreign criminal elements supporting them. Al-Qaida boasted of its responsibility for the horrible acts that occurred in Mogadishu on 3 December 2009 at the Benadir University graduation ceremony  where many graduating doctors died at a time when the country needed them most. Professors  ministers  families and guests also died at that ceremony.  Other heinous acts include the explosion at the Muna Hotel  the African Union headquarters in Mogadishu  as well as the explosion in Kampala  Uganda  which killed over 70 innocent people who had come to watch the World Cup match that was then taking place in South Africa.  These beastly massacres carried out by Al-Shabaab and Al-Qaida terrorists turn the stomach of any person with a conscience. This movement carries out such acts in Mogadishu and other Somali cities on a daily basis  in plain public sight and in places of worship  killing Somali civilians  hacking off their limbs  hands and ears and cutting their throats. It has also carried out unspeakable crimes against humanity  such as cutting off the heads of victims and disposing of them somewhere else. It has also committed rape and theft and caused great damage to property.  This movement does not believe in Somalia as a nation and does not support the creation of a national Government in Somalia; rather  it seeks to establish the Horn of Africa as a terrorist hub that is managed by its Al-Qaida partners and whose intention is to wreak havoc on the entire region and the world beyond.  Besides terrorism on land  another type of terrorism — piracy  perpetrated by pirates and extremist movements in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean — threatens navigation and sea trade. Maritime terrorism is no less dangerous than land-based terrorism; many United Nations Member States have had their ships hijacked by pirates who attack merchant or passenger vessels and then blackmail them and demand millions in ransom. While military convoys attempt to protect shipping in the Indian Ocean  they are unable to uproot this ongoing threat or eliminate its root causes.  There is a close connection between those pirates and armed extremist elements in Somalia. Such ships can be destroyed at any time and their crews killed rather than be held for ransom. All of this  again  requires a solution to the problems in Somalia  because the root causes of these problems lie not at sea but on land. No partial solution to the problems of Somalia can succeed no matter how strong and effective it is; only a comprehensive solution of these problems will work. 19 10-55103   I would also like to draw attention to a phenomenon even more dangerous to the Somalis in the long term than piracy. This is illegal fishing and the dumping of toxic waste along the Somali coast  which harm the health of Somalia’s citizens and its environment. We have already begun to see symptoms and illnesses that did not previously exist in Somalia.  One function of the General Assembly is to deal with hotbeds of tension and threats to international peace and security. I therefore appeal to world leaders to stand together in confronting the threat of international terrorism  including Al-Qaida and Al-Shabaab  as well as organized crime. We must eliminate this scourge so that it will not expand and worsen  and bear in mind that any delay or compromise will provide further opportunities for terrorism  prolong its life and allow it to spread. Beyond this  we need to solve the political  economic and social root causes of terrorism locally  regionally and internationally.  After many years of dispute and conflict  the Somali parties met in Djibouti and reached an agreement  endorsed by the international community  that led to the creation of a broad-based national Government that included all the conflicting parties who participated in the Djibouti peace conference. This Government has inherited a heavy burden and many challenges and obstacles  but it has managed to shoulder those responsibilities. However  it continues to wage a bitter struggle against such hostile elements as Al-Qaida and its allies  Al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam.  Here  we should note that the Transitional Federal Government (TFG)  while only in its second year  has managed to counter and repel these enemy attacks and to achieve reconciliation and several agreements with members of Hizbul Islam and Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama’a. Thus the TFG has achieved some success in its goals  especially following its recent ministerial change  which brought in members of Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama’a  who have been assigned important ministerial positions in the new Government. I note that the national reconciliation achieved in Djibouti remains a strategic choice for us  and we reach out to all those who desire peace and security in Somalia.  We have also formed strategic plans in the areas of politics  security and social reform. We must produce a public budget for 2010 that covers economic  political and social affairs and State management expenses  as well as reconstruction. We must rehabilitate Government ministries and institutions and economic structures  such as the central bank  and encourage a free-market economy. We must provide food and humanitarian assistance to the needy and those displaced by river floodings  drought or desertification. This plan has been particularly difficult to implement because the Al-Shabaab movement has blocked the distribution of humanitarian aid and food to the areas it controls  and has raided and stolen from aid organizations and hijacked vehicles carrying food intended for the hungry.  We must further create opportunities to empower young people to play leadership roles  and furnish them with the skills necessary to manage Government institutions. We need to increase the skills and abilities of Government employees and foster a spirit of sacrifice for the homeland and devotion to work and transparency in conducting the country’s business. We must build capacity in the security sector and train police and security forces to protect the Somali people and their independence and territorial integrity. We need to prepare a permanent constitution that can serve as the foundation for law  democracy and the guarantee of basic human freedoms. The constitution will be submitted for a referendum so that it can be applied as soon as possible. We must revitalize our judicial institutions and train judges and legal assistants  as well as reconstruct and rehabilitate support centres such as police stations  criminal courts and prisons. We should create an environment conducive to dialogue  reconciliation  negotiation and collective work  and halt the continuing violence in Somalia  which has lasted more than two decades now  so that peace and security can be restored. Finally  we must end the internal disputes that continue to erupt within our national institutions — for instance  among members of Parliament — and resolve them peacefully.  These are but a few of the issues that we have selected from among the many on which our strategic plans are focused. However  a shortage of funds  resources and expertise hinders the TFG from implementing many of them. From this rostrum  I appeal to the world’s leaders and the international community to continue to come forward to help us stop the bloodshed in Somalia and to provide us with the    10-55103 20  emergency assistance necessary to save our citizens and Government  especially in the following areas.  First  in the field of security  the Somali security forces need to be armed and trained in an effective way so that they are capable of taking the security initiative in their country  and provided with the salaries and health care they need if they are to protect citizens and establish Government authority throughout the country.  Second  the African Union forces in Somalia must be strengthened and reinforced by the addition of new forces.  Third  a military strategy must be designed and implemented by the United Nations  including the dispatch of an international force to Somalia with the purpose of restoring security and stability throughout the country.  Fourth  the Security Council should adopt resolutions aimed at saving Somalia and liberating it from Al-Qaida and any other terrorist movements that conspire against the restoration of peace and security there. On the political front  we would also ask for continued United Nations support for the TFG  allowing it to remain a focal point for reconciliation between the various parties in Somalia and the international community. The TFG should also be given the support it needs to discharge its duties and manage its budget  so that it can stand on its own two feet and carry out its economic projects and extend its authority throughout the country.  Fifth  the Somali Government should be assisted in rebuilding the infrastructure that was destroyed in the civil wars.  Sixth  the international community should participate and assist in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Somali State institutions  such as schools  hospitals and educational centres.  Seventh  the Somali economy must be promoted and its faltering institutions developed.  Finally  I would like to extend my gratitude to the international community for its assiduous efforts to restore peace and stability in Somalia. Nevertheless  I would like to point out that all that has been offered to date is still not commensurate with what Somalia deserves. Somalia is a country that has lost everything  including its State infrastructure. We hope that the international community will assume its humanitarian responsibility towards our country and assist in ending its suffering  which has now entered its twenty-first year. It is also our hope that the international community will fulfil its promises and turn its resolutions and recommendations — past and present — into actual  implementable deeds.  I would especially like to thank the Governments of Uganda and Burundi  which have sent their troops to Somalia to bring peace to the situation there. I would also like to thank the Governments of the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  the European Union and the brotherly Arab States  as well as the African Union  all of which have contributed to security and stability in my country. Our thanks also go to the international and regional organizations  including the United Nations  for their support. We hope that we will all succeed in restoring security and stability very soon because the continued suffering of the Somali people is unacceptable.  In conclusion  I pray to God that the efforts of this session of the General Assembly will be crowned with success and that Somalia will attend the next session having resolved its chronic crisis."
"156",6421,"STP",65,2010,"Allow me to convey to the President and to this noble Assembly the greetings of His Excellency Mr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de Menezes  the President of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe  who cannot attend this meeting for scheduling reasons. Since this is his last term as President on constitutional grounds  President de Menezes would have much liked to participate in this sixty-fifth session in order to personally express his sincere and heartfelt thanks for the support and cooperation of our Organization provided to him during the period of his presidency.  On behalf of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe  which I have the honour to lead  I would like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his election to chair this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. His election is proof that the Member countries of this Organization recognize the contribution that he and his country  Switzerland  have made to the cause of peace and to upholding the noble ideals of freedom  democracy and human rights in the world. We are therefore convinced that he will guide our work with dexterity  clarity and success. We also congratulate him for the relevance of the theme “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance”  which merits the attention of all present here on account of its timeliness.  We salute the very distinguished Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for the efforts  dedication and skill with which he has guided our Organization  despite the enormous political  economic and social challenges that the world is facing  in particular with regard to the issues of peace  international security  underdevelopment  extreme poverty  climate change  food security and the continuation of some regional conflicts. It is our deep conviction that  in order to collectively face such challenges  we must reaffirm and strengthen our confidence in the role of the United Nations in promoting peace and justice in the world.  The defence of multilateralism is of vital importance in seeking solutions based on the principles of the United Nations Charter. The role of the United Nations in preventing and resolving conflicts  promoting peace and supporting development should be bolstered. In that regard  it is vital to strengthen the role of the United Nations  including reforming the system and the Security Council  in order to provide responses that are more consistent with the challenges facing humanity today.  We echo the concerns expressed in this Assembly Hall by the President of Malawi and Chairperson of the African Union in that regard. The consensus to date on the question of Western Sahara leads us to urge the parties involved to continue on the path of dialogue in pursuit of a peaceful settlement of that conflict.  Our global security is vital to the sustainable development of our countries. The international community must be cautious and aware of the risks that the Palestinian conflict could spread and endanger the entire Middle East region and ultimately international peace and security in the larger world.  Sao Tome and Principe welcomes the resumption of the dialogue on the Palestine question and encourages the Government of the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority to continue on that course in the hope that the peoples of Israel and Palestine will live side by side in peace in the future. My country would also like to acknowledge and welcome the personal commitment of President Barack Obama to finding a permanent solution to that conflict.  The world faces other risks  such as transnational crime  piracy and drug trafficking. For us  a small country surrounded by a vast expanse of sea  that is a significant reason for concern. Sao Tome and Principe will therefore continue to pay particular attention to the regional integration organizations to which we belong  as well as to give priority to conflict-prevention  -management and -resolution mechanisms in order to ensure security and peace in Central Africa.  The profound changes taking place in international politics  which are the result of structural changes in the global economy and have important geopolitical implications  have been affecting Sao Tome and Principe in various ways. As a small island    10-55128 44  State  Sao Tome and Principe therefore calls for greater access to various economic opportunities  in particular official development assistance and international investment. Moreover  we support the conclusion of a new international trade agreement on a more equitable and fairer basis  as well as the conclusion of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  We welcome the appointment of Ms. Michelle Bachelet  former President of Chile  to oversee matters relating to women and gender with a view to promoting their participation in global challenges.  At the Millennium Summit in 2000  world leaders committed themselves to creating an environment conducive to development and the eradication of poverty  both nationally and internationally. The adoption of the Millennium Declaration was followed by other international conferences  which  although they reaffirmed the commitment of both the donor community and the countries receiving aid to seek innovative funding sources and alternatives  did not have the desired effect of alleviating world poverty levels. However  it is vital that we create a new spirit of partnership and a better concept of cooperation for development. To that end  there is a need for additional efforts in the area of official development assistance.  The High-level Meeting that has just taken place here in New York is proof of our concern about the benchmarks to be achieved for the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. For our part  the results in the area of education and health are fairly encouraging  particularly when it comes to reducing child mortality and combating HIV/AIDS  malaria and other diseases.  With regard to education for all  our net enrolment rate in the first cycle of primary education — for children aged one to four — is estimated at 98 per cent. Literacy rates in the 15 to 24 age group are high as compared to most African countries  namely  96 per cent for females and 95 per cent for males.  The results in reducing child mortality have been equally encouraging. In 2009  we recorded 38 deaths per 1 000 live births. That is a significant reduction compared with past years. For example  there were 61 per 1 000 live births in 2002. The mortality rate for children under five fell from 138 to 101 deaths per 1 000 live births in 2002  further dropping to 63 in 2009. The number of children immunized against measles has increased substantially  with 84 per cent vaccinated in 2009 as compared to 70 per cent in 2000.  With regard to the prevalence of HIV/AIDS  it is still contained but can spread rapidly. The prevalence rate in the 15 to 24 year age range is 0.7 per cent  but among the total population aged 15 to 49 it is 1.5 per cent. The prevalence rate of malaria has been reduced dramatically  from 478 cases per 1 000 inhabitants in 2002 to about 34 cases in 2009.  It is true that our country has made significant progress in the areas I have mentioned  but we are aware that much more remains to be done in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  Sao Tome and Principe believes that it is our collective responsibility to take measures to address the adverse effects of climate change  although we welcome the political willingness of Member States to continue the process of building the necessary consensus on the various themes discussed at the Copenhagen Summit. We recognize the efforts made at the recent meeting held in Bonn  as well as the prospects for the opening meeting to be held in Mexico.   Sao Tome and Principe expresses its concern at attempts to use nuclear energy for non-peaceful purposes. We hope that those who utilize nuclear energy do so in accordance with existing mechanisms for international regulation and supervision.  Climate change has caused imbalances in the microclimate of our country  with dramatic impact on our domestic production. That poses a threat to the food security of Sao Tome and Principe. The authorities of my country would therefore like to continue to count on the invaluable support and willingness so far expressed by the international community  in general  and in particular by specialized bodies of the United Nations.  I would be remiss if I concluded my statement without addressing the situation along the Taiwan Strait. We recognize the efforts made by both sides along the Strait aimed at reducing political tension and creating a favourable climate that is conducive to peace  security and development in the region. Despite those positive developments — including the signing of an economic treaty regulating trade relations between the two sides  opening up airspace to commercial traffic and promoting stronger links   45 10-55128  between the two peoples — there are still some aspects that must be addressed in order to allow greater involvement by Taiwan in the international community.  We call on Members of the United Nations  and in particular its specialized agencies  to find ways to make possible Taiwan’s greater participation in specialized agencies and other bodies and machinery  such as the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We believe that Taiwan’s participation in those two forums will strengthen both those mechanisms and better serve our common interests.  In consolidating its democratic process  the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe has just conducted yet another elections process  from which a new Government and Assembly have emerged. The new Government  whose programme has just been approved by the National Assembly  has identified four key areas for attention  namely  good governance  credibility and combating corruption; economic growth; national cohesion and organization; and State authority. To achieve those objectives  the Government of Sao Tome and Principe would very much like to count on the continued support of the international community.  We believe that the international community  and in particular the United Nations system  knows how to respond to the new challenges of a changing world by seeking out mechanisms  instruments and policies aimed at promoting international cooperation  innovative partnerships and international solidarity. In that collective effort  I want to reaffirm that Sao Tome and Principe is ready and willing to make its contribution to the realization of the noble principles and objectives that were at the heart of the creation of the United Nations. "
"157",6462,"SUR",65,2010,"On behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Suriname  I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election to preside over this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am pleased to see Switzerland  one of the newest members of the Organization  occupying this high office  especially since his country has a long-standing and constructive record regarding international neutrality and respect for international order. I am convinced that his diplomatic experience  as well as his well-known in-depth knowledge of current international issues  will enable him to successfully discharge the important responsibilities of his office. As one of the Vice-Chairs  Suriname pledges its full support for his work agenda for this session.  I wish to express our appreciation to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his unwavering efforts in steering the Assembly’s work at its sixty-fourth session.  I also pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-Moon  for his leadership and guidance of this Organization throughout the past years of crisis and turbulence.  It is a great honour for me today to address the Assembly  as a leader who recently received a mandate from the Surinamese people to realize sustainable economic and social development through our own efforts and with the support of all friendly nations.  Twenty-seven years ago I had the honour to address the Assembly. I then stated:  “by the same token  we are dismayed by the fact that  in spite of the presence of the Organization on the international scene for almost four decades  its lofty goal of creating an international order based on respect for international law and the peaceful settlement of disputes seems today to be as elusive as ever”. (A/38/PV.28) Today we can conclude that things have not fundamentally changed.  The challenge we face is that of striking a proper balance between full recognition of the sovereignty of the individual Member States of the United Nations and the apparent need for global governance regarding the global issues that endanger the very survival of our planet and its inhabitants. We are not there yet. It has become obvious to Suriname that this balance can be achieved only when participants in the international arena refrain from using military force and/or economic coercion. We have even seen States abuse their own legal system to force their political will on another nation.  Restricting ourselves to the Caribbean region  the Republic of Suriname is deeply concerned about the persistence of the imposition for almost half a century of the economic  commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba with the aim of changing developments of that nation’s political  economic and social road map. Those coercive measures cause unnecessary hardship and have severe effects on the rightful development and well-being of the Cuban people. Suriname therefore joins Member States which since 1992 have consistently been calling in vain for the rejection of the unilaterally imposed embargo against Cuba. As is the case on the national level  the international community will prosper only when all values protected by the rule of law are distributed equally  notwithstanding the asymmetry that characterizes international relations.   13 10-55103   My country finds itself at a crossroads in its history. The electorate gave its leaders a mission to create a society in which everyone participates and everyone shares in what the country has to offer  meeting their basic material means  and in which solidarity prevails. The aim is the creation of a just society in which people can develop themselves to their highest potential and become international role models and leaders in areas in which our society excels. No one will be left behind in this task of nation-building. My Government pledges not to waste  but to protect  our national inheritance and assets for future generations and the world. Moreover  we will seize every opportunity to generate greater national wealth.  We will devote special attention to groups who in the past have had limited scope for development. In this regard  I refer to our indigenous peoples and our countrymen living in tribal communities. Our intention is to gradually break the cycle of their isolation and considerably improve their quality of life.  When we look at the many national challenges facing us  it is clear that our task will not be easy. In almost all sectors of the economy and society we have suffered enormous neglect  and there has been a decline  stagnation and reversal of national growth. As a result  today many segments of our society have become desperate and hopeless. We therefore need a bold new visionary approach to give our people what they justly deserve as co-owners of a nation endowed and blessed with so many riches.  However  we need to overcome two huge challenges that since decolonization have haunted and blighted our national destiny as a people.  First  we must dismantle any lingering remnants of the colonial police State which blocks and obstructs the establishment of a free  democratic  constitutional State based on the pillars of an independent judiciary  a Government free of corruption  a legislature that acts in the interests of the people  and a free and independent press committed to the honest dissemination of information.  Another major challenge that we face is the transformation of our society from an economy which is merely a source of profit for foreign interest groups into one that is based and built on a healthy interdependence. Suriname needs a new national economic approach created by Surinamers and for Surinamers.  We realize that we are part of the global community  which as a result of technology is gradually turning into a global village  fostering intensive relations in both a negative and a positive sense. Despite all the resources and knowledge at our disposal  we are still faced with what seems an insurmountable challenge: to rid the world of extreme poverty  to ensure adequate education for our children  to stem the tide of infectious and other diseases  or to take responsible decisions on environmental sustainability. We have to recognize that with today’s interdependence many challenges transcend national borders and that the ability of countries  in particular developing countries  to make progress on many of the international development goals does not merely depend on domestic policy choices. An international enabling environment in this regard is of increased significance.  Climate change is a global threat that will affect developing countries in a most devastating way. Suriname  with its low-lying coast  belongs to the top 10 countries which will be seriously affected by sea-level rise. This is ironic  because we are not culpable for the excessive levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  but we are about to bear a heavy part of the brunt.  According to the United Nations Environment Programme  global biodiversity loss is high  so high that 2010 has been declared the International Year of Biodiversity by the United Nations in order to attract attention to this global problem. In this respect  Suriname could serve as an example for the world  as its laws to save forest and biodiversity date from the middle of the past century. We are proud to state here today that Suriname is rightly called the greenest country on Earth for its 90 per cent forest cover.  That having been said  it is ironic that a country such as Suriname  with such a good environmental track record  is overlooked and that the world’s efforts are concentrated on countries that are using their resources unsustainably  thereby sending the wrong message globally. We believe that we should tackle this problem head on  starting at home  moving towards our immediate neighbours and from there to the subregion of South America and the Caribbean  thus creating a    10-55103 14  substantial force at the world forum dealing with the ill effects of climate change.  It seems that the standing forest and the wealth of Suriname’s biodiversity are being taken for granted by the global community  as there are no structures in place to provide incentives to continue on the path of sustainability. Despite that  we promise that our choices for development will duly respect a proper balance between nature and development.  Various high-level meetings have been organized to address issues of common concern  such as the fight against HIV/AIDS  the negative effects of climate change  arms proliferation  the effects of the global economic and financial crisis and transnational organized crime and its associated ills.  At this time it is necessary to draw special attention to the issue of non-communicable diseases  which is of great concern to all of us. The initiative of Caribbean Community leaders  subsequently endorsed by the Commonwealth  to organize a high-level meeting of the General Assembly in 2011 to address the rising incidence and prevalence of non-communicable diseases is very important. It highlights the ever-growing need for the international community to join forces in addressing this global barrier to development.  Although non-communicable diseases are currently not a part of the indicators for assessing progress in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  they undoubtedly have a negative impact on those Goals. We can no longer ignore this emerging health crisis  which disproportionately impacts the poorest people  pushing them further into poverty and deprivation. Therefore  the global development agenda needs to include measures to address this problem  if we do not wish to jeopardize the accelerated achievement of the MDGs by 2015.  We are aware of poverty and extreme human suffering resulting from natural disasters. We empathize with the peoples of Haiti  Pakistan  China  Chile and all other countries where major weather patterns have wreaked havoc. Suriname is of the opinion that all nations should effectively and adequately contribute to the alleviation of the dire needs of our fellow citizens of the world. These people deserve more than expressions of sympathy; they deserve to see that promises made to them are kept.  Finally  we want to share our thoughts on the structural causes of poverty and the resulting ill effects on societies. My Government believes that education related to survival skills and production is the only way to effectively eradicate poverty. Money given to poor people for the sake of one’s own conscience is an absolute waste. Accordingly  we ask ourselves whether we should continue to use the phraseology “fighting poverty” or should instead start talking about pursuing wealth. Therefore  the slogan of my country in our lingua franca is: “Broko a pina  tek yu gudu”  which means “Break away from poverty  by pursuing wealth”."
"158",6486,"SVK",65,2010,"Let me congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. May the United Nations  under his leadership  confirm its central role in global events. Slovakia stands prepared to support him. I also appreciate the work done by his predecessor at the previous session.  The Slovak Republic fully aligns itself with the European Union’s statements. We are pleased that 27 European member States  plus other associated countries  speak in one voice at this universal international forum. This is a good prerequisite to clear the way for widely anticipated effective cooperation between the Union and the United Nations.  Let me now share with the Assembly several remarks on certain global and regional issues from the perspective of the Slovak foreign policy priorities.  The foreign policy of Slovakia  as a United Nations member  is based on respect for the core democratic values  international law and effective multilateralism. We therefore welcome and support the main theme of the sixty-fifth session: “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance”. This topic is all the more important since we often witness failure to respect binding decisions taken by United Nations bodies  and from time to time even among the various United Nations institutions.  One of the most important missions of the United Nations is to act as a guarantor of the formulation  protection and implementation of the principle of collective security of States. Hence  the preservation of international peace and security at a global level and within the bounds of international law must remain at the core of United Nations activities. For peace and security become particularly vulnerable in times of global financial and economic crises. They require increased attention on our part in order to remain under the control of States and the international community.  The process of arms control and disarmament represents the most important instrument for the prevention of war and other conflict. The progress achieved in the area of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction gives us reason for cautious optimism. Our duty is to continue the effort and to strengthen the global system of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Yet the risk of such weapons falling into the hands of terrorists remains high. We are also prepared to cooperate with our partners on a number of priorities  such as the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.  We appreciate the new post-START Treaty between the Russian Federation and the United States. We believe that the Treaty will invigorate the process of disarmament  which is getting off the ground  and increase pressure on certain States to desist from their ambitions to own nuclear weapons. In particular  I wish to underscore the important role played by the Conference on Disarmament  which is described as the sole multilateral disarmament negotiating forum.  In the area of conventional weapons  it is necessary to continue negotiations leading to the adoption of a new  effective arms trade treaty. Adequate attention must also be paid to small arms  the uncontrolled spread of which may have devastating consequences for the maintenance of peace and security  particularly in conflict areas.  United Nations peacekeeping operations represent one of the most visible activities of the United Nations in its efforts to preserve peace and security in the world. Slovakia  as an active contributor to United Nations missions and other international crisis management operations based on a United Nations mandate  welcomes the steps towards reviving the reform of peacekeeping operations as described in the document “ A New Partnership Agenda: Charting a New Horizon for UN Peacekeeping”.  I believe that the new Global Field Support Strategy will contribute  in real terms  towards a more rapid deployment of peacekeeping missions and  at the same time  ensure a more efficient utilization of human and financial resources.  Proper coordination between the United Nations and regional organizations plays an important role. There is room for improvement  for example  when it comes to cooperation between the EU and NATO at the operational level  but also for a more effective coordination at strategic level.   13 10-54833   The United Nations must also play a key role in the prevention of conflicts. Slovakia supports the prevention and mediation role of the United Nations and its capacity-building. It is  however  necessary to exert synergic efforts taking due account of the interests of all stakeholders at the local  regional and global levels in order to eliminate sources of conflict and proceed directly with establishing peace.  The establishment of the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia  which is headed by a Slovak diplomat  was a step in the right direction. The recent events in Kyrgyzstan confirmed the usefulness of this instrument and underscored the need to support it further.  Slovakia takes an active part in peace processes. Since our non-permanent membership in the Security Council in 2006 and 2007  we have continued our involvement in security sector reform. We are glad that since then several strategic papers have been produced and that progress has been made in building the requisite capacities  particularly in cooperation with African countries.  As the chair of the Group of Friends of security sector reform  we continue to actively work towards strengthening the relations in this matter between Member States and the Secretariat. In the course of the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly  we teamed up with our partners from Argentina and Indonesia to hold regional workshops dealing with security sector reform in the broader context of preserving and building peace and  at the same time  establishing a link between its global and regional aspects. We are determined to uphold this effort in cooperation with the Inter-agency Task Force on Security Sector Reform  as well as with other Member States and subregional organizations.  Under the Charter  the primary responsibility for international peace and security lies with the Security Council. The process of its reform could almost be called a never-ending story. We are therefore pleased that the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform were given a clearer shape. It must stand on the following pillars: representativeness  effectiveness in fulfilling its mission and transparency of its working methods  while allowing for possible enforcement of its decisions by sanctions.  The global financial and economic crisis laid bare the weak spots in the existing structures of the world economic order. The key role of the United Nations and its Member States must also be confirmed in this financial and economic dimension at the global level.  At the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals  we shared the view that since our efforts in achieving these Goals started some 10 years ago they had not become less topical or less important. Eradicating poverty and hunger  improving the quality of education  adequate employment  improving health-care services and housing  improving maternal health  gender equality and environmental sustainability remain among the central concerns of United Nations programmes  funds and specialized agencies.  Everyday life also shows us that creating conditions for equitable and sustainable development must go hand in hand with respect for nature and its rules. There is an inherent link between the two  and both have an impact on the life of individuals  who are part of the universal system.  The people of Slovakia had the misfortune to witness nature’s power as floods of an unprecedented scale ravaged our country earlier this summer. A proper balance must be struck between development and respect for nature  based on well-reasoned arguments supported by proper analysis  and without giving way to the influence sought by certain narrowly focused transnational organizations that call themselves environmentalists.  For the first time this year  Slovakia took part in the Economic and Social Council meetings as a member. Our experience shows that we need to strengthen the links between the Economic and Social Council and other organizations of the United Nations system and beyond  provided they work towards the same objectives.  Slovakia welcomes the establishment of UN Women — the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women. We believe that this entity will help curb all forms of violence against women. We also extend our good wishes for a successful mandate to the Secretary-General’s Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict.  Slovakia rejects any and all forms of intolerance  xenophobia  discrimination  racism and extreme nationalism. We are devoted to the protection of and support for human rights at both the national and    10-54833 14  international level. We play a leading role in the interregional initiative aimed at the adoption of a new optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Slovakia fully supports the fight to end impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes under international law  such as genocide  war crimes and crimes against humanity. As a facilitator for the universality and implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court  we actively work towards increasing the number of States Parties to the Rome Statute and towards its proper implementation.  Slovakia closely watches the situation and problems in individual regions of the world.  The long-term effort to reach lasting peace in the Middle East has failed to yield the expected results. At this stage  we appreciate the contributions of all facilitators involved in reconciling the demands of both sides by way of direct Israeli-Palestinian talks that were launched recently. We are hopeful that the Palestinian and Israeli leaders will find a way of coming to an agreement that will lay down the final arrangement of their mutual relations. This is necessary for world peace.  Africa  as the most troubled continent  continues to call for special attention by the international community. We need to address the origin and the essence of the problems  not only their consequences. On the other hand  we are pleased to see the progress made in the stabilization and development of countries such as Ghana  Benin  Togo  Mauritius and others.  As members of the United Nations  we all have to support respect for the binding nature of Security Council resolutions — particularly when it comes to preserving peace around the globe. For this reason  we support diplomatic negotiations on the Iran issue  as well as on the situation on the Korean peninsula  which is a matter of concern.  Slovakia welcomed the conclusions of the Kabul International Conference on Afghanistan. The Conference marked a new phase of partnership between the Afghan Government and the international community  based on the principle of a gradual Afghanistanization of the country  that is  the transition to full Afghan leadership and responsibility to be achieved in the Kabul Process. Slovakia will continue to participate in the stabilization and development of Afghanistan by contributing to NATO- and EU-led stabilization and training operations and by implementing humanitarian and development aid projects.  Slovakia remains a staunch supporter of a peaceful and just settlement of the Cyprus issue under the auspices of the Secretary-General. More than 20 years of our support for negotiations and the continued involvement  since 2001  of the largest contingent of the Slovak armed forces in the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus within the United Nations crisis management operations  bear witness to our engagement in this respect.  As for the Western Balkans  we are looking to strengthen stability and support democratic processes. We wish for the European integration processes of the Western Balkan countries to move forward. We also wish for the Balkans to see peace agreements and not imposed solutions.  The United Nations must be able to effectively respond to the current challenges of the twenty-first century. This calls for synergies across all United Nations bodies  programmes  funds and specialized agencies. But  more importantly  since Member States determine their activities and their direction  we need to build synergies among us. The people of our countries are looking to see positive results.  I am confident that  under the Assembly President’s leadership  the United Nations will make great strides in advancing its cause."
"159",6511,"SVN",65,2010,"I am indeed honoured to address this Assembly for the first time as Prime Minister of the Republic of Slovenia. I reaffirm my country’s commitment to the United Nations and its Charter.  Let me also congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We all rely on your political wisdom and experience  and I assure you of my country’s utmost support in the coming weeks and months.  In the past few years  numerous national leaders have spoken in this very Assembly about new global challenges that threaten our security  prosperity and freedom. There is a general consensus that more effective and coordinated global action is required to address such challenges. For Slovenia  strengthening global governance means renewing our common commitment to multilateralism and its principles of inclusion  legitimacy and transparency.  The United Nations must keep its place at the core of global governance structures. However  this Organization also needs to adapt to the contemporary reality of an interconnected world and the resulting new challenges and threats. As many of my colleagues have already said  reform of the United Nations has been long undervalued. The composition of the Security Council is visibly out of date and the work of the General Assembly needs revitalization. Progress in peacekeeping reform would strengthen all other United Nations activities relating to the maintenance of international peace and security  including preventive diplomacy and post-conflict peacebuilding.  The reforms of international economic and financial systems must continue at an accelerated pace  reflecting global development needs. Our endeavours should aim at increasing accountability  responsibility and solidarity  while taking into account the need for a   23 10-55103  stronger voice for and better participation of developing countries  which should be fully included in the international response to the crisis. Together  we must build a world in which economic indicators are not the only measure of a prosperous society. Human  social and environmental values should also become principal elements of our criteria. In this connection  I encourage closer cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions and between the United Nations and the Group of 20 in finding the best possible responses to the crisis and in addressing the needs of the most vulnerable.  It is unfortunate that  as a result of far-reaching developments  we continue to face an even greater challenge in climate change. Indeed  the past year has been a year of lost opportunities. However  this should not be a reason to lower our ambitions. Climate change is real  the loss of biodiversity is unprecedented and the consequences are already being felt by far too many people around the world. In some cases  the very existence of individual countries  States Members of the United Nations  is at stake. This year  we must do better and do more in Cancún to reach a comprehensive post-2012 climate agreement that will limit global warming to below 2°C  as stated in the Copenhagen Accord  and improve adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change. Our responsibilities differ  but we must all shoulder our share of the common burden.  After the fall of the Berlin Wall  the countries of Western Europe decided to open their ranks to the States of Central and Eastern Europe. This decision was instrumental in building a modern Europe of key democratic values. The choice of enlargement of Euro-Atlantic institutions was thus a choice for stability on the continent.  Unfortunately  the financial and economic crisis and international debates in many European States pushed aside some of the topics that are important and of strategic interest to the continent as a whole. The need for a continued process of enlargement of the European Union and NATO is one of them. I would therefore like to underline that the commitment to enlargement to the Western Balkans needs to be honoured  and all the more so since the situation in the region today has changed for the better. Obvious and tangible progress has been made.  In this connection  I would like to recall that only a couple of weeks ago this Assembly adopted resolution 64/298 by consensus  acknowledging the content of the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice  which was rendered in response to a submitted request on the issue of the declaration of independence of Kosovo. I am particularly glad that the resolution paved the way for dialogue  which the European Union is ready to facilitate. It is the historic responsibility of the democratically elected leaders of the countries of the Western Balkans to pursue reconciliation and the rebuilding of mutual trust.  In order to promote the necessary confidence  I therefore decided  together with the Prime Minister of Croatia  to launch the so-called Brdo process several months ago in Slovenia. I think the results and consequences of this decision have so far been very good. Our aim is to encourage dialogue and cooperation among the political leaders with a view to discussing mutual support and further steps on the road to the Euro-Atlantic integration of the entire region. I believe that we are on the right track  and we will continue to work in this direction.  Slovenia plays an active role in the international community and takes its responsibilities seriously. I would therefore like to confirm once again our dedication to our candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council  for the period of 2012-2013  at the elections to be held next year in this Assembly. Slovenia views its candidature as an opportunity to contribute further to the maintenance of international peace and security  as well as the peaceful settlement of disputes. We intend to build on our international commitments and experience gained in recent years. We are committed to upholding the rule of law  respect for human rights  international law and international humanitarian law  and we continue to foster open and transparent international dialogue in the spirit of cooperation and consensus-building.  Our candidature therefore underscores the great significance Slovenia attaches to the role of the United Nations in an increasingly interdependent and complex world. Furthermore  it indicates Slovenia’s desire to utilize its rich multilateral experience to enhance the goals and principles of this universal  international Organization.  Finally  let me say once more how honoured I am  as the Prime Minister of Slovenia  to be present in this Assembly. Extraordinary historical circumstances have shaped the development of my country  which    10-55103 24  therefore attaches great importance to the constant promotion of the noble purposes and principles of international relations  as defined in the Charter of the United Nations. I am therefore all the more pleased to have been able to participate in the general debate devoted to the reaffirmation of the central role of this Organization in global governance."
"160",6556,"SWE",65,2010,"May I start by pointing out that Sweden aligns itself fully with the written statement of the European Union (EU)  which will soon be distributed to all Member States.  By signing the Charter of the United Nations we have all pledged to combine our efforts towards the shared goals of international peace and security  human rights  respect for international law  and economic and social advancement. Implicit in that pledge is the principle of shared responsibility. If we are to move beyond divisions to find common solutions to global problems  every country will need to assume its share of responsibility. Last week  world leaders met in this room to confirm their determination to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Progress made over the 10 years since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration has been mixed. The overall   37 10-55276  trend is positive  but critical areas are lagging behind. This is particularly true for Goal 5 on maternal health. Sweden will continue to do its part to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and is one of the countries contributing the largest share of its national income as official development assistance. But development assistance can only complement — and never replace — development efforts based on genuine national ownership. Thus  we have a shared responsibility  developed and developing countries alike  to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.   The development and prosperity of poor countries to a large extent depend on their ability to integrate into the global economy. The fact that protectionism has largely been kept at bay during the most severe recession since the 1930s is therefore a major achievement. Robust international rules for open trade and investment are key. Free trade benefits rich and poor countries alike. The regions that have been most successful in eradicating poverty are also those where countries trade the most. In order to strengthen the trading capacity of the poorest countries  aid for trade can play an important role. Completion of the Doha Round must remain a shared first priority  but should not prevent complementary free trade and investment arrangements.  The devastating natural disasters in Haiti and Pakistan have underlined the importance of a well-functioning and well-coordinated international humanitarian system. It is only through joint efforts and shared responsibility that the international community can ensure quick and effective responses to people in need. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) plays a crucial role in this respect. Sadly  we see a global trend of increasing humanitarian needs. It is therefore of utmost importance that we continue to strengthen the humanitarian system as a whole  in particular OCHA. In parallel  we need to focus more on preparedness and prevention to reduce long-term vulnerability to disasters.   Climate change is clearly one of the greatest challenges of our generation  affecting the world and particularly poor countries in unpredictable and devastating ways. Even if we meet the two-degree target set by the United Nations  disasters will continue to be a reality. Developed and developing countries alike share the responsibility to ward off this threat to our planet by working towards concrete climate goals. Developed countries  as major emitters  bear a large share of the responsibility for reducing emissions and for providing funding  but actions must be taken by all countries. The example of Sweden shows that it is possible to achieve both emissions reductions and economic growth — there is no contradiction.   Together we have a shared responsibility as the guardians of human rights  enshrined in the United Nations Charter  the Universal Declaration and the relevant conventions. Without respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  all other progress will be incomplete. The ultimate responsibility lies with States. It is for us to put ideals into practice. The Human Rights Council needs to use all its tools to address the substance of its mandate: human rights violations. For that Council to be relevant  its members must meet the membership criteria of fulfilling their international human rights obligations. Much remains to be done. The death penalty continues to be applied extensively across the world  in some cases even against juveniles  and often without a credible legal process. As we have recently seen  in some countries a woman can even be sentenced to death by stoning for alleged adultery  and both men and women can be executed for no other reason than their sexual orientation. The responsibility to stop such barbaric acts lies firmly with us  the governments. Gender equality remains one of the greatest challenges to human rights and democracy. We therefore welcome the establishment of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women  (UN Women) and believe it will further the cause of gender equality.   Democracy and human rights are not just mutually supporting; one cannot be said to truly exist without the other. The right to participate in a democratic system of government is indeed in itself a human right. Although we have seen democracy spread to new countries  a large part of the world’s population is still denied the right to participate in free elections. We call upon the Government of Myanmar to make its November election free  fair and inclusive. In this context  we reiterate our call for the release of the political prisoners and detainees  including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.   Freedom of expression is a core human right and a prerequisite of democracy. In this era of information technology  communication has been revolutionized. New technologies can assist in making Governments more transparent and can stimulate citizens to take a    10-55276 38  more active role in the democratic governance of their countries. Yet  technology alone cannot make information and expression of opinion free. Access to technology is needed as a catalyst for human rights. The harassment and jailing of journalists and bloggers must stop. The situation in countries such as China  Viet Nam  Egypt  Myanmar  Cuba  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  Eritrea and Iran is deeply worrying. It is important that the international community address the issue of violations of freedom of expression  also in connection with new technologies and with greater vigour than in the past.  Sweden is concerned about continued human rights violations in the Sudan  not least in Darfur. Full cooperation with the International Criminal Court is an obligation under international law. The upcoming referendum on the status of Southern Sudan will be of crucial importance to the country’s future. We must spare no effort to make sure that it is credible and to support the parties in reaching an agreement on post-referendum arrangements. In this process the United Nations has a key role to play  together with the African Union.  The recently reported cases of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  with shocking news of hundreds of rapes of women and children  are not isolated incidents. They are part of a pattern of conflict-related crimes that have been carried out with impunity over many years. As so often in conflict situations  women and children are the most vulnerable groups; as so often in peace processes  women are the most ignored. A lasting peace calls for the empowerment and equal participation of women in negotiations and decision-making. Lasting peace can never be achieved while there is impunity. It is high time to fully implement Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000)  on women and peace and security  and 1820 (2008)  on sexual violence in conflict situations. Sweden welcomes the appointment of a Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict.  The international community has agreed on the responsibility to protect populations from genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. We need to intensify our efforts and develop the right tools to ensure the full realization of the responsibility to protect  both as sovereign States and as part of the international community. Sweden fully supports the Secretary-General’s efforts to strengthen the early warning capability within the Secretariat.  Few aspects of our cooperation through the United Nations illustrate shared responsibility better than our joint role in preventing and managing conflicts  and keeping and building sustainable peace. Important steps have been taken to improve global peacekeeping. We welcome the New Horizon Initiative as a way of further enhancing the capability of the United Nations to conduct demanding and complex peacekeeping missions worldwide. Much work remains to be done in the areas of conflict prevention and peacebuilding. We need to increase the capacity of the United Nations to help countries in transition from war to lasting peace  and to provide relevant support — not least through the Peacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding Fund — for their efforts to foster peace and rebuild State and society. Similarly  the United Nations must have the right tools to help prevent countries from lapsing into conflict in the first place. This is a central challenge for the United Nations and a key priority for the coming decade.  We welcome the increasingly important role that the African Union plays  not least in peacekeeping operations in Africa. Cooperation between the African Union and both the United Nations and the European Union has been important in both the Sudan and Somalia. Earlier this year  Sweden led the European Union’s anti-piracy operation off the coast of Somalia  a mission that provides security for humanitarian transports of the World Food Programme into Somalia. Furthermore  the European Union  in close cooperation with the African Union  is conducting training in Uganda of the Transitional Federal Government security forces. The African Union has made a courageous and considerable contribution to security in Mogadishu. Yet over the past year we have witnessed some of the most violent fighting in Mogadishu and in parts of south-central Somalia. Together with the Transitional Federal Institutions  we now need to prepare and plan for the end of the transitional arrangements by August next year. In this process  strong United Nations leadership will be crucial.  The United Nations plays a crucial role in the efforts of the international community to contribute to secure  stable and democratic development in Afghanistan. At the Kabul International Conference on Afghanistan  held in July  there was a renewed commitment by the Afghan authorities and the   39 10-55276  international community to enhance national ownership in this process. Together  the United Nations  the European Union and other international actors have to show continued strong resolve in assisting the Afghan people in building a more peaceful and democratic society. To this effect  Sweden will continue to contribute to civilian and military operations in Afghanistan  while increasing our development assistance.  In the Middle East the responsibility for the success of direct negotiations lies with the two parties. But we all share an interest in  and must contribute to  a two-State solution with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security. We deeply regret the Israeli decision not to extend the moratorium on settlements. The context of direct negotiations  as stated in European Union Council conclusions  must be that negotiations should be based on the pre-1967 borders  that settlements are illegal  that all final status issues are to be included in the negotiations — including the status of Jerusalem as capital of two States — and that both parties are to refrain from provocative actions.  We strive for a world without nuclear weapons. World leaders have made significant progress in disarmament and non-proliferation efforts in the past year. The New START agreement is of great importance  but there is scope for further reductions  not least of non-strategic nuclear arsenals. The spread of nuclear weapons must be stopped. The Action Plan adopted at the Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in May  covering the three mutually reinforcing pillars of the NPT  must be implemented and fully respected.   The early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is as urgent as ever. The unacceptable deadlock in the Conference on Disarmament must come to an end.   We are deeply concerned that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has continued its withdrawal from the NPT  even having tested two nuclear devices  and that Iran has been conducting activities in violation of its NPT commitments. It is of vital importance that commitments under the NPT be honoured.  The control of conventional arms is also an urgent priority. The illicit or uncontrolled spread of such weapons contributes to regional and international instability  maiming and killing thousands. We must seize the opportunity and strive together to find the political will to agree on regulating mechanisms  such as is currently being discussed in the form of an arms trade treaty.  The European Union is a strong supporter of the United Nations. Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty  the EU has established new permanent structures for its external representation  taking over functions previously carried out by the rotating presidency. Ensuring that the EU can continue to contribute effectively to the work of the United Nations requires allowing its representatives to participate actively in its proceedings in the capacity of observer. We are looking forward to continued cooperation with a view to ensuring the adoption of a resolution to that effect as soon as possible.  Our countries are interconnected today in an unprecedented way. In a globalized world  problems such as climate change  natural disasters  disease  drugs  terrorism and conflicts take on new proportions. At the same time the alleviation of poverty  the fight for human rights and democracy  and economic development remain as relevant as ever. We need to cooperate in global structures and engage in various forms of global governance to meet these challenges. The United Nations is the only world body offering a unique forum to address these problems in a coordinated way. We need to continue to reform the United Nations in order for it to fulfil its functions and remain relevant. Only when every country assumes its share of responsibility can the United Nations achieve its full potential. Sweden will continue to be a strong supporter of the United Nations and will assume its share of our common responsibility."
"161",6594,"SWZ",65,2010,"It is a pleasure for me to address the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session.  We meet following the historic review summit on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  the High-level Plenary Meeting of the Assembly  which gave us the opportunity to review progress and share experiences and ideas on how best to achieve our set goals and objectives for 2015. As we return to our respective countries we go with renewed commitment to keep working harder to meet the MDGs.  I would like at the outset to extend our thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General and the United Nations agencies for their presence around the world. We commend the active participation of the United Nations in various missions  such as efforts to restore peace in conflict areas  and its role in disaster relief and in various exercises to fight hunger and poverty.  We pledge ourselves to continue to support the United Nations in its primary role of ensuring that all the nations of the world live peacefully with each other while supporting nation-building through development projects.  The theme for this sixty-fifth session  “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance”  came at a most opportune time in   7 10-55103  the life of the United Nations  since we have been calling for all our voices to be heard. I must hasten to state that all the wars and conflicts that we see around the world can only be resolved through peaceful dialogue and negotiations. The United Nations is the organization best positioned for this task. There is no place for unilateralism.  It is on this basis that the Kingdom of eSwatini reaffirms our call for the finalization of the United Nations reforms  with particular reference to the Security Council. It should be appreciated that the world today faces a new set of challenges  different from those that it faced when our Organization was founded in 1945; thus the urgent need for the United Nations to remain dynamic and transform itself to meet today’s challenges.  One of the major organs that require immediate reform is the Security Council  which has seen a number of regions expressing a desire to gain membership  to ensure wider representation. The Kingdom of eSwatini stands by the African position  as clearly stated in the Ezulwini Consensus  that Africa should have two permanent and five non-permanent seats. We hope that during this session this matter will be finalized.  We in the African continent are committed to resolving all conflicts through peaceful dialogue. The coordination and cooperation between the African Union and its various regional blocs is beginning to pay handsome dividends. We now approach issues as a collective for better results. We are happy that the United Nations continues to work and cooperate with us in effecting our programmes for peacebuilding and peacekeeping.  The General Assembly will know that the African Union declared 2010 to be our Year of Peace and Security. We have made it clear that all perpetrators of coups and civil wars and all forms of conflict should be dealt with squarely and decisively. Indeed  we are committed to the promotion of lasting peace  because it is a prerequisite for achieving sustainable development. We appreciate the support of the United Nations in our resolve to ensure that peace prevails in the continent and  indeed  the whole world.  I am happy to say that I personally had the honour of lighting and hoisting the African flame of peace twice this year. The Swazi nation prides itself on this  because we are a peaceful nation  which is telling the world that peace is the best formula for development.  Another issue that touches upon global governance is that of the Kingdom of Morocco. It is our considered view that the United Nations  working with relevant regional organizations  should work on the issue and find a lasting solution.  We note with concern the continued conflicts in Madagascar  Somalia  Darfur  the Middle East and Afghanistan  to mention just a few. We call for the restoration of peace in all those areas  as it is always disturbing to see people undergo so much suffering due to conflicts.  While Afghanistan is still undergoing its process of reconciliation and the reconstruction of its institutions  it is depressing to note that there are at times pockets that seem to disturb the peace process in that country. We must continue to work hard to find lasting solutions  because such instability affects peace and prosperity  not only in Afghanistan  but also in neighbouring States and the region.  The Kingdom of eSwatini draws hope from the promising developments in Iraq  as that country continues on the road to peace through restoration of its important institutions for self-determination.  Furthermore  we are also following with keen interest efforts to ensure peace between Israel and Palestine. We are pleased to note the concerted mediation efforts led by the United States of America in bringing the parties together in pursuit of peace in the Middle East. We support this process  and remain optimistic that it will reach its desired conclusion  so that the Israelis and Palestinians can live together in harmony. In order to concentrate all their efforts towards development and peaceful coexistence  we call upon them to reach a compromise and place the best interests of peace and security above everything else.  Developments in cross-straits relations between the Republic of China on Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China continue to be a source of inspiration to us all. We note with appreciation that the Republic of China on Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China have made impressive strides to promote mutual understanding leading to more trade and interaction between them. I am happy to say that Taiwan highly appreciates being allowed to participate as an observer in the World Health Organization.    10-55103 8  Hopefully  this will also lead to Taiwan’s participating in a similar manner in all other United Nations agencies. Of particular interest is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Our world today continues to be concerned about nuclear proliferation and the threat that weapons of mass destruction pose to human existence  world peace  economic development and the environment. The spread of nuclear weapons makes a mockery of our efforts for world peace and protection of the environment.  It is a disheartening fact that currently efforts to ensure accountability and compliance with United Nations resolutions are hindered by an apparent lack of impartiality in the processes meant to completely rid the world of deadly nuclear weapons. I call upon the United Nations to strengthen the capacity of the International Atomic Energy Agency to enable the inspectors to do their work more effectively  with the involvement of all the countries with nuclear capability.  The United Nations must never compromise the implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; it must ensure that all countries  without exception  comply. Countries must be made to comply and be accountable within clear time frames.  It is my suggestion that we eliminate all weapons of mass destruction  because they present an uncertain future. Indeed  we need a fresh start so that we may regain the moral high ground in deterring whoever may have ambitions for nuclear capability in the future. For example  if we compel everyone to dismantle their nuclear capacity we will be able to rein in other countries which may still be developing their arsenal  without being accused of unfairness or bias.  A world free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction will allow us to concentrate on issues of sustainable development.  As a developing nation  the Kingdom of eSwatini is following with keen interest the issues surrounding the effects of climate change. As an agriculture-based economy  the Kingdom is also a victim of environmental degradation. We therefore look forward to the climate change Conference to be held in Mexico later this year. I trust that the ongoing negotiations will result in agreements acceptable to all parties. What is of paramount importance is for the developed world to honour pledges to assist developing countries in their mitigation and adaptation efforts.  It is a known fact that access to international markets for our products is one of the ways to grow our economies in our quest to eradicate poverty. We are encouraged that the developed nations have opened their markets for some products from developing countries. We look forward with optimism to an amicable conclusion of the Doha Round of talks  an outcome essential to boost global trade and economic recovery for the developing world.  As part of our development and poverty alleviation strategy  the Kingdom is ready to explore and exploit existing and emerging markets. Our focus is on limiting exportation of raw material by emphasizing the production of finished goods.  The Kingdom continues to promote equality in all sectors of our development spheres. We therefore welcome the recent establishment of the new United Nations entity for gender equality: UN Women. Women the world over continue to play key roles in contributing to the socio-economic and political development of our nations.  We are meeting as a family of nations that seeks to promote peace and coexistence among all nations of the world and bring hope for the future. Our people look to us  as leaders  to take the lead in promoting peace  as enshrined in the Charter.  We must find lasting solutions to all the challenges. They include poverty  unemployment  disease and global warming  but the major challenge is to make peace within and among all nations happen. By finding solutions  we shall indeed guarantee a clear road towards the achievement of sustainable development by all the nations of the world. We shall achieve that noble goal if we all reaffirm and adhere to the central role of the United Nations in global governance."
"162",6623,"SYC",65,2010,"May I take this opportunity to join those who have come before me in congratulating His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election as President of our Assembly and on his diligent stewardship of the proceedings thus far. I also thank and congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his leadership and drive at the head of the sixty-fourth session of the Assembly.  We spent the first three days last week debating the progress made — or not made  as the case may be — in attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. For many of us  there are still formidable struggles ahead. For Seychelles  while we have made huge strides forward towards meeting these Goals  we are also pedalling furiously so as not to slip back on what we have already worked hard to achieve. This brings to mind the question: Are the MDGs an end in themselves? The task does not end in 2015. It cannot end in 2015. What happens  and where are we headed after that?  Those of us that are middle-income countries  and that includes many small island developing States (SIDS)  already know the different set of challenges that these questions bring — questions that other countries will also have to face as they achieve and move beyond the MDGs. The debate needs to start now  as we fast approach 2015  on how countries will access the affordable financing they will need not just to move beyond the MDGs  but to ensure that they keep and do not lose what they have achieved.  That is why Seychelles announced at the MDG summit that we will be engaging with the United Nations system to enter into new commitments towards setting MDG-plus targets  the overall objective being to make sustainable development a reality beyond the Millennium Development Goals and the next generation.  We are all aware of the differences among us in our sizes and populations. The needs of every Member of the United Nations are different. We have learned a lot about development over the years  and today we all know that one-size-fits-all does not work. At the United Nations and other development organizations  we have created development categories to facilitate access for those most in need of the appropriate resources. Resources are always stretched  and  as we move beyond 2015  we must make sure that development categories truly facilitate development. Such categories must not become a way to punish those that succeed in development.  And we must not allow small island developing States to fall through the cracks between the categories. Middle-income SIDS face special problems that the international development architecture does not currently make provision for. The funding that is available to SIDS is fragmented. There is no reliable funding to them. Even on issues where SIDS are most affected  such as climate change  there are many barriers to our ability to access funding  not least the use of gross domestic product per capita criteria to define eligibility for funding.  The question that will come up increasingly as we try to answer the question of how to fund development beyond 2015 is where SIDS can go to finance their development. The answer is that we need to define a specific development category for SIDS to be used by all development partners.  That is why small island developing States say “let us start at home” by requesting the Secretary-General to initiate a system-wide review of how effectively the United Nations and its various agencies   49 10-55122  are actually supporting SIDS  and how that can be improved. This could be done by an inter-agency working group that would provide concrete recommendations to this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly as to how the United Nations system could better support the specific needs of SIDS. The world economic and financial crisis has reinforced the vulnerability of island States to external shocks. More than ever  it has illustrated that islands need as much support as possible if they are to be able to pursue development successfully.  As I have already highlighted  there are gaps in the existing development system. Those gaps mean that we must be prepared to be innovative in meeting the development challenges that are looming. We welcome the efforts of several countries and of the Secretary-General to adopt new and innovative means to finance development. In Seychelles  the pressures of the food  fuel and financial crises meant that in 2008 we had to engage in wide-ranging macroeconomic reform with the support of the Bretton Woods institutions  the Asian Development Bank and our Paris Club creditors. We are most grateful to all our partners for their support.  I think it is interesting to note that while we were restructuring our old debt  our economy began to grow thanks to new foreign direct investment  most of it from the developing world — the Gulf  Africa and Asia. There are many new channels for development that remain relatively unexplored and unstructured.  I would like also to brief the Assembly on a groundbreaking renewable energy project being undertaken in Seychelles with the support of the United Arab Emirates Government. This project is an example of how a small island can have access to affordable financing to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels — one of the things that make islands most vulnerable.  These South-South dynamics are often overlooked in the traditional dynamics of the United Nations. Often  we also waste a lot of time on ideological debates that further obscure the true objectives of development. We need to be pragmatic and we need to act.  Climate change  and in particular sea-level rise  remain by far the greatest threats to small islands. Much more ambitious global action needs to be taken to significantly reduce emissions and implement adaptation in a manner that will ensure the development aspirations and survival of all countries  small islands in particular. We need to ensure that fast-start funding is also available for disbursement as quickly as possible.  I must stress the concern of small islands that much of the funding available to adapt to climate change is being channelled through traditional funding channels. This means that most SIDS will miss out on funds because of our middle-income status. Climate change requires funding mechanisms that do not rely only on business as usual. We need a real fast start. For the moment  we are still stuck at the starting block.  While we reflect on the governance of the United Nations  we must also spare no effort to ensure that we can be effective in resolving conflict in those areas where human suffering is at its worst. In the Horn of Africa  we remain deeply concerned about the ongoing situation in Somalia. We convey our solidarity to the Somali people and the Transitional Federal Government that is trying to restore peace and security. We fully support the efforts of the African Union  through the African Union Mission in Somalia  and of the United Nations.  It is clear  however  that we must now be prepared to move beyond what we have already tried and tested. The ongoing problems associated with the situation in Somalia also continue  unfortunately  to hamper the conditions for development in the region. The threat of terrorism is rising  while the scourge of piracy continues to spread further afield  as far east as Maldives and as far south as Madagascar.  Seychelles has worked hard to ensure that our maritime zones remain safe  and we thank all our partners for their support. Nonetheless  piracy has led to direct losses in our economy of over 4 per cent of gross domestic product. We welcome the new regional project on piracy being developed by the Indian Ocean Commission and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa  with the support of the European Union. This project approaches the problem from several angles simultaneously as we attempt to strengthen the regional capacity for patrols and surveillance  strengthen the legal and judicial capacity of our countries  and mitigate the negative effects on our economies.  I would like to thank our friends and neighbours for their support on this issue. It is an issue that depends on all countries working together  both from within the region and beyond. We must also continue to    10-55122 50  engage with the Somalia to strengthen its ability to build its own institutions.  Seychelles also strongly believes that the international community must strengthen its efforts to tackle transnational crimes that are often linked to instability and insecurity  from money-laundering to people trafficking. In the Indian Ocean region  we are determined to work with all partners to ensure that we can address these issues effectively.  We are all part of the United Nations because we believe that we must work together to achieve development. Development is a collaborative process. We need to strengthen this collaboration. We need to make more efforts to ensure that there is more innovative financing to fund development. We need to be more pragmatic in our approach. We know it will not be easy  but that only strengthens our resolve. We are ready to move forward together."
"163",6669,"SYR",65,2010,"Allow me to congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss personally  as well as his country  Switzerland  on his election to the presidency of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. His experience and competence qualify him to ably discharge his responsibilities  and I wish him every success in his endeavours. I also thank his predecessor  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  and extend to him and his fraternal country our appreciation for his skilful stewardship of the work of the General Assembly during the previous session. I would also like to express to the Secretary-General our appreciation and wishes for success in fulfilling the tasks entrusted to him.  The Middle East region has been rife with tensions for many decades. It has survived major events and numerous wars. The policies  interests and trends that have unfolded on its soil have converged at times but clashed at others. Due to its geographic location  the Middle East influences neighbouring countries in Asia  Europe and Africa and is  in turn  influenced by them. Syria  which lies at the heart of the Middle East  has experienced these tensions  policies  events and outcomes and has reacted to them.  This fact — which has spelled both positive and negative consequences for the Syrian Arab Republic — prompted us to define our perspective in addressing external issues  particularly the nature of our international relations. Safeguarding and sustaining Syrian and Arab interests is our priority. Therefore  our door remains open for an in depth and meaningful dialogue aimed at reconciling differences with others and reaching common ground on the basis of which progress can be made. That was our response when Syria endured attempts to isolate and blockade it  a response we reaffirm today as Syria discharges its role as a major player in matters related to the security and stability of the region. We believe that civilized international relations must be built on openness and dialogue as opposed to insularity  isolation  confrontation and aggression. This is our approach  which we hope will prevail in a world driven by multiple interests and perspectives  overwhelmed by problems and complications  yet at the same time sustained by hopes and noble visions.  The world has declared that it is determined to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East  and has stressed that peace is an urgent prerequisite for the maintenance of security and stability in the region. In Israel  there is much talk about peace  yet the drums of war continue to sound. Land appropriation for settlement-building goes on unabated. Peace negotiations  we are told  are currently under way on the basis of the two-State solution  but settlement activities are about to make this two-State solution a dead letter that stands no chance of survival. Israel is intensely pursuing its Judaization plans for Jerusalem in order to depopulate it of its Palestinian inhabitants. Israeli actions threaten the safety of Jerusalem’s holy sites. Through settlement activities  actions and declarations concerning Jerusalem  Israel pursues a fait accompli policy on the basis of which it imposes its will regardless of whether negotiations continue or stall.  Peace can be genuine only if there is a genuine will to make peace. That is the litmus test. Political manoeuvres during negotiations under the umbrella of the desire for peace strain and exacerbate the situation and may make it more volatile and explosive.  Syria seeks a just and comprehensive peace achieved through the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  and the Arab Peace Initiative. Our position has been known and declared for years. We have the will to make peace and we are the masters of our decision  which is unwavering. The occupied Syrian Golan is not negotiable nor is it a bargaining chip. Recognition of    10-55264 20  the fact that it must be returned fully is the basis on which peacemaking arrangements should be made. Syria is ready to resume peace negotiations from the point where they stopped  through the Turkish mediator  if it finds in Israel a partner committed to the terms of reference of peacemaking  and if that partner has the political will to achieve peace.  We note with satisfaction the objective opinion of the report of the Human Rights Council fact-finding mission investigating the Israeli attack on the freedom flotilla that was headed to Gaza on an exclusively humanitarian mission (A/HRC/15/21). We look forward to the conclusions to be drawn from the report of the international commission now that the necessary legal grounds and supporting evidence have been established by the Human Rights Council’s fact-finding mission.  Syria is a fraternal Arab neighbour of Iraq. For us  Iraq thus remains a subject of interest and a cause for concern  particularly when the situation there deteriorates. We embrace any improvement in conditions there with a major sense of relief. The restoration of Iraq’s full sovereignty and independence  the preservation of its Arab and Islamic identity  the unity of its people and its territorial integrity are of utmost priority for our approach towards Iraq and its future. Undoubtedly  national unity remains the cornerstone of a secure  prosperous and strong Iraq.  We have called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Iraq. In this context  the partial withdrawal of the American forces from Iraq constitutes  in our view  a positive first step in the direction of Iraq’s assumption of its power over its own affairs and the restoration of its full sovereignty over its territories. We hope that Iraq will ultimately develop strong military and security capabilities to safeguard its internal security and safety as an independent and sovereign State.  It should be reiterated that Iraqi security is contingent upon its national unity and is based on its Arab-Islamic identity and the principle of the participation of all segments of Iraqi society in building their country’s present and future. Syria is willing to cooperate with Iraq in every aspect to serve Iraq’s interests and the common interests of our two fraternal countries.  My country has been advocating the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East since 2003  a demand we included in a draft resolution we presented to the Security Council at the time. We continue to stress that Israel must be made to comply with international decisions calling on it to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to submit its nuclear installations to the comprehensive International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards regime. Israel’s accession to the Treaty is of extreme significance for the security and stability of our region.  We often wonder why some States talk about the universality of the NPT but hasten to make strenuous efforts to shelter Israel from the Agency’s oversight. They are encouraging Israel to continue to develop its nuclear military programme  which is a cause of concern to the people of the region. Furthermore  this policy of double standards runs counter to the non-proliferation prerequisites  not only in the Middle East region  but also in the world at large.  We reaffirm that all States have the right to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful uses  as guaranteed by the NPT. We also call for the peaceful resolution of all disputes relevant to this aspect through dialogue.  Syria follows the developments in the Sudan because we are dedicated to the Sudan’s unity  sovereignty  security and stability. In that context  we are grateful to the State of Qatar  the League of Arab States and the African Union for their efforts. We also appreciate and support the African Union’s efforts in settling disputes in the Sudan and other conflict zones on the African continent  and in promoting Africa’s role within the international system.  We also strongly reiterate our call to lift the embargo that has been imposed on Cuba for decades.  The world has suffered numerous natural disasters this year resulting from climate change and global warming. We all know that these disasters are but a prelude to more severe and wider-scale calamities that could well threaten natural life on this planet. We have an obligation towards nature  yet we have exceeded all limits in abusing it.  Many countries have chosen to ignore the warnings of scientists and the ominous signals from nature. We must rise to this serious challenge and assume our historic responsibility  so as to make up for past imbalances and shortcomings.   21 10-55264   We look forward to an expression of international solidarity in Cancún  Mexico  based on scientific evidence and on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It is our hope that the Cancún outcome will take into account the priorities of sustainable development in order to arrive at a comprehensive and legally binding post-2012 framework agreement. We believe that it is extremely important to address the shortcomings of Copenhagen and to renew the commitment to the Bali Action Plan and the premises of the Kyoto Protocol.  The painful situation in Pakistan  a typical symptom of climate change  is yet another example of the devastating disasters that we must expect unless we work seriously and collectively to address this grave situation. The people and Government of my country  Syria  wholeheartedly sympathize with Pakistan and other disaster-stricken countries. I stress the urgent need for States to increase assistance to Pakistan  both in cash and in kind  to mitigate the tragic and widespread damage there and prevent any further exacerbation of the situation.  We aspire to a better  more just and secure world and look forward to strengthening and revitalizing the role of the United Nations and guaranteeing respect for international law. We must not forget  though  that our planet Earth is home to the world we are aspiring to build. This home is besieged by an ominous phenomenon  climate change  which entails tragic consequences for humanity. This year was only a prelude to what is yet to come. We sincerely hope that the Cancún conference will be the herald of a direly needed rescue effort."
"164",6714,"TCD",65,2010,"The delegation of Chad echoes previous speakers in warmly congratulating you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session  and assures you of our desire to cooperate with you as you carry out your mission.  I also express my delegation’s admiration for your predecessor  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  who skilfully guided the Assembly’s work at the sixty-fourth session.  Our tribute and recognition also go to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his courage and passion in seeking solutions to the problems facing mankind.  Over the last two years the entire world has struggled against the effects of the financial  food and energy crises. The international cooperation underpinning that struggle has been exemplary and unprecedented. But  while it was able to curb the financial crisis in the rich countries  the poor countries continue to suffer from the effects of the food and energy crises  added to which are the negative effects of climate change on their environment.  The Republic of Chad welcomes the fact that the United Nations is focusing on development challenges  in particular the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and their financing  as evidenced by the recent high-level meeting. But we fear that once again the relevant recommendations that emerged from that meeting will not be implemented.  Over recent years our Organization and the international community have been particularly concerned about the Darfur crisis and its impact on relations between Chad and the Sudan  which have been fully normalized following the courageous decision of Mr. Idriss Déby Itno to travel to Khartoum and finalize reconciliation with his Sudanese counterpart  Mr. Omer Hassan Ahmat Al-Bashir.  The two countries agreed  among other measures  to establish a joint force to secure their common border. It is now patrolling the entire border to maintain security. High-level meetings are held regularly to assess the situation.  The two countries are also committed to providing no support of any kind to rebel forces in the respective countries  and they call upon those forces to lay down their arms and accept a political settlement. As always  the Government of the Republic of Chad favours dialogue.  Although relations between our two countries are being normalized  and there is a growing dialogue between the Government and the armed opposition in the Sudan  the situation in Darfur still merits special attention.   Chad  no doubt like the entire international community  has a dream of peace in the Sudan  which is preparing for a major political event: the referendum on self-determination for southern Sudan. That is a high-risk undertaking if the process leading up to it is not controlled  and if the balloting is not organized under the best conditions of independence  security and transparency.  We fear that failures in those respects could compromise peace and security in the Sudan and the subregion. That fear is reinforced by an appeal made this morning by the Archbishop of the Episcopal Church of the Sudan  who expressed concern about the serious risks of war. In addressing the appeal to the   15 10-55276  United Nations and to the Governments of the United States and Great Britain  the guarantors of the peace agreements  Archbishop Daniel Deng drew our attention to the significance of those risks. We must take account of that legitimate concern.  In any event  the international community must understand that the referendum in southern Sudan  whatever the outcome  will have an impact on the rest of Africa.  My country would like to see the Sudan’s unity and integrity maintained  but the Sudanese themselves are the only judges of their future  and Chad will respect their choice.  On the other side of the Sudanese frontier  in eastern Chad  there are still 290 000 Sudanese refugees and 180 000 displaced Chadians  who have been there since the Darfur crisis erupted in 2003. They are living in precarious environmental and social conditions; this is not to mention the situation of the host populations  who also deserve more attention in order to restore the natural balance disrupted by the massive influx of refugees and displaced persons.   In anticipation of the withdrawal of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT)  Chad has committed itself to having its own forces assume the protection of those refugees and internally displaced persons  as well as of United Nations and associated humanitarian personnel. Thus  in accordance with Security Council resolution 1923 (2010) of 25 May  the Government has developed a sustainment plan to ensure support for elements of the Integrated Security Detachment (DIS) post-MINURCAT. It must be remembered that DIS is composed entirely of national elements of the gendarmerie and police whose mission it is to maintain order and the rule of law in the refugee camps and in areas with concentrations of internally displaced persons  and to help ensure the safety of humanitarian operations.  Respect for security and humanitarian commitments in Chad has led the Government to make a financial effort of around $12 million a month. That does not include the cost of the joint Chad-Sudan forces’ operations to secure the border.   Logistical support for security and for managing humanitarian needs requires the combined efforts of all. Therefore  the Government intends to organize in Chad in the coming days consultation with all partners in order to mobilize the necessary financial and logistic support for DIS.   We take this opportunity to reiterate  once again  the Government’s readiness to continue to cooperate with the United Nations in all initiatives that will benefit peace and security in eastern Chad  the Central African Republic and Darfur. Accordingly  Chad welcomes the meeting on the Central African Republic held on the margins of the Millennium Development Goals summit. We hope that that important meeting enabled the international community to understand the extent of the challenges facing that country and to assist effectively both in the organization of the coming elections and in the maintenance of peace throughout its territory.   We believe that the cessation of armed incursions into the area will have satisfactory effects on the phenomenon of recruiting child soldiers. The Government had already firmly resolved to eradicate such recruitment  long carried out by the armed groups. It was with that clear intention that my country hosted last June a regional conference on ending the recruitment and use of children by armed forces and armed groups. My country makes its full contribution alongside the contributions of the African Union and the United Nations.   In national politics  a climate of trust between the Government and the democratic opposition has existed since implementation of the political agreement of 13 August 2007. This has enabled the various political actors to agree on the conduct of our electoral process. An independent joint national electoral commission has been set up to organize consultations on the various local and national elections  and it has decided on the schedule for local  parliamentary and presidential elections in the first quarter of 2011.  With regard to development  the country has spent 60 per cent of its additional oil resources in the social sectors and on basic infrastructure as the basis of its socio-economic development. However  funding needs for the MDGs in 2008-2011 show a gap of more than $3.5 billion. Domestic financial resources remain woefully short of our needs. Additional resources are therefore essential to finance our development. Accordingly  we call for the support of international financial institutions  including the World Bank  to reach the completion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.     10-55276 16   In spite of all those difficulties  the Government has implemented a social policy based on free access to education and exemption from all charges related to maternal health  HIV/AIDS and malaria.   On the environmental front  Chad has taken strong measures to protect the environment  including the prohibition of excessive cutting of green wood  to conserve our forests and savannahs and to fight desertification.   In addition  last June Chad hosted the first summit of heads of State and Government on the establishment of the Pan-African Great Green Wall Agency  and on its programme. Chad was given the honour of hosting the summit  organized by the Sahel countries  because of its pioneering role in the large-scale reforestation of the region. A national programme  “Green Belt”  to plant more than 10 million trees a year throughout the country  began in 2009. Beyond the subregional aspect  such programmes integrate perfectly with global initiatives in the worldwide struggle against the ill effects of climate change  and therefore deserve the international community’s support.  Moreover  in October Chad will host the eighth World Forum of Sustainable Development  whose theme will be “Save Lake Chad”. Lake Chad  part of world heritage  is in danger of disappearing; it has shrunk from 25 000 square kilometres to less than 2 500 square kilometres in 40 years  and is a typical example of the disastrous consequences of climate change. I take this opportunity to invite all people of good will to take part in the Forum in large numbers.  In regard to international issues and the alarming increase in terrorist activities in several regions of Africa and throughout the world  we express our total condemnation of the gratuitous violence that threatens the peaceful and calm existence of innocent citizens.  I turn to the issue of Israel and Palestine. We remain constant in our support for this Organization and the Government of the United States with regard to reaching a peace agreement allowing the peaceful coexistence of two sovereign States. To that end  we support President Barack Obama in his courageous initiative with the two parties. We sincerely hope that his mission will succeed.  Our world has changed considerably over the past 20 years. Peoples and States aspire to greater well-being  freedom and justice. Our common Organization must treat those aspirations as part of its primary vocation. My country therefore again calls on the Assembly to work for Security Council reform  without delay  in order to integrate Africa. The international community must not accept the marginalization of the African continent  which has so much to offer to the world."
"165",6760,"TGO",65,2010,"At the outset  allow me to extend my congratulations and those of the Togolese people to Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session and to wish him every success in the accomplishment of his great task. My delegation will spare no effort in working at his side towards the successful achievement of his mandate. Like him  we are firmly convinced that the values that lie at the heart of the United Nations remain very relevant today to successfully meeting the challenges facing humankind.   I also congratulate his predecessor for his invaluable efforts during his term of office to advance the agenda of the General Assembly in many diverse and different areas  in particular those of peace and security  human rights and the development of our nations.  I would like to renew my personal support and that of my country to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the dynamism he has shown over the course of the past four years at the head of the United Nations. I also take this opportunity to congratulate him on the important report that he introduced to us yesterday on the work of the Organization (A/65/1).  The theme that the President of the General Assembly has proposed for the current session  “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance”  eloquently translates the aspirations of our States  particularly the developing countries. The theme implies that the United Nations must remain at the heart of multilateralism and that the institutions of our Organization must therefore be reconsidered  beginning with the long-awaited reform of the Security Council  in order to bring greater democracy and equity and  above all  to respond more effectively to the many challenges to our world.   In its own search for better governance and the well-being of its people  my country  Togo  has tirelessly and irreversibly continued its march towards greater democracy  freedom and justice in an environment of peace and stability. Seeking to turn the page once and for all on the dark years of our democratic deficit  the Head of State has established a new policy of openness. In August 2006  this commendable initiative led to the signing of the Comprehensive Political Agreement among the main political actors in Togo and to the establishment of a Government of national unity and the holding in October 2007 of legislative elections that were universally recognized as free and transparent and  for the first time  without violence. These elections  which established a pluralist National Assembly  are without a doubt the emblem of our democratic renaissance.   The Government has since initiated political and economic reforms leading to the adoption of a statute of the opposition and of a law on the financing of political parties; the consensus appointment of members of the National Independent Electoral Commission; and the creation of a security force for the presidential elections  the members of which are trained according to universally recognized standards and have maintained security throughout the electoral process in an exemplary fashion. All of these efforts naturally allowed Togo to hold  on 4 March 2010  a presidential election that was democratic  peaceful and widely praised by the international community.   I reiterate here the profound gratitude of the Government and people of Togo to all of our partners     10-54965 42  to regional and international institutions  and to the friendly countries that supported us throughout the electoral process  making it a success and a good example. Our gratitude goes to the United Nations for its many forms of support throughout the process of democratization and consolidation.   I would also encourage the United Nations to invest even more in preventive democracy by  inter alia  beginning to envision mechanisms that could lead all parties to accept the results of elections that are recognized as credible and transparent by the international community. That is a challenge we have to take up  particularly in our young democracies  and especially the African democracies  so that the post-electoral period is no longer a nightmare or a source of division among our peaceful populations.  Notwithstanding his outstanding victory  and faithful to his policy of reaching out to his opponents  President Faure Gnassingbé appealed to all persons of good will to take part in the building of the Togolese nation. It was in this vein that an historic political agreement was concluded in May between the presidential majority and the Union des Forces de Changement  the main opposition party in Togo  which  with seven ministerial posts  has for the first time joined a Government after 40 years of political fighting.   Moreover  the Truth  Justice and Reconciliation Commission  which seeks to promote reconciliation among the Togolese people by shedding light on the political violence that took place in Togo between 1958 and 2005  is currently in the depositions phase. My country will work tirelessly to consolidate the achievements of democracy and peace  while devoting increasing efforts and energy to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in order to bring human and sustainable development to the entire population. Now that Togo has reconciled with itself  I have faith in our capacity to fully renew our relations with all of our bilateral and multilateral partners and to open up new horizons in the vast field of solidarity that is international cooperation.  Although there are some positive signs of the recovery of the world economy  it is no exaggeration to say that the path to stabilization and the suppression of the disturbing effects of the crisis is still long  perilous and uncertain.   The new problem of climate change has brought in its wake catastrophes linked to rainfall phenomena  such as floods  drought and landslides. Without a doubt  all of these phenomena will have a negative impact on global economic growth in general and  more specifically  a tragic effect on the least developed countries in particular. Despite this threat  we still hesitate to reach agreement  as was demonstrated recently by the Copenhagen Conference on innovative and proactive strategies to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions  on the one hand  and  on the other hand  to pursue discussions to adopt as soon as possible a schedule for concluding a new agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol. The time for speeches is over; the time to act is now.  The High-level Plenary Meeting that we have just held here on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals revealed once again the intrinsic link between aid and development  on the one hand  and development and political will  on the other  at the national and international levels. The modest results my country has achieved with respect to the MDGs could have been better  and we would have been closer to attaining them within the deadlines set if we had not been deprived for far too many years of the precious help afforded by development aid.   The peaceful political climate being enjoyed by my country will also enable us to effectively pursue the improvement of the management of our public finances so that we are able to devote more domestic resources to achieving the MDGs. However  the efforts undertaken by poor countries to consolidate the bases of sustainable development will be a genuine success only if developed countries provide them with their various forms of assistance and if they honour their commitments. Let us not close our eyes to this fact. We need better aid in terms of quantity and quality.   Although the international community can welcome the fact that the number of armed conflicts in the world has fallen  we cannot forget that several peacekeeping operations of the United Nations are still under way. That is undeniable proof that we are still far from the ideal of international peace and security that the founding fathers of the United Nations envisaged. Civil wars and terrorism continue to plunge many families into mourning throughout the world. More than wars  terrorism today is the most murderous form of violence inflicted upon people because it attacks indiscriminately  killing children  men  women and the   43 10-54965  elderly. The eradication of terrorism in all its forms is a long-term task and the responsibility above all of States and the international community acting in solidarity. They are obligated to find the best way to fight this phenomenon. In this regard  prevention  protection  prosecution and punishment  as well as international cooperation  must remain the main focus of State action.  While Member States struggle to find a definition of terrorism in order to better fight it  the scourge is affecting an increasing number of countries because of the support that terrorists receive  particularly from drug trafficking networks. In West Africa  all leaders have become aware of the threat posed by drug trafficking and are engaged in a fight to the death against the phenomenon. I call on wealthy countries to help fight drug trafficking in my subregion in order to prevent it from becoming an unstable zone of unrestrained violence.  The purposes and principles for which the United Nations Organization was created are noble  but 65 years after its birth the work that remains to be done is immense because the social situation of the inhabitants of the planet does not always follow the development that our world has achieved. Poverty and destitution are not mere words; they are oppressive realities experienced day by day. They lead to violence  instability  conflicts and other scourges that we  today  are not fighting successfully. Only international solidarity will allow us to overcome the evils of this world."
"166",6805,"THA",65,2010,"Please allow me  Sir  to extend to you  on behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Thailand  our wholehearted congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. You can rest assured of my delegation’s full support and cooperation.  We live in a world of divides. Although the predominantly ideological divide of the Cold War has ended  new divides have come to the fore — politico-security  socio-economic  digital or even based on beliefs. Such divides present challenges to peace  security  prosperity and human dignity. Overcoming them requires that nations work together as one; overcoming them requires a United Nations.  But the effectiveness of such international cooperation depends upon the strength and willingness of individual nations themselves. Thailand is such a nation  willing and ready to cooperate with international partners to help bridge such divides and help the world cross into a better future.  Of course  we are under no illusions about Thailand’s own difficulties and our own current divides. But history has shown that Thailand is a resilient country  and its people are capable of overcoming whatever challenges are thrown before them. Thailand remains a functioning democracy  but we are a relatively young one. Like many other democracies  ours will develop and mature with time. The Thai Government is committed to that and to the principles of democracy  the practice of good governance and respect for human rights.  Have no doubt that our Government is resolutely working to heal the political and social divisions in my country. We are working to address any legitimate socio-economic grievances  with a view to bringing back national unity and confidence. We have launched a national reconciliation plan and set up independent committees  led by eminent persons with the utmost integrity  to propose ways to reform the country and its democratic institutions. We will bridge our country’s divide.  Human rights remain the cornerstone of the Government’s policy. We are looking into any wrongdoings in the past and will ensure that they do not recur and that justice is done. To that end  we have set up an independent fact-finding commission to look into the tragic events earlier this year. Other independent organs  such as our human rights commission  also play a key and active role in safeguarding human rights.  The Thai Government well recognizes that some political grievances mainly arise from the economic disparities in our society. That is a serious issue  and the Government is working to bridge economic and social gaps. We are creating social safety nets through our universal health-care schemes and by providing 15 years of free education  training programmes for the unemployed and support for low-income earners  farmers  the elderly and people with disabilities. Our stimulus packages will benefit not only the overall economy but especially those who are economically and socially disadvantaged and disenfranchised.  Despite our troubles  the Thai economy remains robust  as it and our exports continue to grow steadily. However  we are not complacent  as much remains to be done. We need to better spread economic and social well-being and vitality throughout Thailand  which will also contribute to the reconciliation  trust and stability of the country. To that end  we seek to strengthen Thailand’s creative economy by utilizing our rich cultural and historical heritage and the creativity of both urban and rural Thais to add more value to Thai products and services  so that our productivity and competitiveness are enhanced and our wealth more widely spread.  I think we have proven to the world the strength of our national character and the resilience of our nation. Despite the tragic incidents  Thailand has continued to move forward  not merely for the benefit   17 10-55396  of the country but also for that of the international community. It is evident that we remain an active and responsible Member of the United Nations  ready to enhance our present partnerships and build new ones to help create a better future for the world.   I will now expand upon how Thailand has contributed  and can further contribute  internationally to help bridge the world’s divides.  Many a conflict  whether inter- or intra-State  stems from development disparities and the suffering caused by economic injustice. The world is divided  not simply into have and have-not countries but  rather  into have-more and have-less ones  and into North and South. Thailand therefore believes that in bridging the development gap  global economic growth should be balanced and inclusive  regional economic cooperation and integration should be enhanced and the disadvantaged and dispossessed should not be left behind.  The recent global financial crisis served as a valuable wake-up call for all  reminding us to live within our means. Thailand believes that people-centred development  moderation in economic behaviour and the optimal use of limited resources — as stipulated in His Majesty the King of Thailand’s “sufficiency economy” philosophy — are essential if we are to have sustainable economic development and growth. Thailand has embarked upon that path  and we urge others to follow.  The financial crisis has also alerted us to the necessity of better global governance and the need for reform of international financial institutions  with due consideration for the interests of developing nations  as they are the ones affected the most. Countries must work more closely together to better coordinate fiscal and monetary policies and to improve the regulation of financial institutions.  On our part  Thailand has engaged actively in regional and international forums such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  the ASEAN+3 process  the Group of 20 (G-20) and the United Nations. As ASEAN Chair  Thailand was invited to the G-20 Summits in London and Pittsburgh last year to share ASEAN’s experiences and lessons learned from the 1997 financial crisis.   Thailand believes that regional initiatives like the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization  the Asian Bond Markets Initiative and the ASEAN Economic Community would all help to complement ongoing global cooperation to achieve balanced and sustainable growth  as well as to promote a resilient international financial system that also addresses the concerns of developing countries. We believe that ASEAN  through the ASEAN Chair  will continue to contribute to the forum its relevant experiences in achieving those goals.  As a developing country itself  Thailand stands ready to help others in need. We believe in greater South-South cooperation  for it is fellow developing countries that best understand what is required to help push development forward. We are also active in building partnerships between the developed and developing world  providing a bridge between them through triangular cooperation by adapting technology from developed countries to match the needs of developing ones. We have achieved most of the Millennium Development Goals  and we stand ready to share our knowledge and experience  especially in alleviating poverty and improving well-being in other countries.  We have already done so in our region by cooperating with our neighbours to improve social welfare and build essential infrastructure. Through the Thailand-initiated Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity  the initiative for an ASEAN Integration Strategic Framework  the East-West Economic Corridor  the Greater Mekong subregion projects and bilateral cooperation  we have striven to promote greater technical cooperation in the region and to create and upgrade transport and telecommunication networks to facilitate greater economic activity. Such initiatives ultimately help narrow the developmental divide within the region.  Of the problems of development  food security ranks as one of the most important. For people to live  mouths must be fed. As a major food exporter  Thailand can contribute to ensuring greater food security. We also believe in greater regional cooperation. The ASEAN Plus Three emergency rice reserve stands as a model for other regions to emulate.  Climate change is undeniable. It is happening now. We are all experiencing its effects  which have exacerbated the world’s woes  including food scarcity and natural disasters. Thailand is a developing country actively pursuing voluntary climate-change mitigation efforts. We plan to increase our forest area through    10-55396 18  reforestation and afforestation  as well as our renewable energy usage. Indeed  our eleventh national social and economic development plan  for the years 2012 to 2016  now being drafted  aims to move Thailand towards becoming a low-carbon society.  We are also aiming for green economic growth  with energy used more efficiently and wisely. But the developed world must also play its part in helping others become better equipped to fight climate change. Greater technology transfer is thus a must. We sincerely hope that the sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Cancún  will lead to more concrete and comprehensive results in our fight against climate change.  Development is linked to human security  which is linked to human rights. People must have freedom from want as well as from fear. But while fundamental human rights are universal  how they are guaranteed and promoted differs from country to country in accordance with different belief systems and cultures. Thailand believes that we should bridge such differences by working together towards a more common understanding of human rights and how they must be protected. To this end  forums such as the interfaith dialogues and the Alliance of Civilizations are invaluable contributions to greater common understanding.  I stress again that human rights are a core principle of the Government of Thailand and its foreign policy. Thailand’s election to the Human Rights Council for the years 2010 to 2013  and its election by acclamation to the presidency of the Council in June  is clear testament to the faith of the international community in Thailand’s active and positive role in promoting and protecting human rights. As a member of the Human Rights Council  Thailand aims to reinvigorate the Council to address more effectively human rights problems worldwide. To this end  as President of the Council  we hope to see the review process through to completion by next year. We believe the Council should adopt a more even-handed approach through greater cooperation and engagement with the concerned countries themselves  to establish greater dialogue between States as well as regions and to try to forge consensus among them.  Instead of offering mere criticism and the imposition of values seen as foreign  we must reach out to persuade the countries concerned to understand that human rights are shared values and common to all. Only through true engagement can the Council have a real impact on the betterment of people’s lives and ultimately help pave the way towards peace. Only then can we ensure that the rights of man do not again fall hostage to the wrongs of humankind.  Thailand has striven for this regionally as well. Under Thailand’s chairmanship of ASEAN from July 2008 to the end of 2009  the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights was created to protect and promote human rights and to uphold human dignity. We have also contributed to setting international human rights norms in the area of improving the lives of female inmates  through Her Royal Highness Princess Bajrakitiyabha Mahidol’s  the draft United Nations rules for the treatment of women prisoners and non-custodial measures for women offenders  which have been submitted for the Assembly’s consideration (see A/C.3/65/L.5).  Thailand has also rendered humanitarian assistance to preserve human well-being and dignity injured by natural disasters  not only in nearby places such as Myanmar  China and Pakistan  but also as far afield as Haiti and  most recently  Chad. We remain ready to offer our facilities as a staging centre for humanitarian assistance in our region.  The flames of war can be sparked for many reasons  but none are as combustible as the security divides and power imbalances  real or perceived  that exist between nations as well as within them. Thailand believes that global disarmament and non-proliferation are essential in order to level the security playing field  to dispel that sense of an imbalance of power and security. The United Nations must continue its active role to that end  but major Powers and regional entities must also do their fair share: the Southeast Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty is a good case in point.  Thailand supports international efforts towards the disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We have consistently abided by the relevant Security Council resolutions and are gravely concerned about the threat of the spread of such weapons to terrorists. That is why Thailand has recently joined the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism.   19 10-55396   The maintenance of international peace and security is a serious and costly endeavour  and history has shown that the international community has often acted too late  enforcing and keeping the peace rather than making it. We believe that more should be invested in peacemaking and preventive diplomacy  which are much less expensive than peace enforcement and peacekeeping. It is much better to hold talks than to wage war. It is also far less likely for a community of nations to wage war within itself. That is why ASEAN is steadfastly becoming a community: economically  socially  culturally and politically.  But in cases where peacekeeping has been and is necessary  Thailand has also done its part. In the past two decades  we have contributed nearly 20 000 troops  police officers and civilian staff to United Nations peacekeeping operations worldwide: from Cambodia and Timor-Leste to Haiti and very soon Darfur in the Sudan. Thailand has also recently sent a counter-piracy task force to assist international efforts in patrolling and protecting ships from pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden area. These are our contributions to the maintenance of peace and security worldwide  and we are prepared to do more. Rest assured that as long as there is peace to be kept  the Thais will be ready to help keep it.  However  peacekeeping alone is not enough. The conditions for sustainable peace must be built in post-conflict societies to ensure that blood is not shed again. We believe that sustainable development is crucial to perpetual peace. This is what Thailand is working for  by helping lay the foundations for peace through development during the peacekeeping phase — from the transfer of agricultural know-how in Timor-Leste to the building of essential infrastructure in Burundi. We have also striven for this goal through our membership of the Peacebuilding Commission. Thailand envisages that body playing a greater role in ensuring sustainable peace worldwide.  Thailand itself is poised to play a greater role in ensuring international peace and security. We have presented our candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the term 2017-2018  for which we ask members’ invaluable support. Thailand aspires to work closely with our international partners to ensure that the path towards war is never trodden again  but is rerouted towards peace.  While we believe that the Security Council has so far played an indispensable role in maintaining international peace and security  we also believe that the Council should be adjusted to better reflect world realities in order to tackle today’s global challenges more effectively. Thailand envisions a Security Council working with greater efficiency  transparency and engagement with concerned parties  be they countries  regional organizations or other United Nations bodies. We believe that  through such reforms  the Council would become more effective in maintaining peace and security worldwide.  Thailand is wholly committed to the United Nations and its lofty ideals. Since the birth of the Organization over six decades ago  Thailand has worked closely with the United Nations to advance peace and security  development and human rights around the world. And we will continue to do so. In spite of our problems  our commitment and determination have never wavered.  As a medium-sized and middle-income developing country  Thailand is ready to engage  with — and serve as a connection between — North and South  East and West. As a country with substantial experience in addressing today’s problems  we are ready to help narrow the international gaps in development  human rights and security. Thailand believes that the time to act is now  and we stand ready with our partners to act as a bridge between worlds and to help bridge the world’s divides. "
"167",6830,"TJK",65,2010,"I would like to congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election to the prestigious post of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session and to wish him every success.  Yesterday  the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly finished its work. At the Meeting  world leaders not only reaffirmed their strong commitment to the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) laid down in the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2)  but also announced specific new decisions on their practical implementation.   The leaders who demonstrated their renewed political will availed themselves of a very important and timely opportunity for accelerating the enhancement of concerted efforts at ensuring sustainable progress in the implementation of the MDGs. Further advancement in this area depends on concerted  coordinated and consistent actions by the entire international community  with the United Nations playing a central and coordinating role.  We believe that this firm commitment must be buttressed in every possible way by specific practical measures that will contribute to the full and timely achievement of all MDGs without exception. Against the backdrop of the energy and financial and economic crisis of recent years and the ever-growing impact of climate change  our actions should be supported with adequate financial resources. In this regard  the appeal to double official development assistance  an important component of financing for development  remains urgent. Allocation of additional external funds for development should not aggravate the burden of debt of developing countries whose financial situation has been exacerbated by the world economic crisis.   Strengthening the global partnership is essential if we are to provide an environment conducive to sustainable economic growth and job creation. First and foremost  it is necessary to revitalize global trade and investment  which are the driving force behind industrial growth. Such an approach is of vital importance for landlocked countries  whose participation in global trade is hampered by their geographical location and existing barriers to expanding trade relations  which  in turn  affect industrial growth and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in these countries.    10-54827 32  Efforts should be focused on creating new international transport systems and corridors as well as promoting the efficient use of existing ones  as this will help to end the marginalization of landlocked countries in global trade.   Tajikistan advocates the speedy completion of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations  which will contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Our view is that the international trade system must remain open  equitable  predictable  non-discriminatory and based on agreed rules  especially in a time of crisis.   Our current stage of development is characterized most notably by the fact that we have attained maximum quantitative growth  which must now be followed by new qualitative development. Such a transformation requires an entirely new conceptual approach to development which takes into account the interests of both the present and future generations.   Governed by the principles of sustainable economic development  the Government of Tajikistan has identified three strategic goals  namely  freeing the country from communications isolation  ensuring energy security  and ensuring food security.   In order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  my country adopted and has been implementing the National Development Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan for the period up to 2015 and the Poverty Reduction Strategy. As the country’s major strategic document  the National Development Strategy identifies priorities and the principal lines of Government policy aimed at achieving sustainable economic growth  improving access of the population to basic social services and reducing poverty.   Despite enormous difficulties associated with the global financial and economic crisis and natural disasters  the aforementioned strategies have in the last five years contributed to progress in the achievement of the MDGs.   To accelerate progress towards the aforementioned strategic targets  the Government of Tajikistan intends to address sustainable macroeconomic growth issues  improve the system of government management  develop real sectors of the economy  and rehabilitate and diversify industries  as well as to strengthen the country’s export capacity  improve the investment climate  support trade renewal activities  ensure social protection of the population  develop the labour market and strengthen human resources.   We need to make the transition to sustainable development in order to address such long-term issues as climate change  preservation of biodiversity and prevention of desertification. Finding solutions requires comprehensive and concerted actions. Our efforts to address global climate change need to examined critically  especially in light of last year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen.   The lessons drawn from that meeting should encourage us to take more resolute measures towards mitigation of harmful gas emissions  adaptation to reduce the adverse impact of climate change  and the transfer of technologies that promote transition to a low carbon economy. We are convinced that at the forthcoming meeting in Cancún the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will be able to agree upon those and other dimensions of a new global agreement that will become an important milestone in the post-Kyoto period.   It is known that climate change affects freshwater resources and increases the probability of floods  mudflows  landslides  droughts and other water-related natural disasters. Furthermore  climate change aggravates an acute scarcity of freshwater in certain regions of our planet. For example  in Tajikistan  which is the source of about 60 per cent of the water resources for the entire region  during the last 30 years over a thousand glaciers disappeared  out of a total of 13 000. I will add that Tajikistan’s share of gas emissions is very low. All the electricity in Tajikistan is generated by hydropower stations.   The depletion of groundwater in the world remains a serious problem. According to the available forecast  by 2025 more than one third of the Earth’s population will experience water shortages  and by 2050 the planet will not be able to fully meet its water needs.  Tajikistan  as the initiator of the International Year of Freshwater 2003 and the International Decade for Action  “Water for Life”  2005 to 2015  actively promotes the water agenda in the United Nations. We act not only as the initiator of discussions on water issues in the international arena but also as the initiator   33 10-54827  in adapting specific measures on the sustainable use of this vital resource. All these steps are aimed at an in-depth study of water issues and the development of relevant coordinated actions by the international community.   In that context  the high-level international conference on the midterm comprehensive review of the implementation of the International Decade for Action  held in Dushanbe and organized in cooperation with the United Nations and in compliance with the General Assembly resolution 64/198  has made an important contribution. The conference confirmed once again that further strategies for water use  irrespective of the level at which they are developed  should be based on the principles of sustainable management of freshwater resources. The universal introduction of sustainable development is important for achieving progress in all fields of economic growth and the strengthening of human potential. Those and other recommendations are highlighted in the Dushanbe Declaration on Water (A/65/88  annex)  the outcome document of the conference.   The efforts of Tajikistan in matters of water are aimed at the sustainable and efficient use of the country’s potential and at strengthening mutually advantageous and equitable regional cooperation. We believe that water cooperation should strengthen rather than undermine interaction in other areas. It should increasingly build confidence among all water users and contribute to the introduction of integrated management of water resources at the local  national and regional levels.   With that in mind  we proposed proclaiming the year 2012 as the International Year of Water Diplomacy. We are convinced that the adoption of a relevant resolution by the General Assembly will contribute to overcoming competing interests in the management of freshwater resources through such diplomatic means as early warning  preventive diplomacy and confidence-building measures  mutually advantageous and mutually acceptable regional cooperation  and a dialogue on these issues.  A worldwide move towards the development and use of renewable energy  which considerably reduces harmful gas emissions  is an important component of efforts to address climate change. It is essential to encourage and support in every possible way projects aimed at increasing the proportion of renewable energy used globally  the transfer of new and advanced technologies and enhancing the efficiency of energy supply and energy conservation.   Tajikistan fully supports the initiative on ensuring universal access to advanced energy services and considers it a prerequisite for the successful achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. For this reason  Tajikistan has been developing its energy potential in a consistent and planned manner on the basis of the integrated development of renewable energy sources. Alongside the construction of small and medium-scale hydropower stations  we are considering the implementation of large-scale projects of regional significance and exploring the possibility of using solar and wind energy.  Effective regional cooperation plays a significant role in establishing a global partnership for sustainable development. The specific feature of our region is that development of comprehensive cooperation depends in many respects on the success of the process of strengthening peace and overall stability in Afghanistan.  Counteracting terrorism is a long-term objective because of the multifaceted nature of this phenomenon  which is alien to humanity  and because of its deep roots. It is essential to intensify the concerted struggle for uprooting terrorism by applying the entire range of political  economic  financial and humanitarian measures. We consider it important to speed up the agreement on and adoption of a comprehensive convention on combating international terrorism.  While combating terrorism  one should take into account that terrorism cannot exist without financial and logistical support. It is no secret that today illegal drug trafficking has become one of the major sources of financing for international terrorism. The urgency and magnitude of problems related to drugs and illicit drug trafficking are clear evidence of the global menace that threatens international stability and security at large.  Currently  Tajikistan finds itself between the major world producer of opium and heroin and the countries that consume those drugs. Given that our border with Afghanistan  with a very complex mountain terrain  is almost 1 500 kilometres long  we have to act as a buffer blocking the ever-increasing flow of this “white death”.    10-54827 34   We are absolutely confident that the success in combating narcotics aggression  which yields multimillion-dollar profits to the countries far from Tajikistan  can be achieved only through consolidated and collective efforts. We consider it necessary to get Afghanistan involved in the processes of multifaceted regional cooperation.  In that regard  I would like to underline the efforts by the Quadripartite Group — comprising Afghanistan  Pakistan  Russia and Tajikistan — which is gaining in strength. Within that new format of multilateral cooperation our efforts are aimed at counteracting the terrorist and narcotics threats  which are difficult to uproot unless the problems of poverty  unemployment and other urgent social issues are dealt with. All those efforts will help to strengthen specific global measures to reinforce the peace process. We hope that objectives and goals recently voiced at the Kabul Conference will be put into practice.   Intellectual and creative efforts over recent decades have brought about new principles and norms for sustainable development  set out in Agenda 21  the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. Those historic documents laid down a sound foundation for transition from existing patterns of production and consumption to a sustainable pattern — the paradigm of today.   The whole range of long-term objectives that we confront today demands a clear and sound reconsideration of the actions by the international community in favour of sustainable development. We are convinced that the United Nations should remain the centre for coordination and harmonization of the efforts in this area. At the same time the consolidating role of the United Nations itself should be enhanced by strengthening its capacity to respond to problems in an efficient and appropriate way and to efficiently meet numerous global challenges and the threats of the new millennium. Tajikistan confirms its willingness and commitment to contribute to this process as far as it can."
"168",6865,"TLS",65,2010,"I have been given such a bad spot on the speaking list that I feel as if I am in a Fellini movie  speaking to an empty Hall. Still  because I believe in ghosts  I believe that the friendly ghosts of those who are not present are here to listen  and I profusely thank those who bothered to come on this Saturday afternoon.  Mr. President  in compensation for my having the worst possible time slot in the general debate  when I see you this afternoon I hope you will have a nice box of Swiss chocolates to give to me.  We will not distribute the written version of my speech because no one reads them anyway and it is a waste of paper and money. However  anyone who is curious enough about my speech will be able to find it on the General Assembly’s website. It is a lengthy speech — although I will not compete with Presidents Obama  Ahmadinejad or Chávez — so I will skip through much of it  out of respect for the representatives who have been here for a week listening to many speeches.  Still  I would fail my upbringing if I were not to thank the Mayor of New York and New Yorkers for welcoming us to their city. We sympathize with the residents of this city for the inconveniences we cause them by our presence  even if most people would agree that the United Nations and the numerous meetings held here throughout the year bring enormous tangible and non-quantifiable benefits to the city. I also would like thank the United States federal authorities for their exceptional efforts and professionalism in providing us with a secure and friendly environment.  I have never met Mayor Bloomberg  but he has gone up in our esteem and respect because of his intellectual clarity and moral courage in standing up for the rights of American Muslims in building a cultural centre and a sacred place of worship in lower Manhattan as a venue for reflection  learning and fraternity among cultures and religions. What better place is there than lower Manhattan  near the World Trade Center  to signal the revulsion of American Muslims and moderate Muslims all over the world at the actions of some extremists? I congratulate Mayor Bloomberg for his moral courage and integrity.  I was not present in this Hall when President Ahmadinejad of the Islamic Republic of Iran addressed    10-55109 2  this Assembly a few days ago. I was at Columbia University  addressing an equally important gathering of young students and academics from many countries  cultures and religions. So I did not hear President Ahmadinejad’s latest intellectual concoctions in this Assembly. I will not question the right of anyone to speak his mind. President Ahmadinejad is entitled to believe in and regurgitate whatever intellectual  philosophical or theological concoctions his unique mind may fabricate. However  I do not agree that any of us should disregard the basic rules and practices of conduct among leaders by uttering obscenities in this Assembly. What President Ahmadinejad said in this forum in regard to the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center was an obscenity. He went too far  as he has done many times before in this Assembly and in other forums  as when he has questioned the facts of the Holocaust.  Otherwise  we fully subscribe to Iran’s legitimate right to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes  and we caution the Powers that be not to hasten in reaching conclusions that may lead to irreversible  catastrophic decisions. We do have serious doubts  however  about the reliability and safety of nuclear energy. Let us not forget the lessons of the Three Mile Island accident  which occurred at 4 a.m. on 28 March 1979 in Harrisburg  Pennsylvania  or the even worse Chernobyl nuclear meltdown of April 1986. The recent catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico would pale by comparison with the blow-up of a nuclear energy facility. We do not know whether Iranian rulers do or do not have the desire to be an armed nuclear Power. What we do know  however  is that the possession of nuclear weapons is not a shortcut to super-Power status  as some in Asia seem to think  and does not insure anyone against twenty-first century conventional and non–conventional security threats.  Nuclear weapons were developed as a result of the tragic experiences of the Second World War and of mutual suspicion and fears pervasive among the Powers at that time. They have become obsolete. That is proven by the fact that the mighty Soviet nuclear and conventional arsenals were not able to prevent the implosion of its Empire  the liberation of hundreds of millions of people or the reunification of Germany. Nuclear weapons are not going to be of much help in the ongoing ethnic  religious and border disputes in Asia. We pray to God the Almighty and the Merciful that these weapons and others  chemical and biological  do not ever fall into the hands of extremist non-State entities.  We gathered here from 20 to 22 September to review the progress — or lack of it — on the pledges we solemnly made before our peoples in 2000 to eliminate or at least halve poverty by 2015. In Timor-Leste  we regained independence in 2002  and in the first years of our independence we set out to rebuild our country from the ashes of the violence of the past  lay the foundations of a functioning democratic State  heal our wounds  reconcile our divided communities and normalize relations with past external adversaries. In only eight years and in spite of the overwhelming challenges facing us  we have navigated out of the storms to a new period of peace  stability and economic growth.  Timor-Leste is a least developed country  affected by pervasive poverty. We are still a fragile country  partly because we are only eight years old  and being an infant country  all the institutions of the State are young and fragile. However  the Almighty and the Merciful has blessed us with generous natural resources  such as oil and gas  enabling us to accelerate our overall development.  Timor-Leste was not yet independent in 2000  and it was not until our first Millennium Development Goal report was issued in 2004 that the first targets were set. For the past three years  Timor-Leste has enjoyed real peace and a robust economic growth of over 12 per cent. In the past two years  poverty levels have decreased by as much as 9 per cent. Infant mortality and under-five mortality rates have been reduced and have already reached the 2015 target. School enrolment has increased from 65 per cent in 2007 to 83 per cent in 2009-2010. Adult illiteracy is being gradually eliminated thanks to a joint programme between Timor-Leste and Cuba. We anticipate that  within two to three years  Timor-Leste will be completely free of illiteracy. About 30 per cent of our general State budget is allocated to public health and education. This turn-around is due largely thanks to aggressive public financing of social such programmes as direct cash transfers to the elderly  widows  the handicapped and veterans  and to determined efforts to expand cultivated areas and increase food production.  The first of the 800 Timorese medical students studying in Cuba have returned home. In addition to those studying medicine in Cuba  there are 200 more   3 10-55109  enrolled in the medical school of our national university. In addition  more than 200 Cuban doctors have been assigned to Timor-Leste since 2004  working side by side with Timorese doctors and nurses delivering services to the remotest corners of the country and training our medical and health personnel. The members of the famous Cuban Medical Brigade are true missionaries  as deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize as Mother Teresa.  In Timor-Leste  this year we will finalize our own road map  the 2011-2030 Strategic Development Plan  which will lift our people from centuries of poverty to the level of an upper-middle-income country by 2030.  With regard to the management of our petroleum resources  we are pleased to note that the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in its most recent report of 1 July  rated Timor-Leste number one in Asia and number three in the world for sound  transparent and effective management of our oil and gas revenues.  Women make up almost 30 per cent of the deputies in our national Parliament. Key cabinet positions in the executive branch — finance  justice  social solidarity  prosecutor-general and so on — are held by women. A youth parliament  comprising 130 youth parliamentarians ranging in ages from 12 to 17 years  has been elected and will have its first formal sitting in November. I am pleased that our expectations on balanced gender representation were in fact exceeded. The youth parliament counts 68 girl and 62 boy deputies.  Timor-Leste is proud to have one of the most humanist Constitutions in the world. It prohibits the death penalty and its maximum prison sentence is 25 years. We have also ratified all core international human rights treaties. Our Constitution gives primacy to international law over domestic law  such that all our laws must conform to international law.  As the Head of State guided by humanist beliefs and the relevant provisions of our Constitution  I have issued pardons to individuals who have been tried and found guilty by the courts and have served a number of years with good behaviour. We believe that the pursuit of justice cannot be dissociated from other overwhelming values  such as compassion and understanding of mitigating circumstances.  I wish now to turn to some international issues. We appeal to President Barack Obama to sign an executive order releasing five Cuban citizens who have languished in United States jails for over 10 years and denied family visits. Even visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross have not been authorized. The United States should likewise lift the draconian financial and economic sanctions and trade embargo against Cuba. The Cuban people are among the few in the world who are still suffering the inequities of the cold-war era. It would seem that  for some in the United States and in particular in the State of Florida  the cold war is not over.  The situation in Myanmar is an immensely complex one. It is a vast country fragmented along ethnic lines and plagued by numerous armed groups fighting with different agendas. Based on our own experience  we believe that in order to manage such complex challenges  be it in our own country  Myanmar or anywhere else  we must all show wisdom and engage in patient dialogue with those who do not agree with us so that together we can end conflict and pull our countries out of poverty.  With respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  we commend the Israeli and Palestinian leaders for their renewed dialogue under the auspices of the United States Administration. To those in Palestine who  in spite of decades of suffering and humiliation  have resisted the temptation of extremism and violence  I bow. To those in Israel who have championed the cause of peace and the rights of the Palestinian people  I will say that they represent the very best of the Jewish people — a people who more than anyone else on Earth should understand the suffering and desire of others for freedom.  We urge Hamas to show statesmanship by recognizing the State of Israel. Extremism  fanaticism and indiscriminate violence do harm to the noble Palestinian quest for dignity and freedom. At the same time  we submit that Hamas and Hezbollah are genuine popular movements deeply rooted in the plight of millions of poor  dispossessed  alienated and angry in the Middle East. Labelling them terrorists and refusing to engage and build bridges with such groups is  in our view  not a sound policy.  We urge Israel  a country founded on 5 000 years of history and born of centuries of persecution and war  to show the wisdom and generosity of the Jews by ending the Gaza blockade  allowing unhindered access    10-55109 4  for humanitarian assistance  and ending the land-grabbing and colonization of the West Bank.  On the question of Western Sahara  the aborted decolonization of that territory and the endless plight of hundreds of thousands of Saharans in camps in Algeria constitute an indictment of the international community. This is not an issue as complex as Afghanistan or Palestine. How can we believe that there will be an early resolution of these other seemingly intractable problems when there seems to be little political will to solve the Western Sahara problem?  I believe that I have already exceeded the time allocated to me by one minute and 35 seconds. I have a few more words to say about foreign aid and climate change  but I will skip that in order to respect everybody else  particularly those following me. Allow me only to say two words about United Nations reform.  More than 60 years after its founding  the United Nations has yet to undertake meaningful reform to make it more representative of the world of the twenty-first century and to become more effective. And we are not talking only about an expanded and more representative Security Council. We are talking about making the United Nations and its many agencies and programmes less bureaucratic and more efficient in their internal management and service delivery.  In regard to the Security Council  we restate our view that it has to be expanded to accommodate the new demographic and economic realities of the twenty-first century. Major regional Powers like India and Brazil must be granted permanent member status in the Security Council.  In concluding  on behalf of our people I thank the international community for the steady and generous assistance provided to us in our years of need. We would not have been able to achieve the progress of the past years without the understanding of our friends and partners.  We can all do better in Timor-Leste and elsewhere  and we must. With humility we acknowledge our failings and limitations. We are determined to live up to the expectations of our people and to lead them towards a peaceful and prosperous future."
"169",6881,"TON",65,2010,"I too offer you  Sir  my warmest congratulations upon your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this our sixty-fifth session. Let me assure you  as always  of the cooperation and support of the Tongan delegation. I also express my gratitude to your predecessor His Excellency Mr. Ali Treki for his    10-55408 6  recently concluded term as President at our sixty-fourth session.  I wish to also thank the tireless Secretary-General  Ban Ki-moon  for his resolute leadership of the Organization during these times of unprecedented and challenging global events. We also acknowledge the enduring work of the Organization’s Secretariat and its agencies  and in particular those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the furtherance of that work.  A decade on  the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) continue to reflect our firm global resolve to ensure a durably improved quality of life for all of our peoples — a global pursuit of happiness  if you will. It is no surprise  then  that the MDGs are now a core component of our national development planning.   Tonga has recently produced its second national MDG report  which highlights positive results across the eight Goals. With regard to MDG 1  on the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger  the report suggests that  while the international community acknowledges that Tonga does not suffer from extreme poverty or hunger  there are some households that do suffer hardship  and their needs are being addressed. With regard to Goal 2  the net enrolment ratio in primary education for 2008 was 93 per cent  indicating that Tonga has almost achieved universal basic education. Goal 6  as it relates to halting and reversing the incidence of non-communicable diseases by 2015  and Goal 5  as it relates to universal access to reproductive health  both remain challenges.  Yet despite the continuing uncertain global economic and financial climate  Tonga remains committed  in the five years remaining until 2015  and beyond  to making further strides towards achieving the MDGs. We look forward to completing one such stride on MDG 6 next year  in 2011  with the timely convening of a high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and control of  non-communicable diseases.  The MDGs  in our view  as much as marking the advent of the twenty-first century  reflect our aspirational goals for this millennium beyond 2015. Much of any future progress for Tonga will be contingent on our determination and ability to rely on our own domestic efforts  complemented by the actions of our development partners and the international community.  At the annual meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum leaders held in Port Vila last month  leaders adopted the Port Vila Declaration on Accelerating Progress on the Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  wherein they drew linkages between the attainment of the MDGs and the state of progress in the 19 focal areas of the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation.  If the landmark Barbados Programme of Action placed small island developing States (SIDS) firmly on the global agenda  then the linkages between the MDGs and the Mauritius Strategy +5 Review (MSI+5) serve as an accurate compass for charting the direction that small island developing States  their development partners and the international community need to take to ensure progress. We join others in thanking the good Ambassadors of Luxembourg and Singapore for brokering the consensus outcome of the MSI+5.   Like others  Tonga calls for the creation of a formal SIDS category within the United Nations system that not only improves the internal linkages and infrastructure within the system but ultimately improves its ability to better relate to and respond to the needs of SIDS. Without some measure of adjustments to the manner in which the United Nations system addresses SIDS and SIDS issues  progress will remain stilted.  Climate change properly continues to dominate the majority of statements we have heard this week and last. In the end our collective ability as States could not adequately meet the burden of global expectations in Copenhagen  and many States like Tonga were left to look for what little positive outcome the Copenhagen Accord represents. Therein lies the potential for all of us to reach beyond our narrow national and regional interests in Cancún and embrace our collective responsibility and duty to each other as nation-States  particularly to those States that are most vulnerable  least responsible for this situation and least able to address the capricious whims of climate change.  In taking forward the work of the Pacific SIDS on the consensus resolution entitled “Climate change and its possible security implications” (resolution 63/281)  we would join others in strongly encouraging current and prospective members of the Security Council to seize the moral imperative and follow the momentum by taking positive and proactive action on the resolution. As the final arbiter of international peace   7 10-55408  and security  the Council must ensure it positions itself in an active leadership role on this issue.  Tonga continues to follow the course of the ongoing exchanges among our membership on the reform of the Security Council and the limited progress that has been made to date. An organization such as ours that wishes to retain its broad relevance and global primacy in this day and age has to be open and willing to seriously reconsider those elements that give it a unique and distinctive quality. In our view  the Security Council and its composition constitute one of those elements.  We maintain our support for Council reform. It is already somewhat self-evident that there should be an expansion in both categories of membership  permanent and non-permanent  with certain States — Japan  Germany  Brazil and India — being worthy of permanent membership on an enhanced Council. The permanent membership category must also take favourable account of seats for Africa.   Tonga remains supportive of the substantive efforts for direct talks by President Obama and his Administration  the Quartet and regional neighbours to find a comprehensive  just and enduring peace in the Middle East. Despite the pursuit of the seemingly elusive goal of two States living side by side within secure borders and in lasting peace and genuine security  including a viable Palestinian State that can realize the true potential of its people  we encourage all parties to continue this fresh round of dialogue with a renewed sense of purpose and conviction.  Tonga was one of the 13 Pacific SIDS that participated in an historic summit between Pacific leaders and the League of Arab States earlier this year in Abu Dhabi in order to share perspectives on the current and future challenges faced by our respective regions. That historic summit and its outcome represent the ever-expanding development of Tonga’s foreign policy interests to include countries and regions that had hitherto not been considered. That development comes firmly on the heels of our active engagement with the International Renewable Energy Agency and our continuing interest in the potential of renewable energy and the first-time visit to Tonga and a number of other Pacific SIDS by His Highness Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan to develop relations with our region. In that regard  we acknowledge with appreciation the Partnership in the Pacific Programme and its potential to meet the development aspirations of the peoples of the Pacific.  Earlier this year  Tonga  in compliance with its obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  formally presented its partial submission to the Commission on the Outer Limits of the Continental Shelf. One issue of concern that arose as a result of our formal presentation to the Commission is the likely lengthy time frame for consideration of submissions such as Tonga’s. We encourage our fellow States parties to the Convention to thoughtfully consider the adjustments necessary for the Commission to fulfil its mandate with respect to all States parties in a reasonably timely manner.  Tonga welcomes the successful conclusion of the 2010 review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  particularly  the continuing acknowledgement of the concerns of SIDS over the safe transport of radioactive materials by sea and the announcement by the United States of its intention to pursue ratification of the Protocols to the Treaty of Rarotonga.  When my Prime Minister addressed this body last year  it marked the tenth anniversary of Tonga’s admission as a State Member of the United Nations. Our admission was culmination of a journey towards statehood that began with tentative steps 135 years ago  in 1875  with the granting of Tonga’s Constitution by King George I.  And after 135 years  we realize that our domestic system of governance needs to be strengthened in ways that align itself more readily with the strong and vibrant systems of democratic governance prevalent today. And so  simultaneous with my delivery of these remarks here today is the historic closure of the current session of Tonga’s Legislative Assembly  the last under the existing system of governance. Elections under the new system are scheduled to take place later this year  on 25 November. So while the modalities for improving democratic representation have been enhanced  the fundamental values and freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution continue to protect and support all Tongans.  As any small island developing State appreciates  a presence here in New York represents a significant sacrifice of already scarce resources  but it is made in the knowledge that despite our size  our remoteness and our geographical isolation we are not immune to    10-55408 8  the global challenges that beset us all. Therefore we have a responsibility to our Government and our people to be more than mere bystanders in the work of our Organization.  As such  Tonga reaffirms the rights and responsibilities bestowed upon it by the United Nations Charter  and we pledge in our own way to continue to participate actively and constructively to give an enduring Tongan voice to the global issues of concern to us all. And while many subgroupings and variations of States such as the Group of 20 or the Group of Eight may convene from time to time for a particular purpose or timely nuance  whether it be reforming the international financial governance institutions or reinvigorating international environmental governance  the pivotal role of the United Nations as a viable institution remains constant against an ever-changing backdrop.  Finally  any other 65-year-old might be contemplating retirement  but our Organization’s strength rests as much in the principles of the Charter as it does in the people it must continue to inspire and remain relevant to  especially our young people. During this  the International Year of Youth  the United Nations and all of us must ensure a legacy worth passing on to the next generation."
"170",6921,"TTO",65,2010,"First  I offer my congratulations on your election   Mr. President. I also take this opportunity to recognize the leadership of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  whose influence brought to this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly 139 heads of State or Government to rededicate efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.  It is with a sense of hope for a better world that I address this Assembly of leaders and decision makers. I join the Assembly and the international community in echoing the call for a world where people are again placed at the centre of our actions  where the care of children is given greater priority  where poverty is seen as an enemy of human dignity  where peace can be achieved without bloodshed  where conversations resulting in greater tolerance  mutual respect and understanding would motivate cooperation and unity  and where selflessly sacrificing one’s best skills and resources for the benefit of fellow human beings would be the primary purpose of our actions. I believe that all of this is possible if we recommit ourselves to the founding principles upon which the United Nations was built.  The United Nations must continue to provide a voice to all States whether small or large  developed or developing  industrialized or agrarian. The Charter of the United Nations provides for the sovereign equality of all States. It must be at the centre of all discussions and decisions geared towards meeting the demands of its membership in this third millennium. For that reason  we welcome the theme of this year’s debate: “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance”.  We are of the view  as are many of you  that no nation will be safe and no democracy will prevail if there is no mutual cooperation towards global stability  fashioned by opportunity for all  equity and the ability to feed  provide health care  clothing  housing and education for people everywhere. We are all in this together. We shall rise or fall together.  Let us not take for granted the significance of our presence here. That we can sit in one Hall means that we can also work together to achieve those noble objectives  which foster and promote global peace and stability.  To realize those goals  our debate of this topic must not be reduced to empty rhetoric and nice language. We must reaffirm the essential role of the United Nations in resolving global issues and make the United Nations more accountable. So we must look at a wider definition of global governance.  It is our respectful view that global governance must not only mean agreement on a body of rules  laws or practices that place the United Nations at the centre of all matters which confront the international community; it must also mean that we hold our leaders and institutions more accountable for their actions  delivering a better quality of life for all our peoples. No nation large or small must be exempted.  Global governance cannot be limited to the crafting of instruments related to the promotion of democracy. A key component must be the creation of fair and equitable rules to enhance the development prospects of developing countries as well. We recognize the rules governing membership of groups such as the Group of 20 (G20)  but a mechanism must  we believe  be established to insert the voice of the United Nations in the activities of those groups  such that the concerns and needs of all Members are actively considered. Trinidad and Tobago therefore calls for the establishment of predictable and regular channels to facilitate dialogue between the G20 nations and Members of the United Nations  which constitute the “Group of 192” or the “G192”. It is our hope that some of those issues will be examined at the next G20 Summit  scheduled in November of this year.  At the same time  Trinidad and Tobago  as Chair-in-Office of the Commonwealth  calls on the General    10-55128 22  Assembly to recognize the important work being done by the Commonwealth  especially as it relates to small and vulnerable economies. The international community must do more to deal with the economic plight of its most vulnerable Members  which depend heavily on the flow of international capital and trade to ensure that their development needs are met. Trinidad and Tobago intends to use its position as Chair of the Commonwealth to promote enhanced cooperation between the United Nations and the Commonwealth so as to facilitate measures aimed at providing development financing in a predictable manner to developing countries. This would mean a willingness on the part of international financial institutions to re-examine whether some of their policies have been creating a perpetual cycle of poverty for small nations. Such a cycle must not be allowed to continue.  A few days ago I participated here in the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals. Since then  the question that keeps lingering in my mind is whether we would have to convene another meeting in the future — shortly — to restate the urgent need to provide the necessary assistance to developing countries  so that they can meet the MDGs. While I applaud the noble efforts of the United Nations in providing an enabling environment for leaders to exchange ideas and to formulate solutions on the subject  I must confess that over the years we have had ample rhetoric but insufficient action on this matter.  In my country we have put in place a Ministry of the People to deal with poverty eradication and hunger as a priority. This is just one vehicle aimed at placing us in a position to honour our commitments to reduce poverty. However  we are of the firm view that international cooperation is also essential. Good governance requires that developed countries fulfil their commitments made at the Millennium Summit to provide assistance to developing countries  so that those countries can achieve the MDGs by the deadline set. The deficit in commitment has to be addressed if real advances are to be made. We all have a duty to the future. It will be measured by how we fulfil our responsibilities today.  My Government has created the Children’s Life Fund to provide funding and critical support for children needing life-saving surgery. It is our belief that children must not die in our country — or in any other country — because they cannot afford health care — not in the year 2010. There must be new arrangements and relationships between countries that have advanced medical technology and those without  so that children of the poorest nations can grow as healthy human beings and achieve their full potential. It is only when this is done that the world will progress.  My colleague from Grenada spoke about  non-communicable diseases. Trinidad and Tobago  joined by other members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  has reiterated that call for international attention on the issue of the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. We have agreed that in September 2011 a high-level meeting of the General Assembly on non-communicable diseases will be convened (resolution 64/265). Much work remains to be done  if we are to have a successful meeting next year. In order to achieve the desired results  the United Nations will have put in place a common set of principles to tackle this important concern of global public health.  On the issue of climate change  we say that Trinidad and Tobago  as a small island developing State  seeks to promote and safeguard the welfare of our planet from the harmful effects of climate change and supports measures aimed at mitigating the effects of climate change  which threaten our environment  economic livelihood  territorial integrity and the very survival of many States. Although the United Nations continues to be at the forefront of discussions to confront this formidable challenge  progress has been much too slow. In making our contribution to the process  we wish to reiterate the position of the Alliance of Small Island States  namely  that there should be deep and ambitious cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by developed countries amounting to about 40 to 50 per cent by the year 2020 and 85 to 90 per cent by 2050.  In order for there to be meaningful advancement at the sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Mexico  we must utilize the coming United Nations Climate Change Conference  to be held in China  to agree on the identification of additional and predictable sources of finance  institutional issues related to finance and the form of the final agreement. It is our respectful view that urgent and concerted action is the only viable option to bring about results at the upcoming negotiations.   23 10-55128   I turn now to the issue of natural disasters. One of the first problems I encountered  almost immediately after taking the oath of office four months ago  was the issue of unprecedented and widespread flooding that resulted in tremendous financial and other losses to victims and placed a strain on the resources of the local emergency management services. My Government continues to provide assistance to the affected communities  while we devise long-term strategies to reduce the incidence of this type of flooding. Nevertheless  I recognize that we are not alone to have been faced with this grave problem. Recent events in Haiti  Pakistan and Russia have demonstrated that greater international action is needed to provide relief to those affected by flooding and other natural disasters.  In the Caribbean the case of a devastated Haiti provides the international community with the opportunity not only to be compassionate  but to also learn major lessons on disaster preparedness and management. Respectfully I say that — notwithstanding the valuable work being done by the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF)  to which Trinidad and Tobago has made annual contributions — more action is required to provide the agency with the requisite resources in the face of ever increasing natural disasters. In this regard  I respectfully call upon those States that are in a position to do so to make financial contributions to CERF  so that it can respond more efficiently and effectively to humanitarian crises due to floods and other natural disasters.  There is another persistent matter receiving the attention of my Government and others of the CARICOM region  which is the illegal proliferation of small arms and light weapons and their ammunition. In our attempts to address this problem  we have had to divert financial resources that we could have used otherwise for economic and social development. We have observed an increase in gang-related violence  homicides  the illegal narcotics trade and organized crime. The origin of the illicit trade in those weapons is beyond our national borders. It is of international dimension and therefore requires a global response. We are encouraged by the attempts of the United Nations to conclude a legally binding agreement to regulate the trade in conventional weapons. It is our view that this instrument must also make provision for regulating the trade in small arms and light weapons  thereby preventing their illegal diversion.  Trinidad and Tobago also calls for a strong and effective implementation regime to ensure proper compliance with the provisions of the treaty to be drafted. It must also include a proper verification mechanism and a sanctions regime for breach of its terms. Such safeguards would assist in preserving the object and purpose of the agreement.  We have partnered with other members of the international community to establish rules governing the non-proliferation of nuclear  chemical and other types of weapons  which could create untold suffering for humanity. However  in the Caribbean  our weapons of mass destruction  are  ironically  small arms and light weapons. Therefore I implore all those States that have been reticent about the need for an arms trade treaty to join us in this undertaking. I pledge the commitment of my Government to work with other like-minded States to ensure a successful outcome of the Preparatory Committee for the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty and ultimately the Conference itself  scheduled to take place in 2012.  Tied together with the issue of small arms and ammunition is drug trafficking. Regulating the trade in small arms and light weapons is not an end in itself. Urgent international action must also be taken to deal with the issue of international drug trafficking. We cannot allow our young people to continue to fall victim to this monster  which has fuelled transnational organized crime and resulted in cross-border armed violence  threatening the political and social stability of many nations. National Governments alone cannot solve this problem because of its global dimension. Governments are forced to divert scarce resources  which should be used for social programmes  in order to confront the challenge posed by narco-trafficking. We need urgent action to address this problem.  In 1989  the Honourable Arthur Robinson  former Prime Minister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago  took the political initiative to reintroduce on the agenda of the General Assembly the need for the establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court (ICC). The Court has since been established. However  his call for international drug trafficking to be included as a crime within the jurisdiction of the ICC has not yet been realized. Today  I say that it is even more critical for this to be done. I therefore respectfully call upon States Members of the United Nations which are States parties to the Rome Statute of the ICC to include international drug trafficking as a    10-55128 24  crime within the jurisdiction of the ICC. The ICC is the only credible international judicial organ with the competence to prosecute those who perpetrate this crime.  In closing  I wish to raise one area of reform that I hold very dearly. That is the establishment of  UN Women  an entity which consolidates four previous agencies. I am confident that this venture  which will become fully operational by January 2011  will provide a coherent approach in attending to issues affecting women internationally. It is my hope that UN Women will receive the support of all States.  Finally  10 years ago the Security Council adopted resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security  acknowledging that there can be no sustainable peace and security without the involvement and contribution of women. Trinidad and Tobago is committed to advancing the peace and security agenda of the United Nations  and my country’s attachment to the promotion of women is equally strong. That is why I wish to state that Trinidad and Tobago will introduce in the First Committee of the General Assembly  devoted to disarmament  international peace and security  a resolution on women  disarmament  arms control and non-proliferation. I pledge the support of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago for this initiative.  We have spent a decade in this third millennium. In retrospect  have we advanced as a world community in ways that will create a sustainable environment and secure the lives of people everywhere? Yes  we have made tremendous strides in communications technology; yes  we are a global village as a result of improvements; but  regrettably  we cannot say that we are our neighbours’ keepers. There are still too many fences between us — fences of politics  ideology  religion  ethnicity  culture and traditions. As human beings  we have the unique capacity to reason and on the basis of that reasoning to develop deeper understandings. Today  I respectfully say: Let us pledge to use this understanding gained from reasoning to promote conversations between nations and peoples; conversations to replace aggression and threats; conversations geared towards finding peaceful ways to deal with differences; conversations borne out of mutual respect for each other as people and nations; conversations founded upon respect for diversity; conversations that ensure the survival of the human race and the planet as their purpose.  As I end my contribution to this debate  I wish to compliment the United Nations for all of the work designed to revitalize this unique global body. I also affirm our support for efforts and policies aimed at revitalizing the central role of the United Nations in global governance."
"171",6968,"TUN",65,2010,"First  Sir  I warmly congratulate you and the friendly Swiss Confederation on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session  and wish you every success in your noble mission. We are convinced that your great political and diplomatic experience will provide the best conditions for the success of this session and enrich its contents. This will help achieve the objectives and aspirations we all cherish  especially as regards the theme of the general debate: “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance”.  I take this opportunity to renew my congratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki and to the sisterly Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  for his valuable efforts as President at the sixty-fourth session  his deep knowledge of international affairs and his wise approach in dealing with crucial  complex and delicate issues  thus serving the interests of our peoples and nations and enhancing the role of the General Assembly in international relations.  I also wish to express my great respect to Mr. Ban Ki-moon  the Secretary-General  for his commendable efforts at the head of the Secretariat to further enhance the position of our prestigious Organization and promote its performance  so that it can meet the many challenges posed on the international scene. In this context  Tunisia reaffirms its support for all the efforts of the Secretary-General  and of the United Nations in general  to promote peace  stability  security and development in all countries of the world.  Tunisia highly values the important historic step made during the previous session in the process of reforming the United Nations. I refer to the adoption of resolution 64/289  which reaffirms the importance we all attach to the development of the United Nations system and the promotion of complementarity between its activities and programmes. That applies especially to those pertaining to women  for whom a new unified Entity has been created to deal with all issues related to gender equality and the empowerment of women. I take this opportunity to renew our congratulations to its head  Ms. Bachelet. We wish her every success.  Under the leadership of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali  Tunisia attaches crucial importance to these issues. Women  in fact  have a strategic role in our civilizational project  and are considered a partner in making all our national choices. Tunisia strongly believes that democracy cannot be built  and comprehensive development cannot be achieved  without the active involvement of women in public life  and that promoting society to higher levels depends on enhancing the conditions of women in all fields. This conviction stems from our vision of human rights in their comprehensiveness  inseparability and complementarity.  The prestigious status that Tunisian women enjoy today is confirmed by figures and indicators pertaining to human development and women’s involvement in all fields. They now represent 30 per cent of the country’s working population. They hold 30 per cent of decision-making positions and other positions of responsibility. They represent 33 per cent of the judicial corps — judges and lawyers — and 42 per cent of the medical corps. In higher education  girls account for 60 per cent of the total number of students. In the legislative branch  women’s presence has been reinforced to reach 30 per cent in the Chamber of Deputies and 16 per cent in the Chamber of Advisers.  It is indeed a source of pride for Tunisia to be ranked first internationally in terms of fighting violence against women and guaranteeing their right to free movement and ownership of property  to be ranked first in the Arab world in terms of offering women opportunities for economic participation  and to be ranked first in Africa in terms of women’s per capita income.  The Tunisian presidency of the Arab Women Organization (AWO)  in the person of Tunisia’s first lady  is in line with that approach. Mrs. Leila Ben Ali   7 10-55276  has endeavoured to spread the culture of gender equality  to further improve the condition of women in Arab societies  to allow them to enjoy their rights and accomplish their duties  and to preserve their dignity. All this  in fact  constitutes a civilizational and strategic stake and an integral part of the concept of Arab national security and human security in all its dimensions.  As part of the various pioneering initiatives and activities of the Arab Women Organization  Tunisia will next month host the third AWO Conference  with the theme “The Arab woman  a partner in sustainable development”.  Since the change of 7 November 1987  Tunisia has adopted a comprehensive and balanced development policy based on the inseparability of the economic and social dimensions  a policy that reconciles the requirements of an economy based on the principles of profitability and efficiency and an equitable social policy in which there is no room for exclusion or marginalization  guaranteeing a decent life for all citizens.  The electoral programme of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali for the 2009-2014 term of office  “Together we meet the challenges”  and the five-year development plan for the period 2010-2014 have both made a reality of those choices  reflecting a determination to further enhance the process of democracy and pluralism  to move political life in Tunisia towards further modernity and continuous reform  and to launch a new process of development based on the economy of knowledge and intelligence.  As part of that ambitious  future-oriented plan  Tunisia has attached crucial importance to youth as the pillar of the present and the builder of the future  through regularly organizing national youth consultations to explore the concerns  expectations and views of young people. The results of those consultations are taken into consideration in preparing development plans. Furthermore  Tunisia proclaimed 2008 the Year of Comprehensive Dialogue with Tunisian Youth. That event  with massive participation by different youth categories  was crowned with the adoption of a Youth Pact signed by all the national organizations concerned and the elite of Tunisian youth.  Keen on consecrating this policy at the international level and on involving the world community in supporting it  our country launched during the previous session of the General Assembly an initiative to proclaim 2010 International Year of Youth  to consolidate the position of youth in all societies of the world  youth being at the forefront of the forces of progress embracing noble universal values. Tunisia expresses its deep pride over Member States’ unanimous support for this initiative  which the General Assembly adopted in resolution 64/134.   Tunisia also takes pride in the fact that on 12 August the Secretary-General himself chaired the launch of the festivities celebrating the International Year of Youth; he did so at Headquarters  in the presence of hundreds of representatives of the world’s youth.  Tunisia calls on all Governments  international and regional organizations  and youth institutions  to establish adequate plans of action  programmes and activities to celebrate the International Year of Youth in a way that makes a reality of its motto  “Dialogue and mutual understanding”  and leads to the adoption of an international pact to bind the world’s youth to common universal values. I take this opportunity to express Tunisia’s appreciation for the initiatives of Turkey  Singapore and Mexico in organizing important international youth events last August.  Throughout its modern history  Tunisia has remained committed to the principles and values of peaceful coexistence  good-neighbourliness  fraternity and mutual support. It has tirelessly endeavoured to promote relations of fraternity  friendship and cooperation with all peace-loving countries  and has invariably advocated peace  security and justice in the world.  Since the change of November 1987  Tunisia has given particular attention to the promotion of relations of fraternity and cooperation with Arab Maghreb countries  based on its strong belief in the unity of destiny and the inevitability of Maghreb integration. While reaffirming its adherence to the Arab Maghreb Union as a historic gain and an irrevocable strategic choice  Tunisia is committed to pursuing efforts jointly with sisterly Maghreb countries to realize the aspirations of the Maghreb peoples for complementarity  integration and solidarity. This commitment stems from a deep common civilizational  historic and geographic belonging  and is imposed by the successive economic fluctuations and the deep and ever-accelerating changes taking place in our world today in all political  social and cultural fields.  At the Arab level  Tunisia will firmly pursue its efforts to promote joint Arab action and establish solid    10-55276 8  foundations for an efficient inter-Arab economic complementarity.  Tunisia has continuously played an efficient role in dealing with Arab causes  in the forefront of which is the Palestinian cause  through its firm and unwavering position supporting the brotherly Palestinian people at all stages of their legitimate struggle  and calling for a fair  durable and comprehensive solution that can put an end to the suffering of our Palestinian brothers and allow them to recover their legitimate national rights and establish their independent State on their land.  In this context  Tunisia expresses its deep concern about the situation in the Middle East  as a result of Israel’s disrespect for international legality and the basic principles of the peace process  its persistence in the settlement policy and its attempts to obliterate the Arab-Muslim identity of the city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif.   Tunisia expresses its hope that the resumption of direct peace talks  launched on 2 September in Washington under the sponsorship of the United States  will meet the legitimate aspirations of the brotherly Palestinian people.   We also call on all the influential parties on the international scene  particularly the Quartet  to act to bring Israel to adhere to the requirements of peace  on the basis of international legality  the principles of the peace process  and the Arab Peace Initiative  and in accordance with a specific time schedule that covers all the relevant main points.  Tunisia also reiterates its call for an end to the Israeli occupation of the Syrian Golan and the remaining occupied Lebanese territories  in accordance with international legality  so that all the peoples of the region can enjoy security and peace  and devote their efforts to construction and development for a better future.  Moreover  Tunisia hopes that the efforts made will promote peace and security in Iraq  Yemen  the Sudan and Somalia  within a climate of unity and national harmony.  Tunisia attaches particular importance to its belonging to Africa  based on its belief in the importance of its integration in its geographic environment and the expansion of the fields of cooperation and solidarity with sisterly African countries. Since the 7 November change  our country has endeavoured to realize this policy by reaffirming its commitment to the principles of the African Union  and continuously supporting all initiatives aimed at promoting the continent  achieving development for its peoples  and preserving its potentialities  within a climate of security and stability.  Tunisia has spared no effort to contribute to the promotion of peace and security in the African continent  through participating in United Nations peacekeeping operations  supporting conflict-prevention mechanisms  and continuously acting for the eradication of hotbeds of tension.  Moreover  our country has continuously called on African countries to play an active role and to find adequate solutions to their problems through activating the central organ of the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management and Resolution  the first regional experience of preventive diplomacy  then through the African Peace and Security Council  which has helped re-establish stability in a number of sisterly African countries.  We reaffirm Tunisia’s support for all the efforts of the African Union  which proclaimed 2010 the Year of Peace and Security in Africa  so that peace and stability would reign all over the continent  which is a responsibility of the international community as a whole.  In line with those principles and with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  Tunisia calls on developed nations to act promptly to meet the needs of the African continent and of developing countries in general  by using the existing international and regional mechanisms to ensure decent living standards for African peoples.  I take this opportunity to stress the need to activate the World Solidarity Fund  created by the General Assembly in 2002  upon Tunisia’s initiative  to serve as an efficient international mechanism for sustainable development  capable of achieving the MDGs  particularly the Goal of reducing the poverty rate by half by 2015.  At the Euro-Mediterranean level  Europe is currently an essential partner of Tunisia in various fields. Our country has time-honoured historic relations with Europe. Yet we consider that our relations still need to be further enhanced and developed  through an equitable  solidarity-based partnership that rests on mutual respect and is in line with our strategic and civilizational choices in terms of political reform and   9 10-55276  economic  social and cultural development. This will strengthen the ties of cooperation and solidarity  and help reduce disparities between the countries and peoples of the two shores of the Mediterranean. On the basis of those principles Tunisia supported the establishment of the Union for the Mediterranean  a promising initiative that can create a new dynamism in Euro-Mediterranean relations  promote a positive interaction to meet the coming challenges  and enhance security and stability in our Mediterranean region.  Tunisia is endeavouring to respond positively to the huge changes occurring on the international scene  by developing the mechanisms of consultation and cooperation with all the American and Asian countries. Our country attaches great importance to the promotion of its relations with large regional blocs in the American and Asian continents  so as to enrich cooperation and explore new fields for a strong partnership serving mutual interests. In this context  at the end of this year Tunisia will host the Japan-Arab Economic Forum. It will also host  in 2012  the Fifth Ministerial Meeting of the China-Arab Cooperation Forum.  Tunisia is also keen on promoting rapprochement with South American countries  within an Arab or African framework.  The values of mutual support and solidarity  which constitute the pillar of our country’s policy and orientation  and which have now become a deeply-anchored tradition  demand that we give immediate assistance to countries stricken by natural disasters  which cause thousands of deaths in many countries of the world. Tunisia has responded promptly to the urgent calls by the Secretary-General to help disaster-stricken countries  such as Pakistan  which was recently ravaged by floods  and Haiti  which early this year was hit by a devastating earthquake  in which Tunisia and the United Nations lost one of their eminent diplomats  known for his great competence and generous devotion  the late Hédi Annabi  head of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti.  Today  the world urgently needs to adopt an efficient policy to protect the environment  so as to spare humanity the adverse consequences of climate change  which over the past three decades has caused the international community huge economic losses.   The Assembly is certainly aware that climate change has a serious impact on stability in many countries  given the many problems caused  especially by global warming  drought and floods  and the resulting degradation of harvests and scarcity of water resources. Once again  Tunisia underlines the need to accelerate the pace of international talks on climate change  while giving priority to human interests over economic benefits  so as to reach an agreement guaranteeing that a minimum of measures will be taken to meet the huge challenges posed by climate change  particularly in the developing and the least developed countries.  Tunisia calls for the establishment of a decisive intervention programme to help remedy the effects of climate change and the problems it causes in terms of ecosystems  farming policies  and international food security in general. In this context  Tunisia reiterates its support for the African position and underlines the importance of helping African countries to face the effects of climate change. Tunisia commends the attention given by Japan and Korea to this issue. We hope that the forthcoming Mexico summit will produce positive results that can help achieve the objectives in this vital field.  At the present session the Assembly has devoted a large part of its agenda to the evaluation of our countries’ achievements in the implementation of the MDGs  five years before 2015. Implementing the Goals and meeting the challenges resulting from the new world order  with the deep changes that it has generated  require that we step up action to embody the principles of the Charter in international relations  and to anchor the culture of dialogue and the values of tolerance  civilizational communication and solidarity among peoples.  Tunisia reaffirms its determination to continue actively contributing to joint international action to find adequate  fair and durable solutions to current problems  through joining in all efforts based on dialogue  mutual respect  consensus and mutual support within the framework of the United Nations. That is the ideal framework for international action to promote security  peace and stability in the world  so that our peoples can apply all their efforts and capacities for comprehensive and sustainable development and for realizing their legitimate aspirations for prosperity and a decent standard of living.  The current international situation can only strengthen our adherence to the United Nations and its founding principles  and bolster our determination to    10-55276 10  reaffirm its central role in meeting challenges and to confer more efficiency on its activities and programmes  given its pivotal role in global governance.   In this regard  Tunisia hopes that Member States will reach the largest possible consensus for introducing the necessary reforms into the United Nations system  especially as regards the composition of the Security Council  and for giving more transparency and efficiency to the Organization’s performance; that is in addition to further enhancing the role of the General Assembly  which includes all the Member States  and that of the Economic and Social Council.  To conclude  I once again wish all success to the Assembly at the current session  at which we hope it will make constructive recommendations that serve all the peoples of the world  promote peace and stability  offer wider prospects for progress and prosperity  and help meet challenges with confidence and efficiency."
"172",7015,"TUR",65,2010,"The mission of the United Nations is to protect the dignity  security and well-being of all human beings. Therefor  peace  security  stability and general welfare constitute the tenets of Turkey’s work and action in the United Nations. Since this Assembly gave us an overwhelming mandate for Turkey’s non–permanent seat on the Security Council  we have worked hard  sincerely  objectively and effectively to contribute to peace  security and the welfare of the international community.  In these two years  we have tried to offer added value  in a fair and principled manner  in addressing various global and regional issues. We have sought to advance the discussions within the Council on an issue to which we have always accorded high priority: peacekeeping and peacebuilding. Indeed  this afternoon  we will be holding a Security Council summit to exchange views and ideas on this matter at the highest political level. Furthermore  next Monday  we will hold a thematic debate of the Security Council on counter-terrorism.  Terrorism is indeed a leading and most pressing challenge for the international community on the global scale. It cannot be countered without sincere  effective  cohesive and concrete international cooperation. I would like to recall that our struggle against terrorism is bound to fail unless we fight all terrorist organizations  irrespective of their supposed political  ideological  ethnic or religious aims.  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is one of the risks of our contemporary world. We cannot overcome that menace unless all Member States  including nuclear States  adopt a just and principled approach to their respective policies. Establishing a credible global non-proliferation regime will not be possible if we ignore the de facto existence of nuclear weapons in certain countries at the heart of some of the world’s most delicate regions.  In this context  I would like to call on all Member States to intensify their efforts to create a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East  as was envisaged in Security Council resolution 687 (1991)  and as has been repeatedly called for by the General Assembly. We also support the calls made in May at the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons for convening a conference on a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East in 2012. I believe that such an initial step would be a sine qua non for all non-proliferation initiatives in the rest of the world.  In responding to those security challenges  we should keep in mind that global problems cannot be solved unilaterally  bilaterally or within a small circle of like-minded nations. Therefore  it is more important   25 10-54827  today than ever for us to adopt a multilateral approach to global problems.   One such problem is the current global economic crisis. Though we are in a slow recovery  the impact of the crisis is still being felt today. We must draw the proper lessons from it in order to avoid a recurrence of similar shocks in the future. That crisis was caused by the irresponsible acts of some financial institutions in the most developed markets. Ordinary people have paid the highest price for the mistakes of a few in developed nations. The current economic crisis revealed once again the weakness and deficiencies of the existing global and national financial and economic architectures  which lack effective governance and regulations to oversee reckless financial institutions.  The Turkish economy  however  has managed to stay on course in spite of the world economic crisis  thanks to previously undertaken comprehensive economic and financial measures. Within the Group of 20 (G-20)  we strongly support the efforts of international forums aimed at restoring global growth and streamlining financial practices. We believe that the G-20 should continue to play a central role in putting together the right policies and measures to those ends.  The situation of the least developed countries has worsened in the aftermath of the global crisis. Every effort should therefore be made to integrate those countries into the global economy. In that endeavour  we should act according to the principles of free and fair trade and avoid protectionist tendencies. It is with these thoughts that we look forward to the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  to be organized next year in Istanbul.  During the past decade  Turkey’s economic indicators improved  as did its development assistance. Our relatively greater means have enabled us to contribute more to the development of others. Turkey has now evolved into an emerging donor. With the contribution of Turkish-based non-governmental organizations  our overall development assistance exceeds $1.5 billion annually. Through the Turkish International Cooperation and Development Agency  we allocate that amount to diverse capacity-building projects  in fields such as health  education  agriculture and infrastructure.  Developing nations are also more exposed than others to the gravest threats of four interconnected problems: global warming  climate change  epidemics and food security. In recent years  tragedy has struck many nations because of the adverse impact of climate change around the world. Some parts of our planet are experiencing severe drought  while others have been hit by devastating floods. The current plight of Pakistan is a reminder that this has become a pressing issue that calls for urgent remedial action. We must acknowledge that a sustainable environment is an indivisible global public good for humankind. We must therefore assume collective responsibility for preserving it. Billions of lives  not just today but also of future generations  will depend on the actions we take now.  The global food crisis is another urgent concern. It poses a worrying challenge to coming generations. These compelling economic  demographic  ecological and biological challenges oblige us to redefine the notion of security. Such issues no longer fall into the category of soft risks  but rather pose a clear and present threat to humankind.   In the face of such overwhelming threats  it is time to take global action within the United Nations framework. To that end  I call on Member States to explore the possibility of establishing a global rapid-reaction capability to effectively tackle natural and ecological disasters  food shortages and epidemics. This would also help to maintain international peace and security by mitigating threats that arise from weak governance  the collapse of public order and domestic or inter-State conflict over diminishing natural resources.  If we allocate a small fraction of our defence expenditures to financing and establishing a peacekeeping capability  we will have more cost-efficient results in maintaining peace and stability in the world. Moreover  if we could pool some of our defence equipment — equipment that has lost its effective utility in military terms but is still relevant for disaster-relief operations — we could swiftly improve such rapid-reaction capability. Of course  existing regional capacities could be instrumental in this global endeavour. All such resources should be channeled directly to those in need  and not eroded by excessive administrative costs.  On the political side of our agenda  there is no shortage of enduring regional issues. Because of time    10-54827 26  constraints  I will touch only briefly on some of them here.   Permanent peace in the Middle East is the key to a peaceful and stable future for the world. Unfortunately  the absence of peace there has had serious and adverse strategic consequences for the rest of the world. Turkey has therefore always supported every effort aimed at reaching a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. In this understanding  we appreciate President Obama’s efforts and welcome the direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. We hope that this new engagement can take us closer to a viable and fair settlement.  On the other hand  it will be very difficult to make progress towards permanent peace unless we put an end to the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza. In this context  the attack in May of the Israeli armed forces on the international humanitarian aid convoy on the high seas resulted in grave civilian casualties and was an unacceptable act  in clear violation of international law. In the light of international law  Turkey expects a formal apology and compensation for the aggrieved families of the victims and the injured people.  Therefore  we attach particular importance to the work of the panel of inquiry and the fact-finding mission. We are pleased to have received the report (A/HRC/15/21) of the fact-finding mission established by the United Nations Human Rights Council. The report offers a solid legal framework for establishing the facts of the incident. We also look forward to the successful completion of the work of the panel.  As for Iraq  the elections of 7 March marked a new period for the people of that country. Nevertheless  the post-election political stalemate is aggravating the security situation and hindering the launch of a comprehensive reconstruction programme. We sincerely hope that the new Government in Iraq will reflect the balance that emerged at the elections. The new Government must be inclusive  effective and democratic. In the aftermath of the withdrawal of foreign combat troops  we also urge all neighbours of Iraq to act responsibly and support the territorial integrity  political unity and sovereignty of Iraq. We must all help the Iraqi people in their quest for a better future.  Our contributions to international efforts in the search for an urgent and peaceful settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue will also continue. This controversy can be resolved only in conformity with International Atomic Energy Agency norms and obligation under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  and in respect for the right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. In this vein  the Tehran Declaration and the July gathering in Istanbul provide a window of opportunity to be seized. We believe that there is no alternative to diplomacy.  As a Balkan country  Turkey attaches cardinal priority to the peace  stability and economic development of the Balkans. In recent years  we have actively engaged in result-oriented initiatives in the Balkans by intensifying our high-level bilateral visits to Belgrade and Sarajevo. Moreover  the launching of trilateral cooperation mechanisms with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia  on the one hand  and with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia  on the other  was of historic significance. Through these mechanisms  we are trying to create a new atmosphere of mutual understanding and cooperation among those nations. I believe that the integration of the western Balkan countries into the European and Euro-Atlantic structures would be a decisive final step for the resolution of conflicts in the region.   As for the Caucasus  we remain committed to pursuing our efforts in search of a comprehensive and sustainable peace in the region  while respecting the principle of territorial integrity. In recent years  we have all seen how frozen conflict can easily turn into active clashes in the region. Given this context  we attach particular importance to the peaceful resolution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.  Any failure in Afghanistan will certainly have unpredictable consequences for the international community. Therefore  Afghanistan deserves our close attention and sincere commitment. Afghanistan is going through a historic process of transformation. As military operations continue  there must be a simultaneous and growing emphasis on civilian efforts to win the hearts and minds of the Afghan people. Turkey’s commitment to Afghanistan is open-ended. We will continue our assistance as long as the Afghans require it.   Supporting Pakistan’s democracy is also of singular importance  not only in and of itself  but also to the stability of the region as a whole. In the wake of the terrible disaster caused by the floods  it is critically   27 10-54827  important to support the people and the democratic Government of Pakistan in healing their wounds.  Africa is another region that requires the international community’s collective responsibility and action. The burden of resolving the overwhelming problems of that continent cannot be placed on the shoulders of Africans alone. It is in this understanding that Turkey has devised a comprehensive policy that includes effective political  social and economic measures to help address the challenges that Africa faces.  On the Cyprus issue  our long-standing commitment and full support of a just and lasting settlement remains unchanged. We share the vision of the Secretary-General that a settlement will be within reach before the end of this year  but this process should not be open-ended. A positive outcome emerging from these negotiations would rapidly transform the eastern Mediterranean into a pillar of peace  stability  cooperation and welfare in the European Union.  The Turkish Cypriots have shown that they are in favour of a settlement  as clearly manifested in the 2004 referendum  but they continue to suffer unjustly from the absence of a settlement. I would like to repeat the call made by the Secretary-General to the international community to take the necessary steps to eliminate the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots and enable their integration into the greater world.   In conclusion  I wish to reiterate our view that the United Nations can and should play an even larger role in chartering a better future for humankind. It is up to us  the Member States  to provide the United Nations with the necessary political support and concrete tools so that it can fulfil that role. I assure the Assembly that Turkey  for its part  will continue to lend its full support and cooperation to the United Nations in our quest to leave a much safer  more prosperous  cleaner and healthier world to our children."
"173",7031,"TUV",65,2010,"At the dawn of the new millennium 10 years ago  Tuvalu raised its flag among those of the States Members of the United Nations here in New York as a new member of this body. Our admission was a testimony of hope and opportunity for our nation’s destiny in the resolve of humankind through the noble pillars of the United Nations  as   35 10-55276  enshrined in its Charter. I am greatly honoured and privileged to speak before this body on behalf of the people and Government of Tuvalu and to convey of the General Assembly our warmest greetings at this session.  At the outset  we join the high commendations expressed by previous speakers to you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session  and to your predecessor for his leadership and dedication during his presidency of the last session. Let me reassure your Excellency of our support during your presidency.  As Tuvalu celebrates its thirty-second anniversary of independence later this week  I take this opportunity to acknowledge and convey our sincerest thanks and gratitude to the international community  especially our traditional development partners and close and new friends  for their continued support and cooperation in the pursuit of our development goals. Without their gesture of understanding  friendship and cooperation  Tuvalu could not have achieved the progress it has made to date.  We welcome and support the key priority issues — such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  global governance  and the promotion of sustainable development — that you  Mr. President  clearly highlighted in your opening address to the sixty-fifth session. Last week  the General Assembly convened a High-level Plenary Meeting on the review of the Millennium Development Goals. In the context of achieving these Goals  Tuvalu has been reasonably successful. Our population does not suffer from extreme poverty or hunger. We have very high participation rates in primary education. The participation of women in Tuvalu society is prominent  although representation in Parliament remains an issue. Progress in reducing child mortality has been somewhat slow  and access to adequate health care also remains an issue.  During the review of the MDGs  there was one very clear lesson that we learned. This relates to the fact that while we have made progress in achieving the MDGs  these successes can be easily and very quickly reversed by our particular economic and environmental vulnerability.  In the context of economic vulnerability  the recent global financial and economic crises continue to have an enormous adverse effect on Tuvalu’s economy. For a small island economy like Tuvalu’s  which is highly reliant and dependent on the import of products from overseas  the severe impact and consequences of such crises also continue to be encountered by our people. One element of that effect was the increased cost of importing fossil fuel. The cost of fossil-fuel dependency is having a crippling effect on our national budget. We are in desperate need of renewable energy and energy-efficiency technologies that are appropriate to the unique conditions of Tuvalu.  Last week  we also undertook a review of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action. During the discussions  we proposed three key outcomes. First  we need support to help regulate and police illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing. Secondly  we need to ensure that our economies are able to recover after severe weather events. This means that we need a climate risk insurance mechanism that can draw on public international finance to underwrite the cost of premiums and pay-outs. Thirdly  we are seeking proper acknowledgement of small island developing States’ concerns in the United Nations process and their recognition as a discrete group within the United Nations system.  Much has been said and well documented on the importance and seriousness of climate change  especially its adverse impact on small island States and least developed countries like Tuvalu. At the recent Pacific Island Forum meeting  leaders highlighted climate change as the greatest threat to the livelihoods  security and well-being of the peoples of the Pacific. Our leaders further iterated that unsustainable development and climate change threaten not only the livelihoods of Pacific peoples but also the islands themselves and the cultures they nurture.  However  despite our high expectations of concrete and timely support from the international community  we were deeply concerned and disappointed at the outcomes of the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. We sincerely hope that the forthcoming Conference of the Parties to be held in Cancún later this year will lead to concrete results and not shallow promises. In view of the slow and painful progress in the ongoing negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change process  coupled with the lack of concrete commitments shown by key greenhouse gas emitting countries  Tuvalu would like to see three key political commitments come out of the meeting in Cancún.     10-55276 36   First  we would like to see all the amendments and rules for the Kyoto Protocol agreed so that such amendments are ready for ratification to avoid a gap in the commitment periods. Secondly  we should decide on a mandate to start negotiations on a new  legally binding agreement based on all elements of the Bali Action Plan. Thirdly  we should agree on a set of decisions that would provide interim steps to implement measures to be incorporated into the new legally binding agreement. That should be the bare minimum we anticipate agreeing upon in Cancún. For Tuvalu  addressing climate change in a substantive way is fundamental to our sustainable development and livelihood. We cannot allow the next conference in Cancún to be another failure like Copenhagen.  Despite the fact that Tuvalu is one of the small island developing States and least developed countries most vulnerable to a wide range of global events  as alluded to earlier  the United Nations General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council have not recognized and taken such vulnerability seriously into consideration when addressing the question of graduation from the least developed country category. We strongly believe that Tuvalu’s economic and environmental vulnerability cannot be overemphasized and totally ignored  especially with the ongoing consequences of climate change and the recent global crisis. In that regard  we continue to call upon the United Nations and our development partners to recognize our vulnerability as a least developed country in the review of the criteria and the graduation rule for the graduation of least developed countries.  We could not agree more as to the need and importance for the General Assembly and Security Council to be revitalized and reformed  respectively  so as to enable them to fulfil their mandates and roles in a more transparent  coherent  efficient and timely manner. We fully support the ongoing reform processes  and we believe that small island developing States should be allocated a seat in the Security Council.  While we applaud and strongly support the continuing significant role played by the United Nations as the major peacekeeping body in the international community  the efforts and progress made by Taiwan in pursuing peace on both sides of the Straits needs special recognition and encouragement by the United Nations. In addition  we strongly believe that with its active involvement and contributions to international trade  investment  air transport  finance  telecommunications technology and environmental protection  Taiwan deserves to participate more fully as a member of the World Health Organization and other United Nations specialized agencies such as the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Tuvalu therefore urges the United Nations specialized agencies to accommodate Taiwan’s meaningful participation in their respective systems and activities.  In conclusion  let me reiterate and underscore the importance and seriousness of climate change as a cross-cutting issue and its adverse impacts  especially the impact of sea-level rise on a small island developing State such as Tuvalu. Although we do acknowledge with profound appreciation the commitments and generous pledges offered by the international community and the establishment of international trust funds specifically earmarked for climate change  the process of accessing such sources of funds  let alone their timely disbursement  is extremely difficult and time consuming for small countries such as Tuvalu. Therefore  such commitments without timely actions to deliver concrete results on the ground may well leave small and poor countries such as Tuvalu to continue to shoulder the burden. May God Bless the United Nations. "
"174",7077,"TZA",65,2010,"Let me begin by congratulating you  Sir  on your well-deserved election to preside over the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I assure you of Tanzania’s full support and cooperation. I also thank and congratulate your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Abdussalam Treki  for his leadership and accomplishments.  Having just concluded a successful summit on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  I would like to congratulate the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his leadership  dedication and commitment to the work of the Organization and for the new momentum that he is bringing towards the achievement of the MDGs. Once again  we welcome his Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health and urge the international community to render the necessary support for its implementation.  We emphasize the importance of national leadership and global partnership in meeting the MDGs. Tanzania will do its part. We call on all partners to do their part  as stipulated under MDG 8. One such successful partnership is the collective efforts of the African leadership through the African Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA)  chaired by His Excellency Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete  President of the United Republic of Tanzania. Our focus within ALMA is on ensuring that we attain the 2010 targets for universal coverage of appropriate malaria prevention  diagnosis and treatment interventions. We are confident that  if the requested support is realized  we can attain that target. For that reason  we ask for the full and timely replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria.  We all know that the Millennium Development Goals will not be attained without sustained economic growth and sustainable development. For Tanzania  where the vast majority of the people depend on agriculture for their incomes and livelihoods  poverty cannot be alleviated without addressing the challenges of production  productivity and markets in the agricultural sector.  Recognizing that  Tanzania has developed a programme known as Kilimo Kwanza  which translates as “Agriculture First”  aimed at transforming and modernizing the agricultural sector. A key component of the programme is the improvement of infrastructure  especially irrigation systems  transport and energy. However  the major challenge for us remains how to finance the huge investment gap in infrastructure. That gap cannot be filled by the public sector alone. For that reason  the participation of the private sector is imperative.  Tanzania has undertaken a number of reforms to create an environment conducive to private sector investment. We have created the requisite legal  regulatory and institutional framework to attract both local and foreign private investment in infrastructure development. We now have a public-private partnership policy in place  and Parliament enacted a bill on such partnerships in June.  Through a presidential circular  Tanzania also established the Tanzania National Business Council as an institution to provide a forum for public-private sector dialogue. The Business Council brings together public and private sectors with a view to reaching consensus and mutual understanding on strategic issues relating to the efficient management of resources in the promotion of socio-economic development in Tanzania. The Council’s Chairperson is the President of the United Republic of Tanzania.    10-55122 10   The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania would like to reaffirm its commitment to democratic good governance  the rule of law and respect for human rights. The recent peaceful referendum in Zanzibar produced a new political dispensation that provides for a Government of national unity whichever party wins the elections. That should now stabilize Zanzibar and strengthen the democratic ideals that we all aspire to as Tanzania prepares for its general elections  scheduled for 31 October. As in previous elections  we will do everything in our power to ensure that these are peaceful  free and fair. We thank all partners that  bilaterally or through the United Nations system  are strengthening our capacity to realize that goal.  Tanzania is pleased that Africa has continued to play a leading role in conflict prevention  management and resolution  as well as in entrenching principles of good governance. Increasingly  more and more African countries are holding free  fair and peaceful elections  followed by smooth transitions. The peaceful referendum in Kenya that paved the way for a new Constitution demonstrates the will of African countries to take charge of their own destinies. That is a matter of great satisfaction to us  and we commend the people and leadership of Kenya for that important achievement.  We thank and commend all who continue to work hard for a political solution to the situation in Darfur that will lead to durable peace and address the humanitarian situation. We are concerned about periodic eruptions of violence  and we call on all sides in Darfur to join the peace process. In the meantime  we commend the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) for the good work that it continues to do under very difficult conditions. We therefore urge the international community to give UNAMID all the support that it needs.  We note the preparations and progress towards the holding of a referendum in Southern Sudan early next year. We call on all parties to do everything in their power to keep to the timetable for that referendum. The referendum must be peaceful  free and fair  and the wishes of the people of Southern Sudan must be respected. We commend the Secretary-General for his initiatives to facilitate that process  including his decision to appoint a panel of eminent persons  headed by His Excellency Mr. Benjamin Mkapa  the former President of the United Republic of Tanzania  to monitor the process. We pledge Tanzania’s full support to Mr. Mkapa and his team for the successful accomplishment of the task ahead of them. We urge all parties to cooperate with the team  and we call upon the international community to provide the requisite support for the successful holding of the referendum and the peaceful management of its outcome.  Tanzania will continue to play its role in ensuring lasting peace and stability in Africa and elsewhere. That includes contributing to United Nations peacekeeping operations and missions in Africa and elsewhere  including those we have deployed in Darfur and Lebanon.  We are concerned about the worsening political  humanitarian  social and security situation in Somalia  which threatens the whole region and  ultimately  the world. Recently  we witnessed terrorist bombings in Uganda by the group Al-Shabaab  which caused the loss of many innocent lives and the destruction of property. Having been victim to similar attacks in  Dar es Salaam in 1998  Tanzania condemns that barbaric attack in the strongest terms and expresses solidarity with and support for Uganda and other neighbours in tracking down and prosecuting those involved.  We highly commend Uganda and Burundi for contributing peacekeeping troops in Somalia under the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM). We further thank all those African countries that have committed to providing additional troops to AMISOM. We ask the international community to provide the support needed to make that deployment possible and timely. However  the problem of Somalia cannot be left to Africans alone. In that regard  the Security Council must be more engaged and supportive in finding a lasting solution to Somalia.  Tanzania is concerned about the continued increase in piracy activities in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean  which are now spreading beyond the coast of Somalia. The piracy issue cannot be resolved on the seas alone or without addressing the causal factors on land. A coordinated  coherent  comprehensive and integrated response that includes political  military  financial and legal support is needed. The United Nations and the international community should work closely with the African Union  members of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and other neighbouring States to   11 10-55122  suppress acts of piracy  as well as to apprehend and prosecute those who commit that crime.  In the United Republic of Tanzania  we recently amended the criminal code to allow our courts to prosecute suspected pirates under universal jurisdiction. We call on the international community to enhance the prosecution and custodial capacities of countries  such as ours  that apprehend and prosecute pirates. The international community must also agree to share post-prosecution custodial responsibilities with the affected States. Tanzania has also offered to train 1 000 Somali soldiers in Tanzania in the firm belief that  in the final analysis  peace and security in Somalia lie in the hands of the Somalis themselves.  Over the years  Tanzania has been a home for many refugees. The current stability in our neighbouring countries has enabled voluntary repatriation of many refugees  in addition to those who have been naturalized. As a result  the population of refugees in Tanzania declined from 1.2 million in 1994 to 108 426 by 31 July this year. This has enabled the closure of 12 refugee camps.  Tanzania has also continued its tradition since independence of granting citizenship to refugees who have been in our country for many years. In April this year  we naturalized 162 254 refugees who entered the country in 1972. The Government is now in the process of integrating these naturalized persons into Tanzanian society.  This  however  is a costly exercise. It is estimated that the naturalization and local integration programme will cost over $146 million. This is a huge burden to a poor country like Tanzania. We call upon the international community to support this integration programme under the principle of equitable responsibility and burden-sharing.  We join others in welcoming the adoption of resolution 64/289 on system-wide coherence  which  among other things  established UN Women. It is our hope that UN Women will receive the required support from the international community and the entire United Nations system to deliver on its mandate. Tanzania congratulates Ms. Michelle Bachelet on her appointment to head UN Women and assures her of Tanzania’s unwavering support as she discharges her duties.  Tanzania’s experience as a pilot country in the delivering as one reform initiative has convinced us that this  indeed  was a good decision and has strengthened national ownership and leadership. I am pleased that Tanzania will  in January 2011  be the first country to present a common country programme.  Tanzania fully supports the priorities that you  Sir  have set for the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Inclusive and democratic governance is as important at the national level as it is at the global level. It has  sadly  taken too long to give this issue the priority it deserves at all levels. We believe that the inclusive global governance agenda will ensure accountability and equitable participation in international trade and financial institutions  and open doors for fair and equitable participation of developing countries in the World Trade Organization  the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.  Tanzania emphasizes and reaffirms the inclusiveness of the General Assembly as opposed to the Security Council. We thus call upon all Member States to press for the expeditious reform of the Security Council. Africa has the largest number of Member States. It cannot continue to be denied fair representation in that important organ of the United Nations. We urge all Member States to support Africa in its rightful pursuit of permanent representation on the Security Council.  In this regard  Tanzania reiterates the decision of the African Union  as contained in the Ezulwini Consensus  which demands not less than two permanent seats with all the prerogatives and privileges of permanent membership  including the right of veto  as well as five non-permanent seats.  On the issues of the Middle East and Western Sahara  let me reiterate what His Excellency President Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete said during the sixth-fourth session of the General Assembly in 2009 (see A/64/PV.6). Tanzania supports a two-State solution whereby Israel and Palestine would live together side by side and at peace with each other. Tanzania strongly maintains that this is the best way to sustainable peace in the Middle East.  Regarding Western Sahara  the President also called upon the Security Council to expedite the process of giving the people of Western Sahara the opportunity to decide their future status. This matter    10-55122 12  has dragged on since 1975 — in other words  for too long. The time has come to end the impasse.  Let me conclude by once again reaffirming Tanzania’s belief and confidence in the United Nations as the Organization and forum for global governance and the pursuit of the letter and spirit of its Charter: a world free from wars and dehumanizing poverty; a world of sustainable economic and social progress  as well as freedom  human rights and justice for all. We reaffirm our commitment to doing our part in pursuit of that world."
"175",7120,"UGA",65,2010,"I did not attend the High-level Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  as I was not yet in New York. Nevertheless  I would like to inform the General Assembly that Uganda will definitely achieve the following MDGs: Goal 1  on the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger; Goal 2  on achieving universal primary education; Goal 3  on the empowerment of women and the promotion of gender equality; Goal 7  on ensuring environmental sustainability; and Goal 8  on creating a global partnership for development.  It is only in the areas of maternal and child health that we may not achieve by 2015 the targets set. However  in Uganda  we have developed a national road map to accelerate the reduction of maternal and child mortality and morbidity  which is a comprehensive strategy that clearly spells out our national priorities in this area. In this strategy  we have given priority to four key intervention types  namely effective antenatal care  skilled attendance at birth  emergency care for women who experience complications in childbirth and family planning. We have also given priority to creating infrastructure that supports and strengthens the health-care system.   Regarding MDG 6  Uganda has made tremendous efforts with respect to HIV/AIDS prevention and control. We are now renewing our efforts to deal with the challenges of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  It is noteworthy that  overall  Uganda was recently ranked among the middle performing countries according to the United Nations Development Programme’s Human Development Index. However  in Uganda  we have never believed in donor-anchored responses to the MDGs as a sustainable solution. Responses to the MDGs should be anchored in the growth and transformation of the economies of the target countries. I am therefore glad that the cloud of Afro-pessimism is dispersing. The opinions of the Afro-pessimists are being consigned to    10-54965 30  where they have always belonged — to the dung-heap of history.   Some groups in the West  where Afro-pessimism abounded in the past  have now started talking of the African lions  no doubt equating in their minds the performance of the African economies with the Asian tigers of yesteryear. Groups like the McKinsey Global Institute are beginning to group the African economies — which collectively recorded a growth rate of 4.9 per cent of gross domestic product in the gloomy years of the recent global depression  compared with the mere 2 per cent of gross domestic product that the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recorded in the same period — into four categories. Those categories are: diversified economies  oil-exporting economies  economies in transition and pre-transition economies. Uganda was put in the group of transition economies.   Although the McKinsey group needs to improve their statistical base and some of their insights  they are among the first Western groups to recognize what we — who have been working on African issues for a long time  on goals we set out to achieve in the years after independence — long knew was possible: to make Africa move from Third World to First World  in the words of Lee Kuan Yew  the former Prime Minister of Singapore.  Although there are 53 economies of Africa being managed by the respective national authorities  reform trends and ideas are sometimes shared. The McKinsey group estimates that the consumption level of Africa  which stood at $860 billion in 2008  will grow to $1.4 trillion by 2020.   What one needs to add is the fact that those economies have become roaring lions  underdeveloped infrastructure notwithstanding. What will happen when the infrastructure bottlenecks are resolved? That is the question that one should ask oneself. What will happen when there is cheap and abundant electricity  cheap road transport and cheap rail transport? Those areas had been neglected for a long time. The study by the McKinsey Global Institute revealed that there are now 316 million new mobile phone subscribers since the year 2000 in Africa  more than the entire population of the United States. In other words  there are now more mobile phones in Africa than there are American people living in the United States.   There are 600 million hectares of uncultivated arable land in Africa. If our partners could concentrate on assisting infrastructure development  Africa’s transition would be that much faster. All the same  a country like Uganda is transitioning. Aid in relevant sectors is welcome  but even without aid we are moving forward.  I know the theme of the general debate is “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance”. In my short address I have not talked directly about this. I have instead spoken about Africa’s economic reawakening as a roaring lion. Was I irrelevant? I do not think so. It is those strong building blocks that will strengthen the United Nations.   Africa has been a weak link in the chain of the struggle for improved governance in the world over the last 50 years. Improved economic performance in Africa is  therefore  good for the continent and also good for the rest of the world."
"176",7167,"UKR",65,2010,"On behalf of Ukraine  I sincerely congratulate His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I am convinced that his rich experience will contribute to the achievement of significant results in our joint work.  We have started our work in New York on a high note. The Millennium Development Goals summit has just successfully concluded. The summit outcome document (resolution 65/1)  the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) have become our road map for sustainable development and a better future. Their rigorous and coherent implementation is a common task for all Member States. Ukraine is ready to work actively to this end.  Ukraine approaches with full responsibility the issues of poverty eradication  providing high-quality education  developing proper conditions for preserving the environment  improving maternal health and reducing child mortality  curbing HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis  and ensuring gender equality. Our achievements as well as the problems we face are set out in the national report on implementation of the Millennium Development Goals  which we presented at the summit.  Today my country is undergoing profound internal changes. We have finally achieved political stability and have launched comprehensive economic and social reforms. In short  Ukraine has been given a new progressive impetus  allowing us to take real practical steps towards transformations that are long overdue. I am confident that it will enable us to participate more actively in the implementation of the principles of the United Nations  to which Ukraine has been committed all along.  The world economic crisis has become a major problem that has slowed progress in Ukraine as well as in other countries. Global challenges require a global response. The world must develop a new financial and economic system of relations. Further trade liberalization  prevention of protectionist measures  new solutions and transparent tools for safeguarding global competition can contribute to the economic recovery.  We believe it is necessary to support further global processes that expand the free movement of    10-54827 40  people  goods  services and capital. New free-trade areas and visa-free travel regimes are an important component of the appropriate response to the global challenges of today.  We all know that sustainable development is impossible without security and that security is impossible without development. Ukraine has always been an active contributor to peace and security worldwide. I believe that our contribution in that regard is beyond doubt.  This year Ukraine declared its non-bloc status. That helped to significantly reduce tension in the region and to establish a zone of stability and strategic balance around Ukraine.   In 1994 we were the first in the world to voluntarily give up our nuclear arsenal  the third most powerful in the world. Sixteen years have passed  but that decision by Ukraine has not diminished in importance. In April of this year  Ukraine took the next step at the Nuclear Security Summit  held in Washington  D. C.  by announcing its decision to get rid of all its stocks of highly enriched uranium.   The experience of recent decades shows that nuclear weapons do not always increase security. Moreover  countries that try to acquire nuclear weapons may be exposed to the impact of new risks and become more vulnerable. The best way to counter the proliferation of nuclear weapons is to gradually eliminate them completely. We welcome the signing of a new START treaty between the United States and Russia and further reductions of their national nuclear arsenals.  Today there is also an urgent need for concrete steps to reduce the risks related to the proliferation of nuclear materials and technology. We encourage all Member States to follow our example in the area of global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  In view of the steps I have just mentioned  Ukraine hopes to see our international partners unswervingly comply with their obligations concerning security guarantees for my country  that is  primarily  the Budapest Memorandum of 1994. Ukraine insists that security guarantees for States that have disposed of their nuclear arsenals and for countries that do not belong to any military alliance should be reflected in a legally binding international instrument. That is the best way to discourage regional nuclear ambitions.  The principles of peaceful coexistence  respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States  good neighbourly relations and equality have always been the cornerstone of Ukraine’s foreign policy. We believe that the spirit and letter of the United Nations Charter are the foundation for any regional agreements and arrangements in the area of security architecture. Yet our Organization can make greater use of the potential of existing regional security mechanisms so as to strengthen global security.  We have never distinguished between our own woes and those of others. From the very first years of its independence  Ukraine has actively participated in United Nations efforts to maintain international peace and security. We strongly support the strengthening of United Nations peacekeeping capabilities. Ukraine also intends to keep working to improve legal protection for the Blue Helmets. We welcome support for our initiatives by the Member States.  In our opinion  we also need to develop mechanisms to respond to new or changing challenges to international peace and security. One of these is piracy and armed robbery at sea. I am convinced that that threat can no longer be underestimated. Without effective and decisive intervention by the international community  that evil will only gain force. The United Nations should play a key role in the fight against maritime piracy. Ukraine is determined to continue its efforts to increase international maritime security and the protection of sailors’ social rights  and we call upon all Member States to cooperate to that end.  Today  humanity is increasingly confronted with so-called soft security challenges. The word “soft” should not mislead us  though. Climate change constitutes a global threat to the very future of mankind. The experts are saying today that some of those changes are irreversible. That is why the international community should immediately make all possible efforts to avoid the worst-case scenario. The political will of all Member States should be mobilized. By signing the Copenhagen Accord  Ukraine has taken a step in that direction.  The Earth is our common ship  and it should not become a Titanic. We believe there should be an effective international mechanism to protect the environment of the Earth as our only planet. The world needs a standing global environmental organization with universal membership.   41 10-54827   Against the backdrop of environmental  financial  economic and energy challenges  the peaceful use of nuclear energy is becoming increasingly crucial. States that possess nuclear technologies bear a huge responsibility towards their own people  their neighbours and all mankind.  Next year  the world will commemorate a sad date — the twenty-fifth anniversary of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. That tragedy is still an open wound for us. Overcoming its consequences remains a serious challenge for the international community  as the scale of the problem requires a coordinated effort involving all of our international partners.  Ukraine plans to host a high-level international conference on the theme “Twenty-five years after the Chernobyl disaster: security for the future”. We intend to hold it in Kiev in April 2011  with United Nations participation. The forum should assess the progress made in the restoration and normalization of life in the affected regions and discuss nuclear safety issues. I invite all Members to take part in the conference.  Today’s world is changing at an ever-increasing pace  and our Organization has to change along with it. The United Nations should be not an observer but an architect of events. For that to happen  it urgently needs to undergo comprehensive reform. Ukraine welcomes the progress we see in the organizational consolidation of the United Nations  in particular in the areas of gender equality  protection of women’s rights and peacebuilding.   However  far-reaching changes are impossible without modernization of the core of the United Nations: the Security Council. The transformation of the Security Council into an entity that is more representative and balanced in composition  with improved working methods and higher transparency  is an essential precondition for increasing its effectiveness and for adapting the United Nations to the world’s current practices and procedures.  Ukraine stands ready to discuss all progressive concepts relating to Security Council reform. We believe that the key to success is to take into account the interests of all the underrepresented regional groups  including the Eastern European States. I would like to take this opportunity to confirm Ukraine’s intention to obtain membership in the Security Council for the period of 2016-2017.  I am confident that the work of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly session will be an important step on the road towards a peaceful  safe and prosperous world — a world of freedom  democracy and effective international cooperation. To achieve those ends  we have strong political will  a clear understanding of the challenges and a common vision of the problems. I believe in our success. "
"177",7214,"URY",65,2010,"Our goals at the national level are goals we also want to see achieved in the international community. They are goals that the international community must tackle as priorities. They include eradicating indigence and reducing and eliminating poverty and its root causes  as well as ensuring a dignified life and favourable working conditions for all. We also want an international system that is more democratic and efficient. We want the issues that I have mentioned to be resolved through cross-cutting policies. We can work to promote democracy in every country of the system  but we are badly off indeed if the law of the strongest prevails in the overall system.   Uruguay will always take a moral and ethical approach to every issue  whether with regard to the environment  human rights or international security. In every instance  the ultimate guide is the human person. We must in the end  therefore  always rely on our conscience. However  the functioning of the system is crucial  for that is what generates social  territorial and gender inequality.  At the outset  we welcome the election of the Argentine Republic as Chair of the Group of 77 and China. Argentina is a brotherly country that shares common principles and values with us.  Uruguay  in keeping with its historical path and traditions  reaffirms its commitment to the principles of international law. I would like to underscore in particular our firm support for the peaceful solution of conflicts; the sovereign equality of States; the principles of non-intervention and of the self-determination of peoples; respect for human rights; international socio-economic cooperation; and multilateralism. The maximum expression of those principles is to be found in this Organization.  I would also like to express our rejection of the use or the threat of use of force  of terrorism and of all types of violence  and of the application of coercive measures in contravention of the Charter of the United Nations  such as the economic  financial and trade embargo against Cuba by the United States  which we firmly reject. That unilateral measure is contrary  not only to the Charter but also to international law and to one of the most dearly held principles of my country’s foreign policy  namely  the peaceful settlements of disputes.  Uruguay is party to the principal international conventions relating to the environment and sustainable development. Thus  we have reaffirmed our responsibility for the protection of the environment as a human right and a fundamental component for achieving truly sustainable development.  Uruguay has a long history of defending  promoting and protecting human rights and international humanitarian law. Those principles are a central priority of the State  enshrined in the traditional pillars of the Republic’s foreign policy  which constitute the political and institutional foundations of the country. We welcome the progress made this year in Kampala  Uganda  which has led to the strengthening of the regime established under the Statute of the International Criminal Court. Uruguay is among the countries that have subscribed to the widest range of conventions in the area of human rights and international humanitarian law.  Uruguay’s long-standing tradition of defending those principles has allowed us to take a leading role in  among other areas  the protection and promotion of the rights of children. We believe it is vitally important that we continue to focus our efforts to promote the defence and protection of children and to ensure their well-being.  We also reaffirm our full support for the integration of a gender perspective into all policies and programmes of the United Nations system. In that respect  we welcome the adoption of the resolution (resolution 64/289) on the coherence of the United Nations system  which  in particular  created the new United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. We would also like to express our satisfaction with the appointment of     10-55396 6  Ms. Michelle Bachelet  former President of Chile  as Under-Secretary-General for UN Women. We are confident that her experience will serve as a vital asset for the new Entity.  Uruguay has a steadfast commitment to the cause of peace and our country’s foreign policy bears testimony to that fact. We have given decisive support to all measures aimed at the elimination of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction. We have also advocated the control and reduction of conventional weapons. We underscore  once again  the importance of the swift universal implementation of these agreements.  Likewise  and without prejudice to the reaffirmation of our hope to see a Nuclear Weapons Convention  we believe that the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and a fissile material cut-off treaty during the present year  would constitute decisive steps in the consolidation and deepening of the progress made in the area of disarmament. We must not stop  because to stop is to go backwards  and to go backwards is to expose humanity to the horrendous and unacceptable risk of nuclear holocaust.  It is our hope that  in 2012  a conference will be held  without further delay or conditions  in which all of the States of the Middle East will participate  with the aim of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone  free of all other weapons of mass destruction as well  through freely agreed arrangements between the States of the region  with the full support and commitment of those States that possess nuclear weapons. Similarly  Uruguay supports the Secretary-General’s five-point initiative for a world free of nuclear weapons.  Uruguay actively participates in the United Nations multilateral system of peacekeeping and maintenance of international security  as well as in efforts to defend human rights and uphold international humanitarian law through peacekeeping operations  based on our conviction that these are a solid testimony to the collective commitment of the international community as a whole. That commitment on the part of my country can be seen both on the ground  through our deployment of more than 2 500 Blue Helmets  deployed principally in Haiti and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  and in its work on the political level here at Headquarters.  We recognize that the Security Council holds the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. But we believe it is extremely important to promote a closer relationship between the Council and the General Assembly. The greater the distance between them  the more difficult it is for peacekeeping operations to achieve their objectives and for their complex mandates to be effectively implemented.  In this respect  the existing gap between the complexity of the mandates and the resources available poses a challenge that we must confront every day. We are convinced that is of fundamental importance for us to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the allocation of the resources needed for the proper functioning of those operations. The conditions offered by the system also need to be updated  so that the United Nations has at its disposal the equipment and human resources that it needs. That subject affects developing countries in particular  since it is they which provide the large majority of the troops and thus the viability of their participation in missions is at stake.  The case of Haiti probably provides one of the best illustrations of the need for a cross-cutting political effort to lift a country out of a situation of crisis and institutional and social stagnation.  Uruguay has never been indifferent to the challenges that this brotherly country has had to confront and continues to confront today. From 2004 to date  we have deployed more than 10 000 military personnel to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti  who have faithfully carried out the mandate approved by the Security Council for the stabilization process in that country.  In its role as coordinator of the Group of Friends of Haiti  Uruguay has for some years been advocating for a mandate that  without neglecting the urgent security needs  permits at the same time the establishment of the conditions necessary for strengthening the productive capacity of the country  which was seriously affected by the earthquake of  12 January 2010.  In our view  greater emphasis should be placed on providing teachers  doctors  engineers  agronomists  experts in information technologies and volunteer workers  who could contribute effectively to solving the problems of the Haitian population. Investing in   7 10-55396  human resources in Haiti is of fundamental importance for the future development of the country.  Over the past two years  there has been an open process of restructuring the peacekeeping system  which was necessary given the new reality that we are facing. That process must be viewed as part of a larger project of reform of the Organization  which  through various initiatives  seeks to be more effective  to work in a more coordinated manner and to enjoy greater legitimacy.  Uruguay reiterates its adherence to that process of reform of the United Nations. The process  begun during the 2005 Summit  which gave rise to the creation of two new structures within the Organization — the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission — should be brought to completion through the consideration of various outstanding topics  including the reform of the Security Council. The current international reality is such that that body needs to be more representative and democratic. We must therefore take steps to effect its expansion  while guarding against an extension of the historical obstacles that run contrary to the principle of the sovereign equality of States  such as the right of veto.  A very clear example of Uruguay’s commitment to the United Nations reform process  which seeks to establish greater effectiveness and coordination within the system  is its direct participation in the “Delivering as One” programme. Three years after the pilot programme was launched in Uruguay  we have recently completed the country evaluation and can affirm that the design  implementation  follow-up and evaluation of the process have contributed to the national Government’s efforts to strengthen the coordination among the various State bodies through a joint programming exercise  which made possible greater interaction between agencies  the Government and the United Nations system.  Uruguay has formally expressed its aspiration to occupy a seat as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the period 2016-2017. We are the only candidate country in the region at the present time. Since its accession to the United Nations as a founding Member and despite having pursued a foreign policy inspired by the same purposes  principles and ideals enshrined in the United Nations Charter  Uruguay has occupied a seat in the Security Council only once  which was during the period 1965-1966.  Presenting one’s candidacy to the body in which the international community has entrusted the current global collective security system constitutes the most demanding test of a State’s foreign policy. In the present context  which is profoundly marked by multiple global crises  it is imperative that we work jointly towards building long-term strategies and solutions that will lead us to more just and equitable societies.  In that regard  the role of the United Nations in international economic and financial governance is fundamental in terms of democratizing decision-making and ensuring equal participation in global decisions that affect us all and directly impact strategic planning in the short  medium and long term. Coordinated  transparent and harmonious decision-making is essential for achieving tangible results that improve the living conditions and situation of the world’s citizens. Our country deems it important to promote dialogue in order to foster bridge-building among the various decision-making forums.   We must be aware that without a healthy natural environment  all other development efforts will have a limited effect. In that context  the global phenomenon of climate change is perhaps the most urgent and dramatic challenge currently facing humanity. It poses additional challenges to development and forces us to urgently consider the need to implement measures to adapt to and mitigate its adverse effects. Such measures require changes in production methods and seriously compromise the distribution of domestic resources.  Achieving sustainable development that takes into account the economic  social and environmental dimensions is fundamental to ensuring long-term results and a healthy environment for present and future generations as well as sustained economic growth. That goal is also a necessary precondition for reducing disparities between the developed world and the developing world  particularly in the quality of life  income distribution and human development indicators.  In closing  Uruguay would like to reaffirm the imperative necessity of renewed political commitment aimed at achieving an open and equitable multilateral trade system based on clear rules that would permit all countries to benefit from the potential provided by international trade as the engine of development.    10-55396 8  Hunger eradication  food production and agricultural trade are closely related and must be strengthened through a predictable multilateral system that provides guarantees to producers and ensures food availability to the most vulnerable sectors. In that context  the elimination of subsidies and other non-tariff barriers that hinder access to markets is essential  as is a successful conclusion of the Doha Round based on a development perspective."
"178",7261,"USA",65,2010,"It is a great honour to address this Assembly for the second time  nearly two years after my election as President of the United States. We know this is no ordinary time for our people. We each come here with our own problems and priorities. But there are also challenges that we share in common as leaders and as nations.  We meet within an institution built from the rubble of war  designed to unite the world in pursuit of peace. And we meet within a city that for centuries has welcomed people from across the globe  demonstrating that individuals of every colour  faith and station can come together to pursue opportunity  build a community and live with the blessing of human liberty.  Outside the doors of this Hall  the blocks and neighbourhoods of this great city tell the story of a difficult decade. Nine years ago  the destruction of the World Trade Center signalled a threat that respected no boundary of dignity or decency. Two years ago this month  a financial crisis on Wall Street devastated American families on Main Street. These separate challenges have affected people around the world. Men and women and children have been murdered by extremists from Casablanca to London  from Jalalabad to Jakarta. The global economy suffered an enormous blow during the financial crisis  crippling markets and deferring the dreams of millions on every continent. Underneath these challenges to our security and prosperity lie deeper fears: that ancient hatreds and religious divides are once again ascendant; that a world which has grown more interconnected has somehow slipped beyond our control.  These are some of the challenges that my Administration has confronted since we came into office. And today  I would like to talk to the Assembly about what we have done over the last 20 months to meet these challenges; what our responsibility is to pursue peace in the Middle East; and what kind of world we are trying to build in this twenty-first century.  Let me begin with what we have done. I have had no greater focus as President than rescuing our economy from potential catastrophe. And in an age when prosperity is shared  we could not do this alone. So America has joined with nations around the world to spur growth and the renewed demand that could restart job creation.  We are reforming our system of global finance  beginning with Wall Street reform here at home  so that a crisis like this never happens again. And we made the Group of 20 the focal point for international coordination  because in a world where prosperity is more diffuse  we must broaden our circle of cooperation to include emerging economies —economies from every corner of the globe.  There is much to show for our efforts  even as there is much work to be done. The global economy has been pulled back from the brink of a depression and is growing once more. We have resisted protectionism and are exploring ways to expand trade and commerce among nations. But we cannot — and will not — rest until these seeds of progress grow into a broader prosperity  not only for all Americans but for peoples around the world.  As for our common security  America is waging a more effective fight against Al-Qaida’ while winding down the war in Iraq. Since I took office  the United States has removed nearly 100 000 troops from Iraq. We have done so responsibly as Iraqis have transitioned to lead responsibility for the security of their country. We are now focused on building a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people while keeping our commitment to remove the rest of our troops by the end of next year.   11 10-54827   While drawing down in Iraq  we have refocused on defeating Al-Qaida and denying its affiliates safe haven. In Afghanistan  the United States and our allies are pursuing a strategy to break the Taliban’s momentum and build the capacity of Afghanistan’s Government and security forces so that a transition to Afghan responsibility can begin next July. And from South Asia to the Horn of Africa  we are moving towards a more targeted approach — one that strengthens our partners and dismantles terrorist networks without deploying large American armies.  As we pursue the world’s most dangerous extremists  we are also denying them the world’s most dangerous weapons and pursuing the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.  Earlier this year  47 nations embraced a work plan to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials within four years. We have joined with Russia to sign the most comprehensive arms control treaty in decades. We have reduced the role of nuclear weapons in our security strategy. And here  at the United Nations  we came together to strengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).  As part of our effort on non-proliferation  I offered the Islamic Republic of Iran an extended hand last year and underscored that it has both rights and responsibilities as a member of the international community. I also said — in this Hall — that Iran must be held accountable if it failed to meet those responsibilities. And that is what we have done.  Iran is the only party to the NPT that cannot demonstrate the peaceful intentions of its nuclear programme  and those actions have consequences. Through Security Council resolution 1929 (2010)  we made it clear that international law is not an empty promise.  Now let me be clear once more: the United States and the international community seek a resolution to our differences with Iran  and the door remains open to diplomacy should Iran choose to walk through it. But the Iranian Government must demonstrate a clear and credible commitment and confirm to the world the peaceful intent of its nuclear programme.   As we combat the spread of deadly weapons  we are also confronting the spectre of climate change. After making historic investments in clean energy and efficiency at home  we helped forge an accord in Copenhagen that — for the first time — commits all major economies to reduce their emissions. We are keenly aware this is just a first step. And going forward  we will support a process in which all major economies meet our responsibilities to protect the planet while unleashing the power of clean energy to serve as an engine of growth and development.  America has also embraced unique responsibilities that come with our power. Since the rains came and the floodwaters rose in Pakistan  we have pledged our assistance  and we should all support the Pakistani people as they recover and rebuild. And when the earth shook and Haiti was devastated by loss  we joined a coalition of nations in response. Today  we honour those from the United Nations family who lost their lives in the earthquake and commit ourselves to stand with the people of Haiti until they can stand on their own two feet.  Amidst this upheaval  we have also been persistent in our pursuit of peace. Last year  I pledged my best efforts to support the goal of two States  Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace and security  as part of a comprehensive peace between Israel and all of its neighbours. We have travelled a winding road over the last 12 months  with few peaks and many valleys. But this month I am pleased that we have pursued direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians in Washington  Sharm el-Sheikh and Jerusalem.   Now I recognize that many are pessimistic about this process. The cynics say that Israelis and Palestinians are too distrustful of each other  and too divided internally  to forge lasting peace. Rejectionists on both sides will try to disrupt the process with bitter words and with bombs and gunfire. Some say that the gaps between the parties are too big; the potential for talks to break down is too great; and that after decades of failure peace is simply not possible.   I hear those voices of scepticism. But I ask the Assembly to consider the alternative. If an agreement is not reached  Palestinians will never know the pride and dignity that comes with their own State. Israelis will never know the certainty and security that comes with sovereign and stable neighbours who are committed to coexistence. The hard realities of demography will take over. More blood will be shed. This Holy Land will remain a symbol of our differences  instead of our common humanity.     10-54827 12   I refuse to accept that future. We all have a choice to make. Each of us must choose the path of peace. Of course  that responsibility begins with the parties themselves  who must answer the call of history. Earlier this month  at the White House  I was struck by the words of both the Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Prime Minister Netanyahu said  “I came here today to find an historic compromise that will enable both peoples to live in peace  security and dignity”. President Abbas said  “We will spare no effort and we will work diligently and tirelessly to ensure these negotiations achieve their cause”.  These words must now be followed by action  and I believe that both leaders have the courage to do so. But the road that they have to travel is exceedingly difficult  which is why I call upon Israelis and Palestinians — and the world — to rally behind the goal that these leaders now share.   We know that there will be tests along the way  and that one test is fast approaching. Israel’s settlement moratorium has made a difference on the ground and improved the atmosphere for talks.  And our position on this issue is well known. We believe that the moratorium should be extended. We also believe that talks should press on until completed. Now is the time for the parties to help each other overcome this obstacle. Now is the time to build the trust — and provide the time — for substantial progress to be made. Now is the time for this opportunity to be seized  so that it does not slip away.   Now  peace must be made by Israelis and Palestinians  but we each have a responsibility to do our part as well. Those of us who are friends of Israel must understand that true security for the Jewish State requires an independent Palestine — one that allows the Palestinian people to live with dignity and opportunity. And those of us who are friends of the Palestinians must understand that the rights of the Palestinian people will be won only through peaceful means — including genuine reconciliation with a secure Israel.  I know many in this Hall count themselves as friends of the Palestinians. These pledges of friendship must now be supported by deeds. Those who have signed on to the Arab Peace Initiative should seize this opportunity to make it real by taking tangible steps towards the normalization that it promises Israel.  And those who speak on behalf of Palestinian self-government should help the Palestinian Authority politically and financially  and in doing so help the Palestinians build the institutions of their State.  Those who long to see an independent Palestine must also stop trying to tear down Israel. After thousands of years  Jews and Arabs are not strangers in a strange land. After 60 years in the community of nations  Israel’s existence must not be a subject for debate.  Israel is a sovereign State  and the historic homeland of the Jewish people. It should be clear to all that efforts to chip away at Israel’s legitimacy will be met by the unshakeable opposition of the United States. Efforts to threaten or kill Israelis will do nothing to help the Palestinian people. The slaughter of innocent Israelis is not resistance; it is injustice. And make no mistake: the courage of a man like President Abbas  who stands up for his people in front of the world under very difficult circumstances  is far greater than those who fire rockets at innocent women and children.  The conflict between Israelis and Arabs is as old as the United Nations. And we can come back here next year  as we have for the last 60 years  and make long speeches about it. We can read familiar lists of grievances. We can table the same resolutions. We can further empower the forces of rejectionism and hate. And we can waste more time by carrying forward an argument that will not help a single Israeli or Palestinian child achieve a better life. We can do that.  Or we can say that this time will be different — that this time we will not let terror or turbulence or posturing or petty politics stand in the way. This time we will think  not of ourselves  but of the young girl in Gaza who wants to have no ceiling on her dreams or the young boy in Sderot who wants to sleep without the nightmare of rocket fire.  This time we should draw upon the teachings of tolerance that lie at the heart of the three great religions that see Jerusalem’s soil as sacred. This time we should reach for what is best within ourselves. If we do  when we come back here next year  we can have an agreement that will lead to a new State Member of the United Nations — an independent  sovereign State of Palestine living in peace with Israel.   13 10-54827   It is our destiny to bear the burdens of the challenges that I have addressed — recession and war and conflict. And there is always a sense of urgency  even emergency  that drives most of our foreign policies. Indeed  after millennia marked by wars  this very institution reflects the desire of human beings to create a forum to deal with emergencies that will inevitably come.  But even as we confront immediate challenges  we must also summon the foresight to look beyond them and consider what we are trying to build over the long term. What is the world that awaits us when today’s battles are brought to an end? And  that is what I would like to talk about with the remainder of my time today.  One of the first actions of the General Assembly was to adopt the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. This Declaration begins by stating that  “recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom  justice and peace in the world”.   The idea is a simple one — that freedom  justice and peace for the world must begin with freedom  justice and peace in the lives of individual human beings. For the United States  this is a matter of moral and pragmatic assessment. As Robert Kennedy said  “the individual man  the child of God  is the touchstone of value  and all society  groups  the state exist for his benefit”.   So we stand up for universal values because it is the right thing to do. But we also know from experience that those who defend these values for their people have been our closest friends and allies  while those who have denied those rights — whether terrorist groups or tyrannical Governments — have chosen to be our adversaries.  Human rights have never gone unchallenged — not in any of our nations  not in our world. Tyranny is still with us — whether it manifests itself in the Taliban killing girls who try to go to school  a North Korean regime that enslaves its own people  or an armed group in Congo-Kinshasa that use rape as a weapon of war.  In times of economic unease  there can also be an anxiety about human rights. Today  as in past times of economic downturn  some put human rights aside for the promise of short-term stability or the false notion that economic growth can come at the expense of freedom. We see leaders abolishing term limits  we see crackdowns on civil society  we see corruption smothering entrepreneurship and good governance  we see democratic reforms deferred indefinitely.  As I said last year  each country will pursue a path rooted in the culture of its own people. Yet experience shows us that history is on the side of liberty; that the strongest foundation lies in open economies  open societies  and open Governments. To put it simply  democracy  more than any other form of government  delivers for our citizens. And I believe that truth will only grow stronger in a world where the borders between nations are blurred.  America is working to shape a world that fosters this openness. For the rot of a closed or corrupt economy must never eclipse the energy and innovation of human beings.All of us want the right to educate our children  to make a decent wage  to care for the sick  and to be carried as far as our dreams and deeds will take us. But that depends upon economies that tap the power of our people  including the potential of women and girls. That means letting entrepreneurs start a business without paying a bribe and Governments that support opportunity instead of stealing from their people. And that means rewarding hard work  instead of reckless risk-taking.  Yesterday  I put forward a new development policy that will pursue these goals  recognizing that dignity is a human right and global development is in our common interest. America will partner with nations that offer their people a path out of poverty. And together  we must unleash growth that powers by individuals and merging markets in all parts of the globe.  There is no reason why Africa should not be an exporter of agriculture  which is why our food security initiative is empowering farmers. There is no reason why entrepreneurs should not be able to build new markets in every society  which is why I hosted a summit on entrepreneurship earlier this spring  because the obligation of Government is to empower individuals  not to impede them.  The same holds true for civil society. The arc of human progress has been shaped by individuals with the freedom to assemble and by organizations outside of government that insisted upon democratic change    10-54827 14  and by free media that held the powerful accountable. We have seen that from the South Africans who stood up to apartheid  to the Poles of Solidarity  to the mothers of the disappeared who spoke out against the Dirty War  to Americans who marched for the rights of all races  including my own.  Civil society is the conscience of our communities and America will always extend our engagement abroad with citizens beyond the halls of Government. And we will call out those who suppress ideas and serve as a voice for those who are voiceless. We will promote new tools of communication so people are empowered to connect with one another and  in repressive societies  to do so with security. We will support a free and open Internet  so individuals have the information to make up their own minds. And it is time to embrace and effectively monitor norms that advance the rights of civil society and guarantee its expansion within and across borders.  Open society supports open government  but it cannot substitute for it. There is no right more fundamental than the right to choose your leaders and determine your destiny. Now  make no mistake: the ultimate success of democracy in the world will not come because the United States dictates it; it will come because individual citizens demand a say in how they are governed.  There is no soil where this cannot take root  just as every democracy reflects the uniqueness of a nation. Later this fall  I will travel to Asia. And I will visit India  which peacefully threw off colonialism and established a thriving democracy of over a billion people.  I will continue to Indonesia  the world’s largest Muslim-majority country  which binds together thousands of islands through the glue of representative government and civil society. I will join the Group-of-20 meeting on the Korean peninsula  which provides the world’s clearest contrast between a society that is dynamic and open and free  and one that is imprisoned and closed. And I will conclude my trip in Japan  an ancient culture that found peace and extraordinary development through democracy.  Each of these countries gives life to democratic principles in its own way. And even as some Governments roll back reform  we also celebrate the courage of a President in Colombia who willingly stepped aside  or the promise of a new constitution in Kenya.   The common thread of progress is the principle that government is accountable to its citizens. And the diversity in this Hall makes clear — no one country has all the answers  but all of us must answer to our own people.  In all parts of the world  we see the promise of innovation to make government more open and accountable. And now we must build on that progress. And when we gather back here next year  we should bring specific commitments to promote transparency; to fight corruption; to energize civic engagement; to leverage new technology so that we strengthen the foundations of freedom in our own countries  while living up to the ideals that can light the world.  This institution can still play an indispensable role in the advance of human rights. It is time to welcome the efforts of UN Women to protect the rights of women around the world.  It is time for every Member State to open its elections to international monitors and increase the United Nations Democracy Fund. It is time to invigorate United Nations peacekeeping  so that missions have the resources necessary to succeed  and so atrocities like sexual violence are prevented and justice is enforced — because neither dignity nor democracy can thrive without basic security.   It is time to make this institution more accountable as well  because the challenges of the new century demand new ways of serving our common interests.  The world that America seeks is not one we can build on our own. For human rights to reach those who suffer the boot of oppression  we need your voices to speak out. In particular  I appeal to those nations that emerged from tyranny and inspired the world in the second half of the last century — from South Africa to South Asia; from Eastern Europe to South America. Do not stand idly by  do not be silent  when dissidents elsewhere are imprisoned and protesters are beaten  recall your own history. Because part of the price of our own freedom is standing up for the freedom of others.   That belief will guide America’s leadership in this twenty-first century. It is a belief that has seen us through more than two centuries of trial  and it will see   15 10-54827  us through the challenges we face today — be they war or recession; conflict or division.  So even as we have come through a difficult decade  I stand here before you confident in the future — a future where Iraq is governed by neither a tyrant nor a foreign Power  and Afghanistan is freed from the turmoil of war; a future where the children of Israel and Palestine can build the peace that was not possible for their parents; a world where the promise of development reaches into the prisons of poverty and disease; a future where the cloud of recession gives way to the light of renewal  and the dream of opportunity is available to all.   This future will not be easy to reach. It will not come without setbacks  nor will it be quickly claimed. But the founding of the United Nations itself is a testament to human progress. Remember  in times that were far more trying than our own  our predecessors chose the hope of unity over the ease of division and made a promise to future generations that the dignity and equality of human beings would be our common cause.  It falls to us to fulfil that promise. And though we will be met by dark forces that will test our resolve  Americans have always had cause to believe that we can choose a better history; that we need only to look outside the walls around us. For through the citizens of every conceivable ancestry who make this city their own  we see living proof that opportunity can be accessed by all  that what unites us as human beings is far greater than what divides us  and that people from every part of this world can live together in peace."
"179",7296,"VAT",65,2010,"On behalf of the Holy See  I am pleased to warmly congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session  and to offer our best wishes for the successful fulfilment of your mandate. In this new period of work for the General Assembly  the Holy See wishes to offer its genuine collaboration in tackling the numerous challenges faced by the international community. The 65 years of existence of the United Nations are a unique event in history in and of themselves  particularly when contrasted with the annihilation of hopes placed in the peace conferences    10-55396 20  of the beginning of the twentieth century  and later in the League of Nations.  The existence of the United Nations shows that humankind has found in the Organization a response to the terrifying tragedies of the two World Wars. Despite the imperfection of its structures and its way of functioning  the United Nations has sought to bring solutions to international problems in the economic  social  cultural and humanitarian fields  and has tried to fulfil the mandate given to it by its Charter  namely to be a centre for the coordination of the action of States with a view to the maintenance of peace and friendly relations among peoples.  The dialogue among the representatives of States that is renewed every year in the plenary of the General Assembly  which remains open and lively in the other bodies and agencies of the United Nations family  has been the basic tool for fulfilling this mandate. There have been times when this dialogue has been  more than anything else  a clash of opposing and irreconcilable ideologies and positions. However  the United Nations has become irreplaceable in the life of the people of the world in the search for a better future for all the inhabitants of the planet.  It is from the perspective of this productive international dialogue carried out through the discussions and deliberations that take place in this Hall that I would like to recall important developments related to international peace and security that took place during the sixty-fourth session of the Assembly.  First of all  the Holy See welcomes the entry into force on 1 August of the Convention on Cluster Munitions. This instrument  which the Holy See was among the first States to ratify  does represent an important result for multilateralism  based on constructive cooperation among Governments and civil society  as well as the connection between humanitarian law and human rights.   Another important result was the positive conclusion last May of the eighth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons with the publication of a consensus-based document that provides for different actions related to the three main pillars of the treaty: nuclear disarmament  the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Among these  an important sign of hope was a decision to convene  before 2012  a conference to establish a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.   Furthermore  also in the area of peace and disarmament  the first meeting  last July  in New York  of the Preparatory Committee for a Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty  which is set for 2012 is also worth mentioning. This meeting showed that the process  which has begun for the treaty  is shared by all States that are aware of the need to legally settle the issue of the arms trade for reasons of peace  humanitarian protection and social and economic development.  In the context and spirit of successful international dialogue  we should also welcome the signing of the New START treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation. That signing is a step forward in relations among the nuclear Powers  and the Holy See hopes that it will open new prospects and lead to substantial arms reductions in the future. Similarly  during this session of the General Assembly  a High-level Meeting was held  some days ago  on revitalizing disarmament negotiations  which was very useful for discussing ways to give new life to the Conference on Disarmament and to continue to build a consensus on the major obstacles to agreement on disarmament  in particular  the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty. We must do everything possible to achieve a world free from nuclear weapons  and the Holy See supports all efforts along these lines.  During the previous session of the General Assembly  the United Nations made an unprecedented contribution to international cooperation and peace in Haiti  where  during the earthquake of 12 January 2010  the head of the United Nations Mission  Ambassador Hédi Annabi  died  as did his assistant  Mr. Luiz Carlos da Costa  along with 82 other civil servants and members of the peacekeeping forces. On behalf of the Holy See  I would like to extend our sincere condolences to the Secretary-General and the national authorities of the States of the persons who died  as well as their families and colleagues. Their sacrifice should serve as an impetus for a new global commitment to maintaining peace.   The Holy See has always recognized and appreciated actions carried out by United Nations peacekeeping forces. The important increase in requests for intervention in recent years shows the increased confidence in United Nations activities in   21 10-55396  cooperation with regional organizations  but it also highlights the importance of the growing role played by the United Nations and regional organizations in preventive diplomacy.   Likewise  the action of the Peacebuilding Commission remains fundamental to rebuilding the social  legal and economic fabric that was destroyed by war and to avoiding the relapse into conflict. Initiatives to prevent conflicts  to peacefully resolve conflicts  to separate warring parties and to promote reconstruction deserve generous political and economic support from all States Members of the United Nations. Support from all would be an eloquent show of confidence in a destiny based on solidarity for humankind.   If we think that normative developments with regard to disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons have shown signs of progress  there are reasons for concern with respect to the many obstacles to global security and peace. Above all  military spending in the world continues to be excessive and even to increase. The problem of the exercise of the legitimate right of States to the peaceful development of nuclear energy in accordance with effective international monitoring of non-proliferation remains relevant. The Holy See encourages all parties involved in settling various ongoing controversies  in particular those with respect to the Korean peninsula and the Persian Gulf region  as well as adjoining regions  to carry out an honest in-depth dialogue that would be able to harmoniously reconcile all rights of the nations concerned.   The recent terrible natural catastrophes in Pakistan add to the difficulties caused by conflicts that have beset that region. In addition to the humanitarian response  which must be generous  and other associated measures  there must also be a broader effort at mutual and deeper understanding of the causes of the hostilities.  Moreover  genuine dialogue  trust and generosity in putting aside peripheral or short-term interests are the way to achieve a lasting solution to the conflict between the State of Israel and the Palestinians. Dialogue and understanding among the various parties involved is also the only way to achieve reconciliation in Iraq and Myanmar  for example  as well as to resolve ethnic and cultural problems in Central Asia and the regions of the Caucasus and to calm recurring tensions in Africa  such as in the Sudan  just before decisive elections.  There is a significant economic component to most of those conflicts. Substantially improving the living conditions of the Palestinian people and other peoples living under civil or regional wars will no doubt make a crucial contribution to transforming violent opposition into patient and peaceful dialogue.  The High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) took place here several days ago. All Member States once again solemnly committed themselves to make every necessary effort to achieve the MDGs by 2015. The Holy See welcomes the reiterated will to uproot poverty  which it hopes will resolutely be brought to an end. However  it is important to underscore that we will not achieve the Goals without fulfilling two great moral imperatives.   On the one hand  it is essential that rich and emerging countries fully honour their development assistance commitments and immediately establish and operationalize a financial and trading framework that on the whole favours the weakest countries. On the other hand  rich and poor alike should ensure an ethical political and economic change that guarantees good governance and eradicates all forms of corruption. Otherwise  we risk reaching the year 2015 not having achieved sufficient results  except — and this would be sad and paradoxical — in the areas of population control and promoting minority lifestyles  as introduced in certain paragraphs of the recently held summit. In that case  the Millennium Goals would become a veritable fraud vis-à-vis the comprehensive human development of peoples.  With regard to the environment  which is the subject of Millennium Goal 7  the participation of more than 115 heads of State and Government at the Conference of the States Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Copenhagen in December 2009 demonstrated the attention and importance attached to an issue as complex as the climate on the international agenda. The Holy See hopes that the next session of the Conference of the States Parties will take a political decision that will make the negotiations on a legally binding agreement more concrete.  At the heart of that debate is the establishment of a development model based on a new energy system.    10-55396 22  Nevertheless  it is important to recall the ethical issues associated with this matter. It is not just about achieving a world less dependent on fossil fuels and more devoted to energy efficiency and alternative fuels  but about changing unbridled and irresponsible consumption behaviour. As my delegation has often observed with regard to the Millennium Goals  it is that behaviour  and not population growth and improving living conditions in less developed countries  that places a growing and unsustainable burden on resources and on the environment.  The positive results achieved by the international community in the course of the Assembly’s previous session would not have been possible without dialogue among Governments  which are being joined with growing determination and effectiveness by civil society interlocutors. However  to be honest and effective  that dialogue must be genuinely dia-logos — an exchange of wisdom and wisdom shared. The dialogue must move quickly from an exchange of words and a search for balance among opposing interests towards a genuine sharing of wisdom for the common good.  It is precisely for that reason that Article 1 of the Charter links the promotion of human rights with the defence of peace  settlement of disputes and resolving international problems of an economic nature. Nations are not separate entities  independent of the peoples who comprise them. The fundamental national interest of all Governments should be the establishment and maintenance of the necessary conditions for the full development of the material and spiritual good of every inhabitant of their countries. The promotion of and respect for human rights are therefore the ultimate goal of dialogue and international affairs  as well as the indispensable conditions for genuine and fruitful dialogue among countries.   The Holy See is also attentively following the work of the Assembly’s Third Committee and of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. This statement in the general debate is also an opportunity for me to express our support for the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees and all specialized agencies and bodies working in the broad field of human and humanitarian rights. In that regard  the Holy See also believes that  although slow  the progress made in the discussions on the principle of the responsibility to protect is cause for hope. Nevertheless  resolute and effective attention is still lacking with regard to the problems of refugees  people who have been forcibly expelled and large-scale displacements.   The history of the development of human rights itself illustrates that respect for religious freedom is the cornerstone of the entire human rights architecture. When that freedom is lacking  absent too will be the recognition of the transcendent nature of every human person  which entails a dignity that existed before  and is superior to  the political and normative awareness and that creates an irrepressible framework of freedom and responsibility. If religious freedom falters  all human rights are at risk of becoming something that government grants — or  at best  the result of a balance of social forces  which are variable by nature  because they will have no foundation other than balance or agreement itself.  Beyond criticism of the organizational limitations and lack of effectiveness of the United Nations  we see that there is a universally shared awareness of the need for the Organization  as well as a universal feeling of gratitude for its efforts. All of us understand that  by virtue of its numerous bodies  the Organization constitutes an essential forum for dialogue and understanding between nations. The best way of guaranteeing that the United Nations continues to carry out its historic mission of coordinating and keeping all States united around the common goals of peace  security and comprehensive human development for all will be to continuously focus on the dignity of all men and women and effectively respect it  beginning with the right to life — even of the weakest  such as unborn children and the terminally ill — and religious freedom. "
"180",7331,"VCT",65,2010,"Saint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes  Sir  your ascension to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session with a great deal of anticipation. As one of the primary architects of your own country’s membership in the United Nations  you have demonstrated your belief in the importance of this institution and its role in the modern international context. As you stand on the shoulders of the giants who have preceded you in this role  we are confident that you will ably apply your unique set of skills and experiences to the advancement of our complex agenda.  We are also excited by the theme that you have proposed for your tenure as President of the General Assembly  namely  reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance. It is a theme that resonates loudly with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  and indeed with many of the small and marginalized States that form a significant part of the 192 members of the General Assembly.  We small States have emerged as some of the most jealous and zealous guardians of the United Nations Charter. This vigilance is born of principle and necessity. The Charter is the document that guarantees our place in the Assembly as the sovereign equals of every other country of the world. The United Nations remains the only venue that affords us both a seat and a voice in global affairs. To Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  the United Nations must be the centre of global governance because it is our only option for global governance. There are some States that fortuitously find themselves in the inner sanctums of the Security Council — and the Group of Eight (G-8)  and the Group of Twenty (G-20) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. For them  the centrality of the United Nations may vary with the political winds or the shifting sands of great power intrigue. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has no such luxury. We cannot take our ball and go home  to play on other fields and interact in other forums. The United Nations is all we have. Its centrality in global governance  for us  is therefore an essential and indisputable truth.  You assume the leadership of the General Assembly  Mr. President  at a time when the centrality of the United Nations role is being challenged as never before. Various organizations and small groupings of States  with selective membership and opaque modus operandi  have coalesced to become global decision-makers and shapers of our post-Cold War existence. For our purposes  it is irrelevant whether these groupings have formed to respond to or to precipitate the declining effectiveness of the United Nations. However  the fact is that in the face of global crises of economy  climate  trade and reform  we have been tested and we have been found wanting. We face the real threat of devolving into a mere talk shop  an amalgam of unwieldy bureaucracies or a toothless rubber stamp of decisions taken elsewhere. To avoid such an ignominious fate  we must actively defend our role and legitimacy as the global centre of international governance and decision-making. Permit us the opportunity to offer a few simple suggestions to assist in achieving this goal.  First  for the concept of global governance to have meaning and relevance  we must inject some measure of consistency and predictability into the rules   9 10-55408  that govern our family. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is committed to the international rule of law and the role of the institutions that advance the rule of law and adjudicate international disputes. Governance is ineffective if the rich and powerful among us can place themselves beyond the ambit of timely compliance with rules and decisions.  In that regard  we cite the case of the ongoing dispute between the United States and Antigua and Barbuda on the issue of online gaming  which has already been adjudicated in Antigua and Barbuda’s favour by the World Trade Organization (WTO). We urge those two countries — both strong friends of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines — to quickly arrive at a just and equitable resolution of this matter. Our region was the unfortunate  and no doubt unintended  victim of WTO rulings that have gutted our once-thriving banana industry and threatened to stall that crucial engine of our development. The case against banana tariffs was successfully brought to the WTO by the United States  which does not grow a single bunch of bananas. We are confident that our friends will honour this relatively minor gaming ruling as we have been compelled to adapt to previous paradigm-shifting decisions.  Secondly  the resolutions adopted and decisions taken by the General Assembly must have some worth beyond the paper upon which they are printed. In the dusty archives of our body are hard-fought decisions and resolutions on Palestine  on human rights and on the economic crisis. We have made annual near-unanimous calls for an end to the Cuban embargo. Then our documents are dutifully filed away to be ignored by dissenters or resuscitated in future sessions with  at best  incremental advancement. As long as General Assembly decisions and resolutions remain a buffet from which Member States can selectively pick and choose  our role in governance will continue to be hamstrung. Member States must take the sovereign decision to honour the will of the international community not because they have to but because it is the right thing to do. If we continue to champion the decisions with which we agree while disregarding all others  we are not participating with good faith in the deliberations of this body and we are doing violence to the very concept of a community of nations.  Nor should States manipulate the concept of consensus to make it a virtual veto on United Nations action. Consensus must always be a central goal  but never a barrier  to decisive action by the General Assembly. Necessary  desirable and urgent action cannot be sacrificed on the altar of consensus. Democracy demands that  when consensus cannot be achieved  the recorded will of the majority should be respected.  Thirdly  we must hold every nation to account for commitments that have been voluntarily taken. Much has been written and said about donor fatigue  which is shorthand for the limited attention span of multilateral and bilateral donors when confronting systemic development issues. Much less has been said about commitment fatigue: the developing world’s exasperation with oft-made but seldom-honoured commitments. But make no mistake  fatigue has set in  as we grow increasingly tired of waiting for the 0.7 per cent of gross national income promised by the developed world at the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey in 2002  the billions pledged at the G-8 Summit in Gleneagles for the doubling of aid to Africa  the $10 billion in ironically titled fast-start funding that was to materialize this year for climate change adaptation and the $1.1 trillion promised by the G-20 in April 2009.  To Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  therefore  it is puzzling how some of our friends and development partners can suffer from donor fatigue when they have yet to donate what was originally promised. It is similarly confounding when  reflective of this supposed fatigue  donors attach so many conditions and bureaucratic impediments to unlocking assistance that it becomes all but inaccessible. Small States like ours have neither the capacity nor the desire to establish entire bureaucracies dedicated solely to navigating the administrative labyrinth of irregular and unpredictable aid flows. Nor are we interested in the upkeep of armies of foreign consultants  who seem to be the primary beneficiaries of some international development efforts.  Commitment fatigue morphs into anger when considered in the context of the Haitian people in the wake of the indescribably devastating earthquake of  12 January. In March this year the United Nations held an inspiring donors conference  in which over  $10 billion was pledged for Haiti’s recovery from the earthquake. Today  six months after that conference  and eight months beyond the earthquake  a pathetically miniscule percentage of those pledges has actually been delivered. While less than 20 000 temporary    10-55408 10  shelters have been built to date  over 1.5 million Haitians are still living in tents. A few days ago  we learned that women and children living in tent cities were killed when heavy rains and winds struck Haiti. No one can claim that this result was unexpected  as we in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) have been sounding alarms for months about the dangers inherent in the imminent rainy season. To survive a catastrophic earthquake only to be killed by rain is an unfathomable tragedy. The entirely avoidable deaths of those women and children will remain a stain on the collective conscience of this body and on our membership. Talk is cheap  even when it is the heady talk of billions of dollars. Commitments made must be commitments kept. We must hold to account those who repeatedly make empty promises.  Fourthly  we must cede no ground to the creeping encroachment of non-inclusive  non-transparent and non-representative groupings. We have no doubt that  for example  the G-20 has a useful and even essential role to play in the global economy. There is an undeniable logic to a small group of the world’s largest economies  almost all of which are our close friends  meeting informally to thrash out matters that affect only their large economies. However  the logic fades somewhat in the face of a crisis that has spread rapidly and comprehensively to every corner of the globe.  That is why Saint Vincent and the Grenadines noted with concern the G-20 statement from Pittsburgh a year ago  which proclaimed  “We designated the  G-20 to be the premier forum for our international economic cooperation”. Our esteemed friend and brother  President Obama of the United States  repeated these sentiments from this podium a few days ago when he stated  “we made the Group of 20 the focal point for international coordination” ().  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was not included among the “we” who established this role for the G-20 in Pittsburg. Indeed  we  like 172 other Member States  were not admitted to the meeting  we saw no agenda and we read no minutes of the decisions that were taken. As dedicated champions of the Charter of the United Nations  we also note that Articles 1 and 55 of that document designate the United Nations as the forum for international economic cooperation and solutions.  Indeed  our caution towards the G-20 can be found in President Obama’s very endorsement of it. I shall quote again from his statement of a few days ago. He said  “because in a world where prosperity is more diffuse  we must broaden our circle of cooperation to include emerging economies — economies from every corner of the globe” (ibid.). We could not agree more.  In the wake of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression  172 economies should not be locked out of economic discussions  waiting anxiously on the doorstep of the G-20 for signals and policy shifts that affect our continued survival. We in the Caribbean have been disproportionately and devastatingly affected by the crisis  which we played no role in creating. Yet we have been forced to rely on friendly nations as interlocutors on our behalf. We remain convinced that the deliberations and past decisions of the G-20  from its misunderstanding of the precarious vulnerabilities of small  highly-indebted  middle-income countries to its draconian outlook on offshore financial services — would have benefited from our perspective.  We therefore call on the United Nations membership to give meaning to the words of our Charter and to re-establish our body as a forum for meaningful solutions and cooperation on economic matters. We must reinvigorate the work of the Economic and Social Council. We must renew the mandate of the ad hoc working group to decisively follow up on the issues contained in the Outcome of the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and its Impact on Development (see resolution 63/303  annex).  Good global governance must therefore be premised on global inclusiveness. This is our fifth point: no corner of the world should be excluded from participation in our global family.  In that regard  we once again highlight the case of our friends in Taiwan. The United Nations and its specialized agencies must find ways to ensure the meaningful participation of the 23 million people of Taiwan. Just as their economic strength has merited inclusion in the WTO and the universality of global health challenges have logically compelled their participation in the World Health Assembly  so too should the global reach of climate change merit the meaningful participation of Taiwan in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The interconnectedness of global air travel  and our shared safety concerns  similarly mandate the   11 10-55408  participation of Taiwan in the International Civil Aviation Authority. This is not the case of a tiny  non-governmental organization  to be allowed or denied meaningful participation on some bureaucratic whim. This is a legitimate and vibrant expression of the ancient and noble Chinese culture  with a population 200 times greater than that of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.  The Government and people of Taiwan have advanced a reasonable and responsible policy of engagement to usher in a new era in cross-Strait relations  and have an enviable record of development cooperation and assistance around the world. The international community can and should encourage and reward this responsible global citizenship with meaningful participation in the relevant specialized agencies.  Similarly  urgent and more inclusive reform in the membership of the Security Council is the litmus test of our verbal commitments to governance  reform and revitalization. There is simply no justification for the continued exclusion of the entire African continent or other significant and influential emerging powers from permanent membership in the Security Council. The defenders of the status quo may soon find that they are protecting an increasingly irrelevant and illegitimate institution.  However  we feel that the Council is too important to be allowed to whither into obsolescence. Reform and expansion of the permanent and  non-permanent membership of the Security Council  including the provision of dedicated non-permanent membership for small island developing States  is an imperative that is long past due.  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is proud to have announced its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the 2020-2021 term. If successful  we would be the smallest country ever  by population  to occupy such a position  and only the fourth of CARICOM’s 14 United Nations Member States to assume such a responsibility. Our bid is premised on the historical exclusion of CARICOM States and small island developing States from this critical body  and the value that we believe our presence and perspective will bring to the Council’s deliberations.  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines makes miniscule monetary and military contributions to the United Nations. But our contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security is measured in our historical aversion to wars  our culture of tolerance  peace and plurality and the perspective of a small State that understands that peace is not always best achieved with millions of dollars or armed enforcers  but often with dialogue and small but meaningful peacebuilding actions. Our contribution is succinctly captured in our national motto  which  translated from Latin  reads simply “Peace and Justice”.  Sixthly  and most important  we must never be shy to use this institution to operationalize our commonly held ambitions for a better world and to tackle the global issues of our day. Too often  we spend time lowering  rather than rising to meet  the expectations of a world that is clamouring for our collective leadership.  Our continued failures to achieve a binding solution on climate change mitigation and adaptation is a case in point. In the months since the painful lessons of the so-called Copenhagen Accord  devastating floods in Pakistan and heatwaves and fires in Russia have shown us once again that no nation is immune from the reach and impact of climate change. But the vulnerability of large nations to ruinous hurricanes  floods and fires does not approach the very unique and specific existential vulnerabilities of small island developing States. For  while all States are vulnerable to natural disasters  only small island developing States are threatened with being wiped off the map entirely and ceasing to exist.  As such  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is not interested in the lowering of expectations as we head to Cancún. The need for a binding and meaningful agreement on climate change cannot be deferred indefinitely. We view with disgust the transparent attempts to measure the financial or political cost of doing what must be done to save our planet. We are threatening to destroy our own world  as we shamelessly squabble over dollars and degrees. If we fail in this endeavour  history will look most unfavourably on the narrow  short-term interests that we placed ahead of our own survival.  In a similar vein  and in the interest of time  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines echoes and adopts as our own the proposals enunciated by our CARICOM sister States for prompt action on the global challenges of    10-55408 12  non-communicable diseases  small arms  narcotics and transnational crime  the decade-old Doha Development Round of trade negotiations  international cooperation in tax matters and concessional assistance and debt relief for middle-income island States. We cannot allow narrow ideological agendas to distract us or detract from the accomplishment of these tasks  upon which there is broad agreement.  Finally  a crucial component of the overarching principle of sovereign equality is that of sovereignty itself. We believe wholeheartedly that  in the words of the great Caribbean singer and poet Bob Marley  “every man has a right to decide his own destiny”. We therefore reject  with equal fervour  any foreign or outside interference in the democratic processes of independent States. This is a principle upon which we are unyielding. In many of our small countries  it takes only a few minor mercenaries  or ideologically misguided or misinformed millionaires  to fundamentally threaten the fabric of our fragile democracies. Unfortunately  those interlopers are often aided and abetted by those unpatriotic opportunists who see sovereignty as a fungible commodity  to be bartered and traded to the highest nefarious bidder for short-term political gain.  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is populated by a proud and noble people  with a history of fierce struggle for freedom and independence. There is a steel in the psyche of our Caribbean civilization and its Vincentian component; a steel forged in the fires of slavery and genocide and beaten on the anvil of colonialism  exploitation and resistance. Our small size belies our indomitable spirit. We possess an independence that undergirds Cuba’s heroic resistance to an unjust and internationally condemned blockade. We have a strength that informs the nobility of the Haitian people’s response to unimaginable tragedy. We lay claim to a resilience that is etched in our collective history  and reverberates in the names of our region’s national heroes  such as Nanny  Garvey  Bussa  Martí  and Chatoyer  to name but a few. Our democracies can be neither bought  sold nor intimidated. And our commitment to the democratic inclusiveness of the United Nations and the supremacy of its Charter is similarly unshakeable.  It is against that backdrop  Mr. President  that you will find Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to be a strong ally in your efforts to re-establish the central role of this body in matters of global governance. "
"181",7378,"VEN",65,2010,"On behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  I wish the new President of this session of the General Assembly the greatest success during his term.  The Bolivarian revolution plans to contribute to the structure and agenda of the United Nations  which currently reflect the unjust power relationships that exist in the world. As it is today  this forum helps to perpetuate the unjust relations inherited from the Second World War  relations that become more exclusive and authoritarian as neoliberal globalization advances. The President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  Hugo Chavez Frías  said on 15 September 2005  in his speech during the general debate at the sixtieth session of the United Nations General Assembly that “the United Nations has outgrown its model. It is not just a question of simple reform. The twenty-first century requires profound changes that will be possible only if the Organization is truly recast.” (A/60/PV.6  p.17)  There are two poignant examples that illustrate this unfair and irrational world power architecture. For the past 19 years  the overwhelming majority of the countries of the world have come before the General Assembly to demand an end to the economic and commercial blockade imposed on the heroic Cuban people. But what has the Organization done to ensure that the United States Government abides by the will of the General Assembly? The answer is well known: nothing.  Dozens of resolutions have been adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly on the question of Palestine  but the Israeli military and political elite refuse to comply. The occupying Power acts with total impunity and with the complicity of its main ally. What has the Security Council done to get the occupying Power to respect the principles of international law  including international humanitarian law  and particularly the four Geneva Conventions of 1949? The answer is well known: nothing.  The rebuilding of the United Nations hinges on strengthening the General Assembly and its handling of matters relating to international peace and security.   13 10-55408  Venezuela challenges the fact that a small group of countries impose their conditions in these areas  while the opinion of the majority is not taken into account. A strategy aimed at weakening the General Assembly and excluding it from the most relevant world decisions is being implemented in the United Nations  while the Security Council progressively increases its power and influence over the United Nations agenda and takes over topics beyond the purview granted to it by the Charter of the Organization. The Secretary-General  according to the Charter of the United Nations  is an administrative officer of the Organization responsible for answering to the interests of all Member States  and not the policies of a few Powers that seek to drive the global agenda.  For almost 20 years we have been discussing the reform of the Security Council and the strengthening of the General Assembly  yet so far almost nothing has been achieved. The call from President Chavez to recast the United Nations remains fully valid. To that end  Venezuela proposes to eliminate the right of veto enjoyed by only five Members of the United Nations. This remnant of the Second World War is incompatible with the principle of the sovereign equality of States. Venezuela also proposes an increase in the Security Council’s membership in both the permanent and  non-permanent categories. Why are developing countries deprived of the right to participate in that forum?  Venezuela therefore urges all States to propose candidates for the post of Secretary-General  with the aim of democratizing elections to this senior post. We believe that resolution 11 (I)  adopted on 24 January 1946  regarding the terms of election of the Secretary-General  in no way restricts the ability of Member States to discuss and vote in this election. In line with democratic principles and transparency  Member States must participate in both the nomination and the appointment of this senior official. States would therefore be free to choose among several alternatives.   Rebuilding the United Nations also requires that the General Assembly fully exercise its responsibilities in matters of international peace and security  as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.  Climate change negotiations are unfolding in a complex context that makes it difficult to arrive at consensus on the majority of topics. Developed countries reject international commitments that are fully in force  specifically the Kyoto Protocol. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela hopes that  at the next Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Cancún at the end of this year  a legally binding agreement is reached that is ambitious and respects the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol.   Venezuela is fighting for the creation of a development model based on a new paradigm that substitutes the prevailing models of production and consumption. Developing countries and the most vulnerable sectors of developed countries suffer the impact of the economic and financial crises of capitalism. It is therefore essential and necessary to consider a transformation of this inhumane model that  with its new crisis  has generated more hunger  poverty  unemployment and inequality. The crisis of capitalism has not ended. Its structural nature reproduces itself ad infinitum. Privileged groups  the financial economy  speculators  monopolies and oligopolies and the Bretton Woods institutions will continue to try to have the crisis paid for by developing countries and the world’s poor and most vulnerable. Neoliberal policies  which are applied as a result of the global crisis of capitalism  propose the totalitarianism of the financial markets  deepening the gap between the rich and the poor within those countries and widening the inequalities between the North and the South.   It is also important to underscore that the efforts of the developed countries in the context of official development assistance (ODA) have not been sustained  as large donors have repeatedly not fulfilled their pledges when it comes to the agreed goal of allocating 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product to ODA.   Faced with this crisis  developing countries should strengthen South-South cooperation and create alternative sovereign mechanisms to avoid the credit monopoly maintained by the Bretton Woods institutions. To that end  Venezuela aims to create and strengthen regional financial institutions such as the Bank of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America — Peoples’ Trade Agreement (ALBA-TCP) and the Bank of the South. We welcome the initiatives in that regard that are being undertaken in Africa and Asia.  South-South cooperation is a top priority for Venezuela. In Latin America and the Caribbean there    10-55408 14  are already successful experiences such as that of Petrocaribe  which fosters supportive cooperation in the energy sector  and that of ALBA-TCP  which is producing successful results in overcoming poverty and inequality. These novel forms of solidarity and supportive cooperation contribute to the development of our peoples and to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.   I take great satisfaction in pointing out that  despite the problematic international economic and financial environment  the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has met almost all of the Millennium Development Goals  in particular in the areas of poverty  health  nutrition  education  child mortality and sanitation  among others. We would like to underscore that Venezuela assumed the presidency of the Latin American and Caribbean Summit on Integration and Development in February 2010. The third Summit will be held in our country on 5 July 2011  within the framework of the historic bicentennial anniversary of our signing of our Declaration of Independence.   Venezuela attaches particular importance to the process of union and integration in Latin America and the Caribbean. Progress to that end will lead to the full operation of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  thereby achieving the dream of our liberators as reflected in the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The union of our peoples — the peoples of the South fighting for independence  freedom  sovereignty and self-determination — is a priority of our Simon Bolivar national project  as enshrined in our first socialist plan for the period 2007 to 2013.  In the face of recurrent attempts to erode the sovereignty of countries and in the face of a savage capitalist and neoliberal offensive  the Bolivarian Government calls for the relaunching of the Group of 77 and China and the Non-Aligned Movement so that developing countries can more forcefully defend the interests of their peoples.  We wish to avail ourselves of this opportunity at the rostrum to express our appreciation for the compliments sent to President Hugo Chávez Frías by numerous Governments and social and popular movements from around the world on the occasion of the victory in the Venezuelan parliamentary elections last Sunday  26 September. That victory is a clear testament to the majority support of the people for the humanistic policies promoted by the Bolivarian Government. This electoral victory will also enable our Bolivarian Government to strengthen its solidarity with developing countries.  Defenders of peace  justice  freedom and solidarity in the world can continue to rely on the support of the Bolivarian revolution. "
"182",7417,"VNM",65,2010,"Mr. President   On behalf of the Vietnamese Delegation  I wish to congratulate you on your election as the President of this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that your experience will help bring this session to great success. Viet Nam fully endorses the theme “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance” that you proposed for this debate.  I would also like to take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his significant contributions to the sixty-fourth session.  Mr. President   Our session coincides with the sixty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations  the world’s largest multilateral organization established with a noble mandate of coordinating actions of all nations towards peace  prosperity and justice. Over the past 65 years  the international community and the United Nations have recorded extraordinary achievements in a wide range of areas.  Along with conceptual changes on sustainable development coupled with equitable distribution and enjoyment of fruits produced by growth  the lives of the majority of humankind have been improved and better cared for in many aspects. The process of globalization and the scientific-technological revolution have rendered national interests increasingly interdependent and intertwined. Linkages and exchanges among nations have expanded and deepened  thus further enriching the material  cultural and spiritual values of mankind.  Guided by the primary purposes enshrined in its Charter  which are to maintain international peace and security  develop friendly relations among nations  promote cooperation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural  or humanitarian character  and guarantee human rights  the United Nations has through its membership carried out its lofty mandates in a concrete manner. In this regard  we treasure the outstanding contributions of the United Nations to the prevention of a new world war  settlement of conflicts and civil wars in many countries  roll back of arms races and promotion of disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament  subsequently contributing to the consolidation of international peace and security as well as creation of such a peaceful and secure environment as it is now for humankind to develop.  Besides  we cannot help mentioning the considerable role played by the United Nations in accelerating the process of decolonization in the 1960s and 1970s  which helped liberate over 80 nations from the shackle of colonialism  win national independence and become members of the United Nations. We can never obscure our memories of the four consecutive decades of development initiated by the  A/65/397 3 10-56315  United Nations since the 1960s to assist nations  especially the newly independent  in emerging autonomous and mastering their own processes of socio-economic development  improvement of health care and education  and protection of the environment. The United Nations has also made highly essential contributions to the design of an international legal system  with the Charter of the United Nations itself being the most important piece of legislation.  While a new world war has been avoided  the world of today is still fraught with untold paradoxes and challenges  and the sword of Damocles is still hanging over mankind. We all have witnessed many a war  local conflict  international terrorism  arms race  and proliferation of nuclear weapons. Confrontation  unilateralism  violation of national independence and sovereignty  and inequality in international relations  though somewhat abated  have persisted  and new dangers have surfaced. Over 1 billion people are still living in destitute poverty  and hundreds of millions of others put under the scourge of climate change  food insecurity  natural disasters  pandemics and terrorism.  Mr. President   This situation requires our greater efforts and solidarity to achieve a world of genuine peace  a better life  and a brighter future for all.  The 65-year journey of the United Nations and mankind as a whole with all their successes and constraints has taught us a valuable lesson that the key to success lies in each nation’s own efforts  enhanced international cooperation and promoted multilateralism on the basis of respect for fundamental principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.  In this spirit  Viet Nam holds that this session of the General Assembly under the theme “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance” should focus on the following issues:  First  it is imperative to maintain a peaceful and secure environment to facilitate nations’ development. In this connection  the United Nations should continue promoting efforts for disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons given the new opportunities and prospects  while ensuring the rights of nations to use nuclear technologies and energy for peaceful purposes. As regards differences concerning nuclear proliferation risks  Viet Nam supports efforts aimed at solutions through dialogue and peaceful negotiation.  At the same time  the United Nations should continue promoting measures for adequate settlement of civil wars and local conflicts ongoing in many regions of the world  especially those in Africa as the continent suffering the most in the development process  as has been visibly evident at the newly concluded high-level meeting on the Millennium Development Goals.  Against such a backdrop  Viet Nam supports efforts for a fair  comprehensive and long-term solution to peace in the Middle East. Supporting the reconstruction and national reconciliation efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq  we hope that the people of Iraq and Afghanistan will soon enjoy security  independence and sovereignty for development. With regard to Kosovo  Viet Nam calls on the parties concerned to enhance dialogue in order to achieve a comprehensive solution based on Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). A/65/397   10-56315 4   Second  the international community and the United Nations should continue efforts to build equal international relations  and further improve the international system of law and institutions. Developing countries should be enabled to take part in the globalization and international integration process in a proactive and effective manner. Developed countries  on their part  should fully deliver on their commitments to development assistance  technology transfer and market access. It is important that the United Nations undertake measures to prevent unilateral use of economic means against developing countries. In that context  Viet Nam once again calls upon the United Nations to press ahead with the implementation of the General Assembly resolutions requesting the United States to immediately end its policy of embargo against the Republic of Cuba.  Third  the United Nations  in order to adapt to a changing world  needs to promote reforms as a priority in its agenda. The reforms should be implemented in a prompt  comprehensive  balanced and transparent manner with a view to enhancing the role of the General Assembly  enabling the Economic and Social Council to help the United Nations maximize its role in the development sphere  and enlarging the Security Council membership and improving its working methods. Viet Nam hopes that the negotiations on the United Nations reforms  particularly the reform of the Security Council and its membership enlargement  will soon produce fruitful results.  Viet Nam also looks forward to more coherent  consistent and effective development activities of the United Nations so as to better respond to the demands  priorities and specific conditions of recipient countries. The operation of the Human Rights Council and other United Nations human rights mechanisms should continue to be improved to avoid double standards and politicization.  Mr. President   As actors with an increasingly important role in international affairs and having contributed to the work of the United Nations in many areas  regional organizations have proven effective in helping address many regional and global issues. I wish  in this connection  to mention in particular the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with its incessant growth and development as a dynamic and integrated cooperative organization of 10 countries in South-East Asia  which is striving for the goal of an ASEAN Community by 2015 that rests on three pillars  i.e.  the political-security community  the economy community  and the sociocultural community.  In its cooperation with external partners  ASEAN has been effectively asserting its posture in an environment of peace  security and cooperation for development in the region and the world. The Association has served as the major driving force for cooperation and integration in East Asia  especially in the economic and trade fields. Moreover  ASEAN has been actively promoting the development and sharing of norms and codes of conduct among nations  including particularly the Treaty on Amity and Cooperation  the Treaty on a Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone  the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea  and the ASEAN Convention on Counter-Terrorism.  As the Chair of ASEAN in 2010 under the theme “Toward an ASEAN community: from vision to action”  Viet Nam has been making every effort to contribute to the success of the Association. Motivated by the policy of supporting and harnessing cooperation with the United Nations  we have been working closely  A/65/397 5 10-56315  with relevant partners to ensure success for the upcoming ASEAN-United Nations summit due to be held in October 2010 in Hanoi  thus uplifting the ASEAN-United Nations cooperation to a new calibre.  Mr. President   Alongside the birth of the United Nations  a new Viet Nam  the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam  now the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  was founded. This country has since then surmounted uncountable harsh trials throughout its struggle for national independence and freedom. Having mingled with the mainstream of history of mankind and the United Nations  the Vietnamese people’s struggle for independence  freedom and development has made remarkable contributions to the common success of mankind in an effort for a world of peace  justice and development.  For the past thirty years as a United Nations Member  Viet Nam has joined hands with other Member States in working towards the adoption of many resolutions  decisions and concrete measures aimed at curbing the arms race  promoting comprehensive and full disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  resolving international conflicts and disputes by peaceful dialogue  developing social  cultural and economic cooperation  and ensuring human rights.  It is those commitments and determination that have led the multifaceted cooperation between Viet Nam and the United Nations to increased improvement and incessant development. In the past  the United Nations rendered valuable and practical assistance to Viet Nam in finance and expertise for the country’s post-war reconstruction  helping Viet Nam particularly overcome the difficulties arisen during the period of blockade and embargo.  Today  the United Nations system and its organizations have been active in providing policy advice and technical assistance to help Viet Nam address development challenges as the country steps up industrialization and modernization for the goal of a strong country  a rich nation and an equitable  democratic and advanced society.  Viet Nam has been actively implementing the “Delivering As One” initiative in Viet Nam with a view to enhancing its national ownership capacity in development cooperation and contributing to the reform of the United Nations in general and the United Nations development agencies in particular. Viet Nam has always paid attention to promoting the tripartite cooperation between Viet Nam  a United Nations agency and an African country in such areas as agriculture  irrigation and infrastructure  and this has yielded initial encouraging outcomes. We have recently organized the second Viet Nam-Africa International Forum in Hanoi  which drew keen interests and large participation from most African countries and international organizations.  In the years ahead  building upon the past success of its foreign policy of openness  diversification and multilateralization of external relations  Viet Nam will step up its international integration and make further contribution to the work of the United Nations for the sake of peace  stability  equal relations among countries and an environment conducive to the development of all nations.  A/65/397   10-56315 6   Mr. President   With the firm belief in and strong commitment to the work that requires the joint dedication of hearts and minds of the United Nations and its Members  I sincerely wish this session of the General Assembly every success  thus meeting the common cherished aspiration of the peoples for a world of peace and prosperity.  Thank you very much for your kind attention. "
"183",7448,"VUT",65,2010,"Vanuatu is very pleased that we are meeting under your presidency  Sir  and  on behalf of my Government and of the Pacific Islands Forum  I extend my warm congratulations to you  and we wish to assure you of our full confidence and cooperation.  I should also like to take a moment to pay tribute to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  for his exceptional service and leadership during the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly and for the considerable and important achievements of that session.   15 10-55128   In the same spirit  I take this opportunity also to commend the Secretary-General for his vision  leadership and tireless efforts in working towards achievements in the common interest of all humanity.  Many innocent lives continue to be wasted  with good people killed or wounded and multitudes displaced by heinous acts designed to undermine and destabilize the collective efforts of the international community to achieve peace and security for our societies. These many unprecedented events continue to test the very foundation of our Organization.  As we prepare to enter the second decade of this twenty-first century  it is vital now more than ever that our membership affirms its confidence and faith in the purposes and principles of the United Nations. It is important that we continue to assert our support for fundamental human rights and the peaceful coexistence of our nations. The range and urgency of the challenges that now confront the international community in our globalized and interdependent world demand  at the very least  our steadfast support for and commitment to peace and security for our communities and peoples  and for future generations.  If we are to effectively guarantee human rights and achieve peace and security and social and economic justice for all  we need to be united in this endeavour  and our cooperation and multilateral joint efforts need to be durable and effective. My Government and people of Vanuatu are steadfast in our belief that the United Nations remains uniquely suited to the pursuit and coordination of global initiatives to attain these objectives.  Vanuatu hosted the forty-first annual Pacific Islands Forum in our capital  Port Vila  last month. As current Chair  I wish to inform the Assembly that the Pacific Islands leaders again noted that transnational crime remains a threat to national and regional stability  in particular the proliferation of small arms and light weapons and illicit drugs. Consequently  the Pacific Islands Forum has strengthened cooperation in counter-terrorism measures and emphasized national efforts and regional cooperation in combating transnational organized crime and in strengthening border control capacities. The Pacific Islands Forum remains committed to collective arrangements and mechanisms to assist regional Governments recovering from national conflicts and crises. The value of those efforts is evident in the positive results of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands  created under the Biketawa Declaration with the assistance of contributing member States  which would not have been successful without the strong leadership and commitment of the Solomon Islands Government.  While many of our member countries have not ratified the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC)  Forum leaders recognize the important role that the Convention offers in providing an internationally agreed framework for effective anti-corruption activities around the world. I am pleased to say that our regional organizations are working with the various United Nations agencies to advance work to promote the Convention.  While known as a region characterized by oceanic isolation  smallness and general vulnerability  the Pacific region is one of only a few in the world to have experienced nuclear weapons testing. Therefore  advancing the cause of nuclear non-proliferation and the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty — also known as the Treaty of Rarotonga — remains critical and relevant to our signatory member States. The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty reflects our region’s deep commitment not only to international peace and security but also to collective international action to ensure peace and security. In endorsing the successful outcome of the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference  Forum leaders also welcomed the announcement by the United States of America of its intention to ratify all protocols of the Treaty of Rarotonga.  Notwithstanding their size  national obligations and circumstances  our respective Forum members value and are proud of their contributions to United Nations peacekeeping efforts. My own country is proud to contribute to United Nations peacekeeping missions in East Timor  Haiti  the Sudan  Bosnia  the Peace Monitoring Group and the Bougainville Transition Team in Bougainville  and to the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands.  Terrorism is an offence to humanity and contrary to the core values of the United Nations. We must be resolute in our national and collective efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms. For my own country  I reaffirm our strong support for the relevant Security Council resolutions against terrorism. Those resolutions provide a clear signal of our determination    10-55128 16  to suppress terrorist activities  including training  international movement and financing.  All of us present here today have described the various stages of our progress to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). For our island countries  our increasing vulnerability to threats and challenges  underscored by the impacts of the global economic  financial  fuel and food crises  is exacerbated by the current and impending impacts of climate change  as well as our inherent limited capacity to respond. This is not to say  however  that we have not made progress in achieving any of those goals. With respect to Goal 2  the primary education systems of the Pacific region are characterized by high enrolment  with six of our countries currently displaying net enrolment ratios of over 90 per cent. Most  if not all  of our Pacific island countries are expected to meet the goal of gender equality in education by 2015. We have been able to achieve those goals because we have localized the global indicators by adjusting them to suit our local circumstances and priorities.  While we remain concerned about the pace of our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals  we are committed to accelerating progress towards achieving them by 2015. The Port Vila Declaration on Accelerating Progress on the Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  which was adopted by Pacific Forum leaders at their meeting in Vanuatu last month  recognizes that the MDGs are extremely important  as is also the incremental path towards achieving those Goals — a path that should recognize and accommodate the special circumstances and challenges we face in the Pacific. The Port Vila Declaration also highlights the importance of mainstreaming the programme of support for the sustainable development of small island developing States — which is captured in the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States and the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action — as an accelerator for achieving the MDGs in the Pacific and addressing the specific vulnerabilities that we face. To ensure the success of the Port Vila Declaration  we call for the support  collaborative action and commitment of the international community and our development partners — particularly an improved understanding of and ability to address our vulnerabilities and for improved coordination of efforts towards achieving the MDGs.  Advancing the Pacific islands’ work with respect to the Millennium Development Goals is closely and inextricably linked to the Mauritius Strategy. The development and endorsement of the Pacific Plan by the Forum leaders in 2005 underscored the critical need for creating stronger and deeper linkages between our countries and for identifying sectors where the region could gain the most by sharing resources in the area of governance and by aligning policies. While we believe that we have made some excellent progress in effectively implementing the Mauritius Strategy at the national and regional levels  we also acknowledge our shortcomings  some of which are beyond our control. The growing vulnerabilities of our Pacific island countries are exacerbated by the impacts of the global economic crisis  climate change and natural disasters  and those factors affect our abilities to respond.  Climate change remains the greatest threat to the livelihoods  security and well-being of the peoples of the Pacific. Continuing and concerted efforts by Forum members are being made at the national  regional and international levels to address the impacts of climate change on Pacific communities and peoples. The degree of urgency for real commitments to emissions reduction must be commensurate with the science and with the associated impacts of climate change on the most vulnerable communities. This issue must not be viewed with an eye to short-term impacts on traditional industrial growth or political tenure  but rather with a longer-term consideration of the sustainability of economies  societies and peoples the world over. A meaningful  legally binding agreement on emissions reduction must be reached urgently and without delay. Recognizing the importance of effective coordination and implementation of climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts at all levels — and particularly at the national level — Forum leaders have endorsed a set of principles that will guide Forum island countries and development partners in this regard  bearing in mind existing and ongoing efforts in the region. Those principles are consistent with the Cairns Compact and the Pacific Islands Framework for Action on Climate Change  and they reflect recognition by Forum leaders of the important role that regional and international arrangements play in supporting national adaptation and mitigation through the enhancement of capacity and access to resources.   17 10-55128   I am also pleased to say that  ahead of the Cancún climate change meetings this November and December  the Government of Kiribati will be hosting the Tarawa Climate Change Conference in November. We anticipate bringing together representatives of countries vulnerable to the impact of climate change  as well as representatives of major economies.  Allow me at this juncture to make a few remarks pertinent to Vanuatu’s position on a number of issues. We are meeting here at this Assembly session to once again renew our commitment to the United Nations and to the principles enshrined in its Charter. However  the need to reform the United Nations to ensure that it effectively responds to the needs of its Members remains imperative.  In that regard  I wish to commend the Secretary-General for advancing the work on the reform of the Security Council. We note the work done by the Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations on the question of equitable representation and increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the Council. So we join all like-minded States in encouraging the United Nations to pursue equitable reforms in its institutions in order to minimize the democratic deficit in the multilateral arena.  My Government also joins all other heads of Governments that are Members of the United Nations family in congratulating the Secretary-General on bringing to a reality the efforts over four years to create the office of UN Women  a new entity formally established by the General Assembly within the United Nations created in July of this year. That decision gives more prominence to women and their place in our society.   Vanuatu celebrated 30 years of political freedom last July. This year marks the end of the Second International Decade of Decolonization. My Government wishes to question the progress on some important processes of self-determination. It is disturbing to think that we may legitimize practices that contravene the very principles on which this Organization has been founded. Are we to assume that decolonization issues may be ignored in the years to come so as not to unsettle the status quo?  Issues relating to decolonization and severe human rights violations must be effectively and impartially addressed. We call upon the United Nations to strengthen its efforts in working towards full decolonization of Territories that are still under the control of administrating Powers. Where there are serious reports of human rights violations  there must be a stronger United Nations role in investigating all allegations of human atrocity. We are reminded that the noble task of our multilateral Organization is to reaffirm our commitment to and respect for fundamental human rights and the dignity of the human person.  We are encouraged to see emerging nations  such as Kosovo  rising from the turmoil of restraint to take up their position in the midst of the independent nations of the world. It is in the spirit of democratic freedom that justice must prevail for those peoples whose right to political freedom continues to be suppressed by colonial and illegitimate administrating Powers. That includes for those countries whose political freedom to claim their rights to territorial sovereignty under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and those whose political freedom to rightfully claim an extended continental shelf under the Convention are suppressed by colonial administrative rule.  As we applaud calls for a peaceful resolution of the conflict between Israel and Palestine  my country also calls for the lifting of the embargo on Cuba  which will enable the good people of Cuba to improve their lives.  My country  together with other least developed countries in the Pacific  has consistently argued in this forum that the mechanisms and criteria for assessing graduation eligibility must not be isolated from the permanent and inherent vulnerabilities of our countries. It is unrealistic for United Nations agencies to look at the progress and make projections without taking into consideration the issues of permanent vulnerabilities and capacity to sustain growth in our countries. Indicators for most Millennium Development Goals clearly demonstrate little progress in human development. Climate change  volcanic eruptions and other disasters will continue to be significant factors inhibiting human development in our islands. Such factors are critical  and we therefore reiterate our position that they must be carefully weighed in the vulnerability graduation criteria.  In the case of our very close neighbour  Fiji  my Government believes that all players are interested in    10-55128 18  seeing positive political progress there  which must continue to genuinely engage the good people of Fiji. We have learned that multilateralism offers some constructive innovations in diplomatic practice  but it may also complicate conflict resolution by increasing tension between actors.  Finally  in the spirit of reconciliation through the Pacific way  I call upon all international and regional diplomatic actors to assist in ways that will not polarize the region. Instead  our diplomatic approaches should help to give genuine dialogue and engagement a more credible opportunity. There should be genuine and renewed commitment to fostering relations in the Pacific region  commitment that promotes greater freedom  regional cooperation  friendship and integration  as envisaged in the Pacific Plan document.  In conclusion  I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all our development partners for the support that they are providing in building our economies. I believe more can be done to assist the Pacific island countries in addressing the growing challenges confronting the region."
"184",7480,"WSM",65,2010,"Our world continues to change in profound ways. Technological advances have accelerated globalization  bringing diverse challenges and new agendas. The magnitude of today’s threats requires holistic solutions with a multilateral approach. No one country  however powerful  can meet them on its own. Nations of the world need to work together to forge a coordinated approach. It is a shared responsibility  and the problems will be solved successfully only through effective collaboration.  To meet the challenges  a vibrant institution that is up to the task and responds to the imperatives of our time is required. Sixty-five years ago  the world created the United Nations as the legitimate authority for our collective peace and security. International cooperation and solidarity formed the bedrock of its existence. To this day  the United Nations provides the only viable framework and legitimate authority for acting globally to address issues that transcend national borders.  As a world institution  the United Nations needs to pay attention to its ability to offer itself as a safe place  not just for its traditional stakeholders — the Member States — but also for international organizations  the business community and civil society. Partnerships with those sectors of society are an important vehicle through which the United Nations helps the development of individual countries  and they allow our Organization to achieve  in large measure  the key objectives of its mission.  Our Organization is not without shortcomings  and that is why we must constantly redefine its role and adapt it to respond to the needs of the world that it exists to serve. That is why  with regard to Security Council reform  Samoa has not wavered over the years from its principled support for an expanded Council in both the permanent and non-permanent memberships. The economic and political liberalization has changed the contemporary geopolitical realities and landscape  and the therefore enlargement of the Security Council in both categories is essential for true multilateralism and for the Council’s integrity and credibility.  Equally vital is the ongoing reform to give prominence to the General Assembly as the truly deliberative and representative body in the global decision-making process  giving voice and representation to all Member States  irrespective of a country’s wealth and might. That was the basis for Samoa becoming a Member of this world body over 30 years ago.  The threat of climate change is grave  having dire implications for global peace and security. It threatens to intensify existing drivers of conflict in a way that could roll back development across many countries. The causes of climate change and those responsible for them  the multifaceted threats it poses and the solutions to mitigate and adapt against its negative impacts are well documented and duly validated by science and real life experiences.  A new climate change instrument is currently under negotiation. Progress has been painfully slow  which contradicts the gravity and urgency of the problem. Sadly  vested national interests are taking precedence over concern for a global and just solution. Intransigent positions are being advanced to force concessions and to frustrate progress. For a privileged few  their fortunate geographies and resource endowments may persuade them to feel that climate change is not an urgent priority and that they can afford to wait out the negotiation of a legally binding climate change agreement for as long as it takes.  There is no such luxury for island nations  which paradoxically are at the front line of the destructive impacts of climate change but are least responsible for its causes and often least able to respond and adapt. Indeed  for some island nations  climate change threatens their very existence and survival as sovereign States.  With the stakes so high  climate change is unquestionably an immediate and urgent priority for the world. It would be a big mistake for any country to think otherwise. Similarly  it would be unhelpful to view climate change simply as an environmental issue. Climate change is cross-cutting and endangers economic and social development  with serious implications for the peace and security of our   27 10-55122  communities  whether its impact is national or transborder.  Any new climate change treaty  no matter how ambitious  comprehensive and binding  will be ineffectual without full membership and the participation of all United Nations Member States  especially those with the obligation to participate. Inaction should not be blamed on the absence of solutions to reverse the impacts of climate change but rather on the unwillingness of some countries to be part of a unified global solution.  The much publicized fast-track funding announced in Copenhagen to meet the adaptation needs of the most vulnerable countries has become a best-kept secret. Information on how much of the pledges have been honoured and disbursed  and to whom  has been scarce. When available  the information is vague and seems bereft of coordination. Yet the fast-track resources were commitments made at the highest political level  in recognition at Copenhagen of the pressing need for an interim measure to help the most vulnerable countries avert further harmful effects of climate change  pending the conclusion of a negotiated agreement.  The uncertainty as to the legal form  content and completion date of a new treaty makes it a moral imperative for the promised fast-track resources to be made available without delay and with clear  simplified guidelines to ensure that the intended recipients do indeed secure assistance.  Between now and the conference in Cancún  States parties should move beyond rhetoric and commit to reaching an agreement  as a minimum  on those building blocks of the Bali Action Plan where negotiations have reached a level of maturity and convergence on agreed compromises. We cannot continue to defer making the hard decisions. We need to reclaim the credibility of the process. Every day of indecisiveness disproportionately increases the risks to vulnerable countries that are experiencing more frequent and severe climate change impacts.  We cannot afford to leave Cancún empty-handed. Concrete results must be achieved  not only to give our people confidence that there are substantive responses to protect against climate change  but at the same time to strengthen our belief that our United Nations can deliver a legally binding agreement.  Our global security is at risk. Terrorism transcends international borders in its attack on universal values. Like other international threats  terrorism is an area of mutual concern that demands a collective response. Terrorist acts committed under whatever pretext are deeply deplorable and should be strongly condemned. Those who find self-glorification in the atrocious crimes that they commit should not expect any sympathy or be provided safe havens to hide.  The non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the risk of their acquisition by terrorists  criminals and others should continue to be a top priority of the United Nations. Nuclear terrorism is one of the most challenging threats to international peace and security. A world without nuclear weapons is a safer  more secure and prosperous place to live.  We have heard from this podium of the renewed efforts of the major nuclear-weapons Powers to restart the reduction of their nuclear arsenals. That is encouraging  but we believe that the only absolute guarantee against the use and threat of use of nuclear weapons is through their total elimination. In that connection  we are comforted by the announcement of the United States Government earlier in the year that it was moving towards ratification of the Pacific region’s nuclear-free-zone treaty.  The peacekeeping work of the United Nations contributes  in large measure  to the stability of countries and regions where it has a presence. It is one of the Organization’s growing and most visible mandates and has the full support of my Government. Samoa’s policewomen and policemen are serving side by side with officers of other contributing countries in peacekeeping missions in Timor-Leste  the Sudan and Darfur. In our Pacific region  we continue to honour our commitment to the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands  under the aegis of the Pacific Islands Forum  through our police contingents.  Samoa welcomes the recent initiative  brokered by the United States  for direct negotiations between the leaders of Israel and Palestine to advance the two-State solution  with the nations of Israel and Palestine living alongside each other in peace and security. We remain hopeful that with the genuine support and understanding of other leaders in the region  this will not be another missed opportunity.    10-55122 28   This Wednesday marks the first anniversary of the tsunami that devastated my country  resulting in a heavy loss of life  injury and destruction of property. Life will never be the same for the survivors and those who lost loved ones. However  a sense of normalcy has returned and stability has been re-established.  With the generous support of our development partners  the reconstruction phase is progressing well and the families and villages affected have been resettled on higher ground inland  away from the coast. The necessary infrastructure and utilities for the new settlements are well on their way towards completion. The progress achieved would not have been possible without the kindness and understanding of Samoa’s development partners and the international community.  Of significant importance to Samoa in its efforts to reinvigorate the economy following the dual impacts of the tsunami devastation and the financial crisis is the recent Assembly resolution (resolution 64/295) granting Samoa three more years  to 2014  to put in place a transition strategy to guarantee the sustainability of its economic performance after its graduation from least developed country (LDC) status in that year. Samoa’s post-tsunami experience and the passage of the consensus LDC resolution are important demonstrations of the close and warm relations that my country enjoys with United Nations Members.  At the bilateral and personal level  my Government has already acknowledged the timely and tremendous support of all who contributed during the emergency and in the recovery and rebuilding phases in the aftermath of the tsunami. The United Nations membership was similarly thanked when our LDC resolution was adopted. Nevertheless  on behalf of the people and Government of Samoa  I would like here in the General Assembly to again convey our sincere appreciation to all our development partners  including Australia  New Zealand  Japan  the People’s Republic of China  the European Union  the United States of America  our Pacific neighbours  the United Nations and its related and specialized agencies  and others too many to mention for their generosity and kindness to Samoa. We are very grateful."
"185",7526,"YEM",65,2010,"Mr. President  on behalf of the Government of Yemen  I am pleased to express to you our warm congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We are confident that your abilities and wisdom  Sir  will lead to the success of this session in fulfilment of its desired goal.  I also wish to refer with appreciation and pride to the good work of Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  the previous President of the General Assembly  and congratulate him for his tireless efforts that led the previous session to a successful conclusion  not the least of which was his participation in the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  We also wish to thank His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  Secretary-General of the United Nations  for his continuous efforts to reform our Organization and increase its role in the humanitarian and development fields and in the achievement of international peace and security.  The Republic of Yemen is witnessing complex development and political  social and environmental challenges. A number of factors and circumstances have led to their formation  including the international financial crisis  with its negative effect on the Yemeni economy  and a decline in our progress towards the achievement of the MDGs. There is a severe shortage of available resources owing to the low production and low price of oil  on which the Government depends as a main source of income  representing 75 per cent of its general income. There has also been a decline in remittances from expatriates and in tourism  in addition   5 10-55264  to overpopulation  paucity of water resources  and limited contributions from development partners for funding anti-poverty programmes and providing decent standards of living for our citizens.  Yemen’s pro rata share of official development assistance (ODA) is the lowest of the least developed countries in the world. With a view to achieving economic development and conducting financial and economic reforms  my country has recently concluded an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to implement a programme that will lead to financial straightening out of the budget deficit and stem the progressive decline in Government level of support for fuel in a manner that would contribute to alleviating the general budgetary burden falling on the State.  A number of administrative  financial and judiciary reforms have been adopted  as have efforts to combat corruption and to apply decentralization of power. My Government is now trying to develop its fourth five-year development plan for the years 2011-2015. We have started a political dialogue with opposition parties in order to find agreement on how to address all the challenges faced by Yemen. We have set up election laws and introduced a number of constitutional reforms  called for the formation of a National Unity Government  in preparation for conducting parliamentary elections next April.  Last week  there were a number of meetings in New York on a new initiative regarding cooperation with Yemen  under the name of Friends of Yemen. Participants included representatives of the Gulf Cooperation Council  the European Union  the five permanent members of the Security Council  along with Turkey  Jordan and Egypt  as well as international donor funds and institutions. The purpose of the meeting was to garner support for our efforts to achieve development and combat extremism  terrorism and piracy. We are confident that this cooperation will strengthen our security capabilities to carry out our development plans  reinforce our ability to combat terrorism and protect sea lanes in the Gulf of Aden and the southern part of the Red Sea from piracy and protect our borders.  Among the challenges Yemen has faced are the difficult political developments following a rebellion in the Governorate of Sa’dah  which has complicated the Government’s efforts at achieving national peace and reconstruction. This rebellion  in addition to six wars imposed on Yemen  have caused the displacement of tens of thousands of citizens and forced the establishment of refugee camps in coordination with international relief organizations. The conflict came to an end once the rebel group accepted the six conditions that the Government posed  including the release of a great number of prisoners and agreeing to the Doha Accords  the time frame and implementation of which  as sponsored by sisterly Qatar  we are in the process of carrying out. The Government has responded by peacefully reaching out to the rebels  while upholding the principle of sovereignty and the rule of law throughout the country. The country upheld the right to confront any groups that violate the Constitution and the rule of law  or that practise terrorism  violence or sabotage.  My country is also suffering from the terrorist activities of Al-Qaida  which has been carrying out new operations  such as assassinating leaders in our security sector. It is trying to entrench its position on the Arabian Peninsula by cooperating with opponents to Yemeni unity  such as the southern secessionists  who call for secession in defiance of the will of the majority of the Yemeni people. They also support subversive elements in Sa’dah  in service of the interests of Al-Qaida  and seek to spread instability and anarchy in the country through their terrorist activities targeting Yemen  the region and the rest of the world.  Our security apparatus has managed to make headway in arresting many terrorists and aborting their operations. These terrorists now live in a state of fear and are unable to carry out their terrorist plans. As a complement to the efforts to liquidate Al Qaida  there remains a pressing and important need to build and foster national abilities and coordinate intelligence and security activities.  Experience has proven that outside interference designed to combat terrorism further compounds the situation and paves the way for local sympathy for terrorist groups. Yemen is an effective partner with the international community in combating terrorism. Our success today in waging pre-emptive strikes against Al-Qaida requires that the international community take a strong stand by providing us with its full backing and support.  Since its assumption of the chairmanship of the Group of 77 and China  the Republic of Yemen has enthusiastically and willingly tried to reach consensus    10-55264 6  on a number of issues of interest to the Group and that will maintain the unity and solidarity of the Group and further its relations with the developed countries. Recently  Yemen led the difficult negotiations to arrive at the outcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals (resolution 65/1)  which contains a work programme for the coming five years. Yemen’s leadership of the Group enabled it to achieve much of the South’s agenda  which serves the interests of all developing countries. It is leading other  highly complex negotiations on conventions having to do with the environment and climate change.  We are proud to have chaired the meetings of the Group of 77 and China on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Our effective participation in the work of the relevant committees has led to a compromise and middle ground that we hope will lead to the success that has thus far remained out of reach.  We must focus on the suffering of more than 20 million Pakistanis caused by the recent floods  calling on the international community  particularly the super-Powers  to shoulder their responsibilities towards the Pakistani people as well as their responsibility vis-à-vis the impact of climate change in the future and its potential destructive effects. We call upon all Member States to responsibly stand by the sisterly Government of Pakistan with a view to alleviating the suffering of its internally displaced persons.  I would like to take this opportunity to extend our warmest condolences to the Governments and peoples of States that have recently been affected by natural disasters  particularly Pakistan  China  the Russian Federation and Haiti.  It is  of course  a fact that the Arab-Israeli conflict threatens international stability and security. The history of efforts to solve this conflict shows clearly that Israeli recalcitrance and the Israeli Government’s settlement policies  as well as its refusal to abide by the internationally legitimate resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative or ensure the legitimate rights of the Palestinians are the main barriers to the achievement of peace.  The international community  in particular the main sponsors of the peace talks and especially the United States  should give Israel one last chance to abide by all of the resolutions  previous agreements and calls relating to the promulgation of peace in addition to the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian State on its soil and the cessation of settlement-building. Furthermore  if Israel continues to reject peace  the Security Council should impose a solution to the conflict in accordance with relevant resolutions of international legitimacy and under Chapter VII of the Charter. Israel must also accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and enter into serious talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency aimed at making the Middle East a region free from weapons of mass destruction and to assert the right of States in the region to the peaceful use of nuclear technology.  Despite the numerous meetings of the Security Council and the International Contact Group on Somalia  the situation in Somalia remains dangerous and threatening to the security and stability of the region. It is regrettable that  given the growing piracy phenomenon  its expansion and its threat to international navigation  the international community has not taken effective steps to support the temporary Somali Government  enable it to build its State and institutions  support its security capacity and army and support the African peacekeeping force. This has made the Somali Government and people feel embittered  having witnessed the non fulfilment by the international community of its commitments and obligations to the Somali Government.  Yemen bears the burden of the outflow of thousands of refugees from the Horn of Africa  most of whom are from Somalia. We are well aware of the effects of the security  political and humanitarian situation in Somalia on Yemen and the region. The United Nations and the Security Council in particular should shoulder their responsibility to restore security and stability to Somalia.  Here  we acknowledge the efforts of the Sudanese Government to bring about the success of dialogue with the opposition forces  and we commend the Qatari mediation efforts to achieve peace in Darfur and the Comprehensive Peace Agreement with the South. Dialogue is the only means to maintain the unity of the Sudan and achieve security and stability there. We call upon all Sudanese parties to shoulder their responsibilities and to effectively participate in the dialogue in a manner that fulfils the high national   7 10-55264  interests of the Sudanese people and retains their social integrity and unity.  We call for the revocation of the International Criminal Court warrant against his Excellency President Omer Al Bashir  since this does not respect the sovereignty of the State and impedes efforts to achieve peace in the Sudan.  The parliamentary elections in Iraq reflected the Iraqi people’s support for the democratic option and the Iraqi Constitution. We are confident that they will employ dialogue to solve all of their differences and avoid all sectarian and factional conflicts and disputes. We are hopeful that the Iraqi national leadership will agree to the formation of the Government and put Iraq on the road towards development  construction and stability.  The Republic of Yemen hosted a ministerial meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations at the beginning of last month. At that meeting  it was reiterated that it was necessary to strengthen cooperation among its member States in the fields of trade  investment  tourism  culture and education  fisheries; and efforts to combat epidemics  natural disasters  the challenges of climate change and piracy on the high seas.  We also hosted the extraordinary ministerial meeting of the Sana’a Forum for Cooperation  emphasizing the need to achieve security and stability in the Horn of Africa and the south of the Red Sea  and to combat extremism  piracy and terrorism in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Sea.  We have hosted these and other ministerial and regional meetings based on our desire to achieve collective cooperation in order to maintain peace and security among the peoples of the region and the world  in accordance with the lofty goals of the United Nations.  Despite all the appeals to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the humanitarian themes included in the Goals  the international situation  which has been affected by the financial crisis  the fluctuation of energy prices and natural disasters leading to increases in the price of crops and other foodstuffs  has dissuaded developed countries from fulfilling their obligations to assist and support the least developed countries. There is fear that the specified time frame for achieving the MDGs will pass and the developed countries will not fulfil their obligations towards the developing and least developed countries.  In Yemen  we have positively dealt with these Goals in accordance with our limited capacity. Our Government has adopted a national strategy to eradicate poverty. This has been reflected in our national development plans. We are trying our best  with the cooperation of the international community  to implement this strategy. Our Government has taken a number of measures to increase the allocation of budgetary funds for education and to build more schools as well as to enhance the educational cadres  developing primary education  encouraging education for girls and widening the scope of adult illiteracy reduction. We are trying to improve gender equality and the empowerment of women to participate in political life. We have provided health care for mothers and children  spreading cultural and health awareness. This has led to low infant mortality rates. We have conducted health campaigns to eliminate epidemics and the spread of AIDS.  Yemen suffers from scarce water resources and overpopulation  which adversely affect the sustainability and soundness of the environment. We have therefore made national plans to study the situation  better understand the problems  and protect the environment as part of our national plans for development.  We have spent a great deal on imposing the rule of law and on combating terrorism and other subversive elements. We have taken in more than 700 000 refugees from the Horn of Africa  which has limited our expenditure on development and poverty reduction  on improving the standards of living of our citizens  on providing employment for our youth  on improving education and health care and on the achievement of the MDGs. We therefore call on our friends  partners  international donors and international organizations and financial institutions to help us combat terrorism. They must fulfil their obligations and extend the necessary support to Yemen to help us achieve sustainable development and the socio-economic and political stability to which we aspire. "
"186",7564,"YUG",65,2010,"I stand before the Assembly gratified and in a position to salute it for playing a very important part in the process towards reconciliation in my region  and for supporting the consolidation of the new  modern Serbia. In a few days  we will proudly celebrate the tenth anniversary of our peaceful democratic revolution.  In a world confronted by so many threats  the United Nations must constantly reaffirm its original purpose and adapt to new challenges. The United Nations has confronted  through its many agencies  the scourges of discrimination  disease  hunger  poverty and environmental degradation. In other words  the United Nations has built a capacity to create rules that transcend frontiers  rules that we all respect.  One thing that we have all embraced  as Member States of the United Nations  is the wish to find solutions to all challenges through peaceful means  dialogue and consensus.  I opened with a specific reference to the General Assembly. A few weeks ago it adopted by acclamation resolution 64/298  proposed by Serbia and sponsored by the 27 States members of the European Union  acknowledging the content of the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) regarding the unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo.  The resolution is fundamentally status-neutral with regard to the status of Kosovo. All other interpretations do not correspond to the truth. The resolution welcomed the readiness of the EU to facilitate a process of dialogue between the parties. Serbia welcomes the resolution. We look forward to engaging in the process that will hopefully lead to a mutually acceptable compromise solution to the problem of Kosovo.  We feel vindicated in our contention that the path to dialogue lay through the natural process of international legitimacy. The General Assembly sought an opinion from the International Court of Justice. The ICJ delivered an opinion. The General Assembly has now  as a consequence  called for dialogue. Moreover  that request comes as a consequence of a joint effort between Serbia and the European Union.  In the light of that  we sought reaffirmation of the validity of the international system as we know it. We feel proud that our faith in this process has produced results. We have always said that we are ready to engage in dialogue. But that dialogue must be framed by rules and accountability  and this has been achieved through the latest vote of the General Assembly.  Many have been involved in this process  and we are grateful for the contributions of all those who in the debate on the draft resolution expressed understanding for the position of Serbia. Our issue has been the first test of the new post-Lisbon institutions of the European Union  which we consider our natural and eventual home. We are encouraged by the commitment and sense of purpose of the leadership of these new institutions.  We should be very clear. Serbia has always maintained that the attempt to secede unilaterally is a violation of the basic principles of the Charter  the Helsinki Final Act and Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). A vast majority of United Nations Member States refrained from recognizing Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence. They have continued to abide by their Charter obligations to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of my country. On behalf of the Republic of Serbia  I once again sincerely thank those countries for their support and solidarity.  Serbia’s position remains unchanged. The unilaterally declared independence of Kosovo will not be recognized by Serbia explicitly or implicitly. This is enshrined in our Constitution. We have repeatedly said that we seek dialogue  but within a framework of globally acknowledged law  the law of the United Nations. For this reason  we insisted on the process of    10-55103 10  seeking the opinion of the International Court of Justice and the subsequent General Assembly resolution related to the Court’s opinion.  Let me be very clear as to what the Court did and did not say. Its advisory opinion reaffirmed that Kosovo remains under the interim administration of the United Nations  and that Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and the United Nations Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government in Kosovo stay in force and continue to apply. That means that this part of our territory remains subject to an international regime mandated by the Security Council.  The centrality and leading role of the Security Council in determining the comprehensive settlement of the Kosovo issue remains paramount  and will provide legitimacy to the result. The Court also did not endorse the view that Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence was sui generis — a unique case. Nor did it endorse any avowed right to self-determination for the province’s ethnic Albanians.  The Court chose to examine the language of Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence  and held the view that the text of the declaration itself did not contain anything that violates international law. The Court  thus  did not approve the province’s right to secession from Serbia  nor did it support the claim that Kosovo is a sovereign State.  The Court’s opinion is clear: the unilateral declaration of independence was only “an attempt to determine finally the status of Kosovo” (A/64/881  advisory opinion  para. 114). The General Assembly resolution relating to the Court’s opinion acknowledged this content of the Court’s advisory opinion. It is within this framework that we are ready to follow the Assembly’s resolution and to engage in a dialogue.  We are now ready to talk  and we will do so in good faith. Therefore  Serbia asks all Member States to engage fully in the spirit of their vote in the Assembly  in which they called for a dialogue to be facilitated by the European Union.  A dialogue requires trust. Soon the two parties will be talking to each other for the first time in many years. We must be patient and seek out those issues which allow confidence to be built on each side. There will be many issues to discuss  and some of them will be complicated.  All Member States can contribute to an atmosphere that creates trust. We are entering a phase in which creative solutions require political imagination  respect for our own democratic institutions and great skill. I trust that it can be a phase in which all parties leave behind them anachronistic analyses and diplomatic ambushes. We must be able to build confidence to have trust.  Serbia believes that the continued pursuit of recognition is futile and counter-productive to the spirit in which we now enter this phase. All those who wanted to make their point have made it  and we still do not have a clear settlement. I want to underline that it is of critical importance for Member States that have not recognized Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence to stay the course on non-recognition throughout the dialogue process. That will be a significant contribution to ensuring that unilateral attempts to impose outcomes of ethnic and territorial disputes are not legitimized  thereby preventing Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence from becoming a dangerous and destabilizing precedent.  Until now  statehood has never been attained without the consent of the parent State. A durable settlement on an issue of such magnitude and sensitivity has never been the product of compulsion; it always necessitates consent.  It would be equally harmful if there were attempts to alter realities on the ground while discussions get under way. Any attempt to change these realities through the use of force would bring an immediate end to the process of dialogue.  I address the Assembly today as a leader who believes that the future lies in seeking reconciliation. Our National Assembly adopted a historic Declaration on Srebrenica: a crime was condemned and an apology was extended. There is little precedent for such an action  and I am proud  in that it demonstrates the maturity of the democracy of Serbia.  I hope that more such gestures throughout the region will help us create a new region in which our shared history will unite us morally rather than divide us politically. For this  surely  is the foundation upon which the future will be built.  My guiding light is the history of the European Union. It should be for the entire region of South-East Europe. The European Union has been a story of   11 10-55103  reconstruction and reconciliation. That story is not over. The Union faces its own challenges  and we in our region must assume the responsibility of emulating it. We must absorb the values and culture of today’s Europe in order that the Union absorbs us.  This is a delicate exercise  in which expectations must be carefully nurtured. The EU is evolving. But so is our region. In this dynamic  we have to assume that the European Union will remain true to its word that the inhabitants of the region now referred to as the Western Balkans will all become citizens of the European Union. It would be a geographical  historical and cultural aberration if this were not so. However  as the region goes through its own changes  it is particularly sensitive to the signals that it receives from the European Union. We hope that as the new institutions of the Union take shape  we will have an increasingly clear communication from and with the EU.  It is also true that our region is changing. To a very large extent  it is changing to the good. We should recognize the many new levels of cooperation that exist in our region. The Western Balkans — which has been affected by the financial crisis — is a story of many small and larger incremental successes. In fact  relations have never been better. But the region must also acknowledge that as it develops its successes can generate new challenges.  There is one area  therefore  on which I wish to speak with a clarity that may be deemed undiplomatic. Organized crime is now a global industry. It is the dark side of globalization. It attaches itself to weak societies. It attaches itself to political and religious extremists. It attempts to buy and subvert democracies. Like water  it spreads to where it finds least resistance. It is global and globalized in its interconnections.  Organized crime  I want to state emphatically  is in the Western Balkans. I consider it to be the greatest single challenge to my country and to the whole region. It always has been present  and it was given solid foundations because of the wars in our region. But I fear that it is developing capabilities — acquired from the globalization of crime and access to technology — at a much faster pace. The criminals concerned are bringing drugs  guns  human trafficking and corruption into our societies. In doing so  they are using our region to spread into Europe. I fear that we are in a race against time in our region. The stark choice is that South-Eastern Europe will become either a valuable bridge between Europe and vital areas to the East or it will become the beachhead of organized crime trying to reach Europe.  We have a common responsibility as leaders in our region to eliminate this scourge on our societies  and Serbia will spare no effort in our quest to eradicate this threat. It is our responsibility to all our neighbours. For this reason there has been a growing number of meetings and consultations between us in the region on this matter.  But today I want to say that this issue cannot be addressed tactically and occasionally. It is a strategic issue that affects all of Europe. I am therefore asking that we all become alert to the next generation of threat.  In our region  we have a responsibility to create a strategic alliance against organized crime. We hope that all Western Balkan States will make fighting it a priority. We owe this to our citizens  we owe it to our neighbours in the European Union  and we owe it to the next generation.  Serbia has historically been part of global movements. That is why we are totally engaged in achieving membership of the European Union. That is why we support the United Nations system. It is also why we are now moving to reactivate the many relationships that we built historically  as part of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).  My country is the largest successor to a founding member of the Movement. Serbia’s capital  Belgrade  was the site of the First NAM Summit in 1961. 1 am proud that one of the capstone events marking the Movement’s fiftieth anniversary will be celebrated in Belgrade next September.  As part of our commitment to the Millennium Development Goals  we are strengthening many of our engagements and commitments worldwide through the Movement. We shall contribute to those countries that would welcome assistance  and we look to an intensification of cooperation. I hope that this is a clear signal that my Government believes in an active global engagement that will contribute to both global solidarity and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals."
"187",7592,"ZAF",65,2010,"My delegation joins previous speakers in expressing our congratulations to Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We want to take this opportunity to assure him of our full cooperation and to wish him a very successful and rewarding term. I also take this opportunity to thank Mr. Ali Treki for the excellent work he did in steering this Assembly during his tenure as President during its sixty-fourth session.  The theme of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly — “Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance” — resonates with what our global citizen  Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela  said about this body on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary:  “The United Nations has to reassess its role  redefine its profile and reshape its structures. It should truly reflect the diversity of our universe and ensure equity among the nations in the    10-55109 26  exercise of power within the system of international relations  in general  and the Security Council  in particular.” (A/50/PV.37  p. 6) My delegation supports the choice of this theme  and we wish to reiterate our belief in the centrality of the United Nations and the system of multilateralism.  Despite the challenges that face humanity in the twenty-first century  the relevance of the United Nations as a multilateral mechanism through which a myriad of complex world affairs can be administered and resolved cannot be overemphasized. Those challenges compel us more than ever before to strengthen the United Nations. South Africa is committed to working with other Member States to achieve the full potential of the United Nations to address the urgent challenges facing the international community by making it more relevant  more responsive to the diversity of humankind and more representative.  The creation of the United Nations was one of the notable successes of the twentieth century  and thanks to its existence the world has been spared another war on the scale and magnitude of the First and Second World Wars. The exponential growth in the membership of the Organization over the years  from 51 Members in 1945 to 192 today  clearly demonstrates the confidence that the peoples of the world have placed in the United Nations and the ideals contained in its Charter.  The universal membership of the United Nations gives it the legitimacy to be at the centre of efforts to address global challenges. However  the question is whether the United Nations has leveraged that diversity of its membership as a source of strength and acted decisively against any tendency that runs contrary to its fundamental values and founding principles.  The answer to this is yes because  in the past  the United Nations played an invaluable role in the worldwide process of decolonization  transforming the political landscape of the world and bringing much-cherished freedom and independence to the peoples of Africa  Asia and Latin America. The Organization was instrumental in bringing about the demise of the universally despised apartheid system in our own country  South Africa.  When the Organization recognized the right to development as a human right  it gave voice and hope to those who know the face of poverty. When the Organization has sent its troops to far-flung places to keep peace among neighbours who should be living together  it has again underscored the reason for which it was established. Amid all the challenges  the United Nations has been relevant and responsive to our diverse interests.  Five years ago  at the World Summit  we agreed that  if the Organization were to continue to play its central role in global governance effectively  there was a need to strengthen and reposition it to deal with the challenges of the twenty-first century.  We believe that the revitalization of the General Assembly remains one of the cornerstones of the United Nations reform agenda. The General Assembly is the chief deliberative  policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations and plays a critical role in the process of standard-setting and the codification of international law. Its decisions are taken by a collective among equals for the common good.  We will support measures that are aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the General Assembly  especially regarding its role in the maintenance of international peace and security. Indeed  we witnessed with satisfaction how  on several occasions  the General Assembly acted promptly when the Security Council was unwilling or unable to respond to grave developments in the aftermath of the conflict in Gaza in 2009.  Indeed  no transformation of the United Nations could be complete without the fundamental reform of the Security Council. South Africa believes that the objective of the reform should be to create a Security Council that is truly representative of the membership and effectively responsive to international crises  as mandated by the Charter of the United Nations. Indeed  it remains a travesty of justice that Africa  which accounts for a large portion of the work of the Council  is not represented in the permanent category. Thus  deliberations about us carry on without us.  The world should be free of weapons of mass destruction  in accordance with our undertakings on total disarmament. In that regard  South Africa welcomes the recently agreed programme of work of the Conference on Disarmament.   27 10-55109   While the right to development and freedom from want are central to the work of the United Nations  we have just ended the High-level Plenary Meeting to review our performance in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and agreed that more needs to be done to act on commitments already made by the international community in that regard.  The people of Haiti have a story to tell about how best the international community can respond in unison and effectively to a nation in distress.  A speedy and satisfactory conclusion of the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization  which promised so much for the developing South  unfortunately remains a dream yet to be fulfilled. At the same time  the global economic crisis has highlighted the point that many of us have always made about the need to work for an international financial architecture that is sensitive to the development needs of the South.  The contribution of the Group of 20 (G-20) is a welcome development in that regard  and we believe that the Group should complement and reinforce the good work of the United Nations and not act as an alternative. In its composition  the G-20 will also need to mirror the rich diversity of humankind by making sure that all regions of the world  in particular Africa  are well represented. We look forward to the full implementation of the undertakings made to transform the international financial architecture  including the reform of the Bretton Woods institutions  as a step towards building a world system founded on equity and social justice.  Environmental issues  including climate change  have also become high on the priorities of the international agenda. South Africa is fully committed to a multilateral outcome on the basis of the Bali Plan of Action  with a two-track negotiated and legally binding outcome. We are convinced that the Copenhagen Accord provides political guidance for future negotiations.  Accordingly  we should work together to ensure that the forthcoming meeting of the sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Mexico takes bold and concrete steps to address climate change and its effects. For our part  South Africa will have the opportunity to host the seventeenth session of the Conference of the Parties in December 2011  on the eve of the end of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.  Peace and stability are one of the preconditions for bringing about an Africa of the new beginning that the Chairperson of the African Union  His Excellency President Wa Mutharika of Malawi  spoke of on the first day of the general debate (see ). The United Nations has been an important partner to Africa  working with us through the African Union  whether in Somalia  the Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo. South Africa is encouraged by the commitment shown by the international community in trying to assist the both the Government of the Sudan and Southern Sudan as they prepare for the upcoming referendum in January 2011.  The people of Zimbabwe also need the helping hand of the international community in implementing their Global Political Agreement. The African Union and the Southern African Development Community speak for us  too  in calling for the lifting of sanctions against Zimbabwe. We will continue to work with the peoples of Zimbabwe  Madagascar and Burundi  among others  in their efforts to build and consolidate peace and democracy in their respective countries.  In the case of Western Sahara  South Africa remains concerned about the continuing impasse  which stands in the way of a solution that will result in the people of Western Sahara exercising their inalienable right to self-determination. We count on the United Nations  especially the Security Council  to continue to make decisions that enable us to decisively deal with the challenges of peace and security on our continent.  The United Nations should see Africa as a partner in the maintenance of international peace and the management of conflicts  and accordingly do more to strengthen the working relationship between the Security Council and the African Union Peace and Security Council. In this respect  South Africa will continue to support all international efforts to help the people of Palestine and Israel in their endeavour to find lasting peace  leading to the establishment of a viable Palestinian State  on the basis of the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital  existing side by side in peace and security with Israel.  We are at one with the call made by several delegations for the lifting of the embargo on the Republic of Cuba.    10-55109 28   We have converged here year after year to make strong statements on Palestine  the embargo on Cuba and the independence of the Western Sahara. The ultimate test of the relevance of the United Nations will therefore be in bringing closure to all these long outstanding issues in a manner that is consistent with our decisions and the collective will of nations represented in this Organization. In conclusion  we were also privileged recently to be the stage  and Africa the theatre  of the 2010 Fédération internationale de football association World Cup tournament. Our people spoke for us during that soccer event in how they embraced each other and in their diversity of many nations  consistent with the spirit of ubuntu  which simply means “I am because you are”. They gave us hope and confirmed the faith we have in our belief that a better world is possible. The role of sport in development and in advancing peace can never be underestimated. As States  we can best respond to this message from our people by making sure that the United Nations  in playing its role in the global system  is more relevant  more inclusive and more representative.  Looking ahead  South Africa is honoured to have been endorsed by the African Union as a candidate for the Security Council non-permanent membership for the period 2011-2012. We stand ready to continue to contribute to the achievement of peace and security in the world."
"188",7634,"ZMB",65,2010,"I stand before this Assembly as an envoy of His Excellency Mr. Rupiah Bwezani Banda  President of the Republic of Zambia.  Zambia wishes to align itself with the statement delivered by His Excellency Ngwazi Professor Bingu Wa Mutharika  President of the Republic of Malawi and current Chairperson of the African Union.  This session is taking place amid global challenges such as climate change  loss of biodiversity  environmental degradation  international terrorism  piracy  HIV/AIDS  extreme poverty and hunger  among others. It is an occasion for all Member States to collectively engage in dialogue aimed at finding solutions to the challenges that our countries are facing  in order to contribute to the socio-economic development and well-being of our people.  The Assembly’s theme this year is appropriate  as it provides an opportunity to reaffirm the central role of the United Nations in global governance. The role of the United Nations is felt in areas such as peacekeeping  security  human rights  the promotion of gender equality and the fight for social justice and equality. However  emerging global challenges  such as the recent financial and economic crisis  also call for a greater role for the United Nations in global economic governance. In that regard  our Government would like to see a strengthening and enhancing of capacity in the United Nations to enable it to deal with some of those challenges.  Allow me to express Zambia’s gratitude to the Secretary-General for organizing the important high-level meetings that preceded the general debate.  The summit to review the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) provided an opportunity for the international community to take stock of existing gaps and the challenges faced in the attainment of the MDGs. At that meeting I elaborated on the progress Zambia has made and the challenges we continue to face in our efforts to attain the MDGs. In spite of the strides made in improving the macroeconomic environment and putting in place development frameworks  the incidence of poverty in my country remains high  partly because our efforts alone are not enough. I therefore wish to reiterate calls to the international cooperating partners to honour all of their commitments to ensure that the 2015 targets are realized.  Let me also add that the measures that the Zambian Government has adopted to address the issue of hunger and poverty include devising agricultural sector policies that enable smallholder farming    10-55128 56  households to improve their productivity. In that connection  this year Zambia has recorded a bumper harvest of maize  which is our main food crop. That will ensure food security and increased incomes for smallholder farmers  who constitute the majority of the farming community.  We are mindful  however  of the fact that climate change  as evidenced by persistent periods of droughts and floods in our countries  poses one of the most serious threats to the agricultural sector and thus to overall food production. While as a Government we are doing everything possible  such as investing in agricultural research and irrigation methods  the debate on climate change should not lose sight of the need to assist developing countries  including Zambia  in building capacities to adapt in order to mitigate negative impacts on the agricultural sector. Without those  poverty and hunger will persist in my country.  Zambia shares the concerns of the Secretary-General regarding current global resource loss and ecosystem degradation. It is important that mankind reverse the ongoing trends of natural resource loss and ecosystem degradation as a commitment to protect biodiversity. That will be achieved only if all stakeholders step up their efforts and meet the MDGs and other internationally agreed development goals.  My delegation welcomes the positive developments that have occurred in the past year in the area of arms control and disarmament. The Security Council’s convening of a summit to address disarmament issues  the Secretary-General’s launch of a five-point nuclear disarmament proposal  the entry into force of treaties establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in Central Asia and Africa  and the convening of a summit in Washington to discuss nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation  among others  must indeed be commended. We hope those efforts and the momentum generated will be sustained and will lead to the resolution of all outstanding issues in the area of disarmament.  Zambia  however  continues to face difficulties in controlling the inflow of small arms and light weapons. The illicit trade in small arms threatens security and retards social and economic development in our country. Zambia therefore calls for the establishment of a strong and legally binding international instrument on the arms trade. We strongly support the convening of the United Nations conference in 2012 to establish legally binding common international standards for the import  export and transfer of conventional arms  with specific measures against defaulters.  On the reform of the United Nations  in particular the Security Council  Zambia reaffirms its support for the African position  as espoused in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration  that Africa should be granted  among others  not less than two permanent seats  with all of the prerogatives and privileges including the right of veto  and two additional non-permanent seats. Africa is the only continent without permanent seats  and yet it has the second largest membership of the United Nations. Granting Africa permanent seats will redress that historical injustice.  The Government of Zambia recognizes the important role that women play in attaining development. Furthermore  we recognize that the empowerment of women and their inclusion in the decision-making process have enhanced their role in development. That is why Zambia has integrated women of all sectors of society in decision-making positions  and we are committed to doing even more.  Our Government welcomes the establishment of UN Women  the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women  and the appointment of Ms. Michelle Bachelet  the former President of Chile  to head it. It is our hope that the new Entity will have a strong and effective presence at country level and will help Member States implement standards and will provide them with the much-needed financial and technical support required to achieve women’s empowerment  equality and equity.  As the Assembly is aware  Zambia has been hosting refugees prior to and since its independence in 1964 and is party to all refugee conventions. My country was among the first on the African continent to host a refugee camp. Zambia is committed to hosting refugees  and our experience has demonstrated that voluntary repatriation is a desirable and durable solution. However  as an under-resourced and least developed country  hosting refugees is a major challenge for us. We therefore call upon the international community to provide financial assistance to enable us to discharge that responsibility through the provision of minimum standards of care.  In addition to the question of refugees  the issue of internally displaced persons  which has continued to increase worldwide  especially in Africa  equally calls   57 10-55128  for our attention. The adoption by the African Union last year of the Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa is an important landmark that requires the support of the international community at large.  The sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe continue to cause great suffering to the people of that country and to the southern Africa region as a whole. Similarly  the embargo that the United States has imposed on Cuba  which the United Nations has condemned through numerous General Assembly resolutions  has caused untold hardship to the people of Cuba. Zambia calls on this body to ensure that the sanctions on Zimbabwe and the United States embargo on Cuba are lifted.  In an effort to consolidate democratic governance  Zambia is in the process of enacting a new   constitution. The National Constitutional Conference that was established to oversee the process concluded its work and submitted a draft constitution  which awaits tabling before Parliament. As the Assembly may be aware  Zambia will hold presidential and general elections in 2011. As in the past  international election observers  including those from the United Nations  will be invited.  As we reaffirm the role of the United Nations in global governance  let us not be complacent in the face of great suffering and hardship in our world. Let that be the force that drives us to action  where all nations will work together in meeting the goals and aspirations of our peoples."
"189",7670,"ZWE",65,2010,"Allow me once again to extend to you  Sir  our warmest congratulations on your election as President of General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I would  at the same time  like to assure you of Zimbabwe’s support and cooperation during your presidency.  We are meeting today to reaffirm our commitment to the United Nations and  in particular  to its comprehensive agenda for the promotion of peace and security  sustainable development and human rights. We are  however  concerned that the world today continues to witness unbridled acts of aggression  wars  conflicts  terrorism and rising levels of poverty. We are also alarmed that powerful States  which daily preach peace and good governance  continue to trample with impunity upon the sovereignty of poor and weak nations. Zimbabwe yearns for a community of nations that recognizes and respects the sovereign equality of all nations  big and small  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. We all have positive roles to play in promoting peace and development for the benefit of present and future generations.  As Members of the United Nations  we have recognized the pressing need to reform our Organization to make it better able to carry out its various mandates. Zimbabwe stands ready to work closely with you  Sir  as well as with other Member States  to ensure that the reform process is speeded up and carried out on the basis of consensus and democratic participation.   Most immediately  we must find ways and means to re-establish and assert the pre-eminent role of the United Nations in advancing peace and security  development and the achievement of internationally agreed goals  particularly the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Why are the developed Western countries  especially those permanent members of the Security Council with the veto  resisting the democratization of the United Nations organs  especially the Security Council? Are they not the ones who talk glibly about democracy in regard to our developing countries? Or are they sanctimonious hypocrites whose actions contradict their sermons to us?  As we all know  the General Assembly is the most representative organ of the United Nations. Its position as the chief deliberative policymaking organ of the United Nations should therefore be respected. We need to move with haste and find common ground on how to revitalize the Assembly to enable it to fulfil its mandate as the most important body of the Organization. Most important  this process of revitalization must redress the continued encroachment by the Security Council on issues that fall within the General Assembly’s purview and competence.  Our position on the reform of the Security Council is well known. It is completely unacceptable that Africa remains the only continent without permanent representation on the Council. That historical injustice must be corrected. We therefore urge Member States  including those that have vested interests in maintaining the status quo  to give due and fair consideration to Africa’s legitimate demand for two permanent seats  with full powers of veto  plus two additional non-permanent seats. Africa’s plea for justice cannot continue to be ignored. We all have an    10-54965 8  obligation to make the Council more representative  more democratic and more accountable.  Zimbabwe continues to advocate greater equality in international economic relations and decision-making structures. We therefore recognize the centrality of the United Nations in setting the global development agenda and believe that it is only a more coherent United Nations system which can better support the realization of all the internationally agreed development goals.  The developing world  particularly Africa  continues to suffer from the effects of the global economic and financial crises. It is important to understand that the critical issues we face today cannot be addressed effectively when so many countries and regions are left out of the key decision-making processes of the institutions of global governance.  We need to participate in the making of policies and decisions that affect our very livelihoods. It is for this reason that we have called  and continue to call  for the reform of multilateral financial institutions  including the Bretton Woods institutions.  It is clear that climate change is now one of the most pressing global issues of our time. Copenhagen failed to produce a successor to the Kyoto Protocol  an outcome that many of us had hoped for. Yet that Conference was significant in its own way. It demonstrated the futility of attempts by the rich and powerful to impose their views and policies on the poor and weak.  What we need is not an imposition of solutions based on self-interest  but a consensus on the reduction of harmful emissions and a climate-change regime that balances adaptation and mitigation backed by the transfer of technology and resources.  We need to pay special attention to the three pillars of sustainable development  namely  economic growth  social development and environmental protection. In doing so  we should implement the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It is our hope that when our negotiators meet in Cancún  Mexico  this December  they will produce an outcome that addresses the needs of those most affected by the effects of climate change.  Global food security continues to be a matter of great concern  particularly in the light of increased drought and flooding. We reiterate our call for an urgent and substantial increase in investment in agriculture in developing countries. Global efforts to address the food crisis  the impact of climate change  and the drive to achieve the MDGs must go hand in hand.  It is disappointing that the Doha Development Round has stalled  despite nine years of negotiations  mainly due to the intransigence of some countries. The Doha Round of trade must not be allowed to die but must  instead  remain focused on development  as was originally envisaged.  We also call on the developed world to show commitment to global food security by increasing trade and access to their markets. Developing countries need to break away from the unending cycle of humanitarian assistance  and this can be achieved if they have increased access to developed- country markets.  Zimbabwe strongly condemns the use of unilateral economic sanctions and other coercive measures in international relations. Such measures are completely at cross purposes with the principles of international cooperation as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. I say this because my country continues to be a victim of illegal sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States without any reference to the United Nations and with the evil intention of causing regime change. These illegal sanctions have caused untold suffering among Zimbabweans  who alone should be the deciders of regime change.  Our Inclusive Government is united against these illegal sanctions and has made repeated appeals without success for their immediate and unconditional removal. The rest of the international community  including the Southern African Development Community  the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa and the African Union  has similarly called for the removal of the sanctions  but these calls have gone unheeded.  We urge those who imposed these iniquitous sanctions to heed the call by the international community to unconditionally remove them. The people of Zimbabwe should  like people of every other sovereign State  be left to freely chart their own destiny.  Every year  this body adopts a resolution on ending the economic  commercial and financial   9 10-54965  embargo imposed by the United States on Cuba. To this date  those resolutions have gone unheeded by the United States and the result has been the continued suffering of the people of Cuba. Zimbabwe joins the Non-Aligned Movement and other well-meaning countries which call for the immediate lifting of the ruinous embargo.  Zimbabwe has expressed its concerns with regard to the continued stalemate in the Middle East peace process. It is unacceptable that  decades on  peace continues to elude that part of the world. We call upon all parties involved  particularly Israel  to respect the relevant resolutions passed by the United Nations. It is our sincere hope that the current negotiations under way will be inclusive and eventually lead to the cherished goal of a sovereign State of Palestine  thus ending decades of suffering for the Palestinian people.  Since its inception in February 2009  our Inclusive Government has fostered an environment of peace and stability. Several reforms have been implemented  and the Government has created and instituted constitutional bodies agreed to in the Global Political Agreement (GPA). The constitutional outreach programme is currently under way and upon its conclusion a new draft constitution will be formulated as precursor to a referendum next year  hopefully to be followed by an election.  Achievements in the economic area include the revitalization of capacity utilization in industries  the containment of inflation  improvement of service delivery in health and education  as well as the rehabilitation of basic infrastructure such as roads  water and sanitation facilities. The three parties to our GPA have worked hard to implement most of the issues that we agreed on. To maintain the momentum  we need the support of the region and that of the international community. In this regard we commend the Southern African Development Community  the African Union  the Non-Aligned Movement and indeed like-minded members of the international community for giving us their support. We believe that constructive engagement  and not isolation and punishment  will bring the necessary impetus to the efforts of our inclusive Government. Our great country is indeed marching forward in peace and unity."
