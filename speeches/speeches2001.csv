"1",31,"AFG",56,2001,"﻿At the outset  onbehalf of the Government of the Islamic State ofAfghanistan  and on my own behalf  I wish to expressmy profound condolences to the Government of theUnited States of America and the American nation  aswell as the families that lost their loved ones in theunfortunate crash of American Airlines flight 857yesterday.My delegation is very much delighted at Mr. HanSeung-soo’s assumption of the presidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly and remainsassured that his able conduct will lead the work of thissession to its desired end.My delegation is also very pleased at Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s meritorious winning of theNoble Peace Prize this year  I wish to warmlycongratulate him and his fellow recipient of the prize the United Nations itself.I am very thankful to all delegations that havementioned the name and the case of Afghanistan andthe need for international help to reach Afghanistan.The appalling events of 11 September and thesomewhat lesser-known event of 9 September — the33assassination by suicidal killers of the great Afghanleader Ahmad Shah Massoud — have changed theworld. The United Nations  the internationalcommunity and the world at large are focusing on anew war  the war on terrorism. My Government and thepeople of Afghanistan denounced the terrorist attacksagainst the United States and continue to denounceterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Weourselves have been captives and hostages of terrorismlonger than most. In fact  during 23 years of war inAfghanistan  Muslim Afghans have not engaged in anyterrorist acts. Islam is an integral part of life inAfghanistan and teaches justice and respect for humanlife and glorifies the dignity of human beings.I quote from the Holy Koran: “We have bestoweddignity on the children of Adam”. (The Holy Koran XVII:70)Islam  in the tradition of the Abrahamic faiths places great emphasis on peace  compassion and thevalue of human life. Thus  Islam should be recognizedfor the principles upon which it was created and notacts resulting from irresponsible interpretations  whichare far from genuine Islam. These irresponsibleinterpretations are based on primitive and sectarianthinking  especially the retrogressive policies againstwomen  which have no place in Islam.With the strong  broad global coalition on theirside  today the people of Afghanistan have beenvindicated in their righteous struggle against terrorismand extremism — a struggle pursued single-handedlybut valiantly over the past seven years against theterrorist forces of the Taliban mercenaries and theircross-border and international allies  chief among themsince 1996 being Osama bin Laden’s Al Qaeda terroristorganization.In this most trying time  when the people ofAfghanistan are being liberated from the rule of theTaliban  and when Taliban forces are fleeing strategiccities across our land  including the capital  Kabul  it isevident that the civilian inhabitants of these cities andthe people of Afghanistan as a whole  having offeredtheir support to the liberating forces of the IslamicState of Afghanistan’s United Front  are deserving inthe fullest measure of a Government to which theirwelfare can be soundly entrusted.On Tuesday  13 November  in a series of eventsrapidly taking shape in and around Kabul  the Talibanmercenaries and their terrorist allies were thought to beholding ground  but abandoned the city in a hastymanner  causing a power vacuum.With the capital  Kabul  on the verge of chaos andmayhem  the Government forces were left with nooption but to dispatch a limited police force to the city.The decision to police the city preceded eyewitnessreports of the looting of National Bank assets and theplundering of the city’s main currency market and anumber of aid agencies by the retreating Taliban forces.We deeply regret any ill treatment of individualsthat may have occurred in isolated cases. We haveordered our security authorities not only to refrain frombut to actively investigate any such acts that may havebeen committed and to prevent such incidents fromtaking place in the future. Let me reiterate that ourdesire for peace for all people in our land remains firmand that we will not  now or later  condone any lawlessacts aimed at disrupting the crucial process ofinstituting a broad-based  multi-ethnic and fullyrepresentative Government in Afghanistan  as calledfor by the United Nations and the entire internationalcommunity.The Islamic State of Afghanistan hails the newdevelopments as a victory not only for the people ofAfghanistan but also for the international community inour shared campaign against terrorism.Let me assure the Assembly that the recentgaining of ground by the forces of the Islamic State ofAfghanistan’s United Front in Kabul in no way reflectsan intention on the part of the Government of theIslamic State of Afghanistan to monopolize power.Rather  it is our sincere hope that the people ofAfghanistan will decide democratically in the nearfuture what form of political system they desire. In thiscontext  we steadfastly support United Nationsresolutions on Afghanistan  and thereby therecommendations made by the Secretary-General’sspecial envoys to Afghanistan  Ambassador LakhdarBrahimi and Ambassador Francesc Vendrell  and willdo our utmost for the implementation of the process.The Islamic State of Afghanistan fully honours itsagreement made in Rome with the representatives ofthe Rome process  led by the former King ofAfghanistan  Mohammed Zahir Shah  and remainscommitted to its implementation.Today Afghanistan finds itself in a majorhumanitarian crisis — a crisis such as the world has not34witnessed in recent times. With winter approaching ourpeople are facing famine. Our people will die becausethey do not have enough food to sustain them throughthe winter. Many aid agencies began leavingAfghanistan after it became evident that the bombingcampaign would begin.Over the past several years  tens of thousands ofcivilians have either fled the country or have beeninternally displaced. The people of Afghanistan are notasking for a favour. They desire first and foremost toreturn to the position they were in before 1978 — alevel playing field where they can govern themselvesand grow. Twenty million landmines  a ruined andalmost non-existent infrastructure and a very highilliteracy rate do not make for a level playing field.Even a fraction of the benefits bestowed on theinternational community by Afghan sacrifices canreconstruct our nation.Today we are charged with finding a solution forAfghanistan  even as problems continue to increase andchange on a day-to-day basis. But we must now  notlater  think about the people of Afghanistan and aboutgiving them peace after so many years of war.A broad-based Government  inter alia  throughthe Loya Jirga — Grand Assembly — must beestablished. All ethnic groups must be equitably andadequately represented and given voice in this broad-based Government. The Hazaras  Pashtuns  Tajiks Uzbeks  Aimaks  Turkmen  Baluchis and all otherethnic groups of Afghanistan must have fairrepresentation in this broad-based Government.All these groups make up what Afghanistan istoday  and Afghanistan is not complete without any ofthese groups. For centuries  all of these groups havelived peacefully among themselves without bloodshed and each one has contributed to Afghanistan and hassacrificed tremendously in the resistance againstrepeated foreign occupations. For centuries  all thesegroups  as a united people  resisted foreign hegemonicforces. History has shown that Afghanistan is not forforeign occupation or conquest.The Islamic State of Afghanistan’s United Frontwants the rule of law based on Islamic tenets pluralistic democracy  fundamental human rights peace  unification and meaningful reconstruction. Atour core we wish to uphold human rights for allpeoples of our land — men and women. We desire toabide by United Nations resolutions  the rule of lawand recognized international norms and principles. Wehighly appreciate the efforts being made by the UnitedNations aimed at finding a solution for Afghanistanand support all United Nations endeavours andmeasures to combat international terrorism.The future Government of Afghanistan must notbe subjected any more to the unilateralism that hasblanketed it for so long. The nation of Afghanistanmust have  as any nation must have  the respect of andsincere cooperation with its neighbours. The futureGovernment of Afghanistan must not be reduced to a“sphere of influence”; it must be recognized as asovereign nation in the truest sense. Self-determinationfor Afghanistan means that no country of the worldshould have a veto concerning what the Afghans decidefor themselves.Recognition of the principles of mutual respect non-interference and full sovereignty of Afghanistanwill naturally be followed by economic andcommercial cooperation. Hence  a sovereignAfghanistan will deploy all efforts to broaden itsrelations with all of its neighbours  including Pakistan.Such measures as opening up to Pakistan and openingup key transit routes  from north to south and from eastto west  ought to be implemented. Afghanistan has tobroaden its economic relations with all neighbouringcountries. The crossroads at the heart of Asia issituated in Afghanistan  and our country’s economicand international development rests largely in utilizingthis resource in a progressive and open manner.I need not remind Members today that a stableAfghanistan means a stable Pakistan and a stableCentral Asia. An ignored and ruined Afghanistanwould be a calamity for the entire region and the wholeworld.The people of Afghanistan must decide whatform of Government they desire. No one ethnic groupmust dominate and no neighbour of Afghanistan hasthe right to incite  overtly or covertly  one ethnic groupagainst others. It is time for the people of Afghanistanto think about their future and to come together. Theymust all work together for their country as they haveworked for centuries before. It is my aspiration and theaspiration of every Afghan that normalcy will berestored and that we will live in peace.We  the Islamic State of Afghanistan  and we  theUnited Nations and the international community  havea duty to rebuild Afghanistan. There must be an35extensive and comprehensive United Nations-ledreconstruction plan for Afghanistan. The internationalcommunity must take the reconstruction of Afghanistanas seriously as it takes the war on terrorism. I submitthat reconstruction and a people’s hope will do more toeradicate evils such as terrorism and the seeds ofterrorism than war can perhaps ever do.Rehabilitation must begin with addressinghumanitarian problems  including the pressing crisis ofinternally displaced persons and refugees. The longer-term Afghan reconstruction programme must becomprehensive; under such a programme  facilities ofall kinds — roads  bridges  hospitals and schools anduniversities for boys and girls — must bereconstructed. Girls were purposely made illiterate bythe Taliban mercenaries. A massive education effortmust be undertaken so that our young people can learnskills and grow up to be a new generation for ourcountry. The 20 million landmines must be cleared sothat the people can cultivate their land and not have torely only on poppies to make a living.In the Afghan reconstruction programme theremust be a programme for orphans and widows. TheAfghan reconstruction programme must directly helpthe war-stricken and war-devastated land and people ofAfghanistan. Afghans of the diaspora  from all over theworld  must come and take part in the Afghanreconstruction programme and help build their country.I believe that  with the help of almighty God  wecan rebuild Afghanistan and that Afghanistan can onceagain live in peace with its neighbours and cancontribute to the prosperity of the internationalcommunity.In conclusion  I appeal to the United Nations andto the international community to adopt a new visionfor Afghanistan  a vision that will leave behind thedeath and destruction that has seized its people for somany years  a vision that embraces tolerance and unity a vision that will rebuild the spirit of Afghanistan andgive hope for peace to each and every person of ourland. The change must come from each person whocalls himself a Muslim and an Afghan; it must alsocome from each country that calls itself a friend ofAfghanistan. Our friends and neighbours must grant usthe goodwill to govern ourselves and to be our ownpeople."
"2",70,"AGO",56,2001,"﻿Allow me tostart by congratulating you  Mr. President  on behalf ofmy Government and myself  on your election to thepresidency of the United Nations General Assembly.Your election is an acknowledgement of the manycontributions made by the Republic of Korea to UnitedNations efforts to maintain international peace andsecurity  as well as to promote the economic and socialdevelopment of our peoples.This session is being held during a period ofmajor challenges to our Organization and theinternational community in general.Peace and security continue to be endangered bymany armed conflicts  particularly in Africa  as well asby terrorist activities launched systematically orsporadically against some countries. Extreme povertyand misery still affect large numbers of the worldpopulation  especially in my continent  where onefourth of our 800 million inhabitants survive on lessthan $1 per day. The HIV/AIDS epidemic  nowaffecting more than 36 million people  most of themeconomically active people  may seriously threaten theeconomic development and future of many societiesunless urgent measures are taken.To face these and many other challenges  theUnited Nations must continue to improve its internalstructure  including the Security Council  whosemembership must be reconsidered to allow for a moreequitable geographic balance. In addition  its workingmethods should be restructured to ensure effectiveimplementation of its decisions.The United Nations must also endeavour toimplement the action plans and recommendationsadopted over the last decade  with a view to resolvingproblems in the areas of HIV/AIDS  socialdevelopment  human rights  racism and racialdiscrimination  as well as terrorism.At the last session of the General Assembly  myGovernment voted in favour of resolution 55/158  onmeasures to eliminate international terrorism. Wecontinue to believe that its implementation will beessential to fighting this enemy. Terrorism is aninternational scourge with many faces. No country isimmune to this heinous evil  and to fight it  we mustcooperate at the bilateral  regional and internationallevels  under the leadership of the United Nations.Angola reiterates its firm condemnation of the 11September terrorist attacks  which victimizedthousands of innocent civilians and endorses the use offorce to eliminate terrorist networks and their supportbases.Having been subjected to terrorism for manyyears  Angola is pleased to join all other States in thisanti-terrorist campaign. In this context  we have joinedthe other members of the Southern Africa DevelopmentCouncil to promote a forum to discus and identify themany faces of terrorism  as well as effective means toprevent and fight its activities in and from our region.As to the African continent  we believe measuresto combat terrorism should particularly address itssources of financing  such as the illicit diamond  drugand weapons traffic  and identify its networks in orderto prevent the free circulation of its members.In partnership with some countries  Angola hasdeveloped an international diamond certificationsystem that has prevented diamonds originating fromillegal traffic to reach international markets. Thus  wehave helped prevent the financing of terrorist groupsand their activities in many countries of our continent.At this stage  the struggle against terrorismrequires that  beyond the measures encompassed bySecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001)  specialattention be devoted to the completion of aninternational convention against terrorism. This legalinstrument could eliminate some of the ambiguitiesstill surrounding the definition of this phenomenon.23My Government is firmly committed to peace inAngola  the African continent and the world as awhole. After a period of uncertainty  peace is slowlybecoming an irreversible reality in Angola. The regularforces of UNITA’s militarist wing  which had launcheda large-scale military campaign to seize power  havebeen completely neutralized. Counties under theirillegal control have been liberated and the AngolanGovernment now controls the entire national territory.Large numbers of rebel soldiers and officerssurrendering their weapons and being integrated intoAngolan society is now a daily event. Today UNITA’smilitary wing has only small groups  inadequatelyarmed in the jungle or in remote areas of our largeterritory. Although they can make isolated armedattacks  they do not represent a threat anymore toAngolan democratic institutions or to the safety ofmost of our population.My Government believes that the LusakaProtocol continues to be a valid formula for resolvingproblems related to peace and national reconciliation inAngola.The climate of peace that is starting to prevail ishaving favourable repercussions on the country’seconomy. Although considerable distortions andweaknesses still exist  reform efforts under way canhelp overcome serious social problems and enablegeneral elections to be held in the near future in a trulydemocratic environment.As a result of a long period of war  Angola stillneeds the support of the international community in itseffort to alleviate the problems of poverty  displacedpersons and refugees  and to rebuild its infrastructure.The environment of relative peace would not bepossible without the help of the internationalcommunity  which has made the distinction betweenthose who are committed to peace and democracy andthe proponents of war  and has imposed SecurityCouncil sanctions against UNITA’s militarist wing ledby Jonas Savimbi. The most visible effect of thesesanctions has been their contribution to a significantreduction of Savimbi’s capacity to wage war and  as aresult  to persuade a great number of UNITA membersto give up their weapons and join the peace effort.That outcome clearly demonstrates the efficacy ofthe sanctions as a means  and not as an end inthemselves. That is why my Government favourskeeping and tightening them until peace becomesirreversible in Angola. Nevertheless  my Governmentis still concerned with the findings of United Nationsreports  according to which not all countries have fullyadopted measures called for by the sanctionsresolutions.The Security Council resolutions on sanctionsagainst UNITA were adopted in accordance with thepowers given to the Council by the United NationsCharter. All nations are legally obligated to abide byand implement those resolutions. The resultingobligations on the Member States prevail over anyinconsistent obligation to which they might be subjectby virtue of any other treaty or international agreementto which they are  or may become  party. That principleshould also be applied with regard to sanctions againstUNITA.The Angolan Government considers inconsistentthe arguments put forward by certain Governments —some of which have a privileged relationship withAngola — of a supposed incompatibility between theirinternal legislation and Security Council resolutions.We appeal to those countries to reverse their positionand to take the measures required. This  we believe will contribute to the development of harmoniousbilateral relationships with Angola.Angola is firmly committed to a search for peacein the Great Lakes region  and particularly in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. We are pleasedwith the positive results achieved lately by the peaceprocess. In general terms  the ceasefire has beenadhered to and foreign troops have been withdrawn.Angola  for example  has withdrawn 75 per cent of itstroops. Namibia has completed its withdrawal  andboth Zimbabwe and Uganda have started to repatriatetheir respective armies. Only Rwanda has not yet takenany step to signal its willingness to withdraw its forces and therefore to fulfil its basic obligation as a signatoryto the Lusaka Agreement and the obligations of thepertinent resolutions of the Security Council. We arehopeful that proper preparation of the inter-Congolesedialogue will lead to a substantive discussion of therelevant questions regarding the political future of thecountry.As regards Burundi  Angola salutes theestablishment of a transitional Government  which is adirect outcome of the Pretoria agreement  for which themediation efforts of former President Nelson Mandela24were so crucial. We hope this step will soon lead topeace and stability in Burundi and good-neighbourlyrelations with bordering countries.With regard to Western Sahara  Angola thinks itis necessary to find a solution acceptable to bothparties that makes it possible to overcome the barriersto the implementation of a plan to resolve the conflict.My Government encourages the United Nations and theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) to persist in theirefforts in that direction.The international community should not forgetthe problems of Somalia. The establishment of aTransitional National Government is an important stepon the way to a peaceful resolution of the internalconflict there. Both the United Nations and the OAUshould support that step in order that Somalia canreturn to its rightful place in the community of nations.Angola is also concerned with the deterioration ofthe peace process in the Middle East  which hasresulted from the recent intensification of the violence.We believe that a resolution of the conflict betweenIsrael and Palestine will require negotiations. Wetherefore appeal to the parties to continue theirdialogue and to abide by the agreements they signedand by the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.Angola is pleased with the advances achieved bythe fraternal people of East Timor in their struggle forthe right to self-determination and independence. Thepolitical  moral and diplomatic support that Angola andother members of the international community havebeen providing through the years in major internationalforums was decisive in enabling the people of theterritory to reach a point where they can finally choosetheir destiny in freedom. The Timorese are nowpreparing to proclaim the birth of a new  independent sovereign and democratic nation  but they will continueto need the support of the United Nations for theconsolidation of their institutions.The international economic recession will have amajor impact on developing countries  and on Africa inparticular  which has already suffered the effects ofglobalization. Of course  African countries cannotavoid globalization. But to engage in cooperative andcollective activities  African nations must be based instrong States  something that hardly exists in thecontinent.In the New Partnership for Africa’s Development(NEPAD)  the countries of the continent have found away to break away from stagnation and to promoteinter-African cooperation and achieve development.Angola is engaged in the New Partnership. Economicprogress can be achieved in Africa through thepromotion of trade among its nations  the establishmentof healthy economic conditions and good governance fighting regional threats — including conflicts andendemic diseases — and welcoming capital inflows.We hope that NEPAD will become a force for politicalstabilization and economic development in Africancountries  particularly those affected by seriousdivisions.The International Conference on Financing forDevelopment  to be held in Monterrey  Mexico  mustbe an opportunity to mobilize resources fordevelopment  particularly for the 49 least developedcountries  34 of which are in Africa  and to alleviatethe extreme poverty under which more than 600million people are now living."
"3",117,"ALB",56,2001,"﻿Thisyear's session of the General Assembly is marked byprofound sadness over the innocent victims of themacabre acts perpetrated by terrorists two months agohere in the United States of America  and now also bythe events of this morning. On behalf of theGovernment and the people of Albania  I would like toexpress our utter indignation and our strongest andcategorical condemnation of those acts  which wereaimed not at a single country but  rather  were a seriousattack on the values of democracy  freedom and worldcivilization. At the same time  I would like to conveyour deepest sympathy to the American people and to allthe families that lost loved ones in those tragic events.International terrorism is today becoming one ofthe greatest challenges for the world in which we live.It is essential that the international community tacklethis phenomenon with the greatest seriousness  for it isreplete with catastrophic consequences in many areas.Albania considers the military actions of the anti-terrorism coalition led by the United States and GreatBritain against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan andthe Al Qaeda terrorist group  under the leadership ofbin Laden  to be just and in full conformity withChapter VII of the Charter and Security Councilresolutions. Taking that into account  and as a countrythat defends the values of liberty and democracy Albania expressed its determination to be part of thatcoalition from the outset.The international action that has just begunagainst terrorism should not be seen as a clash betweencivilizations. On the contrary  we Albanians see it as astruggle between good and evil and as a confrontationin which the values of humanism and peace are setagainst obscurantism and the negation of values. Theonly way to win this war is for all of our countries tounite their forces to create a common front  to takeincreasingly Draconian preventive measures at thenational level  and to deploy ways and means forcooperation at the bilateral and multilateral levels toblock any individual terrorist or terrorist group thatthreatens international peace and security. For its part with the mechanisms at its disposal  the United Nationscould and should do more to coordinate those efforts.Albania welcomes the measures taken by theUnited Nations to respond to acts of terrorism. Westrongly support Security Council resolution 13732(2001) and call on all Member States to fulfil theirobligations under the resolution. We also support thecurrent efforts aimed at completing the United Nationslegal framework for coordination and for theinternational community's efforts to combat terrorism.For its part  Albania is already a party to eight majorinternational conventions on the struggle againstterrorism. We shall soon adhere to six moreconventions.The new Albanian Government's four-yearprogramme has set very clear objectives to definitivelytake the country out of its long transition stage andplace it on the path towards stable economicdevelopment  the consolidation of its democraticinstitutions and legal framework  and integration intothe European family. Thanks to sustained efforts Albania has already established an encouraging climatefor individual Albanian entrepreneurship as well as forforeign investment.Moreover  Albanian institutions will keep thestruggle against terrorism  organized crime  illegaltrafficking and corruption at the centre of theiractivities. The responsible commitment of the country'sleaders to an uncompromising struggle against thosephenomena  as well as their cooperation with othercountries in the region and beyond  has in most caseskept in check the activities of criminal elements whoseek to exploit Albania as a transit country for varioustypes of illegal trafficking.Albania believes that a mosaic of fledgingdemocracies is already taking shape in the Balkans albeit with difficulties. Believing that domesticpolitical and economic stability are intrinsically linkedto regional stability  Albania has committed itself toapplying a regional policy of good-neighbourlinesstowards all Balkan countries  and has already givenconcrete proof of that desire. One clear sign of thatpolicy was the re-establishment of diplomatic relationswith the Belgrade Government at the beginning of theyear. That was a logical follow-up to the democraticdevelopments begun in the Republic of Serbia that ledto results that were eagerly awaited by the whole of theinternational community  namely  the fall of theMilosević regime and his dispatch to the Tribunal atThe Hague. The same fate should also befall the othercriminals who carried out the policy of genocide andethnic cleansing he planned.On behalf of peace and stability in the region  aswell as on behalf of good-neighbourliness  Albania hasadopted a realistic attitude  even with regard to themost recent crisis in the former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia. The position we adopted was very muchappreciated by the international community.The Albanian Government welcomed the Ochridframework Agreement between the Macedonianauthorities and the Albanian political forces  and wehope that it will soon be implemented in acomprehensive manner  as this would contribute topeace and stability in Macedonia and in the region. Wealso warmly welcome the indispensable role of  and theefforts made by  international mediators  which led tothe signing of the Agreement  as well as thecommitment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) and the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE) to ensure itsimplementation on the ground.The Albanian State has good relations ofcooperation with Kosovo  and we greatly appreciate thepositive developments that have taken place there. TheUnited Nations Interim Administration Mission inKosovo  and Mr. Haekkerup personally  have taken anumber of very important steps in order to finalize thelegal framework for Kosovo and to organize thegeneral elections  which will be held on 17 November.The elections will represent an important chapterin the history of Kosovo and of the region  because thiswill be the first time in their history that the people ofKosovo will be electing  in a free and democraticmanner  democratic Government bodies that will takecharge of the future of Kosovo. We would like toexpress our sincere hope that the Serb minority and theother minorities living in Kosovo will participate inthese elections  because we consider them to be anintegral part of Kosovar society.Although I do not wish to speak at great lengthabout the many problems that are facing Kosovo  Iwould simply like to appeal to the internationalcommunity to actively seek a solution to the issue ofdivided Mitrovica. Practices aimed at averting inter-ethnic conflict in Kosovo such as compromises in thearea of territorial compensation based on the concept ofparcelling out its territory  and the establishment ofparallel institutions  are harmful and should be3deplored. They will not benefit Kosovo. They willsimply give rise to a fresh surge of the inter-ethnichatred that was fuelled by Milosevic. The internationalcommunity and the active political forces in Kosovomust make every effort to build a new and open societythat respects ethnic  religious and cultural diversity.Albania has established good relations ofcooperation with the countries in the region  bothbilaterally and multilaterally. It has endeavoured toplay its part in contributing to peace and stability in theBalkans  including through the framework of theSoutheast Europe Cooperation Process  whosechairmanship Albania currently holds. In theframework of this initiative  Albania will play an evenmore active role in coordinating the efforts of memberStates with a view to strengthening multilateralcooperation in all areas  in order to overcome the crisesand problems of the region.The Albanian Government will continue with thiscommitment over the next four years. It will work alsowithin the framework of other regional initiatives where one of our important commitments is toimplement joint infrastructure projects in theframework of the Stability Pact for South-easternEurope.Like the other countries of the region  Albaniahas embraced with enthusiasm the process ofintegration into Euro-Atlantic bodies  as its strategicobjective and principal priority is to become a memberof the European Union.The Albanian Government welcomed the decisiontaken last June by the Gˆteborg Summit to begin in thenear future the process of negotiations for the signingof a stabilization and association agreement. TheAlbanian Government hopes that these negotiationswill be concluded as soon as possible and that theagreement will be signed within the next year. We areaware that this will require coordination andcooperation at all Government levels in order for us tobe able to meet the political  economic  social andother standards emanating from this process.We are convinced that integration has to start athome and that we will have to do more to achieve theresults required by the European Union in all areas particularly when it comes to progress in effectingreform  and especially in terms of consolidating ourlegal system  harmonizing our legislation with theexisting body of community agreements  and thecarrying out of effective macro- and micro-economicpolicies.Joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) is one of Albania's strategic objectives.Thanks to its close relationship with the Euro-AtlanticAlliance in the last few years  it is one of the ninecountries that the Alliance has designated as beingpotential candidates for NATO membership.Today humanity is facing both new and oldthreats. Conflicts between States; inter-ethnic conflicts;terrorism and organized crime; widespread poverty andthe wide gap that exists between the poor and the richcountries  including the digital divide; natural disastersand the drying up of energy resources; diseases such asAIDS and other epidemic illnesses  and those spread bybioterrorism  have long been the subject of study in theinternational community. Current developmentsthroughout the world have shown  now more than ever the vital importance and the crucial role of the UnitedNations in achieving peace and security and infostering development throughout the world.The Millennium Summit showed yet again that itis essential for each State Member of our Organizationto maintain an ongoing commitment to contribute toresolving regional and international conflicts andtensions and to address such challenges asglobalization  poverty  HIV/AIDS  drugs  and theachievement of sustainable development.But beyond these challenges  the United Nationsis facing a multitude of problems related to its reform.It must manage its resources even better so that theycan be used as much as possible for peacekeeping andfor development projects in all of the poor countries the countries in transition and the developing countries.The United Nations should also become asrepresentative a body as possible.Finally  the United Nations must devise andimplement wholeheartedly mechanisms that are notbureaucratic or complex but streamlined and effective in order to ensure that its activities become moreconcrete and bear more fruit and that its voice carriesthe highest authority throughout the world."
"4",140,"AND",56,2001,"﻿Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr.Han Seung-soo on his election to the presidency of theAssembly and to express our thanks to his predecessor Mr. Harri Holkeri.I would also like to congratulate the Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  and the United Nations on theirwell-deserved Nobel Peace Prize.We are compelled to take up the events of 11September and the actions initiated by ourOrganization  starting with Security Council resolution1373 (2001)  at our discussions here today. I havechosen to make my statement in a language not of mycountry — English  the language of our host countryand city — in tribute to the United States  to theAmerican people and Government and to New YorkCity  which were harmed by the recent terrorist attacks.We meet today almost two months after theterrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New YorkCity. The horror of this attack  the thousands dead: somany terrible images have been seared into ourcollective memory. And we remember also theremarkable acts of courage and determination thatfollowed in the wake of this shameful crime.That the attack took place here  in New York  theseat of the United Nations  is both painful and sad. ForNew York is an immigrant’s city that welcomes withopen arms all races and all creeds from our world. Thelist of the victims of the attack  from so many differentcountries  attests to the remarkable and joyousdiversity that makes New York. She is truly the capitalof the world  and the right place  the only place  for itsUnited Nations.29We know that this very building might have beena target for the terrorists  and that in an earlier terroristattack of 1993  the United Nations was on the list. Thisseems to me proof  if any is needed  that the UnitedStates of America is not the only object of terrorism.Rather  it is the idea of tolerance and religious andcultural diversity  symbolized both by New York Cityand by the United Nations  that is the object of the rageof a small group of men — men who live and die byterror and who have turned away from political debateto violence and death.And so all of us here must play our part in thebattle against mindless killing  and debate both thereasons for and the responses to terrorism. If there aredisagreements and disputes  we should never forgetthat the very act of debate — the very idea of thisforum — is anathema to those whose modus operandiis silence. What is telling  in my opinion  is not theidentity of the perpetrator — we are quite certain whois responsible  although we have only begun toconsider why — but the fact that the perpetrators  deadand alive  never admitted responsibility for theiractions.I would thus like to express the views of mycountry  the Principality of Andorra  in this debate.Andorra is a small country created in 1278 by a pact ofpeace  and is blessed with seven centuries of peace anda parliamentary system that started in 1419. WeAndorrans like to think of our country as an example oftolerance and coexistence of different creeds andnationalities. Through the centuries  we have welcomedscores of refugees from European wars persecuted intheir homelands for their ideas. Our Constitution which enshrines the secularity of the State  includes afar-reaching bill of rights that highlights democracyand the rule of law. Let me therefore reaffirm  as ourPresident  Marc Forné  stated immediately after theattacks  Andorra’s condemnation of these crimes.My country has taken appropriate measures tocombat terrorism in all its forms  and I will be signingthe United Nations Convention for the Suppression ofthe Financing of Terrorism  the United NationsConvention against Transnational Organized Crime andthe Conventions of the Council of Europe againstterrorism and corruption.Let me assert Andorra’s belief in the role ofdebate rather than violence as a necessary response toviolence — its belief that the United Nations is a vitalforum for world conversation  a forum whoseprinciples  and indeed whose buildings  need to becelebrated and protected.Let us therefore ask ourselves what it is theseterrorists want. In the videotape he released the day theAmerican bombing began  their leader announced thefollowing goals: first  the removal of American troopsfrom Saudi Arabia; secondly  an end to the bombing ofIraq; and  finally  a resolution of the Palestinianproblem.It is worthwhile to note that both the presence ofAmerican troops in Saudi Arabia and the bombing ofIraq are the direct result of prior aggression. Theinternational community has for decades sought aresolution to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis  but asolution  if one is to be found  must come first andforemost from within Israel and Palestine. Their peace if it is to be reached  cannot be imposed from without.While these are the proclaimed reasons for thehostility of the terrorist networks to the United States one might come to the conclusion that these statedobjectives are a screen  and that the attacks were madein order to bring about religious wars in the twenty-first century.For the United States and its allies  it is a waragainst terrorism. But the terrorist networks claim it isa religious war  pitting Christianity against Islam. Theold rhetoric of the Crusades  such as the loss ofAl-Andalus — Andalusia — in 1492 and other battlesfrom history are being invoked by the terrorists toinflame the feelings of Muslims throughout the worldand to bring about a fundamentalist pan-Islamic entity.This is a delicate issue but we must face it head-on.This crisis can be contained only if we speak bluntlyand rationally.The terrorist networks invoke history — thehistory of religious war — to inflame sentiment. Theirinvocation of history  however  may be a tactical error.For history can be our ally in the battle againstterrorism and violence.I beg your pardon  but let us return to an earlierpoint in history  a bloody time of religious crisis inEurope — and I am speaking about the wars of religionthat decimated sixteenth and seventeenth centuryEurope. Out of these wars of religion and out of the30bloody struggles of the Reformation came a powerfulantidote to religious violence that we call humanism.The great French humanist Michel de Montaigne was asceptic. He wrote about the limits to human knowledgein his remarkable Essays. In one of them  entitled “OfPractice ” he observed that  although we can practicefor many things in life  there is one thing for which wecannot practice  one thing we cannot know  and that isour own death. He went on to describe the closest hecame to knowing death  an accident that happenedwhen he fell from his horse. He had been out riding ina militia and was nearly crushed to death. He had abrief sensation of his soul hovering over his body  and later  after being taken home  terrible pain continued toplague him.At a time of religious extremism  when Catholicsand Protestants were fighting over the keys toheaven — just as the 11 September terrorists diedbelieving they would enter paradise — Montaignewrote about the limits of knowledge. And he wroteabout a personal experience  this accident  with whicheverybody  even now  can empathize. This is why he iscalled a humanist  because of his genuine interest inhuman experience.There is no revealed truth in Montaigne  nodogmatism  only human scepticism that appears as anantidote — the only antidote — to the certainty ofmadmen who would kill for belief. This evolution inhuman thought was accomplished without sacrificingthe freedom to believe  to have faith in God and topractice a religion. To think and write as Montaignedid — that is  to insist on the limits of knowledge  andto speak not in a universal but in a personal voice —was a great step forward for humankind. In turningknowledge away from religious certainty  thehumanists allowed for a new field of understandingthat we now call the sciences.While inquisitions would carry on for acentury — Galileo was a boy when Montaigne waswriting — the scepticism that Montaigne advancedagainst religious violence in 1580 is the same as thatwhich Boyle  Newton  or Lavoisier would apply to theuniversal truths of natural theology in order to create away of understanding that we now recognize asscientific. Modern scientific understanding ushered inthe industrial revolutions  the astonishing explosion ofthe middle class  of print culture and of theestablishment of modern democracies. It introduced allof these “world-historical” events  to use Hegel’s termthat we call  rather sloppily  “modernity.”I conclude my intervention on the subject ofmodernity  because many commentators on the currentwar in Afghanistan see the war framed as a warbetween the Taliban  as Islamic extremists  andmodernity. They cite the way in which the Taliban havebanned all forms of mass media culture and haveinsisted on a literal application of sharia law. Theyargue that the Taliban are anti-modern and that theirregime is trying to return its people to an earlier  pre-modern way of life. Yet  when we examine the lives ofthe 11 September terrorists  we realize first that theywere not Afghans  and second  that they were not thewretched of the earth. They were from the middleclass. Most were students  some with advanceddegrees. They never even had to work hard for a living like most members of the middle class. These menwere privileged murderers. Or let me put it anotherway: they were fully modern.The struggle between modernity and the anti-modern is not anachronistic. To be a terrorist demandsthat you enter  systematically and rationally  into themodern world and to turn its apparatus  such astransportation and communication  against it. Thestruggle against modernity is one of the most romanticmyths generated by modernity itself. So  too  is themisrepresentation of the poor by certain writers andintellectuals — I need not name names — who claim tospeak for them. The suffering sown in Afghanistan bydecades of invasion and civil war  they argue  hasbrought terrorism as its terrible harvest. In fact  thesepoor want most of all to live  and to live well. Theyembrace modernity and its comforts. But violence  theability to treat other people as objects  as things to becrushed and destroyed: this is a gift bestowed byeducation.The struggle is therefore ideological. This is whyeducation  the greatest gift  was a passport to terrorismfor these men. The risk of education in this context isthat the pressure of knowledge  or more precisely arecognition of uncertainties and of the limits ofknowledge  will tempt the student into dogmatic belief.The danger always exists that education can hardenfrom humanistic scepticism into the rock of dogma.What is to be done? Today I propose an urgentreturn to a new humanism on two fronts: first  withinIslam  a humanism among Muslims — politicians 31writers  readers — that can dampen sectarian violenceand that can reach out to religious extremism to findcommon ground. This can only come from within theIslamic world. It does not have to be secular in nature although secularism has an important yet increasinglythreatened status within certain nations.Correspondingly  there must be recognition withinpolitical regimes everywhere that antipathy to politicaldissent politicizes religion and creates more problemsfor these regimes than it solves. Modernity’s belief indemocracy as a means to popular expression has neverproved more vital.Secondly  outside of Islam  a return to humanismlies at the heart of the modernity in which we areliving. To recognize modernity and its greatcontribution  a secular and universal culture — massculture — is something that needs to be protected andfought for. It is a modernity that insists on the rights ofmen  women and children.We all know that words often do not lead toaction. But we forget that words  the expression ofideas and of criticism  are a vital form of action. Wecannot be simplistic in our desire for a directrelationship between debate and resolution.What I am proposing is certainly not propaganda;rather  it is a worldwide debate on the importance ofdebate  in which human scepticism  a recognition ofthe limits of belief  is very much at stake. Whether thisargument can be made in an urgent and anti-elitist wayis very much the point. But unless we are able torecognize modernity as a liberating experience independent of its accumulation of goods and services creature comforts  and the like  I have little hope for apositive resolution to the crisis we now face.Modernity is a work in process. One name formodernity  as it exists for us today  is globalization.This is the creation of a “world culture”  the entry oftechnology into every aspect of our lives  theomnipresence of the media and the increasing speed bywhich culture and information are communicated. Itseems to me that there is tragic confusion betweenglobalization and abstract and oppressive technology. Itis this notion of modernity that seems to be at the heartof the recent protests against globalization  proteststhat would have been the focus of our debates before11 September. While the protesters have many validpoints to make  and they need to be listened to globalization and modernity are not the problem.Whether cooperation between nations is economic political or cultural  it is not a threat. Leaders andintellectuals need to reach out and embrace the limitsof knowledge. They must speak out against dogmatismto unravel facile notions of monolithic governments orglobal compacts.An eye for an eye  that harsh principle from theOld Testament  will soon leave us blind. Blindness rather than insight  is the curse of the ideologue  ofpeople who do not want to see outside their own skins their ideas or their place. It is the curse of people whodo not want to see the world in its marvellous diversity its uncertainty and its possibilities. To see this world we have only to look around us here  now. We haveonly to wander through the streets of this miraculouscity of New York."
"5",185,"ARE",56,2001,"﻿At the outset  I wish to express how deeplysaddened we are over the crash of the AmericanAirlines aircraft a few hours ago  a few miles awayfrom this Headquarters  in the borough of Queens inNew York City. Let me express our deep condolencesto the families of the victims and to our friends in thiscountry.I have the honour to convey to Mr. Han Seung-soo  on behalf of the United Arab Emirates  our sincerecongratulations on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. Hiselection to this high office shows the high regard theinternational community has for him personally as wellas for his friendly country  South Korea  with whichmy country maintains good relations. We are confidentthat thanks to his experience in international affairs theAssembly will achieve positive results  and we wishhim and his staff every success.Let me also extend my thanks to his predecessor Mr. Harri Holkeri  for the valuable efforts he exerted inconducting the work of the previous session.I should also like to take this opportunity tocongratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan on his re-election for a second term to this high office and onbeing awarded  together with the United NationsOrganization  the Nobel Peace Prize. We would like toconvey to him our appreciation for his persistentefforts  which are bound to contribute to enabling theOrganization to accomplish its lofty mission ofmaintaining international peace and security andachieving sustainable international development.This session is being held at a very critical stage when the United States of America has been subjectedto the most horrific and dangerous forms of organized39terrorism that not only targeted the lives of thousandsof innocent civilian men  women and children  but alsothe moral codes and values underlying the human andcultural principles that are enshrined in the Charter  thenorms of international law and the foundations andconcepts of the legal  political  economic and socialinstitutions that shape the nature of our internationalrelations as a whole.The United Arab Emirates  which was deeplyshocked after this reprehensible  immoral and criminalact  reiterates today its strong denunciation andcondemnation of these savage acts and all other formsof terrorism  wherever they may be. They constitute theclearest challenges to international peace and securityin the twenty-first century. We also announce ourcomplete support for and cooperation with the UnitedStates Government as well as all the regional andinternational efforts aimed at tracking down theperpetrators of these brutal acts  bringing them tojustice. We also stress our readiness to contribute toany international campaign aimed at eliminatingterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. At thesame time  we call upon the international community tostrengthen the mechanisms and scope of relief aid forthe Afghan people  who have been afflicted by brutalwars for over two decades and who presently face themost horrible and unprecedented internal displacement.The changes that we are witnessing in the natureof international relations today  and the accompanyingaccelerated trends in the fields of globalization technology  modern communications and economicopenness have not only had a positive impact on thelives and interests of certain States and peoples buthave rather contributed to widening the security economic  social  cultural and information gap anddifferences between the peoples of the developed andthe developing countries. At the same time  they havehelped to spawn new situations of conflict  civil andethnic wars and transnational problems. Accordingly we believe that the first steps to be taken to confrontthe totality of these problems require  primarily finding a clear  comprehensive and balanced strategy ofregional and international cooperation that takes intoconsideration  as a matter of priority  the extent towhich the concept of international security and peace on the one hand  and the problems of humanitarianneed and sustainable development  on the other  arelinked.In this context  we stress the importance of theassumption by the United Nations  in cooperation andcoordination with other regional organizations  of alarger role in international affairs. We believe indialogue and peaceful negotiations as an ideal approachfor resolving disputes. We therefore look forward to aresponse from the Islamic Republic of Iran to the callby the United Arab Emirates to find a peacefulsettlement to the occupation of our three islands Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Moussa  eitherthrough direct negotiations or by referring the disputeto the International Court of Justice to be resolved onthe basis of the purposes and principles of the Charterand the principles of international law.We also hope that the visit to Tehran of HisExcellency Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan Minister of State for Foreign Affairs  on 23 July 2001 and that of Mr. Mohamed Ali Abtahi  the IranianPresident’s envoy  to Abu Dhabi on 6 August 2001 will contribute to the serious efforts being made to finda peaceful solution to the issue of Iran’s occupation ofour three islands  promote confidence-building andenhance the principle of peaceful coexistence  mutualcooperation and good-neighbourliness.Furthermore  the United Arab Emirates wouldlike once again to welcome the acceptance by the twofraternal States of Qatar and Bahrain of the decision ofthe International Court of Justice on the settlement oftheir previous disagreement over the disputed areas. Italso notes with satisfaction the arrangements made forthe demarcation of the boundaries between somecountries of the region and stresses that continuation ofsuch an approach and peaceful trends in internationalrelations will strengthen the foundations of regionaland international peace and security.The question of Iraq has been taken up by theUnited Nations for 11 years and the Iraqi people arestill suffering from the continuation of the internationaleconomic sanctions imposed on them. Although theoil-for-food programme has helped alleviate thesuffering of certain sectors of Iraqi society  it clearlydoes not constitute the practical mechanism required tocontain and deal with the human tragedies and far-reaching destructive effects that these sanctionscontinue to inflict  not only on the infrastructure andinstitutions of the basic services sectors of the Iraqipeople  but also with regard to people’s mostelementary necessities  including nutritional  medical educational and other care. We therefore call for a40political formula acceptable to all the parties concernedthat will ensure that the sanctions imposed on the Iraqipeople are lifted and  at the same time  the sovereigntyand territorial integrity of Iraq are maintained.The re-establishment of normal ties between Iraqand Kuwait requires efforts to resolve the problemsthat have arisen as a result of Iraq’s occupation ofKuwait in 1990  the most important of which is thereturn of Kuwaiti nationals and others held hostage oras prisoners of war  in accordance with internationalresolutions.We welcome the Security Council resolution lastSeptember to lift the international sanctions imposedon our brother country Sudan. We also demand that theSecurity Council follow the same procedures in regardto the international sanctions imposed on our fraternalcountry Libya  especially now that its Government hascompletely fulfilled its commitments under the relevantCouncil resolutions.Since 28 September of last year  the occupiedPalestinian territories have seen human tragedies andacts of violence because of the policy of State terrorismpursued by Israel against the Palestinian people including re-occupation of territories  expansion ofsettlements  escalation of bombing and destruction ofeconomic and physical infrastructure in the Palestinianterritories  in addition to systematic liquidation andmassacres that have claimed the lives of more than1 300 martyrs and tens of thousands of other innocentcasualties  half of whom are children and women.The United Arab Emirates warmly welcomes theannouncement made by President Bush three days agoin which he committed his country to helping establishpeaceful coexistence between two States  Israel andPalestine. Once again  we fully support the right ofPalestinians to self-determination and to establish theirown independent State with Jerusalem as its capital. Inaddition  we strongly condemn all flagrant violationsby Israel against the brotherly Palestinian people.We call upon the United Nations — especially theSecurity Council and its permanent members — inparticular the United States  and European Unionmembers to take all necessary and effective measuresto avoid bias and double standards and to bringpressure to bear on Israel to end immediately all itsterrorist acts of aggression against Palestinians  theirtowns and holy sites. In this connection  we call for theestablishment  without delay  of an internationalmechanism to provide the necessary protection for thePalestinian people.The attainment of security and just andcomprehensive peace and stability in the Middle Eastrequires that Israel comply strictly with the agreementsand protocols it has concluded within the framework ofthe peace process and relevant resolutions of theUnited Nations. Those resolutions all call upon Israelto withdraw completely from all Palestinian and otherArab territories it has occupied since 1967  includingthe Holy City of Jerusalem  the Syrian Arab Golan andthe Shab’a farms in Lebanon. They also call for theremoval of existing settlements and the return ofPalestinian refugees to their homes.Israel’s possession of prohibited weapons especially nuclear weapons  is a direct threat toregional and international peace and security. Wetherefore renew our call on the internationalcommunity to pressure the Israeli Government todismantle its dangerous arsenal of weapons. We wouldalso like to emphasize that comprehensive internationaldisarmament  including nuclear disarmament  andimproving international mechanisms and arrangementsfor non-proliferation have top priority in the area ofregional and international security concerns. We alsocall upon nuclear States and States that continue topursue the acquisition of such weapons to end suchdangerous policies  which threaten regional andinternational peace and security.We are following with deep concern the politicaland military events that have erupted in many regions particularly in South and South-East Asia  certainAfrican countries and the Balkans. We therefore stressthe need for the parties concerned to muster thenecessary political will and to try to resolve theirproblems and disputes by resorting to dialogue andpeaceful means  and on the basis of the principles ofinternational law and United Nations resolutions.Despite the encouraging rates of economicgrowth and recovery achieved by some countries in thelast few years as a result of the information revolution globalization and the formidable technologicaldevelopments in the fields of communications and freemarkets  international reports and statistics haverecently indicated a slow-down in global economicgrowth due to the lack of a clear strategy for regionaland international economic cooperation. That slow-down has in turn aggravated the economic imbalance41between the countries of the North and those of theSouth. While the countries of the North enjoyprosperity  those of the South continue to suffer frompoverty  unemployment  disease and environmentalpollution.Therefore the United Arab Emirates  which isaccustomed to extending financial developmentinvestment and humanitarian assistance to manydeveloping countries and countries affected by naturaldisasters and armed conflicts  calls upon developedcountries and international specialized agencies toincrease both their official and unofficial assistance todeveloping countries. It is equally important thatofficial development assistance to poor countries beincreased so as to alleviate the foreign debt burden  tohelp those countries secure access to world markets fortheir domestic products  to facilitate the transfer ofpeaceful technologies  and to assist them in containingtheir growing domestic problems so as to combatpoverty  unemployment  environmental degradationand the spread of disease.In conclusion  we hope that our deliberations onthe items on the agenda at this session will producepositive results that will enhance confidence-buildingmeasures and ensure security and stability in this worldof numerous and quickly changing variables."
"6",232,"ARG",56,2001,"﻿Allowme at the outset to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection as President of the General Assembly. We areespecially pleased that the designation went to apersonality with such a remarkable career  arepresentative of the Republic of Korea  a country thatmaintains a friendly relationship and intensecooperation with Argentina. I also wish toacknowledge the excellent way in which the ForeignMinister of Finland  Mr. Harri Holkeri  presided overthe Assembly at its fifty-fifth session.I would also like to express our satisfaction at there-election of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan for a second term. This reflects the unanimous supportof the international community for the way in which hehas decisively confronted the great challenges of peace the rule of law and development at this very difficultstage of international life. The support given to him bythe Member States reflects the widespread high opinionof his efforts and the work of the Organization  whichwas confirmed by the Nobel Peace Prize  a distinctionthat brings honour to those who work in the service ofthe United Nations and to its clear-sighted Secretary-General.This distinction also comes at a moment when thefull relevance of the United Nations has becomedramatically urgent as a result of the criminal attacksagainst the United States of 11 September. In the faceof those events  I wish to reiterate our solidarity andcommitment with its Government and people. It was anattack against us all  against all humankind.Those events have shown that terrorism can strikeat any State and that no country can fight it in isolation.It is an international threat  and the only existinginstitution with the global reach  the United Nations 21must confront that threat within the political and legalframework established by the Organization.The Millennium Declaration had already set asone of its objectives the adoption of concertedmeasures against international terrorism and the needfor all States to accede as soon as possible to all therelevant international conventions. The adoption ofSecurity Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373(2001) and of General Assembly resolution 56/1 showsthat the United Nations has been equal to thecircumstances  with the goal of using every meansavailable to counter the threat to peace and securityrepresented by terrorism.The global effort against terrorism is animperative for the international community  oneblessed by the United Nations. Within the guidelinesapproved by the Organization  all States  groups ofStates or regional organizations must contribute to thiscommon struggle.Argentina expresses its full commitment to thefight against terrorism. Our nation has twice sufferedattacks of this nature  in 1992 and 1994. The memoryof those events helps us to understand the grief forinnocent victims and to say that this fight is also ourfight.The recent Security Council and GeneralAssembly resolutions have been supplemented by otherinstruments that reflect the will of the majority ofStates to define any terrorist act  without exception  ascriminal and unjustifiable  no matter what the intendedpurposes. Existing resolutions and conventions haveoutlined a series of specific measures and rules tofoster judicial and police cooperation and havecriminalized many acts of terrorism  enshrining theprinciple that all States have an obligation to prosecuteand punish the perpetrators.Argentina is a party to the majority of theinternational treaties in effect and is making progresson ratifying the remainder  among them theInternational Convention for the Suppression ofTerrorist Bombings  of 1997  and the InternationalConvention for the Suppression of the Financing ofTerrorism  of 1999. We support the conclusion of theconventions currently under consideration that shouldbe finalized before the end of this year  such as theconvention on nuclear terrorism. I hope that thenegotiations on a convention of a general nature will besuccessfully concluded. The existence of politicaldifferences or different interpretations related to othersituations should not distract us from the urgent need todevelop an instrument that would encompass allaspects of this threat.At the level of the hemisphere  we have put intopractice the regional system of legitimate defence andcollective security established in the Inter-AmericanTreaty of Reciprocal Assistance. At the same time  wehave fostered the full operation of the Inter-AmericanCommittee on Terrorism and the drafting of an inter-American convention  that complements existinguniversal conventions  as well as the convening of aspecial conference on hemispheric security.At the regional level  the countries of theSouthern Common Market (MERCOSUR) arepromoting measures to enhance technical andoperational coordination  cooperation and assistanceamong the various agencies entrusted with the fightagainst terrorism in the field.We must be aware that the approach to thisproblem will be incomplete if we fail to recognize thefactors that nourish terrorism. In the framework of theincreasing interdependence that characterizes thepresent stage of economic life  the benefits ofdevelopment reach only a few States  and theincreasing marginalization of countries and societiesthat live in extreme poverty  the tragedy of neglected orundernourished children  sickness and hunger becomemore evident. This uneven economic distribution  madeeven more tangible by modern communications  causesfrustration in wide sectors of the dispossessed andcreates the conditions for the outbreak of conflicts andconfrontations  on which fundamentalist movements ofvarious kinds are at work. This is why we need toreaffirm here the fundamental statement made a fewyears ago by Pope Paul VI: “the new name for peace isdevelopment”.This is a task for the international community as awhole  in a joint effort and a spirit of solidarity. It iswrong to minimize the importance of internationalcooperation and to leave on their own those who haveproblems surviving in the face of global economiccompetition.The launching of a new round of negotiations atthe World Trade Organization (WTO) could be animportant signal to control the increasinglyprotectionist tendencies and to promote worldeconomic recovery in the short term and growth in the22long term. It is a signal that will also bring additionalconfidence to the financial markets. Through thelaunching of a new round in Qatar  the 142 membercountries of the WTO could give impetus to a processthat lays the foundations for a more equitable andpeaceful world.The persistence of conflicts such as the one in theMiddle East is a source of tension  with a wide range ofrepercussions for the region  causing legitimateconcern for the international community. TheArgentine Republic wishes to renew its expression ofsupport for a stable and lasting peace in the MiddleEast  based on respect for the inalienable right of thePalestinian people to self-determination and toestablish an independent State  as well as recognitionof the right of the State of Israel to live in peace withinsafe and internationally recognized borders.Violence and terrorism in any form are absolutelyunacceptable and can only exacerbate the situation.The parties should urgently agree on a ceasefire andbegin negotiations on a final settlement  which untilrecently seemed reachable.The Secretary-General has offered us a road mapfor implementing the Millennium Declaration  whichprovides a responsible programme for confronting ourcurrent serious circumstances. The principal milestonesof that road map deserve our support as a sound waytowards peace-building and strengthening our security:the rule of law to fight terrorism with determination;conflict prevention and the strengthening ofpeacekeeping operations; the reform of sanctionsregimes in order to avoid affecting civilianpopulations; the eradication of poverty and thepromotion of development; respect for fundamentalhuman rights throughout the world and for political andreligious plurality; and the firm rejection of anyattempt to associate certain religious creeds ornationalities with violence or terrorism.We also share the Secretary-General’s view of theimportance of putting an end to the culture of impunityby bringing to trial the perpetrators of extremelyserious international crimes. We underscore thehistorical importance of the establishment of theInternational Criminal Court and we reaffirm oursupport for measures to promote its prompt launching.The great majority of humankind desires a futureof peace and progress. The irrationality and violence ofa minority can be isolated and defeated on the basis ofcooperation among nations following these generalprinciples  which we endorsed in the MillenniumDeclaration  and in regard to which we proposeconcrete measures today. We trust that we shall be upto that challenge.I cannot conclude without recalling  as theGeneral Assembly already knows  that the ArgentineRepublic is still engaged in a sovereignty dispute withthe United Kingdom over the Malvinas  South Georgiasand South Sandwich Islands and the surroundingmaritime areas. The recovery of the full exercise ofsovereignty over that part of our national territory respecting the interests of their inhabitants andinternational law  is a precept enshrined in ourConstitution. This issue is on the agenda of thisOrganization  which through repeated resolutions hasasked the Governments of Argentina and the UnitedKingdom to resume negotiations on a just and lastingsolution to the sovereignty dispute and thus to put anend to a colonial situation imposed by force in 1833.Today  in response to that request  Argentinaagain reiterates its full readiness to resume bilateralnegotiations with the United Kingdom in order toresolve the issue  as well as its support for the missionof good offices appropriately entrusted to theSecretary-General by the General Assembly to assistthe parties in achieving that goal.I conclude by calling for peace  justice andsolidarity  so widely sought by all peoples defendinglife throughout the world."
"7",257,"ARM",56,2001,"﻿Let me begin  Sir  bycongratulating President Han Seung-soo on his electionas President of the fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly. I would like also to express our appreciationof and respect for Mr. Harri Holkeri for theprofessionalism and dedication with which heconducted the previous session.Since the acts of terrorism on 11 September  eachof us  as individuals and as leaders responsible for thefuture of our planet  has been trying to understand whathappened — why and how. The universalcondemnation of the arrogance and fascist mentality9that conceives and implements such terror could nothave been more justified. The immediate determinationthat the perpetrators must be punished and their baseseliminated was necessary and prudent. The awarenessthat this is a long and complex process remainsevident.Scholars and analysts have attempted to exploreand explain that day of terror  its causes and itsramifications. This is a necessary process that  if weare patient  will begin with more questions thananswers. Listening will inevitably lead to dialogue  notjust this year  but every year. If we are honest  thisdialogue will reflect the fact that  although we all seequite plainly that there has been a change  we do notagree on what that change is or how it affects each ofus.There are those who believe that the world hasbeen taken off the path of economic globalization anddemocratization. There are some who insist that thenature and course of international relations hasirrevocably changed — that the world order  as itexisted  has come crashing down. That may be theinescapable  though illusory  initial reaction. It mayappear that bilateral and multilateral relations havebeen fundamentally and involuntarily re-tailored.Yet if this perception becomes more than anatural temporary reaction — if the terrorists succeedin intimidating us  and force us to take actions that arenot in our best interests  causing us to abandonprinciples and agendas — then the terrorists will havesucceeded. They will have terrorized their way tosetting agendas and determining policies. But just asNew Yorkers have vowed continued allegiance to theircity and their way of life  the international community too  must remain true to its structures  traditions andagenda.That is not to say  however  that life has returnedto business as usual  or that it can do so. It certainlycannot return to thinking as usual. Our allied approachto the problems and realities that we collectively facerequires genuine  radical rethinking. The deepdissatisfaction  injustice  poverty and hopelessness —which do not justify terror but serve to validate it legitimize it and guard it — must be addressed anderadicated  too. These deep-problems must be replacedby equality  education  social justice  women’s andchildren’s human rights  civil liberties and democracy.Armenia readily joined the global struggle toeradicate the terrorism network because the success ofthis effort is as important for us as it is for the coalitionleaders. However  Armenia asks that  in our effort andexercise of responsibility  to neutralize this enemy  webe careful about our own definitions and labels. Just asit is crucial to ensure solidarity in the united battleagainst the evil of terrorism  a divergence ofinterpretative opinion or varied agendas should not beconstrued as lack of solidarity.Just as the coalition leaders are concerned aboutthe effects of terrorism on their countries  peoples lifestyles and values  Armenia is concerned about howthe advent of such terror  and the extended battleagainst it  will affect our region and our country. Thewar on terrorism has added a further dimension to ourdomestic and foreign policy agenda  not narrowed itsfocus. The economic and political conditions whichmake ours a volatile region have not gone away.Indeed  they have been exacerbated by the newalliances and priorities. Worse still  they might befurther aggravated if they are ignored and allowed tolie latent while all attention is focused on theimmediate danger. In focusing on the hatred ofthousands  we do not want to dismiss the frustrationand needs of millions  many of whom stand at the brinkof war.That is why  even as Armenia has offeredunreserved cooperation with the global coalition signed the United Nations and Council of Europe anti-terrorism conventions  and offered military andstrategic assistance  we continue to insist that thefundamental short- and long-term developmental issuesfacing us also be dealt with. We are worried about thestability of our region  because the basic freedomswhich are the hallmarks of modern society and whichdecrease the likelihood of violent social and politicalsolutions are not universally guaranteed in ourneighbourhood.Security and peace around the world depend onstability in each region. If we are committed to worldpeace and security  each of us in our own region musttake on the responsibility to address the outstandingissues in a new light  guided by new thinking. Itremains for the leaders to abandon the expediency ofrealpolitik for the efficacy of “justpolitik”. This isnothing that has not been said before  but perhaps inthis new environment of searching  our call will not fallon deaf ears. Our region has the wealth  the traditions 10the opportunities and the links that can make it flourishand thrive.As far as Armenia’s contribution to peace andstability in the Caucasus is concerned  there are twointertwined issues affecting our relations with two ofour neighbours. One is the absence of relations withTurkey  to the west; the other is the Nagorny Karabakhconflict  which affects our relations with Azerbaijan.For the past 10 years  representatives of myGovernment have  from this podium  affirmed thatbasic freedoms of thought  belief  conviction  ethics traditions  values and culture also apply to the men women and children of Nagorny Karabakh. This lies atthe heart of the conflict over Nagorny Karabakh.Azerbaijan’s insistence on inventing numbers redefining terms  creating history and obfuscatingdiscussion are part of the problem  not the search for asolution. In response to the charges made today by mycolleague from Azerbaijan with regard to Armenia andNagorny Karabakh  let me say the following. NagornyKarabakh has never been a part of independentAzerbaijan. Whether we consider history or geography whether we adopt a long-term political perspective orface the reality of the facts on the ground  the men women and children of Nagorny Karabakh have earnedthe right to live peacefully on their historic lands. Fordecades they have been denied that right. Today  adozen years after the re-eruption of the conflict  thechildren of Karabakh have completed an entire schoolcareer free of alien domination and foreign occupation.Justice for the people of Nagorny Karabakh hasbeen at the core of Armenia’s policies and actions  notjust because we believe it is right  but also because webelieve that  in order to achieve lasting peace economic cooperation and political development  thisconflict will have to be resolved fairly and fully.Azerbaijan’s empty calls for a military solution  whicharise from an adherence to old clichés rather than fromnew realities  are not acceptable among neighbours thatare serious about peace.As for our relations with Turkey  in this post-11 September world  when the cold war has truly andfinally ended  where erstwhile adversaries have foundreasons to put aside ideology and establishpartnerships  perhaps Turkey will put asidepreconditions in the interests of regional and worldpeace. Armenia would like to have normal  good-neighbourly relations with Turkey  and is hopeful thatTurkey will establish diplomatic relations withArmenia  open the borders and engage in constructivecooperation.But the obvious must be stated. The memory ofthe Armenian genocide continues to haunt and obstructTurkey’s relations with Armenia. However  we areconfident that this issue can be addressed between thetwo Governments  through dialogue. The events of thepast two months have reminded Armenians that man isindeed capable of immense  indescribable evil and thatmass violence is not a thing of the past. Yet if we  asthe victims of genocide  are unwilling to permit ourown tragic past to define our actions in the future  wecan confidently call on Turkey to do the same  and tojoin us as equal participants in a dialogue between ourtwo peoples.There is no doubt that the United Nationsprovides the most overarching and inclusive frameworkfor creating the conditions that make States andpeoples prefer peace to war. The United Nations —acting  where possible  with various multilateral andregional organizations — should identify and utilizethe comparative advantage and specificity of eachinstitution and each country as a potential fighter  as apotential instrument in the war for peace  and even as apotential victim.The United Nations did not need 11 September toacknowledge economic development and povertyeradication as strategic battlefields in the war againstterrorism. Donor countries can contribute to thesuccess of this war by providing not only militaryforces  but also greater financial and technicalassistance.Such assistance must be coordinated. The newchallenges call for the consolidation of existingmechanisms of international dialogue  cooperation andsecurity. The United Nations can make a majorcontribution to this process  especially if it reflects  in amore equitable manner  the political and economicrealities of today’s world. We believe that real reformof the Security Council lies in the expansion of bothcategories: permanent and non-permanent. We supportthe desire of Germany and Japan to become permanentmembers of the Security Council.Armenia also attaches great significance to theissue of equitable geographic representation  and henceit supports increased representation forunderrepresented regions  especially Asia  Africa 11Latin America and the Caribbean. In this regard Armenia is equally supportive of India’s quest forpermanent membership in the Security Council. Webelieve strongly that any increase in non-permanentmembership should also ensure enhancedrepresentation for the Group of Eastern EuropeanStates through the allocation of one additional non-permanent seat.Modern life has caused upheavals in staticsocieties  and the answer lies not in any particular faithbut in healthy  democratic institutions and legislationand viable economic systems.Writer V. S. Naipaul made that assertion  and thisyear he was awarded a Nobel Prize  as was Secretary-General Kofi Annan. This choice of recipients providesmuch food for thought. Neither has been exclusivist;they have both been inclusive  as can be seen in theirability to bring their deep-rooted traditions to bear onthe challenges facing our global society. While Naipaulthe writer teases and provokes  Annan the diplomatchallenges and soothes. They both do so with grace andfrom positions of strength. They can both afford to bemore extreme in their pronouncements  but they arenot.The message here is that in this year of dialogueamong civilizations  there are successful ways ofmerging the best of the world’s traditions  even whilechallenging the world to move forward towards justiceand democracy for all. Naipaul and Annan do not rejectthe failures of the world  but challenge us to addressthem. We  collectively  could do worse than to followtheir example."
"8",290,"ATG",56,2001,"﻿Antigua andBarbuda is pleased that this is the United Nations Yearof Dialogue among Civilizations. However  we canhave meaningful dialogue only if the dominantcountries reach out with genuine understanding whenothers speak. We can have dialogue only if the basicprinciples of the United Nations are made the core ofreality. We cannot have dialogue if multilateralismremains selective or if the principle of rotationcontinues to be based on demographics  military mightand economic principles. The people of my countryrepresent an integral part of human civilization and wewish to contribute our voice and our ideas to the debateon the future of the journey of humankind on thisplanet.28The tragic events of 11 September in the hostcountry of the United Nations have presented achallenge to world civilization. The Parliament ofAntigua and Barbuda on Thursday  18 October  passedstrong anti-terrorism legislation. Also  the CaribbeanCommunity  meeting in special emergency session inthe Bahamas on 11 and 12 October  recognizedterrorism as a global problem requiring a resoluteglobal response. The heads of Government stated:“We are conscious that the unprecedentedand barbaric terrorist assaults of 11 Septemberwill require of us extraordinary vigilance andcoordination in the future  to ensure that ourterritories  our institutions and our citizens arenot used in any manner to facilitate the activitiesof terrorists or to undermine our national andregional security.”We share the agony of the United States  for wetoo had nationals who perished in the 11 Septemberatrocity. We fully support Security Council resolution1373 (2001)  which makes it obligatory for all States toimpose far-reaching measures to combat the scourge ofterrorism. We support the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. International terrorism is inreality an act of war against the world’s peace-lovingpeoples. It is imperative that all countries of the worldaddress in a more meaningful manner the underlyingsocial  economic and political problems that causehuman misery and perpetuate injustice. We must act toensure that the entire global society lives in anenvironment of freedom and is free from fear. The fightagainst terrorism will be a long and arduous one  but itis one in which we must thoroughly and completelyengage ourselves.Antigua and Barbuda has now ratified the RomeStatute for the International Criminal Court. Thecitizens of my country believe that in the prospect of aninternational criminal court lies the promise ofuniversal justice  since the Court will have the power toindict individuals. Antigua and Barbuda is certainlydisappointed that crimes pertaining to drug traffickingand terrorism have been put on the back burner at theInternational Criminal Court  but we are prepared tocontinue our dialogue to bring them under the ambit ofthe Court when it becomes active. The cancer of drugtrafficking will continue to threaten human civilizationuntil we fashion a truly global response to its menace.The battles in Seattle  Windsor and Quebec are anintegral part of world civilization’s struggle tohumanize globalization. Interestingly  we findourselves agreeing with the statement made by theManaging Director of the International Monetary Fund(IMF) in his address to members of the DeutscheBundestag on 2 April 2001 in Berlin. Mr. Köhlerdeclared that it is political and economic madness forOrganisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD) countries to spend $360 billion ayear on agricultural subsidies  while poverty rages indeveloping countries  especially in the rural andfarming regions. He went on to say that it is high timefor industrial countries to honour their commitment toprovide 0.7 per cent of their gross national product forofficial development assistance.At the United Nations Millennium Summit  myown Prime Minister  Lester Bird  castigated theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment for its unilaterally devised set ofstandards for international taxation to be imposed onother jurisdictions and for demanding that Stateschange their domestic laws to suit OECD purposes.The rule of law has become the rule of the jungle where rules do not apply  and only might is right. Inreality  the OECD Harmful Tax Competition projecthas nothing to do with money laundering  but has moreto do with the fact that OECD believes that its memberStates would lose capital to other States with morecompetitive tax regimes.Globalization has left States like my own with afeeling of exclusion  a feeling of being cast aside andpushed outside  from where we observe the gains of thedominant. It is a feeling of not being able to participatein the determination of our own destiny. The “greenroom” process evident at World Trade Organization(WTO) ministerial meetings has done nothing butincrease our apprehension. We call for serious reformof the global political and economic architecture to beundertaken  both at the United Nations and at theWorld Trade Organization. The multilateral tradingsystem needs to be transparent. It needs to be fair andequitable  and all countries should be able to share inits benefits.Antigua and Barbuda  as a small island State  isextremely vulnerable to natural disasters. The mostprevalent threat is that of hurricanes  three of whichrecently impacted our sister States of Belize  Cuba andthe Bahamas. A single hurricane can set back the29development of a small island State by 10 years.Between 1995 and 2000  our beloved twin island Statewas hit by seven hurricanes.We call on the international community toacknowledge in a meaningful way the vulnerability ofsmall States like Antigua and Barbuda. We point to ourlack of capacity in financial and human resources tobounce back from natural disasters and from externalshocks to its economy caused by economic recession inthe major economies of the world  which also happento be our main trading partners. It is thereforeimperative that we be able to continue to accessconcessionary financing through the World Bank. Oursocial and economic development needs  includinginfrastructure  seem not to register in the boardroomsof the international financial institutions.Countries like Antigua and Barbuda are viewedas middle income because of the per capita incomecriterion  but this is a flawed measurement and shouldbe abandoned. Financing for development should takeinto account a mix of factors and should be linked tothe vulnerability index on which the United NationsConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) hasdone important work.No account is taken of the considerabletransaction costs faced by small States because of theirremoteness and the disproportionate burden they bearin order to effectively participate in world trade. Noaccount is taken of the openness of our economy togoods and services from all over the world  withoutcorresponding market access for our own limited rangeof goods to the markets of Europe and North America.An inhospitable stranger known as “non-tariff barriers”continues to slam the door in our face.In these circumstances  we cannot overemphasizehow important it is for the IMF and the World Bank toapply special and differential treatment to measuringthe fiscal and economic performance of small islandStates. Our limited capacity to raise revenue and ournecessity to spend at a disproportionate level in orderto maintain a decent standard of living for our peopleshould lead the IMF to have special and differentialprogrammes of assistance for small island States.These programmes should not merely prescribe thetraditional formula of large-scale public sectordismissals and reduction of public sector investmentprogrammes. Instead  innovative ways should be foundto provide long-term financing at repayment periodsand rates of interest that would allow small States tomaintain democracy  human rights  low crime rates andeconomic growth.My country welcomes the successful conclusionof the Marrakesh meeting on climate change  where theparties to the United Nations Framework Conventionon Climate Change finalized the operational details ofthe Kyoto Protocol  thereby opening the way towidespread ratification by Governments and theProtocol’s early entry into force. This was the result ofseveral years of tough negotiation in which Antiguaand Barbuda was very active and took a leadershipposition. What we now have in place are theinstitutions and detailed procedures of the KyotoProtocol  and the next step is to test their effectivenessin overseeing the five per cent cut in greenhouse gasemissions by developed countries over the next decade.The agreements reached in Marrakesh also madeimportant progress on strengthening the flow offinancial and technological support to developingcountries so that they can move towards a sustainableenergy future. They also send a clear signal tobusiness  local governments and the general public thatclimate-friendly products  services and activities willbe rewarded by consumers and national policies alike.The meeting also adopted the MarrakeshMinisterial Declaration as an input into nextSeptember’s World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  to be held in Johannesburg. TheDeclaration emphasizes the contribution that action onclimate change can make to sustainable developmentand calls for capacity building  technology innovationand cooperation with the Biodiversity andDesertification Conventions. With the Summit a littleless than a year away  small island developing Statessuch as my own  which are among the most vulnerableto the adverse effects of climate change  continue tourge the speedy ratification of the Protocol.That will require a global coalition among Statesto ensure that it enters into force and becomes legallybinding after it has been ratified by at least 55 partiesto the Convention  including the industrializedcountries that represent at least 55 per cent of the total1990 carbon dioxide emissions from this group. Whileit remains true that those with the highest per capitalevels of greenhouse gas emissions should take thelead  it is incumbent upon all countries to work30together to ensure that there is full compliance withcommitments contained in the Protocol.There is a deep concern in our countries  aconcern that takes on paramount proportions and that iscentred around the transhipment of nuclear wastethrough the waters of the Caribbean Sea  and whichrepresents a blatant disregard of our sovereignty. Thecountries of the Caribbean have insisted that it bestopped  but to no avail; and our populations live inconstant fear of an accident. We call on those whoengage in this deadly traffic to respect the rights oftransit States such as Antigua and Barbuda.The most populous democracy in the world India  spoke on the first day of the general debate andhighlighted concerns that we find it necessary toreiterate. There needs to be a more determinedmovement towards the liquidation of the external debtsof low income and highly indebted countries. Thereshould be poverty alleviation programmes designed forcountries facing financial crises  and there should bestabilization of international prices of primarycommodity exports.The measures that we have outlined here areessential to building a just and equitable internationalorder. Anything less would simply be the imposition ofthe will of the powerful upon the pusillanimous. Allsocieties are measured by the way they treat their mostvulnerable members  and the international communityof nations is no different. I call on all representativeshere assembled to heed the plea of the victims and toconstruct an international order that can lift humancivilization to achieve the highest ideals of the UnitedNations."
"9",337,"AUS",56,2001,"﻿Sir  let me begin  likeothers  by congratulating you on having been electedPresident of the fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly. Let me also very warmly commend you onyour commitment to making the most efficient use ofthe Assembly’s time  including — if I may say — bybeginning meetings punctually. I also want to join otherspeakers in congratulating the Secretary-General  KofiAnnan  and the United Nations more generally on theirheartily deserved receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize.The terrorist attacks of 11 September inWashington  D.C.  and here in New York City were notjust attacks on the United States. Australia  along withmore than 80 other nations  lost innocent civilians. Weare united in our grief for the victims and theirfamilies. Australia condemns these attacks andreaffirms unequivocally that terrorism is never justifiedand must never be tolerated.Australia has joined the international coalitionagainst terrorism. We have invoked our mutual securitypact for the first time with the United States  and weare contributing military forces to the campaign againstthose responsible for the 11 September attacks.The international community is obliged to closeranks against terrorism. We must starve terrorists oftheir support — financial  political and moral. We mustdeny terrorists safe haven. We must bring terrorists toaccount.Australia commends Security Council resolution1373 (2001) of 28 September  which targetscomprehensively the terrorist menace. We will workclosely with the Committee on Counter-Terrorism ofthe Security Council.Australia has introduced new measures to preventand suppress the financing of terrorism and is alreadyparty to all but one of the 12 international counter-terrorism instruments.A comprehensive convention against terrorism ispotentially a very important symbol of globalcommitment on this issue. As the Assembly is aware Australia has taken a leading role in the negotiations reflecting our strong commitment to strengthening theinternational legal framework. While we areencouraged by the progress this past month  we join theSecretary-General in urging the parties to conclude theconvention without delay.The events of 11 September underline howimportant it is that we maintain and strengtheninternational non-proliferation regimes governingnuclear  chemical and biological weapons. If we wantto prevent the spread of ballistic missiles andassociated technology — and if we want to strengthenmechanisms relating to conventional weapons — thenwe also need a stronger commitment to other armscontrol and disarmament instruments as well.Let me turn now to East Timor. We all have adeep interest in a stable  secure  viable and democraticEast Timor. East Timor is no longer an emergency  but instead  an emerging nation.However  much more needs to be done. EastTimor remains vulnerable  and the role of the UnitedNations is not complete. We need  after independence an integrated United Nations mission of civilians police and peacekeepers  under a single Security4Council mandate funded from United Nations assessedcontributions.Australia therefore welcomes the SecurityCouncil President’s statement of 31 October endorsingthe Secretary-General’s recommendations for a UnitedNations successor mission in East Timor. We lookforward to working with others over the comingmonths to set a solid and sensible mandate for asuccessor mission.Cooperative relations between East Timor andIndonesia are key to East Timor’s longer-term securityand to that of the region as a whole. We very muchwelcome steps by both sides to resolve outstandingissues.We welcome progress by the IndonesianGovernment to resolve the situation in refugee campsin West Timor  and we urge continued efforts to ensuresecurity and to facilitate the safe return of refugees.Justice and reconciliation are important to EastTimor’s longer-term stability and prosperity. Australiawelcomes steps by President Megawati Soekarnoputrito expand the jurisdiction of the ad hoc human rightscourt and her Government’s commitment to bring tojustice those who have perpetrated human rights crimesin East Timor. That commitment was reconfirmed in amost welcome way in the Assembly yesterday by theForeign Minister of Indonesia  Mr. Hassan Wirajuda.Australia will continue to support East Timorgenerously. We have an agreement to share resourcesfrom the Timor Sea. We are helping to reduce povertyin East Timor and we are building East Timoresecapacity to govern peacefully and democratically. Weurge others to support East Timor. This is our chance collectively in the international community  to ensurethat the United Nations historic mission in East Timoris remembered as a success.Let me talk about what we in Australia call“people-smuggling”. Australia has a proud history as amajor country of migration. We are  as a result of overa century of planned and managed legal migration  atolerant multicultural society. We will continue as acountry of migration and we will continue to take morethan our fair share of refugees.Regrettably  Australia is also increasingly afavoured target for illegal migration  assisted byindividuals and criminal syndicates engaged in thepernicious crime of people-smuggling. Many othercountries — as either transit or destination countries —are also affected by this problem. As with othertransnational crimes  combating the phenomenon ofpeople-smuggling requires not just national  but alsoconcerted regional and multilateral action.People-smugglers are primarily organized crimesyndicates. They exploit their victims. They find theirclients among people who have experienced conflict orpersecution  economic downturn or extremeenvironmental breakdown. They target those desperatefor a better life. The loss recently of more than 350lives  when a people-smuggling boat headed forAustralia sank  is a tragic reminder of the human costsinvolved and of the callousness of people-smugglers.Irregular migration  facilitated by people-smuggling  undermines the integrity of theinternational protection system. All countries share aninterest in protecting and strengthening theinternational protection system. To do so  we musttackle the problem of people-smuggling. A year ago  atthe Millennium Summit  leaders committed us to fightpeople-smuggling and other transnational crimes. Weshould redouble our efforts to do so. We needcoordinated  comprehensive approaches and concertedinternational action to address all its aspects. Rootcauses in source countries need to be addressed. Thehumanitarian and other needs of displaced persons incountries of first asylum need to be addressed. Transitcountries and countries of destination need tocooperate more effectively.Australia is working closely with its neighboursin the Asia-Pacific region to strengthen our capacity toprevent and deter people-smuggling and to bringperpetrators to justice. This will continue to be a highpriority for my Government. We will also continue tocontribute to broader international efforts to deal withthe causes of irregular migration. These efforts  whichhave the protection needs of refugees at their core  willcontinue while we work with others in our region andinternationally to combat illegal migration and people-smuggling.Afghans fleeing the devastation of their homelandpose a particular challenge to the internationalcommunity. A renewed focus and a more coordinatedresponse are needed. Australia supports the efforts ofthe Office of the United Nations High Commissionerfor Refugees and those of the countries of first asylumto protect refugees in South-West Asia. We have5advocated  consistently and strongly  a comprehensiveresponse to the Afghan situation and substantiallyincreased our assistance to displaced and vulnerableAfghans in South-West Asia.The international community faces grave newchallenges that threaten global peace and prosperity. Atthe same time  as the Secretary-General said in hisstatement  the challenges that faced us before 11September — poverty  disease  development — havenot diminished. The need for international cooperationhas never been greater. It is therefore tremendouslyimportant that agreement was reached in Doha tolaunch the development round of world tradeliberalization. Free trade  including in agriculture offers benefits for all countries and is crucial fordeveloping countries to overcome poverty.Finally  I want to say that Australia stands readyto support international efforts to combat internationalterrorism and the spread of weapons of massdestruction. Australia stands ready to ensure that recentUnited Nations successes — such as in East Timor —help create vibrant and sustainable democracies inwhich people can be assured of their future and that oftheir children. Australia stands ready to contribute tosustained international action against people-smugglingat source  in transit and at destination. Australia urgesthat this fifty-sixth session of the General Assemblymakes substantial progress towards those same goals."
"10",384,"AUT",56,2001,"﻿I am speakinghere while still in shock over the terrible aeroplanecrash in Queens  our immediate neighbourhood especially since the area of Rockaway  where so manybrave New York firefighters live  was already sufferingin the aftermath of the earlier catastrophe. I wish toexpress my deep sympathy to all those families and tothe great number of people affected by this tragedy.Let me at the outset congratulate His ExcellencyMr. Han Seung-soo on his election to this high office.While assuring him of my delegation’s full cooperationand support  I am confident that under his guidance andleadership — which he has already proven in the firstdays of his new function — this session of the GeneralAssembly will contribute to strengthening globalcooperation and its indispensable platform  the UnitedNations  in the coming months.I should also like to take this opportunity toreiterate my very best wishes to the Secretary-Generalon his appointment to a second term of office.Furthermore  I would like to congratulate him verywarmly on being awarded  jointly with the UnitedNations  the Nobel Peace Prize  an honour andrecognition he truly deserves for his leadership dedication and courage in the service of ourOrganization. This award also signals recognition ofand encouragement for the United Nations and all thosewho are committed to its mission  not least UnitedNations staff members.Allow me to also express here our thanks to thePresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifthsession  Mr. Harri Holkeri  for the many efforts heundertook not only in conducting day-to-day business but also in revitalizing the United Nations  in particularthe General Assembly.My colleague  the Foreign Minister of Belgium has already addressed this Assembly on behalf of theEuropean Union. Austria fully endorses his remarks.Two months have passed now since the heinousterrorist attacks of 11 September. Although we are stillin shock at the loss of thousands of innocent lives  wehave  however  also been encouraged by the resolveexpressed in the collective response of the communityof nations  here in the General Assembly and in theSecurity Council. This unanimous strong reaction givesus hope that today our nations are ready to cross over athreshold  leaving behind a world of deadly divisionsand entering a genuine global community.There are some positive signs to that effect.These are  first  that during the past weeks  we havewitnessed new astonishing political — maybe evengeopolitical — alignments that  if followed through are comparable to other watershed events of historicproportions. Secondly  the menace of anunprecedented  devastating type of terrorism iscompelling us to take a fresh look at the root causes ofmuch that is unacceptable in our world  according toour own standards  but which we have been tolerating or at least living with  quite contrary to our declaredprinciples. I refer to the abject levels of poverty inequality and injustice. These factors are at the originof many conflicts around the globe. Some of them areparticularly dangerous  providing breeding grounds forglobal terrorism or serving as pretexts for terrorists. Itwould be irresponsible if we — the internationalcommunity — did not engage in renewed efforts to findsolutions to these regional conflicts  be they in theMiddle East  in Afghanistan  in Kashmir  in theCaucasus or in the Balkans  as well as in the areaaround the Great Lakes  for instance  which has seen somuch human suffering.The European Union  on a continent marked bycenturies of war  has developed its model of conflictresolution. It is held in three words: cooperation partnership  integration. The European Union isengaged in a welcome policy of extending this zone ofpeace. We hope that the enlarged Union  planned to23become a Union of 28 and later more  will be able tocontribute more effectively to peace and stability in theworld.Under the present circumstances  Austria’spriorities outside Europe are the Middle East andCentral Asia  not least because these areas have a directbearing on the fight against terrorism in its presentphase.The Middle East conflict has been on our agendawithout interruption since the time of the creation ofthe United Nations. There is no doubt that we have aspecial obligation to contribute to a just and viablesolution. A heightened sense of responsibility is feltwhen  on the one hand  violence escalates  but when on the other — as I see it — new opportunities haveemerged. Austria is therefore of the opinion that majorconcerted efforts should be undertaken so thatnegotiations can resume on the basis of SecurityCouncil resolutions without delay. Only sincerenegotiations and a sincere renunciation of violence canbring a rapprochement of the two parties and  finally peace.Afghanistan is a reminder of what happens whena conflict is neglected too long. Now  there is a newdimension unfolding. We are forced to act. Thehumanitarian tragedy is obvious. In this context Central Asia deserves increased attention  for example in view of assistance in the maintenance of stabilityand concertation aiming at the necessary reconstructionof Afghanistan.I should like to say a word as to the Balkans  aneighbouring region to my country. It must not beneglected  although new dangers emerge elsewhere. Inthe western Balkans  there is progress  especially inZagreb  in Belgrade  in Tirana and in Sarajevo  butoverall stability and economic recovery are not yetassured. Extremists have not yet disarmed. We have tokeep up a high profile of international commitment.Combating terrorism is  of course  not a one-dimensional task. It requires cooperation on manyfronts. I see the United Nations as playing a key role inthis regard. This requires a clarification andcoordination of tasks within the United Nations systemso as to ensure the necessary synergy. There is also arole for regional cooperation. To provide an example  aso called regional security partnership has beenestablished between Austria and some of itsneighbours  candidates for European Unionmembership  across the boundaries that  for half acentury  divided Europe.Overall  we must address long-term societaldevelopment at the local  national and global levels andthe capacities required to build a universally sharedpolitical culture based on respect for human rights andhuman dignity  including for the plurality of identitiesat all levels of society.Let me elaborate now on the United Nations role.The time has certainly come to significantly strengthenthe United Nations capabilities and programmes incombating and preventing terrorism. The complexity ofthe challenge requires intersectoral and inter-institutional cooperation. We have to enable theprincipal organs of the Organization  including theirspecialized subsidiary organs  such as the SecurityCouncil’s Committee on terrorism  the GeneralAssembly’s Ad Hoc Committee on Terrorism  theEconomic and Social Council’s Commission on CrimePrevention and Criminal Justice and the appropriateSecretariat units to perform the tasks that are nowurgently needed.The Commission on Crime Prevention andCriminal Justice will hold a special meeting onterrorism in the context of the Vienna Declaration onCrime and Justice on 15 November 2001. Just oneweek prior to the terrorist attacks of 11 September plans of action for the implementation of the ViennaDeclaration were adopted. They will play an importantrole in the system-wide response to internationalterrorism  including a comprehensive set ofrecommendations for both national and internationalaction. These recommendations stress once more theexisting relationship between terrorism  on the onehand  and crime  including transnational organizedcrime and illicit drug trafficking  on the other.The United Nations Centre for InternationalCrime Prevention and its Terrorism Prevention Branchhave received a focused mandate  which should serveas a solid basis for enhancing the capabilities of theUnited Nations in the prevention of terrorism. To thisend  the human and financial resources should bestrengthened accordingly.Needless to say  the challenge of terrorismrequires the full support of each and everyGovernment. Ratification of the various internationallegal instruments  as well as the conclusion ofnegotiations concerning a comprehensive international24convention against terrorism  are of fundamentalimportance. The Terrorism Prevention Branch of theUnited Nations should also get immediately active inproviding  where requested  concrete assistance toMember States in implementing national legislationrequired by Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) as well as in national capacity-building.Several items on our global agenda havereminded us of the fundamental importance of theindividual citizen and of society in economic  social cultural and institutional development. Increasingly  wehave understood the strategic role of the basicprinciples and values of our societies upon which thefuture of mankind is based. Our rejection of terrorismmust be absolute. At the same time  we need tostrengthen our networks and skills in dialogue  cross-identification and solidarity.We do need a globally shared political culturethat is based on respect for global diversity  whichfinds its only limits in the right of others to diversity.We must never allow fanaticism  violence andterrorism to undermine the fabric on which peace andsecurity are built. Now more than ever  we have toredouble our efforts in the development of our societiesbased on plurality and trust among peoples andcultures.In this context  the Secretary-General’s efforts topromote dialogue among civilizations  an initiative ofPresident Khatami  can have enormous significance.Austria had the pleasure of inviting the Secretary-General’s Group of Eminent Persons for its firstmeeting in Vienna and was honoured by the Secretary-General’s personal participation in last summer’sSalzburg dialogue among civilizations. Austria’scommitment to dialogue has found its expression in aseries of inter-religious encounters  especially betweenChristianity and Islam  over the past 10 years. Theseencounters have served to identify common values andto project them into the wider communities. For us such dialogue has the core objective of developingsocieties’ capacities in preventing hatred disintegration and politically motivated violenceagainst fellow citizens.Austria’s efforts have also focused on anotherelement of societal development. Long-term strategiesof terrorism prevention require a globally sharedculture of human rights. Let me mention briefly thegrowing cooperation between qualified regionalinstitutions for human rights education and learning inAfrica  South Asia  the Far East and the Pacific Europe and Latin America. The proclamation of humanrights cities in all of these regions might merit specificattention by the appropriate organs of the UnitedNations  including the Commission on HumanSettlements.We are aware that there is a direct relationshipbetween the internal negation of human rights  on theone hand  and a culture of violence that may eventuallyproject its effects not only internally but alsointernationally and even globally. In view ofaccelerated globalization and worldwide economic cultural and information relations  we may have to takeproactive measures to strengthen our shared basicbeliefs and political values through education andlearning processes. The current United Nations Decadefor Human Rights Education might also offeropportunities for appropriate initiatives in response tothe horrifying scenario of global terrorism.In this context  we have to give greaterrecognition to the role of women in providing humansecurity and human development in all our societies.The recognition is due in particular in crisis areaswhere women have not only been the victims of mostof the intra-societal violence  but have also assured thesurvival of the neediest.A case in point is Afghanistan and Afghansociety. Eighty-five per cent of refugees and internallydisplaced persons are women and children. In fact those who are often depicted as the weakest element insociety had to bear the brunt of violence andrepression. As we design our programmes forreconstructing a post-terrorist Afghanistan  we mustconceive of programmes by which women  inparticular those now in refugee camps  are enabled tocontribute their share in a governance of development peace and cooperation. This is essential for a societythat wishes to overcome the scars of decades ofconflict and war. To be concrete  I therefore suggestthat education and training programmes aimed atempowering women — in particular  those in refugeecamps — to assume public responsibility in thereconstruction of their country be immediatelyimplemented.The media bear an increasingly importantresponsibility in shaping societies’ value structures andcapabilities. As Austria’s Federal Chancellor Wolfgang25Schüssel said in his statement on the United NationsYear of Dialogue among Civilizations at the GeneralAssembly’s 42nd meeting  Austria is taking aninitiative  in the context of the partnership between theEuropean Union and the Mediterranean countries  thatwill focus on the special role and responsibility of themedia in this partnership and in the societaldevelopment towards accepting and benefiting from theplurality of cultures and identities in this region.In conclusion  I should like to make a fewcomments on other very important developments withregard to items on our global agenda. The sustainableuse of the local  national  regional and global naturalresources with which we are endowed continues to beof foremost importance. The recent study by theInternational Institute for Applied Systems Analysis(IIASA) on the projected dramatic reduction ofagricultural productivity — between 45 and 55 per centin Africa  India  southern China and Latin America —over the next 50 years due to climate change remindsus that the processes of long-term global change needas much action as our activities in coping with crisesand combating criminal terrorism. The World Summiton Sustainable Development in Johannesburg will neednot only a technical but also a political focus with anappropriate resolve for our shared global development.One specific area where newly shared policiesand institutional support may be required  is theintegration of energy policies into the globalsustainable development agenda. The Commission onSustainable Development at its ninth session and thethird United Nations Conference on the LeastDeveloped Countries recognized the strong connectionbetween energy-policy interventions and povertyreduction. Energy considerations should therefore befully integrated into the implementation of theMillennium Declaration. Vienna  which hosts fourprominent international organizations in the field ofglobal energy policies — the United Nations IndustrialDevelopment Organization (UNIDO)  the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  the Organization ofthe Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) andIIASA — could offer  with Austria’s support  aframework for developing an innovative platform inthis regard. I look forward to exploring this issuefurther with interested partners.With many developing regions having to copewith the difficult and often precarious management ofmountain resources  we should take advantage of theInternational Year of Mountains  2002  for newinitiatives in exchanging experience and for newprogrammes of cooperation.Finally  we are still working on implementing ourresolve to strengthen the Economic and Social Councilof the United Nations for accomplishing its importanttasks. The Economic and Social Council reform paperby the Secretariat’s Department of Economic andSocial Affairs contains  I think  very valuablecontributions to our ongoing debate. As Austria alreadysuggested years ago  coordination and integration ofthe United Nations system’s reporting in economic andsocial affairs and the preparation of a comprehensive“state of the world” report by the Secretary-Generalwould not only facilitate but significantly enhance therole of the Economic and Social Council in policyformulation in this field.When coping with the dynamic processes ofglobal change in the economic sector  we have to putthe human being back into the centre of our policies.New efforts have to be undertaken to internalize themultiple dimensions and costs of globalization. In thiscontext  let me especially welcome the Secretary-General’s initiative of a new partnership with theglobal business community  inviting it to share in theresponsibility for what is happening in the globalpublic space.All the concerns I am addressing in this statementhave a common focus: understanding the human beingas an actor  a perpetrator  a victim and a partner  inother words  as the basic paradigm of globaldevelopment. This is why human development  humanrights and human security are the points from which wehave to address both the current crises and our long-term development objectives."

I congratulate you  Sir  on your unanimouselection to the position of President of the fifty-sixthsession of the General Assembly and I sincerely wishyou all success in guiding the work of the session andwould like to assure you of our full support.Under the current circumstances  enhancement ofthe United Nations effectiveness becomes increasinglyimportant  and in this regard  I would like to expressour special gratitude to Mr. Harri Holkeri  whoseactivity as President of the fifty-fifth session of theGeneral Assembly was an example of the commitmentto the revitalization process of the Organization.We regard the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to theUnited Nations and Mr. Kofi Annan as evidence of theinternational community’s recognition of the specialrole played by the Organization and of the great serviceof its Secretary-General. Congratulating our Secretary-General  I would like to stress that we place specialhope in him and to reiterate our support for hisactivities aimed at achieving those very objectives forthe sake of which the United Nations was created.The Millennium Summit identified challenges inthe context of global development that can beaddressed only through coordinated efforts by theentire international community within the UnitedNations system.One year ago  nobody could have foreseen thetragedy that would befall all of us  a tragedy that hasshown the depth of the abyss before which the worldfinds itself today. The dramatic events that struck theUnited States make it imperative for us to take a newlook at the aspects of global development in thetwenty-first century.Threats and risks in the context of globalizationacquire new scale and character  and the internationalcommunity must change its approaches accordingly.Today  an attack against one of us is considered as anattack against all of us. Will this approach becomeuniversal?Azerbaijan suffered from a series of horrificterrorist attacks that were part and parcel of the conflictimposed on Azerbaijan by neighbouring Armenia.Unfortunately  our warnings about the terrorist threat as well as our appeals to the international communityto join efforts in the fight against this evil  made fromthis very podium  went unheeded.26Terrorism is closely linked to aggressiveseparatism and other forms of extremism  as well as toorganized crime  drug and arms trafficking and otherillegal activities that literally flourish in conflict zonesand that provide terrorist and separatist groups withfinancial resources. Terrorism and separatism get large-scale outside support from States and private structuresalike. Response to these threats must not be selective.They can be eliminated only through adequate andcomprehensive countermeasures undertaken on thebasis of the principles and norms of international lawagainst all those who use terror to achieve their goals leaving them no hope of escaping unpunished. Nothingcan justify terrorism. There should be no room fordouble standards  palliatives or narrow nationalinterests.We all have witnessed many manifestations ofterrorism that have taken place in different regions ofthe world  under different slogans and covers. This factby itself clearly shows that the phenomenon ofterrorism is not associated with any particular religion.Hence  the fight against terrorism should not be a fightagainst a religion. We must take effective measures toreverse a dangerous trend of imprudent instigation tohostility between Islam and Christianity.The legal  political  military and other actionstaken today by the international coalition are not theonly prerequisites for a successful fight againstterrorism. It is necessary to redouble the efforts aimedat assisting and enabling the least developed countriesin the process of their social and economicdevelopment to use the opportunities provided byglobalization.Unfortunately  in many regions of the world westill see violent conflicts that claim tens of thousandsof lives and undermine the sovereignty  territorialintegrity and security of States. One such example isthe conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Maskingits claims to the Azerbaijani territory under the bannerof the struggle for the self-determination of theArmenian population of the Nagorny-Karabakh regionof the Republic of Azerbaijan  the Republic of Armeniahas occupied this Azerbaijani territory  as well as sevenadjacent regions of Azerbaijan  and has conductedethnic cleansing on the occupied territory  which hasresulted in the expulsion of 1 million Azerbaijanis fromtheir homes.My country has been waiting for eight years forthe Security Council to take practical steps toimplement the following four resolutions concerningthe Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict: 822 (1993)  853(1993)  874 (1993) and 884 (1993). The Counciladopted these resolutions back in 1993 in order to takeenforcement measures against the aggressor  inaccordance with Chapter VII of the Charter.Until now  mediation activities of theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) Minsk Group  which is co-chaired by theUnited States  France and Russia  and which will be 10years old next year  have not produced any results  sothe tenth anniversary may turn out to be a sad one.Armenia continues to violate the principles andnorms of international law enshrined in the UnitedNations Charter and the OSCE Helsinki Final Act  andit ignores the provisions of the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions and OSCE decisions. Rejecting thisinternational legal basis for the settlement of theconflict  Armenia negotiates from the position ofpower and on the basis of fait accompli  trying toconsolidate the results of its armed aggression and toannex a part of Azerbaijan territory.Armenia states that there is a conflict betweencertain principles of international law  but there is not aconflict between those principles. The right of self-determination cannot be regarded as a right to forcibleseparation of a part of a State’s territory and must notjustify the violation of the principle of territorialintegrity of States  in our case  that of the Republic ofAzerbaijan. Indeed  the real conflict is betweenArmenia and international law  which preventsArmenia from realizing its claims to the territory ofneighbouring States.The international community should not choosethe easiest course of action and should not recognizethe right of the powerful. Instead  it must act inaccordance with the established principles and normsof international law and the decisions of internationalorganizations.It is unacceptable to blame both sides for thedeadlock in the negotiations  ignoring the differencesbetween the compromises and concessions demandedof Azerbaijan  on the one hand  and those demanded ofArmenia  on the other. The aggressor and the victimcannot be held equally responsible.27The Republic of Azerbaijan stands ready for aresolution of the conflict based on the principles ofsovereignty  territorial integrity and the granting ofself-governance to all the people of the Nagorny-Karabakh region within the Azerbaijani State. TheRepublic of Azerbaijan is prepared to provide safetyand security for this region’s population.Azerbaijan is interested in a just and peacefulresolution of the conflict more than anybody else  andwe will continue to undertake all the necessary steps toachieve tangible results. But our efforts alone are notenough. Expeditious settlement of the conflict shouldbecome one of the main priorities for the internationalcommunity. There is no room for stop-gap measuresand “wait-and-see” positions. The situation demandsfundamental approaches and actions on everyone’spart. We expect a very significant contribution from theco-Chairmen of the Minsk Conference at the highestlevel.Azerbaijan  which for eight years has beenhosting 1 million refugees and internally displacedpersons  continues to face an acute humanitarianproblem that will only be resolved completely bycreating the conditions necessary for them to return totheir homes as soon as possible. Crises in theneighbouring regions have created another problem formy country  which now has to deal with a significantnumber of refugees from other countries. Taking allthese difficulties into consideration  we deem itnecessary for the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Baku tocontinue its functions. Currently  Azerbaijan needseven greater UNHCR assistance  as well as assistancefrom other United Nations humanitarian agencies anddonor countries. I would like to take this opportunity toexpress our sincere gratitude and appreciation to all ofthe aforementioned who have given their support andassistance.We believe that in order to enhance theeffectiveness and efficiency of United Nationsactivities in the area of the prevention of armedconflict  it is necessary to better monitor theimplementation of Security Council decisions. To thisend  we propose  for general consideration  that theSecurity Council adopt the practice of submitting to theGeneral Assembly periodic reports on theimplementation of the Council’s decisions.We deem it necessary to strengthen the capabilityof United Nations rapid deployment forces. The fasterthe international community can react to the outbreakor resumption of a conflict  the easier peace and justicewill be restored.Globalization should enable us to promotesustainable development and the integrity and stabilityof public administration systems  eliminatediscrimination in economic activity and ensureprosperity for all peoples. Azerbaijan is contributing tomoving this process forward. We are sparing no effortto restore the Great Silk Route  to create a Europe-Caucasus-Asia transport corridor and to developdeposits of hydrocarbons in the Caspian Sea basin andtransport them to world markets. These projects are ofparamount importance in terms of the free andsustainable development of States in several regions ofthe world. Furthermore  they will give impetus totransregional cooperation and will serve as a factor thatdetermines global development.The free exploitation of natural resources andtheir transportation to world markets is the inalienableright of a sovereign State. Azerbaijan calls upon all theCaspian Sea States to refrain from the use or threat offorce in the Caspian Sea basin. The Caspian Sea mustbe a sea of peace and cooperation. Azerbaijan supportsearly agreement on the delimitation of the Caspian Seaon the basis of principles and norms of internationallaw and established practice in the use of the CaspianSea.As a member of the group of landlockedcountries  Azerbaijan needs assistance from theinternational community to develop its transportinfrastructure in order to integrate it effectively into theglobal economy.In its efforts to implement the conceptsunderlying transregional cooperation  Azerbaijan istaking a multi-track approach and working within theframework of a number of structures. One of them isGUUAM (Georgia  Ukraine  Uzbekistan  Azerbaijanand Moldova)  an organization consisting of five newlyindependent States whose names form the acronym andwhose economies are in transition. The States membersof GUUAM  which celebrate the tenth anniversary oftheir independence this year  have confrontednumerous challenges and threats during the difficultperiod of the formation and development of theirstatehood. Such threats have manifested themselves28most clearly during the periods of armed conflict whichbroke out in three of those five member States.GUUAM stands for the speedy  peaceful settlement ofconflict based on the norms and principles ofinternational law enshrined in the United NationsCharter  the Helsinki Final Act of the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and otherrelevant documents and decisions of the UnitedNations and OSCE.Currently  the GUUAM member States  located inEurope  the Caucasus and Central Asia  are trying toachieve greater integration into the world economyand  to this end  are actively cooperating in creatingmultidirectional transport corridors and in ensuringtheir safety and security.Within the framework of humanitariancooperation  we regard as very promising a GUUAMinitiative aimed at creating a Europe-Caucasus-Asiacultural corridor  which would promote cooperation insuch areas as culture  science and education. Jointprojects in the area of tourism will also have asignificant role to play.The United Nations Development Programme(UNDP) has actively assisted Azerbaijan in addressingthe development issues it faces. At the same time  theGovernment of Azerbaijan is deeply concerned by thecontinuing decrease in the core resources of UNDP.Developing countries and economies in transition needa strong UNDP that is able to provide effectiveassistance in the most complex spheres ofdevelopment. The Government of Azerbaijan callsupon donor countries to increase the financial base ofofficial development assistance  both multilaterally andunilaterally. In distributing official developmentassistance special attention should be paid to the needsof African countries  the least developed countries  thesmall island States and the landlocked States.Azerbaijan places a great deal of hope in theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment and the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  to be held in 2002. As a member of theCommission on Sustainable Development  Azerbaijanintends to make a constructive contribution to ensurethe success of these important events and to promotethe sustainable development of weak economies.In conclusion  I would like to stress that we allbear a tremendous responsibility. Today as neverbefore  we must act wisely and use our power andresources not to escalate hatred and violence  but topromote peace and justice  stability and thedevelopment of our fragile planet."
"12",455,"BDI",56,2001,"﻿Itis for me a signal honour to take the floor today beforethe Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. On behalf of mydelegation  I wish at the outset to express my sincerecongratulations to Mr. Han Seung-soo of the Republicof Korea on his well-deserved election to thepresidency of this body of the United Nations. Webelieve that his vast experience  his dynamism and hiscompetence guarantee the success of our work at thissession. He can count on my delegation to be fullyavailable to him. We will spare no effort to facilitatehis work so that his noble mission can be carried out tothe fullest.Allow me next to pay sincere tribute to Mr. HarriHolkeri for the way he acquitted himself in his term ofoffice leading the work at our last session. We allappreciated his many talents as a statesman andseasoned diplomat  which in large measure contributedto bringing the work of that session to a successfulconclusion.I should like  finally  to avail myself of thisfelicitous opportunity to convey the greetings of theBurundian people to Mr. Kofi Annan  Secretary-General of the United Nations  and to express to himonce again my heartfelt congratulations on hisunanimous re-election to the helm of the Organizationfor a second term of office. At the same time  I addressto him my warmest congratulations on the Nobel PeacePrize just awarded to him and to the United Nationsitself. This token of renewed confidence is a strikingexpression of recognition of the United Nationsfamily’s tireless efforts in every corner of the world forthe cause of peace and development. My Governmentis particularly obliged to the Secretary-General for hispersonal commitment to helping the people of Burundiemerge from crisis so that through the ongoing peaceprocess they can resume the path of peace reconciliation and development.All of us were shocked and horrified by themurderous attacks perpetrated here in New York Washington  D.C.  and Pennsylvania on 11 September2001. My Government firmly condemned those odiousterrorist acts  characterized by indescribable barbarity.The President of the Republic of Burundi  Mr. PierreBuyoya  dispatched a message of condolence to22President George W. Bush immediately after the tragicevents had been reported.The events of 11 September 2001 mark a newglobal challenge for the United Nations in its resolutefight against terrorism and for maintaininginternational peace and security. The Government ofthe Republic of Burundi fully subscribes to the relevantresolutions of the United Nations on the fight againstterrorism. Committed to the ideals of peace andsecurity the world over  it intends to make its owncontribution to building a world from whichinternational terrorism will be banished. Towards thatend  Burundi endorses the various internationalconventions against international terrorism. It hasalready ratified three of them  and this morning wesigned the International Convention for theSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism  adopted in1999. The necessary steps will be taken to sign andratify the remaining conventions. Burundi hails theadoption by the Security Council of its resolution 1373(2001) and stands committed to examining in depth itsscope of application on our own national territory.In light of the plethora of sophisticated juridicalprovisions — extant for nearly 30 years now — to fightagainst this scourge  a profound awareness and farmore sustained collective action today is imperative.The Government of Burundi agrees with the content ofSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001)  whichemphasizes:“... the need to enhance coordination of efforts onnational  subregional  regional and internationallevels in order to strengthen a global response tothis serious challenge and threat to internationalsecurity” (S/RES/1373 (2001)  op. para. 4).That global response obviously  and as a matter ofpriority  is an imperative for us  the Members of thisinstitution  the United Nations  on which the Charterexplicitly confers the role of maintaining internationalpeace and security.As to the situation in my own country  Burundi the present session is being held at a time when thepeace process has just completed a particularlydecisive phase. Indeed the Arusha Peace Accord which Burundi signed on 28 August 2000  has begun tobe resolutely implemented. May I be allowed to bringto the attention of the distinguished representativesgathered here certain major developments worthy ofbeing emphasized. After a number of consultationsheld among the signatories to the Peace Agreement and after the Facilitation and Regional Initiative  thematter of the transitional leadership for the next threeyears has been settled. On 1 November 2001  thesolemn inauguration of the President and Vice-President of the Republic and the transitionalGovernment was held.I wish to make a point of expressing the verysincere thanks of the Government and people ofBurundi to the heads of State and other eminentpersonalities that elevated those ceremonies by theirpresence.At this important stage in the peace process  Ishould like to take care of a pleasant duty  namely thatof paying tribute first to the late Mwalimu JuliusNyerere  who was the first to play a mediator’s role inthe inter-Burundian peace process in an extremelydelicate setting. Secondly  I wish to make it a pointsolemnly to hail the courage  vision  perseverance andtact that His Excellency the former President NelsonMandela displayed throughout the inter-Burundiannegotiations so as to help the Burundian people regainthe path to peace  reconciliation and democracy. Fromthis lofty tribune I wish to express to him our feelingsof profound gratitude. We feel the same sentiments ofsincere appreciation to the United Nations and allcountries and personalities that have worked from nearor afar to see to the signing of the Peace Accord people who continue to invest of themselves in order tosee the Agreement fully implemented. It is thanks to allthese pooled efforts that some glimmer of hope isperceptible in the Burundian political skies.The new Government has set itself as a prioritytask halting the war  rehabilitating victims andrestoring the country in socio-economic terms.Notwithstanding  however  our firm determination tomove forward  the programme continues to encounterenormous challenges  challenges such as thepersistence of war and the exacerbation of poverty.With regard to the war  we must deplore the fact thatarmed groups continue to sow grief and desolation invarious parts of the country  pursuing a nameless war  awar that is killing innocents in their homes  in thecamps for displaced persons and along the roads  a warthat favours pillaging and rape and that has destroyedsocial and economic infrastructures built at great cost.We denounce and condemn in the strongest terms thisnew type of violence  namely the seizing of school23children by rebel elements to press-gang them intoguerrilla forces or to have them do their dirty deeds.In this context the priority of all priorities for mycountry thus remains the quest for a ceasefire  whichwould make it possible to begin the major reformsenvisaged during the transitional period.Notwithstanding numerous initiatives directed by ourGovernment towards the armed groups — the Conseilnational pour la défense de démocratie-Forces pour ladéfense de démocratie (CNDD-FDD)  and the Forcesnationales de la libération (FNL) — inviting them tosubscribe to the peace process and join in negotiations as yet there is no sign of a firm  formal commitment ontheir part that would allow us to move forward in thatdirection. Nonetheless we feel that these armed groupsno longer have political claims that they can trulybrandish  given the fact that the Arusha Accordsenvisage their participation in transitional institutions their recruitment into defence and security corps andtheir social and professional reintegration if they sodesire.While thanking our partners for the variety ofinitiatives already launched to bring the Burundianrebels into the peace process  I should like once againto call upon all the countries members of the RegionalInitiative  the Facilitation in the inter-Burundiannegotiations  the Organization of African Unity  theUnited Nations  and the rest of the internationalcommunity to continue to bring pressure to bear uponthese armed groups so that they will lay down theirarms and rejoin other Burundians around thenegotiating table without further delay  in conformitywith Security Council resolution 1375 (2001)  adoptedon 29 October 2001  and other resolutions of theCouncil. We particularly ask for the invaluable help ofthe countries in our subregion  all of them co-signatories to the Arusha Accords  so that all thenecessary steps will be taken to stop these armedgroups from attacking Burundi. Notwithstanding thesevarious initiatives  if the rebels continue obstinately torefuse dialogue  my Government will call upon theinternational community and all parties signatories tothe Arusha Accords to do all they possibly can toneutralize and disarm the FDD and FNL and  at thesame time  the other negative forces allied to them.The continuing deterioration in the socio-economic situation in my country constitutes yetanother source of major concern for the newgovernment team. Indeed  eight years of the worst kindof fratricidal war  together with three years ofunjustified economic embargo  from July 1996 toJanuary 1999  have plunged the country into a state ofextreme poverty which will be difficult to overcome.What is more  international cooperation since 1996 has as it were  been frozen  thus confronting us with a lackof foreign exchange and a major erosion of ourmonetary situation. Furthermore  in the year 2000 economic activity continued to suffer from the heavyblows of drought  bringing about negative growth fortwo consecutive years in an essentially agriculturalcountry.Over the same crisis period  the situation withregard to health has significantly deteriorated.Notwithstanding efforts exerted by my Government HIV/AIDS  malaria and other diseases such as thoselinked to malnutrition  continue to rage among ourpeople  already weakened by the horrors of war. Themajor performance indicators for education reflect anet decline. Access to drinking water and generalhygiene conditions have seriously deteriorated at atime when many of our dwellings and the basic socialinfrastructure  such as schools and health centres  havebeen destroyed by war.Faced with a particularly trying situation Burundi looks for a great deal from the United Nationsand its agencies  its various bilateral partners international organizations and non-governmentalorganizations to help our economy to recover  in thename of international solidarity and for the benefit ofour people plunged today into a state of unprecedentedpoverty. I thus urgently appeal to my country’s variouspartners to make tangible the reality of the promisesmade at the Pledging Conference for Burundi  held inParis from 11 to 12 December 2000  for the purpose ofrebuilding and helping the recovery of our economy. Around table following through on these commitmentsmade at that Conference is to be organized in Genevain December 2001. The Government of Burundi countson the active participation of our partners  particularlyin making available the aid promised.On the international scene the delegation ofBurundi hopes to see the implementation of theprovisions of the Millennium Declaration adopted lastyear by the heads of State and Government of MemberStates of the Organization. It particularly supports thereforming of the Security Council and welcomes thefact that this matter already enjoys the broad-rangingbacking of the Members of the United Nations. It24regrets nonetheless that discussions on the modalitiesthat the reform is to take are at an impasse  and this eight years after the establishment of the WorkingGroup under General Assembly resolution 48/26 adopted on 3 December 1993. My delegation notwithstanding all that  remains confident that thework of the Working Group concerned will be quicklyconcluded  the results being of the keenest interest interms  once again  of galvanizing this major body.Burundi wishes to draw the attention of theAssembly to the problems that have grown more andmore serious and alarming because of the accumulationand excessive and destabilizing proliferation of smallarms and light weapons and the arms race. In thisconnection it is ever more necessary and urgent todevelop and effectively implement specificdisarmament programmes. We welcome the adoption ofthe Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat andEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and LightWeapons in All Its Aspects at the United NationsConference  held from 9 to 20 July 2001  here in NewYork. Our surest hope is for that Programme to beeffectively implemented to relieve the suffering ofpeople in the regions where this kind of weaponrycontinues to take the lives of thousands of innocentpeople. What is more  the Government of Burundiremains devoted to the goal of the total elimination ofweapons of mass destruction  whether they be nuclear chemical or biological.To have peace and security prevail requiredadopting a working strategy for conflict prevention with a view to understanding fully the motives anddynamics of confrontation and to curing this evil at itsroot. It also means resolutely attacking the structuralcauses that drive people to revolt  namely ignorance want  disease  extreme poverty  underdevelopment andits corollaries  and inequities in the distribution ofwealth. There is a chain directly linking desperate actsand the fanaticism bred of frustration and humiliation.Thus  the imbalance between the North and the Southis unlikely to promote harmonious equilibrium. Indeed on the basis of available statistics  more than one thirdof mankind lives in absolute poverty. This is liable togrow worse if the rich countries continue not toshoulder their responsibilities in terms of aid fordevelopment.Improving the living conditions of peoplecontributes  through its induced effects  to reducingother anachronistic factors growing out of poverty such as the child labour ban by International LabourOrganization (ILO) conventions and the spread of theHIV/AIDS pandemic. My delegation continues to hopethat the International Conference on Financing forDevelopment  scheduled for March 2002 in Mexico will adopt strategies to reduce these inequalitiesbetween and within countries. It expects from thatConference a definition of the strategic objectives interms of consistent policies for integrating developingcountries into the global economy  whatever their levelof development.As to globalization  many indeed are those thatdenounce its perverse effects  as witness the clashes inSeattle and Genoa. In this context  we are duty-boundto see to it that globalization becomes a positive forcefor all mankind in the best interests of all. Yet anotherissue of concern to my delegation continues to be thatof human dignity  which cannot be conceived asdivorced from respect for human rights  including thatof self-determination. Towards that end  the delegationof Burundi continues to hope that the SecondInternational Decade for the Elimination ofColonialism  from 2001 to 2010  proclaimed by theAssembly by its resolution 55/146 of 8 December2000  will help to eradicate its last bastions.It is impossible to talk about internationalconcord without calling to mind the right to justice genuine justice and real fairness in the settlement ofdisputes. On that score my delegation would like yetagain to reiterate the importance the Government ofBurundi ascribes to the International Criminal Court regarding which preliminary steps towards ratificationare being taken. Indeed  my delegation shares the sameconviction as the Secretary-General of ourOrganization  Mr. Kofi Annan  when he affirms that wemust build a world where order and justice reign interms of respect for the primacy of law in internationalrelations.The challenges confronting the internationalcommunity are multiple and take many forms. Theefficacy of the Organization will be judged by itsability to keep cohesion intact and to promote people’sholistic development  so as to fashion a world where allcan realize their potential and where we all espousepeace  fraternity and equality. We are all called upon tostrive towards the realization of that noble cause."
"13",502,"BEL",56,2001,"﻿I havethe honour today to speak on behalf of the EuropeanUnion  which wishes  through you  Sir  to congratulatethe President on his election. That election testifies tothe esteem of the international community for hisperson and his country. I commend the speed of actionand efficiency that you have shown in the face of thetragic events of 11 September  in adapting the agendafor the work of this Assembly.I would also like to associate with this tribute theSecretary-General of the United Nations  Kofi Annan.Mr. Secretary-General  your re-election had alreadydrawn attention to the unanimous appreciation of theMember States for your exceptional qualities as amanager  politician and humanist. The NobelCommittee paid an even wider tribute by awarding youthe Nobel Peace Prize. The United Nations itself  hereat your side  was also a recipient of this message ofhope from a world in a state of shock  appealing to theUnited Nations to remain at the centre of theinternational community’s action for peace anddevelopment.It was the fundamental values constituting thefoundation of the United Nations that were attacked inso cowardly a manner right here in New York on 11September  when our host country  several thousands ofits citizens and nationals of over 60 countries were the37victims of a barbaric act of aggression for which nojustification can be accepted.That attack  by its enormity  has opened our eyesto the worldwide threat that terrorism has become. It isour open  democratic  tolerant and multiculturalsocieties that were attacked through the United States.The terrorist threat must be hunted down in each of ourcountries  in our various regional organizations and  atthe world level  through the United Nations.The European Union has most categoricallycondemned the 11 September attacks  and the fightagainst terrorism is now  more than ever before  one ofour top objectives. The Union has declared its totalsolidarity with the United States. It has reaffirmed itsunreserved support for the military action undertakenin the name of legitimate self-defence  in conformitywith the Charter of the United Nations and SecurityCouncil resolution 1368 (2001).On 21 September  an Extraordinary EuropeanCouncil adopted an action plan for an unprecedentedcampaign against terrorism. This plan contains anumber of specific measures intended to enhancejudicial and police cooperation  including theintroduction of a European arrest warrant. It alsoincludes measures to put an end to the financing ofterrorism and to improve air security. The EuropeanCouncil acknowledged that the fight against terrorismrequires greater participation by the Union in theefforts of the international community to prevent andstabilize regional conflicts. By developing theCommon Foreign and Security Policy and bringing theEuropean Security and Defence Policy into operationas soon as possible  the Union will be at its mosteffective.At the global level also  fresh impetus must beprovided to the fight against terrorism. Naturally  theUnited Nations has a central role to play in developinga coordinated and diversified strategy. We warmlywelcome the major steps that have already been takento that end. The most remarkable of these was theadoption of resolution 1373 (2001) by the SecurityCouncil on 28 September. The European Union and itsmember States are already committed to rapidenactment of the measures needed for itsimplementation. We call upon all countries tocooperate actively with the follow-up system set up bythe Security Council  and we reiterate our readiness toprovide aid in that connection to any countries thatmay have technical difficulties in meeting therequirements.It is also essential that all States ratify withoutdelay the 12 conventions on combating terrorism andapply all of their provisions. The InternationalConvention for the Suppression of the Financing ofTerrorism is a decisive aspect of international actionand needs to be speedily signed and ratified.Lastly  the European Union welcomes the recentprogress made in negotiating a comprehensiveconvention on international terrorism  on the basis of adraft submitted by India. The remaining difficultiesmust now be dealt with as soon as possible so that thisinstrument can be ready for signing early next year.The efforts we are making to combat terrorismmust also form part of overall efforts to build a betterworld  a world in which human dignity is sacrosanct  inwhich human rights and fundamental freedoms arefully respected.The promotion and protection of human rightsand an attachment to the principles of democracy andthe rule of law are essential components of theEuropean Union’s Common Foreign and SecurityPolicy and of its development  cooperation andexternal relations. The European Union will activelypursue its work on consolidating human rights andfundamental freedoms  with particular insistence on theuniversal  indivisible and interdependent nature of allhuman rights. It will continue to support efforts by theSecretary-General to integrate human rights intoUnited Nations activities at all levels and in all forums and to cooperate with all United Nations human rightsmachinery.The European Union welcomes the imminentestablishment of the much-awaited InternationalCriminal Court. The Union sees this as being ofparamount importance and urges all States that havenot yet done so to accede to the Rome Statute as soonas possible. More than ever before  we need a universaland permanent court capable of sanctioning the mostserious violations of international humanitarian lawand human rights  thereby contributing to peace andsecurity in the world. It is vital that the United Nationsgive effective support to the establishment of theCourt.Following the tragedy of 11 September  thespecial session of the General Assembly on the 10-year38review of the World Summit for Children had to bepostponed. However  until it is held  we need to keepup the momentum developed in the preparatorydiscussions. We must continue to integrate the specificdimension of the child into our actions and strive toensure that every child’s life is free from terror  thehorrors of war  abuse and exploitation  hunger andpoverty.The European Union is resolved to continue thefight against all forms of discrimination and violenceagainst women  and to ensure that all countries takestrong measures to apply the Convention on theElimination of All Forms of Discrimination againstWomen. Women must be able to enjoy their humanrights in full  on an equal footing with men. Girls musthave the same opportunities as boys  particularly ineducation and access to social services. The EuropeanUnion insists also that there be equal rights to property credit facilities and social services  includingreproductive health services. It is in the interest ofeveryone that women be able to participate fully ineconomic and political life at all levels.The Union stresses the importance ofimplementing Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)and the special attention that must be given to theparticipation and full association of women on an equalfooting in all efforts aimed at maintaining andpromoting peace and security.We must also vigorously pursue the crucial fightagainst racist and discriminatory tendencies andintolerance  which are daily realities throughout theworld. The World Conference against Racism  RacialDiscrimination  Xenophobia and Related Intolerancehas  I believe  shown us the way forward. It has alsoenabled us to advance our ways of thinking about thecauses and origins of racism and  above all  to view ourpast in a new way. What matters now is that we findthe will to close the darkest chapters of our history sothat we can build a new relationship based on mutualrespect  solidarity and partnership.The terrible humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan isgripping the attention of the international communityjust as much as the political  diplomatic  military andeconomic aspects of the situation in that country. Thisis the first time that the international community hasadopted such a global approach to an armed conflict.We are convinced that this is the best — if not theonly — way to ensure effective resolution of the crisis.The coordination of aid efforts  primarily on the groundand as part of the range of actions undertaken by theUnited Nations  remains essential.Emergency humanitarian aid to Afghanistan is anabsolute priority for the European Union  which hasundertaken to mobilize an aid package of over 320million euros as soon as possible. The Union expressesits concern about the difficulties of access  as well as ofdelivering humanitarian assistance  in Afghanistan. Itsupports the efforts of the United Nations specializedagencies  the International Committee of the Red Crossand all humanitarian organizations in seeking practicaland flexible solutions. It also calls on the countries ofthe region to facilitate  by all possible means humanitarian operations to deal with new influxes ofAfghan refugees.The European Union recognizes the vital role ofthe United Nations in the search for a peace plan forAfghanistan. It intends to support the initiatives of theSecretary-General and his Special Representative andto make a constructive contribution  with regard toboth the search for an internal political solution and toa plan for rebuilding the country. The Union alsostresses the importance of the regional dimension ofthe stabilization of Afghanistan.We must make adequate contributions to theOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs soas to ensure that it can function efficiently. TheEuropean Union attaches particular importance to aidto persons displaced within their countries. Wetherefore welcome the fact that a unit has beenestablished within the Secretariat to cater to theirspecific needs. Following the recent attacks againsthumanitarian aid personnel  the European Union canonly call once again for the strengthening ofarrangements  particularly those of a legal and financialnature  for guaranteeing the safety and security ofhumanitarian aid workers and United Nations workersin general.Now more than ever  disarmament and non-proliferation constitute the cornerstone of any peaceand security structure  and must therefore be subject tobinding multilateral norms. It is against thatbackground that we wish to strengthen the non-proliferation regime  promote the rapid entry into forceof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty andreinforce the biological and toxin weapons Convention.We must also combat the proliferation of ballistic39missiles and the illicit trade in light weapons andcontinue to work for the complete elimination of anti-personnel mines.With regard to peacekeeping  the United Nationshas shown in the past year that it is better equipped andbetter organized than it has been in recent times. Byway of example  I should like to mention theoperations in East Timor  Eritrea and Sierra Leone.Progress has thus already been made on the ground inimplementing the recommendations of the Brahimireport. But much remains to be done  and the EuropeanUnion will continue to provide its active support forimproving the capabilities of the Department ofPeacekeeping Operations and advocating that theOrganization be given the resources that it needs toenable it effectively to discharge its increasinglycomplex responsibilities.A comprehensive and long-term approach isrequired in order to resolve differences of opinion consolidate peace and prevent a resurgence of conflict.The European Union  which is currently establishingits own military and civil crisis-management capability is actively engaged in strengthening its cooperationwith the United Nations and other internationalorganizations in the area of conflict prevention  crisismanagement  humanitarian aid  post-conflictreconstruction and long-term development.The Balkans  a region so close to the countries ofthe European Union  remains at the centre of theUnion’s external activities. We resolutely maintain ourcommitment to contribute to building a region ofsecurity  prosperity and democracy there  where multi-ethnic societies can be free to flourish. Progress hasbeen remarkable and encouraging  but unfortunately inmany cases the situation remains fragile. Theinternational community must remain vigilant and mustnot let extremists  of whatever kind  use violence todestroy the stabilization work already carried out.The situation in the Middle East is worsening.The lack of any political perspective naturallyencourages continued confrontation and plays into thehands of extremists. Defiance  fear and resentmentradicalize people’s mindsets. The European Union callson Israelis and Palestinians  while there is still time immediately to resume the peace process  withoutpreconditions  on the basis of the Mitchell report. Itcalls on the Israeli authorities to immediately withdrawtheir forces from Palestinian-administered areas. Itcalls on the Palestinian Authority to do its utmost toarrest those responsible for violence against Israel.It is necessary to preserve what has been achievedso far in the peace process: the principles of the MadridConference  in particular the principle of land forpeace  as well as Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973) and the agreements signed bythe parties  which have already led to real results on theground and to progress on the basis of earliernegotiations. The European Union calls on both partiesto do their utmost in the political  security  economicand social areas in order to get back to the negotiatingtable  without preconditions  with the objective ofrealizing the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of theregion  as set out at the Madrid Conference of 1991.For the Palestinians  the establishment of a viabledemocratic State and an end to the occupation of theirterritory is essential. The Israelis must have the right tolive in peace and security within internationallyrecognized borders. The European Union also recallsthat the search for a comprehensive and lasting peacein the region requires due account to be taken of theIsraeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese aspects of theconflict. The same principles should apply in theresolution of those situations.It is primarily for the parties themselves to try tofind peace through negotiating all elements relating topermanent status. This will include finding a viable andjust solution to the particularly complex issues ofJerusalem and the refugees  as well as those of theeconomic support for the Palestinian people.The European Union  in close cooperation withthe United States of America and the other partnersinvolved  reaffirms its willingness to work for a finalsettlement to the conflict. We believe that it is now amatter of urgency to develop an initiative to stronglyurge the parties to resume their political dialogue.The European Union finds the status quo inCyprus unacceptable. We express our disappointmentat the unjustified decision of the Turkish side to declinethe Secretary-General’s invitation to pursue talks. Wecontinue to support the Secretary-General’s endeavourstowards a comprehensive and lasting settlement of theCyprus question in accordance with the relevantSecurity Council resolutions.The scale of the tragedies on the Africancontinent demands resolute action on our part  at alllevels  to address the direct structural causes of those40conflicts. Conflicts in Africa have become increasinglycomplex and their cross-border effects increasinglydestructive. The crises in the Great Lakes region ofWest Africa  in Zimbabwe and in the Horn of Africarequire increased vigilance on the part of theOrganization. Those crises also show the need for acomprehensive and integrated international approach.We gave an enthusiastic welcome to the launch of theNew African Initiative at the Lusaka summit of theOrganization of African Unity. The European Unionhas stated its willingness to respond and has alreadyentered into a dialogue at the highest level with theAfrican Union.At the Millennium Summit  we pledged togetherto attain a set of development objectives. That is anambitious project which involves  inter alia  goodgovernance in each country and at the internationallevel. The Union underlines the need for strengthenedpartnership between rich countries and poor countriesto achieve the development objectives of theMillennium Declaration. That partnership entailsobligations and joint but varied efforts on the part of allcountries.First of all  we must make every effort toeradicate poverty. New  concrete commitments weremade at the third United Nations Conference on LeastDeveloped Countries  held at Brussels last May. TheEuropean Union committed itself to untying aid  toopening up its markets through the “everything butarms” initiative and to the full financing of the HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. It isnow a question of finalizing the follow-up mechanismsof the Programme of Action for the Least DevelopedCountries. The European Union will also continue togive priority to the development of Africa.Two major international conferences will give usan opportunity to take up the challenges and achievethe principal objectives of the Millennium Declaration.At the International Conference on Financing forDevelopment  to be held next March at Monterrey Mexico  we shall focus on improving cooperationamong all development actors  and on using resourcesmore effectively and better mobilizing them.At the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  to be held at Johannesburg in October2002  we wish to promote the sustainable use andmanagement and the protection of the natural resourcesthat are the underpinning of economic and socialdevelopment. We wish also to integrate action on theenvironment and poverty  to ensure that globalizationserves the needs of sustainable development  and topromote better ways of managing public affairs andparticipation. The European Union would like toexplore with its partners the possibility of achieving atthe Summit a global pact on sustainable development.Such a pact should contain commitments both fromGovernments and from other actors. A global pactshould lead to concrete action to improve theimplementation of sustainable development policies.We hope that United Nations Member States willwithout delay commit themselves to be represented atMonterrey and at Johannesburg at the highest possiblepolitical level.The United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change was one of the major results of the1992 United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment. We welcome the progress made at Bonnand at Marrakesh  and we undertake speedily to ratifythe Kyoto Protocol.We have also just reached an intergovernmentalconsensus at the highest level on the strategy needed tohalt the appalling global AIDS pandemic. That was amajor step forward  but the urgent and tragic nature ofthe problem demand greater ambition. We will activelycontribute to the creation of the new Global Fund tocombat HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis  and wewill play an active role in all the other processes thatemerged from last June’s special session so that theDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS is put intopractice through concrete measures.Among other challenges  the demographicchanges that lie ahead are of particular interest to theEuropean Union. The second World Assembly onAgeing  to be held at Madrid in April 2002  will be anopportunity for us to work together to build a societyfor all ages.The Millennium Summit enabled us to tackle  atthe highest level  the major challenges facing the worldcommunity. We must now turn our attention to theprocess of following up the Declaration adopted byheads of State or Government with all due regard forthe lofty and balanced aims of that cardinal text. Forthat  we need reliable data and depend on the existingfollow-up machinery and processes and on theconcerted efforts of the various actors in the41international community who can help us to achievethose objectives.We must also continue reform of the UnitedNations system as a whole  including the specializedagencies and the operational funds and programmes.The strengthening of the Security Council and itscomprehensive reform in all its aspects should bepursued with determination. If we want a SecurityCouncil capable of responding even more effectively tothe major challenges of the moment  we must intensifyour efforts.Looking beyond the tremendous and growingcomplexity of our actions at the international level  ourdebate should highlight this basic truth: if we want tobuild a world made more peaceful by respect for thelaw  solidarity and tolerance  we must strengthen ourcohesiveness in the face of the new challenges beforeus  and also step up our efforts to promote humanrights  eradicate poverty and achieve sustainabledevelopment.In this forum of the United Nations  we reply tothe messengers of destruction with our common ideal which will be stronger than hatred and division amongmankind. That edifice  whose foundations are set in ourspirits and in our hearts  will be unassailable."
"14",547,"BEN",56,2001,"﻿I would firstof all like to express my outrage at the unacceptableconditions that terrorism has imposed on us at the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly of ourOrganization. New York has traditionally been awelcoming and cosmopolitan city. But now  during theAssembly’s fifty-sixth session  it and our Organizationhave been forced to take on the appearance of abesieged fortress.No one knows what the terrorists have planned nor who their next victims will be. We are all on thesame side in the face of their diabolical enterprise —on the side of this battered city; on the side of theAmerican people and their Government; and on theside of all the innocent victims brought down socruelly and coldly in Pennsylvania  Washington andNew York on that tragic day of 11 September 2001. Wereiterate our profound condolences and sympathy to allthe bereaved families and to their countries andGovernments. At the same time  we reaffirm ourunreserved condemnation of terrorism. Terrorismviolates the principles of all religions. It blemishes allthe causes on whose behalf it claims to act  even themost just among them. It is for that reason that it mustbe combated by all of us without reservation.The worldwide awakening aroused by the tragicevents of 11 September 2001 must cause us all — greatand small  rich or poor — to join in an extraordinaryeffort to fight those who have decided to sacrifice uswithout having ever consulted us about either theirobjectives or war tactics. But it should also be said thatas wholly repugnant as terrorist practices are  theycannot be eradicated definitively unless the fertile soilthat feeds the situations that serve as their pretexts isremoved. The strict respect for human rights and therights of peoples that are so rightly enshrined in theCharter of the United Nations should today guide ourpolitical practices more than ever before. It is urgentfor the United Nations to take its proper place ininternational relations and for it to play the roleincumbent upon it. In that regard  the reform of theSecurity Council is an urgent and imperative necessity.Poverty  injustice  exclusion and marginalizationalways result in creating total despair  thereby causingextremism to flourish. And we know how easilyextremists sacrifice their own lives and those of others.It is the duty of all of us  and particularly of the mostpowerful among us  to provide the necessary support toeradicate poverty  marginalization  exclusion andinjustice  and to bear that in mind at all times in thejust  legitimate and resolute struggle against all formsof terrorism.The current tragic events that I have just recalledheighten our concerns and give greater weight to theresponsibilities of the President of the GeneralAssembly. But his personal talents and experience inworld affairs bolster our conviction that he willsuccessfully steer the ship of our Organization into portin these particularly difficult circumstances. For someyears now  his country and mine have enjoyed friendlyand fruitful relations. He can count on the cooperationand support of the delegation of Benin in the executionof his noble mission.I would also like to pay well-deserved tribute toMr. Harri Holkeri of Finland  who guided the UnitedNations into the new millennium with great spirit. Hepresided over the Millennium Assembly withcompetence and discipline  and we extend to him ourcongratulations and gratitude.My congratulations go also to my brother Mr. Kofi Annan  on his well-deserved re-election to thepost of Secretary-General of the United Nations and onthe Nobel Peace Prize for 2001  awarded to him andthe Organization he leads with such competence anddedication. The United Nations has gained a great dealof credibility thanks in particular to the efforts ofMr. Kofi Annan and his team in the Secretariat. Neverhas there been a more well-deserved prize  and we takepride in it. Indeed  it is all of Africa that is honoured.On behalf of the Benin delegation and myself  I wouldlike to repeat our warm congratulations andencouragement.Let me take this opportunity to address theinternational community and each Member of theAssembly to convey the thanks of my country for theirmassive participation at the Fourth InternationalConference of New or Restored Democracies  held inCotonou from 4 to 6 December 2000. Indeed  theCotonou Conference saw record attendance  with 106States  20 international organizations and 51 non-governmental organizations represented  not to mentionacademics and other researchers interested indiscovering Benin’s experience of democracy. Beninwas honoured by the effective participation of three20heads of State. The Secretary-General of the UnitedNations and the Administrator of the United NationsDevelopment Programme made a point of attendingpersonally in Cotonou. We welcome this gracious andgenerous gesture on their part  and express ourgratitude to all bilateral and multilateral partners  thosefrom the new or restored democracies as well as thosefrom the older democracies who contributed tofinancing this Conference.To judge by its title  “Peace  Security  Democracyand Development”  the Cotonou Conference was animportant stage in the progress of our century towardsa consolidation and expansion of democracy. It markeda remarkable advance by its future-oriented approachand the importance of the document that crowned itswork  entitled “Cotonou Declaration”. This Declarationlays out brave and bold measures designed to builddemocracy and allow to it survive in peace  securityand respect for diverse cultures. There can be nodemocracy unless it is adapted to the soil in which it isplanted  even if the values of democracy are universal.The Cotonou Conference was also an opportunityto appreciate how genuine the march towardsdemocracy in Africa is. All peoples want liberty  butthe institutional and financial capacity to establish it isweak in many cases  particularly in developingcountries. That is why my country hopes for moresubstantial assistance for the strengthening of theinstitutional capacities of our countries  becausedemocracy can function only if the leaders and theirpeoples feel they are equal stakeholders. It is alsoessential that within the United Nations system  thestructure recommended by the Cotonou Conference while following up the International Conference forNew or Restored Democracies  be established with aview to increasing coordination among the differentinitiatives and activities undertaken or contemplated bythe agencies  programmes and various institutions ofthe United Nations system.Indeed  the Fourth International Conference ofNew or Restored Democracies strove to highlight thelink that exists between democracy and development.The Conference clearly indicated that if democracy is aforce for stability  poverty is a major factor fordestabilization and a source of conflicts and war. Thedecisions of the Fourth International Conference ofNew or Restored Democracies should not be allowed toremain dead letters. We must organize cooperation andsolidarity among all the democracies of the world.In the course of the Millennium Summit  whichtook place in this very Hall from 6 to 8 September2000  major decisions were taken. Among them  prideof place belonged to those relating to questions ofdevelopment  the elimination of poverty and theparticular needs of the least advanced countries. TheMillennium Declaration provides  in paragraph 15 ofchapter III:“We also undertake to address the specialneeds of the least developed countries. In thiscontext  we welcome the Third United NationsConference on the Least Developed Countries tobe held in May 2001 and will endeavour to ensureits success.” (resolution 55/2  para. 15)That Conference was held in Brussels from 14 to20 May 2001 and produced a Programme of Actionthat was the fruit of very arduous negotiation.However  questions remain. Will the poor countriessomeday know prosperity? Will they someday be ableto satisfy their basic needs? How will they finance theirdevelopment? Public development assistance is indecline. Investment in poor countries remains weak and the burden of debt is becoming heavier. What is tobe done?With regard to the question of debt  we thinkparticularly bold solutions are required. For thecreditor countries  it must be recognized thesesolutions are neither simple nor easy. Some of thesecountries have already adopted exemplary and boldmeasures; others must follow suit. At stake are theirown interests: at stake is the interest of world peace.This demand represents to us the symbol ofsolidarity and shared responsibility. That is why theBenin delegation recommends the urgent establishmentof an effective and highly visible follow-up mechanismof the Third United Nations Conference on the LeastDeveloped Countries.In the context of the search for peace and thepromotion of international cooperation  manydisarmament organizations and other related bodieswere created to reaffirm that questions of peace andsecurity and questions of development wereinterdependent and inseparable. The creation of theZone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlanticmeets this need. Its goal is to protect the coastal Statesof the southern part of the Atlantic Ocean from thedangers of nuclear weapons and to create there a zone21of peace and strengthening of cooperation fordevelopment.Since the third ministerial meeting  held inBrasilia  my country had offered to host the sixthmeeting  scheduled for the year 2000  but because ofthe organization of the Fourth International Conferenceof New or Restored Democracies  this meeting couldnot take place. My country is looking forward to theearly meeting of this sixth meeting. That is why Iwould like to announce here Benin’s offer to organizethe sixth ministerial meeting of the States of the Zoneof Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic in thesecond half of 2003.A particularly important instrument of South-South cooperation  the Zone of Peace and Cooperationof the South Atlantic should lay the foundations inCotonou for its effective and regular functioning withinthe new context of international relations. All of youhere are welcome to Benin  a marketplace and meetingplace  a land of democracy and peace.It is more urgent than ever to establish such peacein the Middle East by recognizing as a matter ofurgency on the part of us all the imperative necessity ofthe Palestinian State — side by side  of course  withthe State of Israel — in peace with all its neighbourswithin secure and recognized frontiers. This is thesame peace that Angola and all Africa long for.We must ban all forms of the illicit traffic inpetroleum  diamonds and weapons. These types ofillegal traffic cause and sustain wars  and thetraffickers are genuine terrorists.From 31 August to 8 September 2001  theRepublic of South Africa hosted in Durban the WorldConference against Racism  Racial Discrimination Xenophobia and Related Intolerance. That greatinternational forum  held under the auspices of theUnited Nations  brought to light the desire forrehabilitation  justice and fulfilment of the obligationsof memory and acknowledgement  which humanity’srecent history has left in the subconscious of certainpeoples. The difficult debates on the thorny questionsraised during the Conference reflect the extent of thedifficulties in this undertaking that we all ferventlycalled for.A collective spirit of openness  the impressiveabilities of the host country  the Republic of SouthAfrica  and particularly the receptiveness and ability ofmy sister  Ms. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma  enabled us toreach agreement on two encouraging documents: thefinal Programme of Action and the final Declaration. Inour view  these documents represent the internationalcommunity’s renewed commitment to fighting anderadicating the seeds of racism and racialdiscrimination. The foundation has been laid. Now action must follow to make the two Durban documentsa reality of everyday life. This does not meanreopening old wounds; rather  we must all now attendto healing the wounds of the past.The tragic events whose effects we are still livingthrough obliged us to postpone the General Assembly’sspecial session in follow-up to the World Summit forChildren. My country hopes that a new date can bedecided on during this session so that we can assess thesituation of children in the world 10 years after theWorld Summit  because much remains to be done toimprove the lot of children.Allow me to recall that Benin  having ratified on3 August 1990 the United Nations Convention on theRights of the Child  is among the first 22 States of theworld consenting to be legally bound by thisinstrument. Benin has also ratified the African Charteron the Rights and Welfare of the Child. Articles 12  13and 26 of Benin’s Constitution guarantee the right toeducation and the protection of families  mothers andchildren. Benin’s intentions in this area are alsoapparent in the creation of a Ministry of the Family Social Protection and Solidarity  which will be devotedessentially to the implementation of a cohesive andaggressive policy to protect the family  particularlychildren.Encouraging results have been achieved at thenational level  but much remains to be done. We aredoing admirable work in this area in partnership withthe United Nations Children’s Fund  the United NationsDevelopment Programme and several estimable non-governmental organizations  such as Terre desHommes  and several other partners of good will.Those who know Benin can testify to this.These collaborative efforts have not stoppedcertain misinformed or ill-intentioned circles in searchof scandals from using the Etireno affair to deceivepeople into believing that the enslavement and selling22of children take place in Benin. But neither maliciousintentions nor misinformation nor this sort ofintellectual terrorism will prevent us from makingprogress in terms of democracy  the protection ofwomen and the protection of children from the abusethey still suffer in all the countries of the world particularly in poor  underdeveloped countries.The Millennium Declaration gave specialattention to Africa under the heading “Meeting thespecial needs of Africa”. One year later  the countriesof Africa are still waiting for action to begin to betaken on those promises. However  Africans are nolonger willing to wait and have taken their fate intotheir own hands by creating the New Partnership forAfrica’s Development. The partnership is aconsequence of the newly restored confidence ofAfricans in their own abilities. It is aimed at placingthe historic initiative in the hands of Africansthemselves  without in any way renouncinginternational cooperation. An important step has thusbeen taken with this new African joint initiative.Africans finally have hope that their continentwill cease to be the continent of disease  poverty misery and bloody conflicts and that a real partnershipcan be created between us and the rest of the world. Itis our wish that this hope will become reality."
"15",593,"BFA",56,2001,"﻿I should like first of all to offer the profoundcondolences of Burkina Faso to Algeria and theDominican Republic following the disasters that havestruck those countries.I would like to convey to you  Sir  my heartfelt warm congratulations on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixthsession. I would also like to congratulate the membersof the Bureau  as well as Mr. Harri Holkeri  Presidentat the fifty-fifth session  for the outstanding efforts thathe made during his term of office.I would like to take this opportunity to pay aresounding tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan  whosenoteworthy re-election to the post of Secretary-Generalof the United Nations confirms the exceptionalqualities that he possesses as a diplomat and tirelesschampion of peace and justice in the world. The NobelPeace Prize  which has just been awarded to him  iseloquent testimony to that.Last year  the leaders of the world met here togive new impetus to our Organization and to committhe international community to mobilizing itself moreresolutely in the quest for international peace andsecurity and to fighting poverty  injustice and otherscourges that threaten the very existence of humankind.The terrorist attacks of 11 September whichstruck the United States and plunged the Americanpeople  as well as other peoples throughout the world into grief truly marked a turning point in thedevelopment of international relations. They were abrutal and atrocious reminder of both the complexity ofproblems facing humankind and the urgent need to findappropriate solutions to them. Burkina Faso firmly andunambiguously condemned those barbaric  criminaland repugnant acts  and we condemn them still.Furthermore  we are resolved to take part in anyinitiatives undertaken by the international communityto eradicate terrorism and its causes. That is whyBurkina Faso has begun the process of ratifying theOrganization of African Unity Convention on thePrevention and Combating of Terrorism  as well asUnited Nations conventions on this subject.My Government has just adopted a draft law witha view to ratifying the United Nations Conventionagainst Transnational Organized Crime and the first second and third protocols thereto  relating respectively  to the smuggling of migrants; traffickingin persons  particularly women and children; and theillicit manufacturing of and trafficking in weapons. Incooperation with the United Nations  Ouagadougouwill be hosting  from 28 to 30 November  a seminar forthe foreign ministers and ministers of justice of the2countries of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates  the aim of which is to accelerate the ratificationof that Convention.If it is to be effective  the campaign againstterrorism must be part of a coherent and solid worldcoalition  with its basis in the United Nations. At thesame time  it must take into consideration the realitiesand constraints confronting international relations. Inother words  in addition to military action  thecampaign must include the most appropriate politicaland diplomatic measures in order effectively to dealwith conflicts and regional political problems and toreduce gross injustice and inequality which  because ofthe frustration they generate  serve as a breedingground for extremists and fuel violence and hatred.As our mobilization to fight terrorism must betotal  so also must we see to the prior definition ofclear objectives and appropriate methods for theirimplementation. While it is true that terrorists are ourenemies  it is also true that the manner in which wecombat them should not provide them with allies. AsPresident Blaise Compaore recently stated:“As we see it  there is a risk that  if we are notcareful  the responses to the events of 11September might lead to a catastrophic scenariofor humanity  with a tangled web of conflict:conflict between the Judeo-Christian world andthe Muslim world; conflict between West andEast; conflict between the rich North and the poorSouth. It is therefore crucial for our currentleaders courageously to attack the injustices andinequalities which fuel violence and hatred.”The international community must thereforeresolutely commit itself to combating poverty epidemics  in particular HIV/AIDS  and economic andcommercial marginalization  as well as exclusion of allkinds  which continue to be the daily lot of manyregions of the world.Attacking these injustices means necessarily thatwe have to find a solution to the question of the MiddleEast. The right of the Palestinians to establish anindependent State  respectful of the existence andsecurity of Israel  is a sine qua non here. Because of thecontinuing tension in that part of the world  conveninga special international conference on the subject at theearliest possible date is necessary.It is also essential to lift the iniquitous embargoesimposed on some States  such as Libya  Sudan  Iraq Iran  and Cuba. For  not only do these embargoes causesuffering to their people  but they also help to weakenworld peace and security.The Republic of China in Taiwan  which hasdemonstrated sufficiently that it is a democratic andpeaceful State  is prepared to play its rightful role inthe concert of nations  and it should no longer sufferfrom the injustice that we are combating each day. Thatis why  in the name of equality among peoples andnations  we make an urgent appeal for the readmissionof the Republic of China to the United Nations.Turning to the question of Western Sahara Burkina Faso has always supported United Nationsinitiatives and efforts here. Accordingly  the recentplan proposed by Mr. James Baker  the Personal Envoyof the Secretary-General  seems to us to be anacceptable political compromise for a constructivenegotiating basis.One activity that fuels and sustains conflicts andserious banditry in the world is the manufacture  saleand circulation of arms and anti-personnel mines.Burkina Faso firmly supports the actions taken by theUnited Nations aimed at reaching general and completedisarmament  both at the level of weapons of massdestruction and conventional weapons. As forcombating the proliferation of light weapons  inaddition to the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS) moratorium to which it subscribes Burkina Faso has set up a high authority responsiblefor monitoring throughout our national territory theimport and use of weapons.Africa has decided to further unite. It has decidedto bring closer together its peoples and economies andto strengthen its partnership with other regions in orderto better integrate itself in the world economy. TheAfrican Union was set up precisely to accomplish thishuge project. Burkina Faso reiterates here the appealmade by the heads of State and Government of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) for the effectivesupport of the international community for the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development.The debate in the United Nations should enableall Member States to express themselves and contributeto the discussion on how best to meet the concerns ofhumanity. All opinions must be heard and taken intoconsideration. Decisions taken pursuant to the rules3must also be applied by each Member State. This is thesine qua non requirement for achieving a viable newinternational order based on a necessary dialogueamong civilizations and a culture of sharing andsolidarity. This new world order  in order to be morejust  has to be based on two basic concepts. First of all there should be a reform of the United Nations toprovide a more collective and democratic way ofmanaging the affairs of the world. Secondly  thereshould be a more equitable distribution of the world’sresources  through revision of trade mechanisms andfinancing for development.Turning to the reform of the Security Council Burkina Faso reaffirms Africa’s position  whichresulted from the Harare Summit  advocating equitablerepresentation of all regions of the world andguaranteeing greater transparency and effectiveness forthe United Nations.Our world is in constant flux. The ardent desirefor peace and security and the search for democracyand well-being are  with each passing day  becomingever more rooted in people’s minds. During the pastfew years  Burkina Faso has undertaken wide-rangingpolitical and economic reforms  which are in keepingwith the permanent validity of these universal values.Politically  the reforms undertaken by theGovernment  based on a consensus approach  haveenabled it to improve the institutional environment andto meet the expectations of the political class and civilsociety. This involves in particular the status of theopposition  new voting procedures  the single-ballotsystem  financing for political parties  trade unions andthe private press  and the creation of the ConstitutionalCouncil  the State Council  the Appeals Court  theState Audit Office and an independent nationalelectoral commission.Economically speaking  the Government isconstantly struggling to improve the living conditionsof our people. Need I recall that destitution and povertyare the first way we deny human rights. They denyhuman beings their main raison d’être: their dignity.Therefore  we have decided to stress the struggleagainst poverty and exclusion by working out  with ourdevelopment partners  a strategic framework to fightpoverty.In our global village  happiness for everyone ispossible. The best of possible worlds is within ourgrasp. Scientific and technological progress means thatwe can overcome the ills that beset humanity. Wesimply need to unite  show solidarity and act together."
"16",636,"BGD",56,2001,"﻿I wish warmly tocongratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his unanimouselection to the presidency of the General Assembly. Weshare the conviction that he will infuse the work of theAssembly with dynamism and a new perspective.I also join in the warm tributes paid to hispredecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri. We congratulateSecretary-General Kofi Annan and his staff on havingbeen awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2001. He hasbrought honour to us all. His re-election to a secondterm is a just tribute to his dedication  commitment andsheer hard work.The catastrophe of 11 September has scarred usall deeply. It has brought irrevocable change andinevitable hardship. Yet it has honed and hardened acommon resolve  a steely determination to confront andcondemn all such irrational and mindless acts ofviolence. Bangladesh stands committed to fight againstterrorism  in all its forms and manifestation  bywhoever and wherever it is committed. We believe thatterrorism hampers peace and security and createspolitical chaos and economic instability around theworld.We have therefore pledged total support for theconcerted efforts of the international community toconfront this scourge as best  as quickly and ascomprehensively as we can. We have initiated theprocess of identifying any possible administrative orfinancial focus or network of suspected terrorists. Wehave not given  and will not give  any form ofsanctuary  training or support to any kind of terroristgroup or cell. We are responding to the call of theSecretary-General and working towards becoming aparty to a number of United Nations anti-terroristinstruments. We already subscribe to the 1987 SouthAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)Convention on Suppression of Terrorism and believethat it has scope for further strengthening.As a member of the Organization of the IslamicConference (OIC)  we support  and will activelyparticipate in  efforts to reach an agreement on theearly completion and adoption of a comprehensiveconvention to combat terrorism. We hope that aninclusive approach will be taken that will unite us all inour common struggle against terrorism.We are aware that terrorism has no consistentprofile and that it has many variables reflecting theincreasing complexity of human society. But this muchis certain: we know what it is not. We must emphasizeand underscore emphatically the fact that terrorism hasno connection to any one religion or to any particular41region of the world. It is a global phenomenon andshould be addressed as such. We therefore welcomePresident Bush's statement to the General Assembly  atthe 44th meeting on 10 November  during which hequoted the sheikh of Al-Azhar University  the world'soldest Islamic institution of higher learning  as havingdeclared that terrorism is a disease and that Islamprohibits killing innocent civilians.Previous speakers have underlined the fact thatthe spotlight on terrorism should not blind us to thepursuit of other pressing objectives. Indeed  terrorismis but one aspect of the many negative forces that shapethe substance of what we call globalization  includingdrugs  organized crime  the illicit transfer of smallarms  money-laundering  environmental degradation and the new diseases that have invaded all societies.Many have intrinsic interlinkages  and none respectborders. They call for collective approaches andconcerted global action.On the positive side  two crucial forces haveimpelled globalization  mass consciousness ofindividual rights and the impact of science andtechnology. The push for individual rights humanitarian concerns and a burgeoning newhumanitarian law are reflected in the worldwide sweepof democracy. Advances in science and technologyhave closed the information and communications gap.Together  these forces have changed the nature of ourworld  challenged the context and meaning ofsovereignty  and brought about a need for new anddynamic approaches.The radical changes that came in the wake of theend of the cold war coincided in Bangladesh with theoverthrow of military dictatorship in 1990 and theadvent of democracy. Since then  Bangladesh has heldin succession three general elections that have beenacclaimed by all impartial observers  both local andforeign  as being eminently free and fair. We have theunique distinction of being the only parliamentarydemocracy in which elections are constitutionallycarried out by an interim caretaker government withina 90-day period.The roots of democracy have taken hold and havespread far and wide. Today  despite all of Bangladesh'slimitations due to poverty  its people havedemonstrated unequivocally that they are a functioning moderate  modernizing Muslim country. The mostrecent elections  held on 1 October 2001  had a voterturnout of 75 per cent of an electorate of over 70million people. What was extraordinary was theunprecedented number of women who freely exercisedtheir right of franchise.In an overwhelming demonstration of support  thepeople have returned the four-party alliance led byPrime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia to power  withmore than two-thirds majority seats in the BangladeshParliament. This is an outstanding endorsement of  andtriumph for  democracy. It also imposes a huge burdenof responsibility on the Government to measure up tothis massive mandate.The Prime Minister of Bangladesh  BegumKhaleda Zia  has responded firmly. The newGovernment is committed to consolidating anddeveloping a sustainable structure of democracy withthe participation of the opposition. The primary focusis to restore law and order and to ensure social peace harmony and justice  so as to improve our capacity tofight poverty  illiteracy and underdevelopment. Fourfactors pace the economic agenda: reducing poverty raising rural productivity  boosting trade andencouraging investment.In pursuing these key factors  the Governmentwill refine its already established four-fold strategy of1991-1996: encouraging macroeconomic reform stimulating the private sector  enhancing the qualityand quantity of development expenditure andconcentrating on the quality  not quantity  ofinvestment. There will be a cardinal push foraggressive economic diplomacy in the wake ofglobalization  which has called for closer interactionbetween domestic and foreign policy and which hastriggered intense competition for greater access tomarkets  the flow of resources and investments  thetransfer of technology and employment opportunitiesabroad.In the pursuit of the pre-eminent objective ofalleviating poverty  a key concern remains to placepeople at the centre of all public policies.In the field of foreign policy  a fundamentalcharge remains that of reinforcing mutual  beneficialand cooperative relations with all countries and theconsolidation of our image abroad as a responsible stable  moderate  democratic and contributing memberof the world community.42Our unwavering policy is to maintain close andfriendly relations with our neighbours on the basis ofequality  mutual respect  non-interference in internalaffairs and the settlement of outstanding bilateral issuesthrough dialogue and negotiation. It is a matter of somegratification that  close on the heels of the formation ofthe new Government  special envoys of the leaders ofboth India and Pakistan visited Bangladesh as agoodwill gesture to renew and reinvigorate ties.In our region  a priority objective will be torevitalize the momentum and credibility of the SouthAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).It is a matter of particular satisfaction that the stalledtwelfth SAARC Summit will now be taking place 4-6January 2002 in Kathmandu  Nepal. It is of vitalimportance that this first millennium summit of SouthAsian leaders forge a new vision for the future of theregion that will encompass promotion of not only itssocio-economic mandate  but also the reduction oftension  the normalization of relations and the creationof a broader-based climate of confidence-building.Bangladesh believes that the most compellingsecurity challenge facing South Asia is promotingsustainable growth  reform and development.Nuclearization in South Asia has  if anything  enhancedsecurity concerns in the region. Bangladesh adheres tothe belief that security goes beyond the weapons anation possesses and extends to raising living standardsand building stable and healthy democracies. The linkbetween development and security is thus crucial inSouth Asia. This was the underlying rationale ofSAARC. The guiding motivation  as enunciated bythe late President Ziaur Rahman  was to visiblyimprove the quality of life of the common people in anenvironment of peace.In the global context  a cardinal priority forBangladesh will be to play an active role throughconcrete initiatives in all socio-economic forums  topromote the cause of developing countries as a wholeand the least developed in particular and  especially  tokeep alive special treatment for the poorest of the poor.A fundamental objective for Bangladeshconsistent with our Constitution is to strengthen therole of the United Nations as the central organ for thecooperative management of the world's problems.Bangladesh will continue to actively contribute to thepeaceful settlement of disputes  to bolster collectivesecurity and peace-building. Our commitment topeacekeeping remains firm and has manifested itself inthe participation of Bangladeshi military and civiliancontingents in many areas of simultaneous conflicts.We are immensely proud to be currently the largestcontributor among blue helmets  serving in ten UnitedNations missions. In the field of peacekeeping  webelieve that the recommendations of the Brahimi Panelprovide a good basis  and we feel that the Departmentof Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) should beequipped adequately to handle such a requirement.Bangladesh strongly believes that the issue ofrepresentation of troop-contributing countries in themilitary  civilian police and diplomatic components inthe DPKO and in other departments  as well as in themission headquarters  should be seriously considered inthe context of the proposed expansion scheme.Bangladesh's term in the Security Council is nowabout to come to an end. We have sought to live up toour responsibility with pragmatism and moderation. Wehave tried to make the work of the Council moretransparent  open and proactive and to develop aneffective interface between the Council and the generalmembership to reflect the aspirations of all on issues ofcommon interest.Today  certain issues both political and economichave assumed centre stage  and our attention istelescoped upon them. Prime among them is thesituation in Afghanistan. Bangladesh is a part of theinternational coalition that seeks to establish a stable durable  social  political and economic structure inAfghanistan as soon as possible. It is our hope that theAfghan people will have a true opportunity to choosetheir own system of governance in line with humanvalues and democratic practices in a post-Talibandispensation. Such a Government should be broad-based  multi-ethnic  demographically and equitablyrepresentative  responsive to the needs of the Afghanpeople and acceptable to the people of Afghanistan  theneighbourhood and the international community. Wewelcome efforts to focus on positive and finitesolutions to the problems of Afghanistan  especiallyefforts being made with the assistance of the UnitedNations for forming an interim transitional Governmentacceptable to the Afghan people. We also welcome twokey projects: first  a massive reconstruction andrehabilitation plan and efforts to mobilize funding;second  a hard focus on ways and means to facilitatethe return of the refugees. Of immediate importance isthe vast humanitarian tragedy in Afghanistan  the need43to contain and minimize the loss of human life and toreach out with immediate relief to refugees anddisplaced persons.While new threats to peace  security andeconomic stability are emerging  the old ones remain.Occupation  inter-State and intra-State conflicts particularly in the Middle East  Africa and the Balkans continue to threaten regional and global peace andstability. We are particularly concerned at the steadydeterioration of the situation in Palestine  arising out ofthe encroachment on Palestinian territories and thecollective punishment meted out to the Palestinians.Bangladesh will continue to maintain its unflinchingsupport of the legitimate rights of the Palestinianpeople to an early establishment of a State of their ownwith Jerusalem as its capital.Poverty today remains the pre-eminent moraland humanitarian challenge of our age and henceneeds to be tackled with due priority. The Secretary-General has reminded us of the commitments made byour leaders during the Millennium Summit last year toeradicate this scourge.The role of external financial support in thedevelopment process has assumed greater importanceby virtue of the fact that better education  knowledge skill and awareness must be effectively integrated intothe global economic and market mechanism. In thiscontext  we look forward to the MonterreyInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment in March 2002.Over the last few decades  access to globalmarkets has been seriously limited for the products ofthe developing countries in general and the leastdeveloped countries (LDCs) in particular. In thiscontext  Bangladesh calls upon development partnersto create more access for trade  including offeringduty-free  quota-free access to products from the LDCson a secure  long-term and predictable basis withrealistic and flexible rules of origin to match theindustrial capacity of the LDCs. We are hopeful thatthe current Ministerial Meeting of the World TradeOrganization in Doha will be able to effectively focuson the obligations to implement the commitments madeearlier during the Uruguay Round of negotiations. Debtrepayment is also an enormous burden on thedeveloping countries  particularly on the LDCs. Weurge the developed countries to expand the HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) facility to includemore indebted developing countries  with particularfocus on the LDCs.Bangladesh is committed to strengthening and tofollowing up on many ideas to bolster the UnitedNations capacity to lead  especially that of the GeneralAssembly. Bangladesh strongly supports the idea offorging better coordination between the major organsof the United Nations  namely the General Assembly Security Council and the Economic and Social Council for working out a long-term strategy for sustainablepeace and development.In conclusion  I would like to say that it is not thelack of resources that prevents the promotion of acollective and shared perspective on commonchallenges. What we perhaps need is to muster thedetermination and courage to build up a collective andinclusive approach for undertaking pragmatic andforward-looking actions. The challenges of the twenty-first century remind us once again that we must seekharmony through diversity  peace through dialogue and prosperity through mutual cooperation. The UnitedNations offers the most appropriate and centralmechanism to promote our best aspirations andobjectives. The journey to peace has always beenarduous; nonetheless  it is the longing for peace progress and justice that has inspired us to work for ourbetter tomorrow."
"17",682,"BGR",56,2001,"﻿A year after the unique Millennium Assembly we can say that the United Nations is playing anenhanced  more important role as a collective tool formeeting the challenges facing the world.Bulgaria welcomes the re-election of Mr. KofiAnnan as Secretary-General  and hails the award of theNobel Peace Prize to him and to the Organization.International terrorism has become aggressiveand powerful  and threatens not only States but also thefreedom of the human spirit  as proved by the worldOrganization’s committed and active stance vis-à-visrecent terrorist acts  along with the unanimouslyadopted Security Council resolutions condemningthem. Bulgaria unequivocally supported thoseresolutions  in particular Security Council resolution1373 (2001). The National Assembly and theGovernment of Bulgaria have adopted similardeclarations on ensuring a common effort in the fightagainst terrorism.Let me recall that the fight will be incompletewithout moral — even spiritual — commitment. Let usnot forget that the mere pursuit of material well-beingis not a panacea; other values are needed to improvethe lives of peoples. In a “virtual society”  there is aneed for real values and for a framework acceptable toboth the poor and the rich.I take this opportunity to convey the condolencesof the Bulgarian people to the citizens of the UnitedStates of America with respect to the terrorist acts of11 September. We all admire the steadfastness andcourage they have displayed in addressing this tragedyand its aftermath.2I am particularly proud to observe that  at a timewhen the role and the importance of the United Nationsare on the rise  the Republic of Bulgaria is about toassume the responsibilities of a non-permanent memberof the Security Council. For the Bulgarian people andits Government  our election to that important organ ofthe world Organization constitutes recognition of theinternational standing of Bulgaria and of its active balanced foreign policy. Our foreign policypriorities — membership of the European Union and ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization — are sounderthan ever before. For natural cultural reasons  we arecommitted to the concept of la francophonie  whichembodies not merely a language but a state of mind. Ithank all Member States that were good enough tosupport us in the election.Bulgaria will shoulder the full responsibility ofnon-permanent membership of the Security Council.We are ready to participate in dialogue on the fullrange of items related to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. My country is open todialogue with all States Members of the Organization andto ideas and suggestions aimed at enhancing the roleand effectiveness of the United Nations.I wish here to speak of the positive part theRepublic of Bulgaria plays as an important actor forpeace and security in South-Eastern Europe and forstability in the settlement of crises in the EasternBalkans  an area that borders on Bulgaria. We favourfull implementation of Security Council resolution1244 (1999)  and we consider that the 17 Novemberelections in Kosovo will be decisive for the process ofstabilization and democratization there. Similarly Bulgaria attaches high importance to ensuring thestability of the Republic of Macedonia through theimplementation of the 13 August 2001 FrameworkAgreement and to guaranteeing its sovereignty andterritorial integrity. My country supports fullimplementation of the Dayton Accords and theconsolidation of the united State of Bosnia andHerzegovina. In our view  democratization in theFederal Republic of Yugoslavia is a positive element. Along-term strategy must be crafted to effect therestoration and economic development of South-Eastern Europe to rebuild it in the wake of the variouscrises it has experienced. Let me stress that thesequestions should continue to be the focus of all ourefforts to find equitable solutions to conflicts.I should like also to highlight Bulgaria’s supportfor the lasting and peaceful settlement of other regionalconflicts that are as tragic as those in the Middle East in Africa and elsewhere  of which there is a long andsad list. Our positions in respect to all of these conflictsare in conformity with the Charter of the UnitedNations and generally recognized principles ofinternational law.Having myself been an exile for more than 50years  I am very aware of the human tragedy ofrefugees  whose number and suffering are continuing toincrease  as is the case now in Afghanistan.We attach great importance to items on theagenda of the United Nations such as the combatagainst organized crime and corruption and againstillegal drug trafficking. That is why our Government ismaking a particular effort to this end on our ownterritory. Monitoring trade in weapons and in dual-usegoods and technologies is highly relevant  given thelinkage between this kind of trade and terrorism.Let me add that Bulgaria is participating activelyin cooperation efforts in the economic and social fieldand in the areas of human rights  the non-proliferationof weapons of mass destruction  global disarmamentand the protection of the environment. These objectivesare consonant with those of the new BulgarianGovernment: to ensure that the social needs ofBulgarian citizens are met  and to bring about durableeconomic growth  despite the sometimes difficultinternational economic situation.The attitude of the Republic of Bulgaria vis-à-visits increased responsibilities within this worldOrganization will be based on a clear  logical andconsistent foreign policy  with an emphasis on regionalsecurity  development and broadening the circle offriendly States  and on making a contribution to theresolution of global problems through its activeparticipation in multilateral dialogue. Solutions toconflicts must be found here  at the United Nations —not on the battlefield.In conclusion  we believe that this policy willmeet with the understanding and support of all of theMembers of the United Nations."
"18",727,"BHR",56,2001,"﻿This session is taking place amid feelings of sadnessand grief that prevail following the terrorist acts of 11September that befell the United States. Theyvictimized the thousands  from more than 80 countries who were working in the World Trade Center in theCity of New York when the vicious attack took place and also resulted in great material and economicdamage.My country  the State of Bahrain  moved quicklyto condemn the terrorist attacks in New York  just afew kilometres from the Headquarters of the UnitedNations  and in Washington  D.C. The Emir of Bahrain Shaikh Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa  expressed toMr. George W. Bush  President of the United States ofAmerica  and to the friendly people of the UnitedStates of America the deep condolences of the Emir the Government and the people of the State of Bahrainfor the victims of these wicked attacks  which runcounter to the teachings of all divine religions as wellas the basic tenets of humanity and the standards ofcultural values.The State of Bahrain has supported theinternational alliance against terrorism. It has offeredits cooperation as a participant in efforts and measuresto eliminate terrorism and terrorists as well as theirhavens and financial resources. We have done so out ofour firm and principled position against terrorism andour rejection of all forms of violence and extremism.Such violence and extremism contradict the teachingsof true Islam and its tolerant values  as well as all loftycultural and human values in which we believe andwhich we support.The State of Bahrain also followed andparticipated in the debates on combating terrorismduring this session of the General Assembly. It sharesthe opinion of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan that the shocking events of 11 September have unitedthe world against terrorism  as demonstrated by thecondemnation of those horrific attacks expressed bymillions of people from all societies. We also share theSecretary-General’s opinion that  because of its uniquestructure  the United Nations has an important role toplay in mobilizing the international community incountering and combating terrorism.As part of its policy of cooperation withinternational efforts  the State of Bahrain welcomedSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001)  which dealt27with the issue of terrorism  in particular operativeparagraph 6  which requests Member States to report tothe Security Council Committee within 90 days on thesteps taken to implement the resolution.While expressing our feelings of sadness at thehorror of the events of 11 September  we must alsowarn against the danger of exploiting the events to linkterrorism to Islam. Islam is a religion of amity andtolerance  and we would like to warn against thedanger of stirring up hostility against Muslims and ofigniting a conflict between religions and civilizations instead of dialogue and interaction among them for thegood of all societies and people of different races andbeliefs. In this context  we are pleased to welcome theposition taken by the United States of America andother friendly countries in calling on their citizens torefrain from harming their residents or citizens of Araband Muslim descent and reaffirming the spirit oftolerance  interaction and dialogue among religions andcultures.The United Nations  which is the ideal tool forconfronting international terrorism  faces otherchallenges that stand in the way of cooperation forprosperity  economic and social development and thebuilding of a world in which justice  peace and equalityprevail.In this regard  this year the United Nations heldseveral special sessions of the General Assembly  oneon human settlements and the other on HIV/AIDS  aswell as a Conference on small arms. The Economic andSocial Council also convened conferences oninformation technology  the eradication of poverty andfinancing for development  as well as the WorldConference Against Racism  Racial Discrimination Xenophobia and Related Intolerance  which was hostedby the Republic of South Africa.The State of Bahrain endorsed the United NationsMillennium Declaration  and today — on the basis ofits deep-rooted civilization and sustained revival aimedat strengthening the foundations of the modern State attaining comprehensive development  furtherinvigorating the mechanisms of civil society and publicinstitutions in order to enable its citizens to understandcurrent issues and the need for further advancement —it reaffirms its determination to continue shoulderingits national  regional and international responsibilities with a view to achieving the common purposes andprinciples set out in the Charter of the United Nationsand the Millennium Declaration.In this context  His Highness Shaikh Hamad BinIsa Al-Khalifa  Emir of the State of Bahrain  took theinitiative to establish a national committee thatincludes representatives from all sectors of Bahrainisociety. This committee prepared a draft Charter fornational action  which was approved in a freereferendum by a majority of 98.4 per cent of the peopleof Bahrain  and was ratified by His Highness the Emirin February this year. This Charter is part of acomprehensive plan to develop Bahraini society update its systems and institutions and transform it intoa modern State capable of participating effectively inthe new world order and of facing the challenges andrequirements of the era.This historic step was coupled with a number ofmeasures to improve and update constitutional anddemocratic institutions  reaffirm the rule of law achieve justice  equality and equal opportunities andenhance popular participation. Foremost among theseare developments in the field of human rights  whichhave confirmed the participation of women andenhanced their role in civil society  including theirright to vote and to run for elected office  as well as theestablishment of the Human Rights Committee of theShura Council and the establishment of the SupremeCouncil for Women. The Council’s mandate includes inter alia  proposing public policies in the field ofdevelopment and enhancing the role of women in civicand constitutional State institutions. Proud of itsaccomplishments in the political  economic and socialfields and reiterating its determination to press aheadwith its comprehensive development plans to build amodern State capable of reaffirming its internationalposition and consolidating its relations with variouscountries of the world  the State of Bahrain would alsolike to express its thanks and appreciation for thesupport given by many States of our Organization tothe worthy steps taken by His Highness the Emir.Bahrain’s determination to imbue its relationswith others with a spirit of friendship and cooperationis evidenced by its fraternal  amicable and closerelations with brotherly and friendly States. Suchrelations are based on mutual respect  non-interferencein the internal affairs of others and the promotion ofgood-neighbourly relations and cooperation amongStates. In this respect  it is worth noting the position ofboth the State of Bahrain and the State of Qatar on the28judgement handed down by the International Court ofJustice on 16 March this year  which brought to an endthe border dispute between the two brotherly countries.The statements issued by the leaders of both countriessaid that the judgement  which was accepted by the twocountries  had opened a new page in relations betweenthem  based as they are on agreement and cooperationaimed at achieving their common interests  and that itrepresented the triumph of international legitimacy andthe principles of international law.It is regrettable that the ramifications of thedangerous events witnessed in the Gulf region over thepast 20 years constitute an ongoing threat to thesecurity and stability of the region and an obstacle toits development and growth. The State of Bahrain which would like to see regional and internationalsecurity prevail  especially in the Gulf region  whichhas strategic importance and in which various countriesof the world have vital interests  calls once again uponIraq to cooperate with the United Nations and to fullyimplement the relevant Security Council resolutions  inparticular those relating to weapons of massdestruction and to the release of Kuwaiti prisoners ofwar and detainees and those of other nationalities  sothat efforts to lift the sanctions and to end the sufferingof its brotherly people may succeed.The State of Bahrain also hopes that  in the lightof the positive developments in relations between thecountries of the Gulf Cooperation Council and theIslamic Republic of Iran  a peaceful solution can bereached in the current dispute between the latter andthe United Arab Emirates over the three islands Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa  all of whichbelong to the United Arab Emirates. The State ofBahrain approves of and welcomes the direct contactsthat have taken place between the two neighbouringcountries and hopes that the dispute will be settled bypeaceful means in accordance with the principles ofinternational law  including referral to the InternationalCourt of Justice.Since the current Israeli Government came topower  the Middle East has experienced seriousdevelopments that have brought back conditions ofhostility and confrontation such as engulfed the regionprior to the beginning of the Madrid peace process in1991. This has come about through Israel’s aggressionagainst the Palestinian people and its oppression economic isolation and blockades of all the territoryunder Palestinian authority.The peace process based on Security Councilresolutions  in particular resolutions 242 (1967) and338 (1973)  and on the Madrid terms of reference —specifically the principle of land for peace — is at animpasse. The explosive situation in the PalestinianAuthority’s territories  with all its inherent risks including the threat to security and stability in theMiddle East and to the interests of the Authority andother States  requires the international community  andprimarily the sponsors of the peace process  to shouldertheir responsibilities to put the peace process back ontrack so that its objectives may be achieved.This can be done only through the fullimplementation of Security Council resolutions callingfor a complete withdrawal from the Arab territoriesoccupied by Israel in the Syrian Golan Heights up tothe boundaries of 4 June 1967 and from the remainingoccupied territories of the Republic of Lebanon  andthrough full recognition of the legitimate rights of thePalestinian people  including its rights of return and tothe establishment of its own independent State withJerusalem as its capital. In this regard  we welcome thestatement made by President Bush of the United Statesof America on the right of the Palestinian people —supported by the European Union  the permanentmembers of the Security Council and the internationalcommunity — to establish a Palestinian State.The role of the United Nations and the reform ofits machinery to enable it to face its challenges andovercome them collectively are among the priorities ofthe Charter that were reinforced by the MillenniumDeclaration. The Declaration calls on us to uphold therule of law nationally and internationally  to respecthuman rights and to conduct international relations insuch a way as to preserve world security  peace development and stability.In praising the role of the United Nations  Ishould also like to take this opportunity to convey mywarm and sincere congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan whom the Member States have unanimously re-electedas Secretary-General for a second term in office inrecognition of his tireless efforts to allow theOrganization to play its full role and to achieve itsobjectives. Through those efforts  the Secretary-General and the United Nations under his leadershiphave fully deserved the Nobel Peace Prize for this yearin appreciation of their great contribution tomaintaining international peace and security. I29congratulate the Secretary-General and the UnitedNations on that honour.I also have the pleasure to extend to you  Sir  andto your friendly country  the Republic of Korea  ourcongratulations on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. I expressthe hope that you will succeed in carrying out yourtasks. I also thank your predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeriof Finland  President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-fifth session  and commend his invaluable effortsin conducting the proceedings of that session and of thespecial sessions held in conjunction with it.We believe firmly that the destiny of the humanrace is a common destiny  given that we all live in oneworld. We are therefore duty-bound to preserve thatworld and to protect it from the threats of war international terrorism  conflict  disease and poverty. Itis incumbent on us  the peoples of the United Nations as stated in the Charter  to choose to practice toleranceand to live according to the will of Almighty God aspeoples that cooperate in the pursuit of friendship justice  peace and security."
"19",765,"BHS",56,2001,"﻿The President has beenelected to chair at what is undoubtedly one of the mostchallenging sessions of the General Assembly in recenttimes. My delegation congratulates him on his election.We pledge our full support to him and express ourconfidence that under his leadership the work of theAssembly will have a positive impact on our collectiveefforts to meet the many challenges facing our world.My delegation would also like to take thisopportunity to commend his predecessor  Mr. HarriHolkeri of Finland  for his leadership as President ofthe fifty-fifth session  the Millennium Assembly.We are in times of great tragedy but also oflaudable triumphs. The Secretary-General and theUnited Nations have rendered outstanding andinspiring service to the world’s peoples. Mr. Secretary-General  we celebrate with you and this Organizationthe well-deserved Nobel Peace Prize awarded to you even as we express our appreciation for the exemplaryleadership that you continue to provide to the UnitedNations.My delegation also wishes to take thisopportunity to express its sincere sympathy to theGovernments of the United States and the DominicanRepublic and to the families of those who lost theirlives in the crash of a United States commercial aircraftin New York yesterday.While recognizing the many challenges the globalcommunity will face in the twenty-first century  leadersat last year’s Millennium Assembly nonetheless wereoptimistic that peace and prosperity would beimportant hallmarks of the new century. Their hopeshave been severely undermined by the indefensible actsof terrorism perpetrated in the United States on 11September 2001. The horrific scenes of death anddestruction in New York  Washington  D.C.  andPennsylvania  so indelibly etched in our minds  haveno doubt changed the world forever. The Governmentand the people of the Bahamas mourned with countriesall over the world  including our sister Caribbeancountries that lost loved ones  and expressed oursadness at the senseless loss of life and wantondestruction of property.Even as events in Afghanistan unfold  the UnitedNations  and indeed the world  now face a dilemma:how to confront the grave challenge whichinternational terrorism has defiantly issued to the worldand at the same time meet the Charter obligations to30promote human rights and social progress and betterstandards of life in larger freedom. We must bevisionary and creative in ensuring that the resourcesand energies of the United Nations and of theinternational community are used to implement abalanced agenda that will deal effectively andresolutely with terrorists and terrorism and that willalso continue to have a positive impact on humanrights  economic and social development and othercommon objectives.The international community has spoken with onevoice in condemning international terrorism as a majordestabilizing force in the world. The acts of 11September 2001 fundamentally shifted securityconcerns regarding terrorists and terrorism to theworkplace  streets and homes of innocent people creating anxiety  insecurity and uncertainty worldwide.Significantly  the terrorist acts have had serious anddamaging consequences on a rapidly globalizing worldeconomy. The economies of both industrialized anddeveloping countries have been severely disrupted with grave implications for future economic andfinancial stability. The economic outlook  particularlyfor many developing countries  is indeed grim. Thesmall economies of the countries in the Caribbean haveexperienced massive disruption because of theirvulnerability to external shocks and heavy dependenceon tourism  especially from the North Americanmarket. There has been significant loss of employmentin the tourism  financial services and related sectors even as government revenues have fallen and foreignreserves are threatened.The countries of the Caribbean Community(CARICOM) have moved decisively to assess theimplications of the terrorist attacks on its memberStates. As Chair of the Conference of Heads ofGovernment of CARICOM  the Bahamas was host to aspecial emergency meeting of the Conference  held on11 and 12 October 2001  which adopted the NassauDeclaration on International Terrorism. ThatDeclaration sets out the action that Governments wouldtake to mitigate the impact on the region’s tourism aviation  financial services and agricultural sectors which are the major contributors to the gross nationalproduct  foreign exchange earnings and employment inthe countries of our region.CARICOM heads of Government alsounequivocally condemned terrorism in all its forms andreaffirmed their commitment to work with theinternational community in the multifaceted fightagainst terrorism  in accordance with international lawand conventions. It is therefore our hope that theinternational community will support the countries ofCARICOM during this difficult and challenging period.We in the Bahamas have taken our obligation tocooperate in the fight against terrorism very seriously.We have complied with Security Council resolutions including resolution 1333 (2000) which calls for thefreezing of funds and other financial assets of Osamabin Laden  the Al Qaeda organization and individualsassociated with it. The International Obligations Economic and Ancillary Measures Order 2001  enactedin our Parliament in September this year  prohibits anyperson dealing with any property and any financialinstitution licensed in the Bahamas from transactingbusiness with Osama bin Laden  Al Qaeda or anyindividuals or entities associated with them  who  forthese purposes  may be designated from time to time.We have been able to take such timely action becauseof a comprehensive legislative regime enacted inDecember 2000 which put in place an effectiveregulatory regime to ensure that the Bahamas financialservices sector is not abused by criminals for money-laundering or any other financial crimes. It was theenactment of that legislation that resulted in theFinancial Action Task Force’s removal of the Bahamas in June of this year  from its list of non-cooperativejurisdictions in the fight against money-laundering. Aspart of its overall review of the international regime foraction against terrorists and terrorism  in October thisyear my Government signed the United NationsConvention for the Suppression of the Financing ofTerrorism. We are following very closely thediscussions on a comprehensive convention againstterrorism  in order to determine what further action theGovernment will need to take in this area. We hope thata comprehensive  practical and implementableinstrument will be adopted that will take into accountthe existing anti-terrorism regime. In this we see aclearly delineated role for the United Nations  andparticularly the Security Council  which is well placedto articulate a coherent policy for global cooperation inthe fight against international terrorism.Meeting our obligations  however  has not beenwithout sacrifice. The Bahamas  like many otherCaribbean countries  has been obliged to divert scarceresources from other critical development objectives toinitiate the sweeping security changes required at our31airports and seaports and otherwise to mitigate theimpact of the 11 September events.For the Government and people of the Bahamas the ravages of hurricane Michelle have furthercompounded the significant economic setbacks causedby the 11 September events in the United States. Justlast week  that hurricane made a direct hit on ourarchipelagic State  causing extensive damage toinfrastructure  agriculture and vegetation in some ofour major islands. The Government is still determiningthe extent of the damage but has already begun theessential period of reconstruction.Globalization and trade liberalization are  andmust remain  central issues on the world’s agenda.Generally  globalization has presented significantopportunities and has had a positive impact on manycountries. However  for others  particularly in thedeveloping world  the freer flow of capital  technology finance  goods and services across nationalboundaries — which is the essence of globalization —has not met the stated objectives of improving overalleconomic prosperity  reducing poverty and closing thetechnological gap. On the contrary  the social costs ofglobalization — poverty  inequality andunemployment — remain serious challenges for manyof the countries of the developing world. Thesechallenges are further compounded by factors includingan onerous debt burden  a limited or inadequate exportinfrastructure to effectively participate in the globaltrading system  and an inability to access the marketsof the developed world. My Government  nevertheless is cognizant that the international trading regime of theWorld Trade Organization (WTO) provides asignificant framework within which countries maybenefit from globalization and trade liberalization  andwork towards appropriately addressing the costs andrisks associated with the global trading system. In Julythis year  the Bahamas submitted its application foraccession to the WTO  for WTO membership is apriority for my Government and we hope that ourapplication will receive the requisite support.We are in a period  leading up to late 2002 during which the United Nations is defining itseconomic and social development agenda with greaterprecision  through a series of assessments ofinternational action in specific areas. The Bahamas waspleased to have participated in the Organization’sreview of its work and setting of its agenda for furtheraction in the areas of racism  racial discrimination andhuman settlements and the illicit trade in small armsand light weapons. My Government believes that everyeffort should be made to consolidate those areas inwhich progress was made at the World Conferenceagainst Racism  Racial Discrimination  Xenophobiaand Related Intolerance that took place in Durban South Africa  from 31 August to 8 September this year.Global objectives in respect of human settlementsreceived considerable impetus from the special sessionon human settlements that took place in New York inJune 2001. The Declaration on Cities and Other HumanSettlements in the New Millennium  adopted by theConference  should prove invaluable in addressingchronic problems of inadequate shelter.The United Nations Conference on the IllicitTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All ItsAspects addressed a problem that for the smallcountries of the Caribbean is a particularly serious one.We wished the Conference could have been moreforthright in its adoption of measures to better addressthese critical issues but readily accept the Programmeof Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the IllicitTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All ItsAspects as an essential first step. Decisions taken atthese and other United Nations meetings are indeeddecisions of the Organization that the Bahamas hopeswill be implemented as such by all Member States.Few countries in the world  if any  have beenspared the vagaries of HIV/AIDS. The statistics arecompelling — more than 30 million people affected.With respect to the developing world they are evenmore compelling — more than 95 per cent of thoseaffected live in the developing world. The Caribbeanregion has not been spared  but we are taking decisiveaction. Our Pan-Caribbean Partnership launched inFebruary this year has the full support and commitmentof heads of Government for effective action againstHIV/AIDS in the wider Caribbean region. TheGovernment of the Bahamas in this regard welcomesthe contribution of the Government of Canada to theCaribbean HIV/AIDS programme. The special sessionon HIV/AIDS held in New York in June 2001 gaveheads of State and Government the opportunity to setan agenda for slowing and reversing the destructiveimpact of HIV/AIDS throughout the world. It is anagenda that must be implemented to halt and reversethis tragedy that is devastating populations and32threatening to reverse the development gains made inmany developing countries. The developing world will and must  look for help and support to those having thetechnology  research capacity and resources by whichthey themselves have been able to control the spread ofthis deadly disease.The year 2002 will also be an active one  both forUnited Nations benchmark assessments andreadjustment of priorities and for addressing significantissues on the international agenda. The InternationalConference on Financing for Development will beconvened in Monterrey  Mexico  in March 2002. Asplans develop  we hope that all Members of the UnitedNations will come to appreciate the need to ensure thatthe Conference provides the framework within whichcommitments can be made so that technical assistancecan be provided to poor countries for basicinfrastructural development  the standards of peopleworldwide who live in endemic poverty can be raised developing countries can be assisted to attract foreigndirect investment  and information technology can bemore freely transferred to developing countries. MyGovernment  for its part  is of the view that small developing  middle-income countries such as theBahamas  because of their economic and ecologicalvulnerabilities  should not be excluded fromdevelopment financing. It is also the view of myGovernment that the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  to be convened in South Africa inSeptember 2002  should be complementary toundertakings made at the International Conference onFinancing for Development. Ten years after the RioSummit of 1992  the ever-increasing fury of naturaldisasters  climate change and sea-level rise  and thedepletion of biological resources and overallenvironmental degradation  are but some of the issuesbegging reassessment that must be part of the blueprintfor determined action emanating from South Africa.Likewise  the Bahamas hopes that the Second WorldAssembly on Ageing  to be held in Madrid  Spain  in2002  and the special session of the United NationsGeneral Assembly on children  postponed to 2002 should assess progress but  more importantly  mustemphasize action that will provide guidance fornational  regional and international policy and planningin their respective areas.The initiatives the United Nations will take up in2002 to review and assess progress in a significantnumber of areas should bring clearly into focus theactions that must be taken by Member States and by theOrganization to accomplish agreed economic andsocial objectives. It is the hope of the Bahamas thatthese reviews will be followed by a period of intenseimplementation of decisions that have been agreed  sothat qualitative and quantitative improvements may berealized in all areas. We believe that suchimprovements are essential but must be in concert withUnited Nations initiatives to meet demands in othercritical areas  such as conflict resolution  war  andhumanitarian crises worldwide. They should also be inconcert with the Organization’s efforts to addresseffectively and comprehensively issues such as theillicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropicsubstances  the illicit trade in small arms and lightweapons  alien smuggling and refugee flows  which donot respect national boundaries. In all such cases  thedanger of inaction could have dire consequences particularly for international peace and security.In conclusion  the current preoccupation withterrorism has fortunately not paralysed the UnitedNations. What it has done is to emphasize the need foran effective and cohesive United Nations  capable ofresponding flexibly to unexpected and contradictoryevents in a timely and effective manner with little or nodisruption of its programmes in other areas. We believethat the United Nations Charter constitutes a viable andfirm foundation for the Organization to balance andachieve its objectives  to maintain international peaceand security and promote economic and socialprogress. The Bahamas fully supports the UnitedNations in all its endeavours."
"20",790,"BIH",56,2001,"﻿I amgrateful for the opportunity to address the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-sixth session. I would like toextend my warmest congratulations to you  Sir  on yourwell-deserved election.I would like to join those who spoke before me inexpressing my deep condolences to the people of theUnited States. The date of 11 September will be foreverinscribed in our minds and hearts as the symbol of themost blatant affront to civilization and commonlyaccepted values. Regardless of the brutality of theterrorist attacks directed against innocent civilians however  they failed in the attempt to polarize theworld and to undermine the very foundations of oursocieties. Those attacks were attacks against all of us too. We therefore fully support the approach outlinedyesterday morning by President Bush.Yes  the fight against all kinds of terrorism mustbe determined and precise. It has to target terrorists who must be apprehended and brought to justice. Atthe same time  we have to do much more when we aretalking about quick and massive help to the innocentcivilians of Afghanistan.I would like to use this opportunity to recall thatmy country promptly and resolutely joined theworldwide coalition against terrorism. And I amconvinced that  by adopting such a clear position  mycountry is a part of the solution  rather than a part ofthe problem  in this particular field. I spoke about thismore extensively in this same Hall two days ago on theoccasion of the meeting devoted to the dialogue amongcivilizations.Coming from Bosnia and Herzegovina  whichwas treated by various kinds of fundamentalists andradicals as a problematic and questionable Balkancountry because of its multi-ethnic and multiculturalnature  I am especially sensitive to the type ofterrorism that misuses religious feelings and  in sodoing  jeopardizes local societies and global society.The war against terrorists is justified  but all of uswill be losers if we fail to do everything we can to helpthe innocent people who are suffering today. Ourexperience in Bosnia and Herzegovina teaches us thatmilitary intervention  even when complemented byhumanitarian assistance  is not enough for asustainable  long-lasting solution.At the same time  we — and when I say “we”  Imean the international community speaking with onevoice  together with local democratic forces  regardlessof their current strength — have to have a clear visionof a political solution  accompanied by a programmefor social and economic development  once the militaryintervention is over. Only such a comprehensiveapproach — military  humanitarian  political and socio-economic — will leave no room for the terrorists tointerpret the intervention in Afghanistan as a waragainst Islam or as a symbol of the clash ofcivilizations.The terrorists will lose. Without a comprehensiveapproach  we might be losers  too  by the measure ofethical and universal human values. That is why wehave to tackle these areas of future action together starting today.At a time when humanity has reached for thehighest objectives but also carried out the worst deeds there should be no doubt that the United Nations canfulfil its new tasks  confronting old and newchallenges  leading in the building of a prosperousworld founded no longer on force but on the rule oflaw  not on a balance of power but on a balance ofcooperation.The contribution of the international communityin achieving progress in my country  Bosnia and17Herzegovina  was particularly visible in the role of theUnited Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina the Stabilization Force  the United Nations HighRepresentative  the Peace Implementation Council  theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europeand other members of the family of the internationalcommunity present in Bosnia and Herzegovina.We particularly recognize and value the role ofthe United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovinain police reform and the substantial upgrading of thejudicial system. The United Nations family oforganizations was certainly one of the key players inthe development of Bosnia and Herzegovina as amultiethnic  tolerant and democratic State.Knowing that the mandate of the United NationsMission in the present form will terminate by the endof 2002  we expect the United Nations missionactivities to continue in a different form. However  wewould like to see a smooth transition without anyinterruption in these extremely important activities.The noble goals and accomplishments of ourOrganization were honoured recently  and I would liketo extend sincere and heartiest congratulations to theSecretary-General and the whole of the United Nationsfor the recognition by the Nobel Peace PrizeCommittee.I would like to inform the Assembly that we havedecided to present candidature of Bosnia andHerzegovina for a non-permanent seat in the SecurityCouncil for the year 2010. We are convinced that bydoing so  we confirm our commitment to contributingfully to the work of the United Nations. It would alsobe a clear sign of advanced stability and normalizationof life in our country  and particularly of ourcommitment to economic and democratic development.Therefore  we hope that as early as in 10 years fromnow  Bosnia and Herzegovina will succeed inbecoming a member of the most important politicalbody of the United Nations.In Bosnia and Herzegovina  we are working dailyto live up to the vision of a safer and more peaceful stable and self-sustaining country. Our efforts aredirected toward three main sets of priorities.First is the rule of law  through the speedyimplementation of the latest Constitutional Courtdecisions and through proper judiciary and policeactions fighting terrorism and organized crime combating corruption  arresting indicted war criminalsand creating a stable environment for the return ofrefugees.Second are the further building and strengtheningof the State’s institutions.Third are economic reforms directed to thestrengthening of economic activities; establishment ofa single economic space; and setting up the conditionsfor upgraded education  thus offering a choice for ouryoung generations to stay in Bosnia and Herzegovinaand become an inseparable factor in its developmentand future.Of course  implementation of the Dayton/ParisPeace Agreement and the continuous adjustment andupgrading of our legal framework according toEuropean standards are the foundation of activities ofthe authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina at all levels.Once again  I would like to express the gratitudeof my Government to the international community forits devoted support of the enduring stability anddevelopment of my country. We are determined tomove from the position of a patient or passive recipientof aid from international organizations and institutionsto one of a partner in and contributor to internationalefforts. We have to go through the process of beingfirst a recipient and then a partner in order to finallybecome the owner of the changes in our country.We are aware that responsibility for healing theconsequences of the war and post-war stagnation  andfor the removal of impediments to faster stabilizationand progress  rest primarily with the politicalleadership in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The future ofBosnia and Herzegovina is in its integration intoEuropean and North Atlantic organizations. Theestablishment of contractual relations with theEuropean Union through the stabilization andassociation process is one of the priority strategic goalsof Bosnia and Herzegovina. Further improvement ofgood relations with neighbouring countries andincreased regional cooperation remain key elements forthe stability and development of Bosnia andHerzegovina and the region.Relations with the Republic of Croatia since thedemocratic changes in January last year are improvingevery day  in every sense.As a result of the democratic changes last year inthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  Bosnia and18Herzegovina has established full diplomatic relationswith that country  which opened the official channels ofthe two countries to deal with a number of importantmatters.However  a number of issues that burdenedrelations between the neighbouring countries are stillon the agenda. Some of them have already been solvedin bilateral meetings  but we are looking forward totackling them more actively.Today is exactly one year since the people ofBosnia and Herzegovina  for the first time in 10 yearsof being driven by nationalism  gave less than 50percent of their votes to three major ethnic parties. Ittook us almost four months to establish the new democratic  multi-ethnic  Europe-oriented Governmentthat is now in place. We believe that we are on the wayto striking a proper balance between the necessaryassistance of the international community and furtherdecision-making by ourselves.Finally  I can assure you today that our countryhas a leadership with a clear vision and is ready to actaccordingly. For years  Bosnia and Herzegovina wasone of the world’s international and regional problems.Today  my country is becoming one of the solutions.With this conviction  we are looking at the importantchallenges and tremendous tasks that are still ahead ofus. We must confront them without delay. I amstanding here to say we will do it."
"21",837,"BLR",56,2001,"﻿Thedelegation of Belarus would like to express its deepestsympathy to the families of the victims of the planecrash that occurred this morning in New York  as wellas to the Governments of the United States and theDominican Republic.My delegation would also like to congratulate thePresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixthsession on his election to that responsible post. Hiselection is undoubtedly clear recognition of theRepublic of Korea's role in international affairs. Wewould also like to express our gratitude to the Presidentof the General Assembly at the previous session 22Mr. Harri Holkeri. His successful presidency of theMillennium Summit and Assembly is a clear exampleof his personal talent and leadership skills.The United Nations is entering the new centuryunder the leadership of Mr. Kofi Annan. Hisunanimous re-election by the General Assembly to asecond five-year term came as an unequivocalacknowledgement of great appreciation for his work asSecretary-General. We welcome the recent well-founded decision by the International Nobel Committeeto grant the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations and to Mr. Kofi Annan personally.The consequences of the terrorist attacks of 11September 2001 against New York and Washington D.C.  are as present and as painful as ever. In thatregard  our country does not consider this session ofthe General Assembly just a regular event in the life ofthe United Nations. For Belarus  the point is that  asMember States  all of us must demonstrate collectivewisdom and display the collective will to make ourworld less vulnerable in the face of acts of insanity thatpush not only individual countries but the whole ofhumanity to the very edge of a global catastrophe.As a responsible member of the internationalcommunity  the Republic of Belarus cannot remainindifferent to this threat. In his message to Secretary-General Kofi Annan  the President of the Republic ofBelarus  Mr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka  clearly explainedthe views of our country with regard to internationalactivities to combat terrorism:In the present situation  the role of the UnitedNations in consolidating the efforts of States inthe fight against terrorism is growing in stature.We can achieve real success in this effort onlywhen the unique capabilities of the UnitedNations are used  especially as regardseradicating the root causes that generate andsupport terrorism. We believe that the UnitedNations should be at the centre of the efforts todevelop strategies and tactics for the measures tobe taken by the international community tocombat terrorism.Having actively supported all the anti-terroristresolutions adopted by the Security Council andGeneral Assembly  and being party to the 12 UnitedNations conventions on terrorism  Belarus welcomesthe measures aimed at defining and eradicating notonly terrorism itself but also its root causes. We firmlysupport the work of the Committee established by theSecurity Council under resolution 1373 (2001)  and areready to cooperate closely with that body.Last year  during the Millennium Summit andAssembly  we called for the preservation of the UnitedNations as a unique universal international institutionuniting all the countries of the world. When we talkabout establishing the conditions necessary foreffective implementation of the goals set out in theMillennium Declaration we are talking about the futureof the Organization itself. We believe that theimplementation by the United Nations of the provisionsof the Millennium Declaration during the first yearafter the holding of the Millennium Summit is causefor a certain optimism. In that regard  I would like tounderscore that the Republic of Belarus has alreadydrafted a special governmental programme onimplementing the Millennium Declaration.The important thing that we have come to realizeis that there is an organic link between development peace and security in the context of globalization. Therecent tragic events in the United States of Americareaffirmed that interdependence. Belarus welcomes theintensive work undertaken at the United Nations in2001 in preparation for the International Conference onFinancing for Development. We are convinced that thisforum must lay the foundation for a new internationalconsensus on global economic and financial issues.Belarus believes that such a consensus should be builtwhile taking into consideration the specific interestsand needs of countries at different stages of social andeconomic development. The overall success of theforum will ultimately depend on the application of thatapproach.While addressing the most pressing social andeconomic challenges of the modern world  we must notweaken our focus on the area of international securityand disarmament. The statistics on militaryexpenditures  which have reached $800 billion per yearworldwide  are of particular concern in the presentalarming international situation. It should be noted thatour country has been pursuing a consistent policy inthe field of disarmament. We have made a significantcontribution to the consolidation and development ofinternational non-proliferation regimes for weapons ofmass destruction  including a reduction in the numberof such weapons and the elimination of existingarsenals.23Belarus has been consistently andcomprehensively fulfilling the provisions of all nucleardisarmament treaties to which our country is a party.The recent concluding inspection under the Treaty onthe Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  which was carried out in Belarus inFebruary 2001  confirmed our country's strictobservance of all the conditions envisaged in thatdocument. As a nation that voluntary relinquishedpossession of nuclear weapons and completelywithdrew them from its territory in 1996  Belarus isdetermined to advocate the necessity of providinglegally binding guarantees to non-nuclear States including the elaboration of an appropriateinternational convention to that end.The Republic of Belarus is among the States thatconsider the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to be acritical component of maintaining strategic stability.The outcome of decades of tense negotiations in thesearch for a compromise that saved the world from agrowing nuclear threat must not be dismissed. Strategicstability is a practical imperative for each and everyState without exception. Negotiations on such animportant issue should be conducted on a multilateral non-bloc basis with the participation of all interestedStates and in strict conformity with the provisions ofthe Charter.We welcome the efforts undertaken for theuniversal prohibition of chemical weapons and supportthe destruction  as soon as possible  of existing arsenalsof weapons-grade poisons  as well as the efforts toachieve the universality of the Convention on theProhibition of Chemical Weapons. This summerBelarus concluded its agreement with the Organizationfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on theprivileges and immunities of that organization.We also pursue a similarly responsible andconsistent policy with regard to reducing conventionalweapons. In strict implementation of the Treaty onConventional Armed Forces in Europe  Belarus wasamong the first of the parties to that Treaty to ratify theagreement on the adaptation of the Treaty. Ratificationby the Republic of Belarus of the Treaty on Open Skiesin 2001 is proof of our consistent policy in this field.One important dimension of our foreign policy isto make practical contributions to the strengthening ofregional stability  based on the principle ofcomprehensive and mutually beneficial cooperationwith neighbouring countries in all areas relevant tosecurity and disarmament. As part of this policy Belarus has concluded an agreement with Lithuania onmeasures for strengthening confidence andtransparency  and we are making progress towardssigning similar agreements with Ukraine and Poland.Conflict prevention remains among the mostimportant issues on the agenda of the United Nations.The events of the past year have proved that theinitiatives undertaken by the United Nations  togetherwith the active personal involvement of the Secretary-General and complemented by the work of regionalorganizations and individual United Nations MemberStates  have been an effective  and very often theonly  solution to the escalation of conflicts in variousregions of the world.This is the appropriate point to mention thesituation in Afghanistan  which is of particular concernto the international community. Developments in thatcountry and in the region as a whole run the risk ofspiraling out of control. Military force cannot resolvecomplex problems that have been building up for years.We are convinced that the complex tensions withinAfghan society can be defused only by means of abalanced domestic dialogue based on strict compliancewith the standards of international law.It is essential not to weaken the intensifyingpolitical effort to give a new impetus to the peaceprocess in the Middle East. There is no alternative tothe peaceful establishment of an independentPalestinian State through political negotiations  basedon the strict observance of Security Council resolutionsalready adopted and the decisions of other relevantinternational forums. It is regrettable that the SecurityCouncil was unable to reach consensus on a UnitedNations presence in the region at this crucial moment.We consider it extremely important that we continueour efforts to settle unresolved problems on theLebanese track  in tandem with the completewithdrawal of Israeli troops from the Golan Heights.We are also concerned about the situation inKosovo and Macedonia as the result of aggressiveseparatism and international terrorism. Here  too  webelieve that political logic must prevail over the logicof force. On the eve of the forthcoming generalelection in Kosovo  Belarus confirms its adherence tothe principle of the territorial integrity of the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia and supports the diplomatic24initiative by the Russian Federation legally to confirmthe existing national borders in the Balkans.The situation in Africa continues to remainunstable. We believe that the establishment of theAfrican Union and the further strengthening of otherAfrican regional structures  with an effective UnitedNations involvement  are important prerequisites forthe maintenance of peace and stability in thatcontinent. A comprehensive approach envisagingintegration of the political  economic and socialresources of the African States is of crucial importance.Belarus supports the immediate implementation of allthe decisions taken at the Summit of the Organizationof African Unity held in Lusaka  Zambia  in July 2001.It is important to maintain the momentum that hasbeen created in the political process leading tostatehood for East Timor and to its admission  as afully fledged member  into the world family of nations.We must encourage the active efforts beingundertaken to continue dialogue  on the basis ofequality  between North and South Korea.The Cyprus problem continues to be a pressingissue. We call for the resumption of negotiations onthis question  in accordance with the provisions of therelevant resolutions of the Security Council.The Republic of Belarus has been increasing itsparticipation in major United Nations internationallegal instruments in a number of strategically importantareas. These include the combat against organizedcrime and drug trafficking. Belarus has signed theUnited Nations Convention against TransnationalOrganized Crime and its supplementary Protocol toPrevent  Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children  as well as theProtocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land Sea  and Air.Beyond that  the Republic of Belarus has becomea party to the International Convention for theSuppression of Terrorist Bombings  the InternationalConvention for the Suppression of the Financing ofTerrorism  the Convention on the Safety of UnitedNations and Associated Personnel  the Conventionrelating to the Status of Refugees  the ProtocolAmending the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.The current session of the General Assemblyrepresents an important stage in the process ofestablishing a legal framework for Belarus to join theUnited Nations system of peacekeeping operations. On1 October 2001  the Republic of Belarus signed amemorandum of understanding with the Secretariatregarding its participation in the United NationsStandby Arrangements System. We see the recent visitof representatives of the Department of PeacekeepingOperations to Belarus to test and select Belarusiancandidates for United Nations civilian policecontingents as an important initial step in the processof implementing this memorandum.Of major importance in the MillenniumDeclaration is the promotion by Member States of theprinciples of sustainable development. It remains clear however  that implementation of the paradigm ofsustainable development in many developing countriesand in countries with economies in transition continuesto be confronted with major difficulties.In this regard  we attach particular importance topreparations for the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  to be held in Johannesburg in 2002. Weconsider the Rio + 10 Summit to be an appropriateforum for defining new approaches to the solution ofglobal problems and for developing new and effectivefinancial  institutional and legal mechanisms for theirimplementation.The current session of the General Assembly is offundamental importance to my country  since it willconsider issues relating to the cleanup of theconsequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclearpower plant. The economic  social and humanitarianramifications of this problem cannot be overestimated.Suffice it to mention here just one figure: over the pastdecade  Belarus has spent $12.5 billion on the cleanupof the Chernobyl disaster. However  the people livingin the contaminated areas have not yet been able toreturn to their normal way of life. There is a needfurther to rally international support for my country'sefforts to mitigate and minimize the aftermath of theChernobyl catastrophe.In this context  we greatly appreciate theinitiatives proposed by the Under-Secretary-Generalfor Humanitarian Affairs  Mr. Kenzo Oshima  tointensify international post-Chernobyl cooperation including shifting its focus towards assistance forsustainable development of the contaminated areas andenhancing the region's human potential. The findingsand outcome of the special United Nations assessmentmission to the three most affected States earlier this25year are expected significantly to contribute to theunderstanding of what precisely should be done in thenear future. In the course of the current session of theGeneral Assembly  a draft resolution entitledStrengthening of International Cooperation andCoordination of Efforts to Study  Mitigate andMinimize the Consequences of the Chernobyl Disasterhas jointly been submitted by the Governments ofBelarus  the Russian Federation and Ukraine. I callupon all delegations to support it.In his road map towards the implementation ofthe United Nations Millennium Declaration  ourSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  observed quiterightly thatThe international community has just emergedfrom an era of commitment. It must now enter anera of implementation. (A/56/326  para. 11)This means that the successful implementation ofthe Organization's strategy in this era of globalizationdepends on us  as United Nations Member States  andus alone. This is not only our common privilege; it isalso our common responsibility.Belarus is confident that the United Nations andthe international community are capable of mobilizingpolitical will and technological and intellectualresources for the sake of building a stable andprosperous world.For the Republic of Belarus  the tenth anniversaryof its independence coincided with the secondpresidential elections in the history of my country. Thesupport of the overwhelming majority of voters forMr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka confirmed the soundnessof the democratic foundations of the Belarusiansociety.Similarly  the foreign policy of our country willremain consistent and constructive. It will be guidedexclusively by the basic principles of the UnitedNations Charter and universally recognized norms ofinternational law  including the aspiration for theestablishment of a world order in which the interests ofall countries  big and small  developed and developing in both the North and the South  are equitably takeninto account. Cooperation with all United NationsMember States on a mutually beneficial andconstructive basis will remain the central priority forthe Republic of Belarus."

We extend the condolencesand the support of my Government to the United Statesand the Dominican Republic.That we have forged ahead with the fifty-sixthsession of the General Assembly and that politicalleaders have assembled for the general debate mark anextraordinary accomplishment  one that brings greatcredibility to the United Nations. I applaud and thankall who reside in this great city for continuing theirwork. Today  more than ever  our efforts and energiesshould focus on implementing the purposes andprinciples of our Charter and should inspire hope andconfidence in all humanity.Foreign Minister Han Seung-soo  on behalf of mydelegation  I extend congratulations to him on hiselection as President of the fifty-sixth session of theAssembly. The manner in which he has guided ourwork thus far is outstanding and worthy of ourrecognition. We wish him continued success as hepresides over this Assembly. To the Secretary-Generaland to the United Nations  we extend congratulationson being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.Before I proceed  please allow me  on behalf ofthe Belizean people  to extend to the President and thepeople of the United States of America  especially tothe people of New York City  our heartfelt condolenceson the tremendous loss suffered on 11 September.For most of us  the immediate reaction to thistragedy was one of shock and disbelief. As we joinedin mourning the loss of innocent lives  including someof our own nationals  the international communitymoved swiftly to adopt a number of resolutions here atthe United Nations. Through these actions weforcefully condemned acts of terrorism and reached outto the United States of America in solidarity  firm inour support to uphold the principles of justice and themaintenance of peace.Today  despots feast in the raging rivers ofdesperation  seeking refuge among the weak  preyingupon the vulnerabilities of the less fortunate. Thosewho are caught in the sweeping currents of poverty forced to live in a world were a dollar is a luxury  findlittle hope for a better future and are often abused bythose who manipulate them for selfish and destructivereasons. For us  securing a better future for the millions15who live in poverty continues to be our most noble ofchallenges.To meet this challenge  the United Nations mustremain true to its task as set forth in the Charter andreaffirmed just over a year ago when our heads of Stateand Government gathered here and adopted theMillennium Declaration. That Declaration outlinesvarious issues critical to the realization of a world withless poverty  death and despair  exhorting the values offreedom  equality  justice and tolerance. We must notallow the events of 11 September to cause us to loseour focus on this righteous undertaking — we muststay the course.For Belize  the path to fulfilling the goals of theMillennium Declaration begins with addressing theissues of development and poverty eradication. Weconfirm our support for the Agenda for Development.As a small State working to provide greateropportunities for its people  especially those who livein poverty  meaningful sustainable development iscritical and can be achieved only through partnershipwith the international community. Regional and globalcooperation are fundamental components for progressand necessitate a universal acceptance of our sharedresponsibility to create opportunities for growth anddevelopment. Please allow me to say a few words inSpanish.(spoke in Spanish)Globalization amply demonstrates ourinterdependence and the importance of cooperationwith the rest of the world based on the principle ofmutual respect. Genuine sustainable developmentrequires inclusive and transparent trading practices thatallow for the participation of developing countries inthe global economy. The geographical location ofBelize enables us to participate in the CaribbeanCommunity and the Central American IntegrationSystem  which gives us the opportunity to offerdifferent perspectives in the fight against poverty. Atthe same time  it increases our possibilities for greaterparticipation in all entities concerned with developinginnovative mechanisms to efficiently integrate oureconomies into the global economic system. In thisrespect  we consider that equitable and participatorycooperation in which our concerns and vulnerabilitieswill receive the attention they deserve is fundamental.(spoke in English)The twenty-sixth special session of the GeneralAssembly on HIV/AIDS  held last June  brought theinternational community together to collectively affirmthe urgent need for critical action on the part of allstakeholders to combat this pandemic. For us in theCaribbean  the Conference was of special importance.Ranked the second highest region in rate of HIV/AIDSinfection after sub-Saharan Africa  Caribbean Statesare working with their international partners to combatthe spread of this deadly disease. Any progress madeduring the HIV/AIDS special session must beattributed to the collaborative spirit displayed by allthose involved  at both the political and technicallevels. The inclusion of civil society  as well as theprivate sector  contributed to the effectiveness of theconference and remains critical to the success of anyprogramme to eradicate HIV/AIDS. We welcome thedecision of the Secretary-General to reach out to theentire world community to assist in the establishmentof the Global HIV/AIDS and Health Fund  in an effortto help alleviate the suffering of the millions of peopleafflicted by the scourge.The protection and preservation of ourenvironment is a major concern to the developingworld  as so many of us depend on our naturalresources for our survival. The commitments made bythe international community for the protection of theenvironment have not been implemented  and if theyare not addressed urgently  the consequences willimpact negatively our small dependent economies  aswell as the economy of the global community. Weattach great importance to the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change andwelcome the successful results of the recentlyconcluded meeting in Marrakech  hoping to see moreStates ratify the Kyoto Protocol.In the Central America and the Caribbean regionswe perpetually suffer from the effects of naturaldisasters  with the number and intensity of hurricanesincreasing over the last decade. This has beenattributed to the effects of climate change caused byglobal warming. For two consecutive years  Belize hasbeen struck by category-four hurricanes  magnifyingthe need to protect our environment and minimize ourvulnerabilities. It is imperative that we gear our effortstowards creating the necessary mechanisms to reverseand curtail negative actions that contribute to thedeterioration of the state of our environment. For this16reason  Belize  along with its partners in the Caribbeanregion  continues to seek the support of the UnitedNations for a special regime for the Caribbean Sea.If we are to speak of shared responsibility fordevelopment and the maintenance of peace andsecurity  this year especially we must ensure thateveryone be allowed to participate in this global forum.In this light  we continue to appeal to this Organizationto consider the right of the 23 million people of theRepublic of China on Taiwan and allow their voices tobe heard in this world institution. Equally  we mustcontinue to advocate recognition of the Palestinianpeople’s right to self-determination  including the rightto their independent State.With respect to our commitment to thedevelopment of peace and security  Belize is pleased toreport the continuation of dialogue with our neighbour the Republic of Guatemala. We continue to support allefforts to peacefully resolve our differences.This year has been designated the United NationsYear of Dialogue among Civilizations. The recentlyconcluded debate on this agenda item producedmeaningful discussion on the advantages of diversityand its benefits to human progress. Enhanced byglobalization  our actions impact others immediately creating new realities that require more openness andgreater sensitivity to the differences among us. In ourcountry  where seven languages or dialects are spokenand diverse ethnic populations live together peacefully my delegation welcomes the prospect of increaseddialogue among civilizations  one inclusive of allpeoples  that will improve upon the understanding ofwho we are and where we came from. The Secretary-General  in his report on the United Nations Year ofDialogue among Civilizations  noted the importance ofensuring that the process of globalization becomprehensive and fair. Let us grasp the opportunitygiven to us through this process to work together asequal partners in this global community  seeking tounderstand our common objectives while respectingour differences.The Millennium Declaration recognizes theexisting inequalities in our world. Likewise  it offers acomprehensive formula for greater prosperity for all. Itdirects us towards a collective responsibility throughgreater partnership among the countries of the world.At this time  when we are faced with new globalrealities  let us make this Declaration meaningful byaccelerating our efforts to achieve the just objectives oflasting peace and prosperity for all of our peoples."
"23",919,"BOL",56,2001,"﻿Icome from the city of La Paz to add Bolivia’s voice tothis universal support the United Nations has receivedthrough the Nobel Peace Prize. This award expressesbetter than all the speeches could possibly do the wayin which the world appreciates the Organization and itsSecretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan. The mediating roleperformed by the Organization  its calls to nations toagree among themselves  the courage it has inassuming risks and the willingness it has shown tooffer lives for a cause go beyond the mere performanceof a duty; they are an example to all our Governments.The active role played by the Organization is morenecessary now than ever before.This is a time in which the evil  malignantshadow of terror is rising on the horizon as the newcentury dawns. The Berlin Wall was the symbol ofideological divisions during the second half of thetwentieth century. We must now  after 11 September tear down the wall of terrorism and intolerance that afew people wish to raise to divide the world.On one side of this new wall are those of us whohave built up and believe in democracy with pluralism.On the other side are those that wish despotically toimpose their beliefs  with no respect for the rule of law.On one side of this new wall are those of us whopermit and encourage the freedom of worship andexpression. On the other side are those that do notpractice  permit or tolerate it. On one side of this wallare those of us who every day try to create equality ofopportunities for all women. On the other side arethose that oppress and dominate them. On one side ofthis wall are those of us who value freedom above all.On the other side are the terrorists that wish to destroyand restrict it.Let there be no doubt that Bolivia will always beon the side of democracy  freedom and tolerance. Wewant a life in peace and harmony. This is why myGovernment  without any hesitation  with totalconviction and in all forums  has expressed its fullsupport for the measures undertaken by the coalitionled by the United States Government after the attacksthat took the lives of thousands of innocent people  themajority of whom were in this very city of New York.Terrorism is to a large extent incubated in and fedby the underground world of drug trafficking. We mustnot accept that in attacking freedom  terrorismdisguises itself by putting forward political claims. Wecannot accept that drug traffickers  seeking toundermine our democracies  drape themselves in themantle of legitimate social demands. It is clear thatterrorism and drug trafficking are Siamese twins andenemies of the free democracies. This is why we mustcombat each of them with the same vigour anddetermination.Bolivia  with all its limitations  is performing itstask in fighting drug trafficking. By the will of themajority of the Bolivians  expressed through our ownnational dialogue  guided by our own interests andencouraged by our own public opinion  we areirreversibly moving forward towards eradicating illegalcoca crops used to prepare cocaine and are entering13into the final stage of the Dignity Plan  whose purposeis to remove Bolivia from the drug circuit.But the work is not finished. Internationalsolidarity and support are now more important thanever before. To complete the task  Bolivia needssupport on two levels. First of all  the internationalcommunity must realize that sustained support foralternative development programmes is more necessaryfor the countries that have eliminated the bulk of illegalcoca crops and cocaine  and in which many peoplehave been displaced as a result.Bolivia has reduced more than 90 percent of itsillegal coca leaf production. However obvious it mayseem  this percentage must be repeated over and over because many international bureaucracies allocateresources according to the size of the problem  which ismistakenly defined as the volume of production of cocaleaves and cocaine  when the real economic problemarises from the size of the reduction that has beenachieved and the proportional reduction of the incomegenerated by this activity. Bolivia deserves and needsmore support than ever before  because it has mademore progress than ever before.Secondly  and of more relevance now  it isnecessary to provide access to markets; the opportunityto fight for a place under the sun; and the right to work produce and sell. And here  at this point  the decisionby the United States and the European Union to openup their markets to the products of alternativedevelopment takes on critical and definitivesignificance.Bolivia is the least developed nation of SouthAmerica  the economy that is most open the region andthe only country that has achieved such a dramaticreduction in such a poisonous and harmful product ascocaine  within so short a time. For these three reasons we feel that we have every right to call for access tomarkets through free trade — triply free trade: freefrom tariffs  free from subsidies and free from non-tariff measures.We need free trade  the triply free trade thatapplies to sectors such as telecommunications banking  computers and turbines  must also apply toagriculture  textiles and leather. Unfortunately  theselast three labour-intensive sectors are governed bynineteenth-century rules in the midst of the thirdmillennium.In Bolivia we are moving forward withdecentralized and participatory programmes on healthand education. An educated and vaccinated citizen whodoes not have a market  however  is not a full-fledgedcitizen of the present-day world of ours. In Bolivia wehave straightened out and opened up our economy  butwe have not seen full reciprocity in the developedworld or on the part of our neighbours.In Bolivia we have almost entirely eliminated theproduction of cocaine  which however harmful it mightbe  was an export product that was not subject tosubsidies  barriers or tariffs. This is why we requireaccess to markets to guarantee the completion of theDignity Plan and avoid frustrating the will of ourcitizens  who have assumed the challenge of movingfrom illegal activities to legitimate work  without however  having achieved the same access to themarket.On the threshold of the twenty-first century  inthe midst of a severe economic and political crisis thataffects all the countries of the region  Bolivia is facinganother challenge that can decisively change its future.In the few years since the work on the most importantgas pipeline of South America was completed Bolivia’s natural gas reserves grew exponentially  andhave made my country a significant player in thehemisphere-wide market. We are now serving agrowing part of the energy demands of Brazil  and wefirmly intend to go on from here to reach the marketsof the Pacific  Mexico and the United States.The tragic events of 11 September saw to it thatenergy and gas integration must be based on a long-term vision that takes into account three elements:extensive gas reserves  a reliable economy and a soliddemocracy. Bolivia has these three elements. Theprojects that are now being studied and negotiated willtransform the productive structure of my country propel the growth rates  reinforce our role as a hub andthe environmentally clean heart of the continent  whileexpanding our role and presence on the Pacific.Bolivia will thus take another step on the marchthat it began more than 120 years ago to return to thesea of our ancestors.Bolivia thus will reassert its unflinchingdetermination to regain its status as a maritime nation something with which we were born into independentlife.14Bolivia supports the struggle against terrorismand for freedom. My country  more than any othercountry  is making a gigantic effort to fight the ally ofterrorism — that is  drug trafficking. Given this effort given our determination to be open  and given the needto fight poverty  my country calls for access to markets.Bolivia will play a central role in workingtowards reliable gas and energy integration in thetwenty-first century.Finally  we realize that the long struggle forfreedom and the fight against terrorism is justbeginning and will end only when all the citizens of theworld  men and women alike  will be entitled to vote to elect  to offer their opinions and to profess theirfaith  to move about freely and  above all  to live freefrom fear and terror. The United Nations must be theplace where the world comes together to walk downthis shared path. And together we will build this roadtowards integration and peace  as these times demand."
"24",966,"BRA",56,2001,"﻿I greet you Mr. President  and pay tribute to the Republic of Korea which offers the world an example of dedication to thecause of peace and development.I reaffirm my admiration for Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan  who  together with the United Nations was rightfully honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize.More than ever  we need his clear vision and couragein seeking to build a peaceful and democraticinternational order that is based on solidarity. Onlyfanatics fail to acknowledge the great missionundertaken by the United Nations and by Kofi Annan.In a tradition that extends back to the beginningsof this Organization  the month of September in NewYork is dedicated to a celebration of dialogue: theopening of the general debate of this GeneralAssembly. It was not so this year. In New York as wellas in Washington  the month of September was markedby the very denial of this dialogue and understandingbetween peoples: the senseless violence resulting froman odious and treacherous attack against the UnitedStates of America and against all peace- and freedom-loving peoples.It was an infamous act of aggression against acity that  perhaps more than any other  is a symbol ofcosmopolitanism; a city that has welcomed immigrantsfrom all parts  such as the Dutch Jews of Portugueseancestry who  in the seventeenth century  left Brazil forwhat was then New Amsterdam.New York has grown  prospered and reachedmaturity guided by pluralistic values. It became great and was admired  not only because of its Jewish andAnglo-Saxon heritage  but also because of its Arab Latin  African  Caribbean and Asian presence. Theattacks of 11 September 2001 were an act of aggressionagainst all of those traditions — an act of aggressionagainst humanity.As the first head of State to speak in the generaldebate at this session of the General Assembly  I wishto be very clear. As I had occasion to say on the verymorning of those horrendous attacks  and as I have saidduring my conversations with President George W.Bush  Brazil extends its full solidarity and support tothe people of the United States in its response toterrorism.To our understanding  the American hemisphereas a whole was attacked. That is why we suggestedconvening the consultative organ of the Inter-AmericanTreaty of Reciprocal Assistance. Terrorism negates allthat the United Nations stands for. It destroys the veryprinciples of civilized behaviour. It fosters fear  andthreatens the security and peace of all countries.The victims of any act of terrorism will not beforgotten; nor will the perpetrators of such acts gounpunished  whether they are individuals  groups or theStates that give them support. The march of folly willbe vigorously resisted by the solid alliance of all freepeoples.The Charter of the United Nations acknowledgesthe right of Member States to act in self-defence. Thatis not in doubt. But let us keep in mind that the struggleagainst terrorism cannot rely exclusively on the5effectiveness of self-defence measures or on the use ofmilitary force by individual countries.In 1945  the United Nations committed itself tothe task of laying the foundations for peace and theprotection of future generations against the scourge ofwar. War always takes a heavy human toll — a cost inlives cut short and lives overtaken by fear and flight.That underscores the responsibility of terrorists forwhat is happening today. Brazil hopes that notwithstanding these circumstances  humanitarianassistance efforts in Afghanistan will not be frustrated.Furthermore  we will  to the best of our abilities welcome refugees wishing to settle in our country.Certain things may be obvious  but they warrantrepeating. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan said  thestruggle against terrorism is not  and must neverbecome  a clash between civilizations  much lessbetween religions. Not one of the civilizations thathave enriched and humanized our planet has notknown  within its own historical experience  episodesof violence and terror.Around the world  problems related to crime drug abuse  drug-trafficking and money-laundering areevils related to terrorism that must be eradicated. Fromthis rostrum  I would like to call for a worldwide publicawareness campaign to make drug users in all countriesrealize that they are helping — even if inadvertently —to finance terrorism.If we are to stem the flow of resources to theterrorist networks spreading death and destruction  it iscrucial that drug use in our societies be drasticallycurtailed. Furthermore  we must not allow differencesin national tax regimes in various countries to be usedas an instrument to foster capital flight  to thedetriment of economic development  or to help financeorganized crime  including terrorist actions. If theexistence of tax havens is inseparable from theseproblems  then tax havens should not exist. We mustput an end to such safe harbours for corruption andterror  with regard to which some Governments have to date  been complacent.It is only natural that  since 11 September  issuesof international security should have been given highpriority. Yet terrorism must not be allowed to stifle thedebate on cooperation and other issues of globalinterest. The road to the future requires the forces ofglobalization to be harnessed in the pursuit of lastingpeace — a peace sustained not by fear  but rather bythe willing acceptance by all countries of a justinternational order.On this theme  I have sought to mobilizenumerous world leaders. Brazil wishes to do its part toensure that the world does not squander theopportunities that are contained in the present crisis.Let us focus on our fundamental imperative ofpromoting development. The process of globalizationis tainted by an undeniable sense of unease. I am notreferring to the ideological disquiet of those whooppose globalization on principle or who reject thevery notion of universal values which inspire freedomand the respect for human rights. Rather  I have inmind the fact that globalization has not lived up to itspromises. There is a governance deficit in theinternational sphere  and it results from a democraticdeficit. Globalization will be sustainable only ifenriched by a sense of justice. Our aim should be“globalization in solidarity”  rather than theasymmetrical globalization of today.In the field of trade  it is high time thatmultilateral negotiations were translated into greateraccess for goods from developing countries to the moreprosperous markets. The ministers meeting in Dohahave a heavy responsibility: to ensure that the newround of multilateral trade negotiations is adevelopment round. To this end  it is crucial forpriority to be given to those issues most conducive tothe dismantling of protectionist practices and barriersin developed countries.Brazil has taken the lead in negotiations to ensuregreater market access and better humanitarianconditions in the fight against disease. We will seek tostrike a balance between the requirements of patentrights and the imperative of providing care to thosemost in need. We favour market practices and theprotection of intellectual property  but not at the cost ofhuman lives. This is a point that must be carefullydefined: life must prevail over material interests.The Bretton Woods institutions must be revampedif they are to respond to the challenges of the twenty-first century. The International Monetary Fund must beallotted greater resources so as to allow it to functionas a lender of last resort. The World Bank and regionalbanks must be given a more active part in fosteringeconomic growth and development.The volatility of international capital flows mustbe contained and the financial system made more6predictable and less crisis-prone  as proposed by theG-20.Similarly  although measures such as the Tobintax present practical difficulties  it should be possibleto look into better and less compulsory alternatives. Isubmit that these issues should be given specialattention at the United Nations InternationalConference on Financing for Development  to be heldnext year in Monterrey.We must also envisage practical forms ofcooperation to alleviate the tragedy of AIDS  above allin Africa. How long will the world remain indifferentto the plight of those who might yet be saved fromdisease  deprivation and exclusion?The twentieth century came to an end amid agrowing sense of global citizenship and universallyshared values. Brazil is determined to forge ahead inthis direction.The International Criminal Court will be ahistoric victory for the cause of human rights. Theprotection of the environment and sustainabledevelopment are equally pressing challenges of ourtime. The process of climate change has beenscientifically ascertained as a fact  but it is notunstoppable. What the future holds depends on whatwe do today  in particular as concerns the KyotoProtocol.(spoke in English)I have just been informed of the successfuloutcome of the Marrakesh meeting. Brazil warmlywelcomes this development  which is a fundamentalstep towards controlling  and eventually reversing  thewarming of the atmosphere. I will submit to theCongress a proposal for the prompt ratification of theKyoto Protocol.(spoke in Portuguese)Recent events in this city and elsewhere haveclearly demonstrated the grave threat posed byweapons of mass destruction. No matter the nature ofthe menace — be it bacteriological  such as anthrax;chemical; or nuclear — there is no alternative todisarmament and non-proliferation.It is an ethical imperative that science andtechnology must not be turned into a weapon in thehands of the irresponsible. This requires the active andlegitimate involvement of the United Nations in thecontrol  destruction and eradication of these arsenals.Just as it supported the creation of the State ofIsrael  Brazil today calls for concrete measures towardsthe setting up of a Palestinian state that is democratic united and economically viable.The right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and respect for the existence of Israel asa sovereign  free and secure State are essential if theMiddle East is to rebuild its future in peace.This is a moral debt owed by the United Nations.It is a task that must not be postponed.It is equally urgent that a lasting solution befound to the conflict in Angola  which deserves theopportunity to get back on the road to development.This is the same future that Brazil wishes for EastTimor  which we hope will soon take its rightful placein the Assembly as a sovereign state.A strong and flexible United Nations is requiredif the world is to respond to increasingly complexproblems. The United Nations will only bestrengthened if the General Assembly becomes moreactive and more respected  and if the Security Councilbecomes more representative. Its composition shouldno longer be a reflection of arrangements among thevictors of a conflict that took place over 50 years ago and for whose triumph Brazilian soldiers gave theirblood in the glorious campaigns in Italy.Brazil joins those who appeal for moredemocracy in international relations in calling for theenlargement of the Security Council. Common senserequires the inclusion  in the category of permanentmembers  of those developing countries with thenecessary credentials to exercise the responsibilitiesthat today’s world imposes upon them.By the same token  Brazil believes that anenlargement of the G-7/G-8 is called for in view of thetransformations the world is presently undergoing. It isno longer admissible to restrict to such a limited groupof countries the discussion of issues pertaining toglobalization and its inevitable impact on the politicaland economic life of emerging countries.An international order that is more just and basedon solidarity will come about only through a concertedeffort on the part of the community of nations. This is7too precious a goal to be left to the vagaries of marketforces or to the whims of power politics.We do not aspire to a world government  but wecannot sidestep the obligation to ensure thatinternational relations are not left rudderless  butreflect the legitimate aspirations of the majority. Thenefarious shadow of terrorism points to what can beexpected if we do not enhance mutual understandingamong peoples.This Organization was created under the sign ofdialogue — a dialogue among sovereign States that arefree nations  whose peoples actively participate innational decision-making.With their help  we can ensure that the twenty-first century will not be a time of fear  but rather of theflourishing of a freer humanity  at peace with itself  andrationally oriented towards the building of aninternational order that is acceptable to all peoples andthat provides a guiding framework for States at theglobal level.This is the challenge of the twenty-first century.Let us face it inspired by the grand vision of thefounding fathers of this Organization  who dreamed ofa pluralistic world  founded on peace  solidarity tolerance and reason  which is the ultimate source ofthe rule of law."
"25",1010,"BRB",56,2001,"﻿I join with otherdelegations in congratulating Mr. Han Seung-soo on hiselection to chair the proceedings of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-sixth session. I also take thisopportunity to express my deep satisfaction at theaward of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize to the UnitedNations and to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. It is awell-deserved vote of confidence in the Secretary-General’s leadership as well as recognition of thepivotal role being played by the United Nations in anera of immense challenge for the internationalcommunity during these early years of the twenty-firstcentury. We are greatly reassured that his firm guidancewill continue for a further term to shape the directionof the Organization.At this time of renewed sadness for the people ofNew York and of the Dominican Republic  may I alsooffer my deepest condolences to the families andfriends of those who lost their lives in Monday’s tragiccrash of American Airlines flight 587.For all of us  this year’s journey to New York toaddress the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth sessionstands in stark contrast to the comfortable annualroutine we have grown to appreciate. We come insteadto a city behind barricades  a people traumatized andbewildered  a mood of foreboding and uncertainty onthe streets and in these corridors. The horror ofterrorism — one that has scarred innocent lives fordecades in the Middle East  in Northern Ireland andother parts of Europe  in Asia  in Africa and in LatinAmerica — has now landed on these shores with a furyand intensity that few of us would have thoughtpossible.The Government of Barbados has been explicitand unequivocal in its condemnation of the terroristattacks of 11 September and has pledged to cooperatefully with the international community in the sustainedeffort to respond to this global threat. No cause orgrievance can ever justify the use of violence as ameans of settling disputes or legitimize the taking ofinnocent lives. The use of terrorism is incompatiblewith the ideals of the United Nations and cannot beallowed to prevail.Barbados shares America’s grief  for we have lostfive proud and hard-working citizens to this senselesscarnage. We share America’s bewilderment anddisbelief  for our citizens  too  have experienced thatsense of violation and loss of innocence that comeswith an unprecedented terrorist strike. Twenty-fiveyears ago  on 6 October 1976  the unthinkablehappened to Barbados with the terrorist downing of aCubana Airlines flight just outside our territorialwaters. Although the masterminds of that attack wereidentified and apprehended  they were never punishedfor their crime  but were instead encouraged to remainactively engaged in their campaign of terror. We shareAmerica’s sense of outrage and determination to bringthe perpetrators of the 11 September attacks to justice.We must also insist that there be zero tolerance forterrorism  whatever its source or ideology.Terrorism is a global problem which requires aglobal solution. For many years  the United Nationshas recognized the threat which terrorism poses to thepromotion and maintenance of world peace. Since1963  when this Organization adopted its first anti-terrorism convention  some 12 related conventionshave been approved by the international community.Barbados is a party to seven of these instruments.Earlier this week  I had the honour of signing theInternational Convention for the Suppression ofTerrorist Financing. Our Government is activelyreviewing the remaining conventions and theiradministrative and legislative implications with a viewto providing for early adherence.Barbados is committed to taking all necessarymeasures to minimize the risk of terrorist acts beingperpetrated or financed in or from its national territory.A thorough review of security has been undertaken atour airport and seaport  and our authorities have takenimmediate action to ensure compliance with theenhanced International Civil Aviation Organization andFederal Aviation Administration guidelines issued after11 September. We have also taken legislative action tofurther strengthen our already well-regulated financialservices regime through amendments to the MoneyLaundering (Prevention and Control) Act and theMutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act. Within theCaribbean Community we have agreed to increasecooperation in intelligence-gathering  analysis anddissemination among our security and enforcementpersonnel. We expect shortly to be in a position toreport in detail to the Security Council on measurestaken in compliance with the terms of resolution 1373(2001).Just as we agree that terrorism is a globalphenomenon to which no country can consider itself13immune  so too must we understand that it is a complexproblem necessitating a multidimensional response. Asthe Secretary-General has so aptly put it in the 44thmeeting  in his opening statement of the generaldebate:“We face two possible futures: a mutuallydestructive clash between so-called civilizationsbased on the exaggeration of religious andcultural differences  or a global community respecting diversity and rooted in universalvalues. The latter must be our choice  but we canachieve it only if we bring real hope to thebillions now trapped in poverty  conflict anddisease.”We must all accept that the struggle againstterrorism can never hope to succeed if it is viewedsimply as a military campaign to strike at the powerbase of the latest practitioners of terror. It must alsoseek to find effective and lasting solutions to theproblems of underdevelopment  poverty anddeprivation  inequality  intolerance and injustice thatmarginalize so large a percentage of the world’spopulation. For it is from these conditions ofhopelessness and despair that spring new converts tothe cause of terrorism.The events of 11 September and the extent towhich they have had an impact on the economicfortunes of all of our countries have shown us the otherface of globalization: the reality of our growingeconomic interdependence. Now more than ever  thereis a need to recognize the value of multilateralism andthe pre-eminent role of the United Nations in thesearch for lasting solutions to the challenges that willconfront us in the early years of the twenty-firstcentury. The importance of giving priority to arevitalized development agenda cannot be overstated.In this regard  Barbados looks to the InternationalConference on Financing for Development as aconstructive forum for refocusing the dialogue oneffective mechanisms for the implementation of thestalled development agenda. We agree there is need toreform the international economic and financialarchitecture to meet the current developmentchallenges. We are pleased that international taxcooperation will be one of the issues discussed at theConference.Many developing countries  including Barbados were encouraged to diversify into the financial servicessector as a viable development alternative and nowderive a significant proportion of their national revenuefrom that source. We therefore continue to insist on theneed for universal participation in decisions that affectthe operation of this sector.Barbados is far advanced in the implementationof its national commitments under Agenda 21. Webelieve that the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment presents an important opportunity tobuild a new and expanded relationship with ourdevelopment partners for the full implementation ofcommitments already undertaken at Rio. Johannesburgshould not merely review the status of progress of Rio but should also outline strategies for dealing decisivelywith the sustainable development challenges that haveemerged since 1992. For all small island developingStates  follow-up of the Barbados Programme ofAction will form an integral part of this process.Naturally  the Caribbean Basin countries willcontinue their efforts to create a special regime for theCaribbean Sea with the ultimate goal of achieving itsrecognition as a special area in the context ofsustainable development.It is no secret that the efforts towards the creationof a new international trading system have resulted inbitter disappointment for the majority of developingcountries  which have been severely disadvantaged bythe imbalance of rights  obligations  benefits andconcessions agreed at Uruguay  and by the failure ofSeattle to address that imbalance. We hope that theDoha decision to launch a new round will lead to ameaningful resolution of these critical developingcountry concerns. We are convinced that sustainedeconomic and social progress for the developing worldwill be achievable only within the framework of a fair equitable and inclusive trading arrangement that givesdue recognition to the differences in size and level ofdevelopment of Member States.We welcome the agreement on drug patents which represents a major victory for the efforts ofdeveloping countries to respond to their priority publichealth needs and is of great significance in the fightagainst HIV/AIDS.The impact of the 11 September events on theCaribbean has been immediate and severe. Theeconomic repercussions have served to emphasize theextreme fragility and vulnerability of our small Statesin the international economy. The countries of the14Caribbean Community  whose economies are heavilydependent on tourism and financial services  havejoined forces to coordinate a regional emergencyresponse and recovery strategy to mitigate the effectsof the crisis.It is clear  however  that responses at the nationaland regional levels alone will be inadequate to dealwith the magnitude of this unprecedented situation. Inthe words of the Prime Minister of Barbados  the RightHonourable Owen Arthur:“the international financial community hastraditionally required developing countries to relyheavily on policy responses to deal witheconomic crisis. But the situation that we face hasnot been caused by policy failure  recklessness orfinancial excesses by developing countries.“Policy responses without the commitmentof real financial resources will therefore notsuffice. Barbados therefore stands ready tosupport a well-conceived response from theinternational financial community to the crisis athand.”It is the mission of the United Nations to promotethe peaceful coexistence and the political  social andeconomic welfare of the world’s peoples. It is in thiscontext that we must recognize the significance of theWorld Conference against Racism  RacialDiscrimination  Xenophobia and Related Intoleranceand renew our confidence in the capacity ofmultilateral organizations to resolve differences andpromote a sense of shared values. This Conferencepresented a unique opportunity for countries to take aproactive approach in defusing both historic andcontemporary conflicts and in coming to terms with theinjustices of the past and creating new understandingsfor the future.We regret that in many respects the Conferencedid not get the serious high-level attention it deservedand that the treatment of its fundamental issues wasless wide-ranging and definitive than we would havewished. In the words of Professor Hilary Beckles  ofthe Barbados delegation:“The crisis of modernity that finds expression inspiralling racial hatred  xenophobia and relatedintolerance is not the sole burden of any one partof the global community  even though the victimsof the crimes of which I speak continue to feel inthe course of everyday life the kind of pain andanguish not easily imagined by others.”The citizens of the Caribbean are a transplantedpeople  who have forged from the crucible of slavery colonialism and economic exploitation a vibrant pluralistic  multiracial society built on tolerance andrespect for ethnic  religious and cultural diversity. Inthese difficult times  we believe that there is much thatcan be learned from our experiences and much that canbe done to promote the culture of peace andunderstanding  especially among the youth. In thisregard  Barbados attaches importance to the earlyconvening of the General Assembly special session onchildren and to a rededication of efforts to achieve theinternational development targets already set.We would do well to remember that  in the wordsof the Secretary-General  “none of the issues that facedus on 10 September has become less urgent”. Indeed  itwould be an unfortunate irony if the global response toterrorism were conducted in such a manner — throughthe massive redeployment of resources from otherpriorities  such as the fight against narcoticstrafficking  extreme poverty  disease and environmentaldegradation — as to further exacerbate the economic political and cultural instabilities which are the primarybreeding ground for terrorism.Small countries like my own are not part of theproblem  but we are nevertheless required to be part ofthe solution  in circumstances that place adisproportionate burden on our financial  human andadministrative resources  which had already beenstruggling to respond to the global economic recession.Barbados remains fully committed to the UnitedNations system and to the values it seeks to promote.We are keenly aware of the important work the UnitedNations continues to carry out in the eastern Caribbean.We are pleased to provide tangible support for thatwork through the provision of purpose-builtheadquarters to house the seven agencies whosesubregional offices are located in Bridgetown. We willcontinue to work closely with the agencies indeveloping a model partnership for eastern Caribbeandevelopment.In this context  we welcome the support of theUnited Nations Development Programme  inpartnership with the International Monetary Fund andthe Government of Canada  for the CaribbeanTechnical Assistance Centre  which was inaugurated15last week in Barbados. We look forward to similarlevels of United Nations cooperation for otherimportant programmes  in particular that of the UnitedNations International Drug Control Programme(UNDCP)  whose work is providing critical support tothe region in an extremely volatile internationaleconomic and security environment.Two years ago  the Prime Minister of Barbadosemphasized that we were leaving the twentieth centuryand entering the twenty-first conscious of the dangers but excited by the prospects. Recent events must not beallowed to dampen our optimism. We must remain firmin the hope that humanity possesses the fortitude anddetermination to triumph in the face of extremeadversity  and that respect for diversity  human dignityand the sanctity of human life will prevail.We are not expected to complete this task  butneither are we at liberty to abstain from it."
"26",1042,"BRN",56,2001,"﻿On behalf ofHis Majesty’s Government  I should like to expressonce again my warmest congratulations to thePresident on his election and our appreciation to hispredecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland  President ofthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I wouldalso like to congratulate the Secretary-General on hisre-election. We are extremely pleased that he iscontinuing to serve the United Nations. The award ofthis year’s Nobel Peace Prize is a fine tribute to hiswork and to the United Nations agencies and workersin the field  who have served us all with suchdedication to the principles of the Charter.Sadly  of course  this comes at a time when theirwork is perhaps more crucial than ever before. Theatrocities committed in the United States on 11September have rightly received the absolutecondemnation of all civilized people. There is nojustification for terrorism. As we have stated bothindividually and in our regional associations  BruneiDarussalam will continue to do all it can to workclosely with the United States and all members of theSecurity Council to play its part in overcoming thedirect challenge that terrorism poses to the properconduct of international affairs.The existence of terrorism is  however  a grimreminder that the United Nations agenda  set over thelast half of the twentieth century  has yet to becompleted. There are many unwelcome legacies fromthe past 50 years. Though none justify acts of terror many offer justification for deep resentment andprofound despair. Perhaps the most apparent of all atthis time is the situation in Palestine  where the justiceimplicit in the Security Council’s resolutions onPalestine is still denied to what is now a thirdgeneration of Palestinians. In this respect  we welcomethe recognition given by many world leaders  includingthe President of the United States and the PrimeMinister of the United Kingdom  to the principle of aPalestinian State. Brunei Darussalam hopes that allconcerned and interested parties involved in the MiddleEast peace process will act with urgency in order tobring this about.As we all know  dispelling feelings of pastinjustice is an extremely difficult task. In essence  webelieve it must involve new approaches to security. Webelieve all members of all regional associations have acrucial role in this. Brunei Darussalam is trying to dothis through the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN) Regional Forum in an approach thathas been taking shape over nearly a decade now. Thisinvolves all the nations of South-East Asia and ourpartners in North America  East Asia  Europe andOceania. We seek common understandings throughconsultation and various confidence-building measures.Members have recognized the complex nature ofmodern conflict. They have accepted that its roots areoften deep and intricately entwined. As elsewhere inthe world  it can be the result of long-standingterritorial claims  centuries-old animosities andinstinctive suspicions or conflicting ideologies. Or itcan be as basic as local land disputes or simple lack ofbasic resources.Whatever the cause  however  the membersbelieve the Forum is seeing signs of success. This year for example  it has been able to move things anotherstage forward and is now looking into the verychallenging area of preventive diplomacy. In short  themembers see dialogue and consultation not as a seriesof meetings but as a process. As such  it may neverend. In fact  in the long run  the process itself mayindeed become the solution.That  we think  is the framework within which theideas expressed at the Millennium Summit can bepursued successfully. In short  we believe that the keyto security today is the capacity to think locally regionally and globally at the same time. To us thismeans that a positive  forward-looking United Nationsis crucial. It is here that all these thoughts can trulycome together. It is here that all nations can renew andstrengthen the tolerance and friendship that are the realbuilding blocks of security."
"27",1083,"BTN",56,2001,"﻿I congratulate thePresident on his assumption of the difficult role ofguiding the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session.This session is being held during one of the saddestmoments in the history of our Organization. Let meassure the President of the full support of mydelegation in the discharge of his most importantfunctions.The twenty-first century will forever beremembered for the fiery hell that engulfed the worldon that dark day of a cloudless sky on 11 September.The horrific images of passenger aircraft flying to theirdoom to cause great death  grief and despair tocountless people will always be a scar on ourindividual and collective memory. Surely  failure tobring to justice those guilty of that crime  and thosewho follow the same path  would mean our collectivesubmission to an endless reign of terror and to fearfuldarkness.It is the wish of the Government and the peopleof Bhutan that I should  once again  express oursolidarity with the Government and the people of theUnited States and convey our heartfelt sympathy tothose who have suffered the irreparable loss of theirloved and dear ones. We admire the way in which thepeople of this great nation have come together to rise tothe challenges that the tragic events have left in theirwake. We pay tribute to the brave and the selfless wholaid down their own lives as they fought to save thoseof others. Our hearts and minds are with the city ofNew York  which has not only been a gracious host tothe United Nations  but is unparalleled in its generosityin giving shelter  livelihood  hope and joy to people ofall races and creeds. Indeed  it came as no surprise thatthe scale of the tragedy made itself felt not only in thedevastatingly high number of victims  but in the factthat people from more than 80 countries were countedamong the dead.A small part of everyone died that day  forreasons that can never be explained or justified. Indeed human society has been left to ponder its claim tobeing civilized.Until the tragedy of 11 September  the threat ofterrorism was not fully appreciated. Those who had notfelt its demonic wrath tolerated it as just anothermanifestation of social or political discontent. Thecurrent environment throughout the globalized worldhas harshly and most cruelly removed suchmisconceptions. People all over the world are losingtheir freedom  willingly or without choice  in amultitude of ways. And there is a pervasive sense offear. Freedom is a heavy price to pay for anything.Civilized society ought to provide more liberty  not becowed into affording less.The disease that is the cause must be stamped out.A determined and coordinated approach by allcountries is the indispensable key. To this end  theUnited Nations must play the central role. It mustinspire  unite and act. It must be behind all individualcountry  group and global efforts. In this context  theimportant initiative taken by the Security Council inresolution 1373 (2001) is to be welcomed. However we must remember that its impact will be determinednot so much by the letter as by the spirit with which itis accepted and implemented by all Member States.For its part  Bhutan will make every effort tofulfil its duty as a Member State and a nation that isfully committed to the eradication of terrorism. Today I signed the International Convention for the32Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism  and in duecourse our legislature will clear the way for accessionto the other conventions relating to internationalterrorism.The reign of terrorists in Afghanistan is comingto an end. It is our hope that the healing of the deepand painful wounds suffered interminably by thehelpless and innocent victims will begin immediately.We also hope that  in the coming years  they will beable to find the environment of peace and security thathas eluded them for too long. Unfortunately  the periodof renewal and reconstruction at the individual community and national levels will be long andarduous for a country that has been reduced to rubbleby war and its ravaging companions. We appeal to theinternational community to give sustained support toAfghanistan in a way that is sympathetic andresponsive to its immediate and long-term needs  whilerespecting fully the dignity of its proud people.Even as we call for sustained and adequateassistance to Afghanistan  we must acknowledge thatthe world is still reeling from the aftershocks of theattacks of 11 September. The cumulative impact on aworld economy that was already following a downwardtrend has yet to be seen. There are other disturbinguncertainties. Clearly  there is a need to better defineand understand the scope and limits of the war onterrorism so that the fears of the broader clash that isbeing spoken of are calmed. How do we create aclimate that can prevent the further diversion ofresources to defence? Will the onslaught be protractedand consumptive in terms of our combined energy andresources? Amid such doubts and concerns  it is naturalthat we should worry about how the internationalcommunity might be able to deliver on the hopes thatwere raised by the Millennium Declaration a year ago.Our capacity to fight HIV/AIDS and poverty becomesquestionable  especially within the time frame we haveset for ourselves.Against such a backdrop  the growing challengewill be how to share and give in difficult times. Howdoes one give beyond the bounds of disposablesurplus? As the representative of a developing country I say this without wishing to undermine the greaterimportance of raising domestic revenues and devotingthem to meeting the targets set. In this context  thedefining moment will be offered at the InternationalConference on Financing for Development  to be heldnext year in Mexico.Now more than ever it is necessary to reform theSecurity Council. We cannot continue to procrastinateon this vital issue. The Council has to be a trulyrepresentative body if it is to be relevant  respected andeffective. That is not possible when vast continents andsignificant populations in the world are left out ofcrucial decision-making processes on internationalpeace and security. Without fair representation  theCouncil will risk emasculation — faltering on makingdecisions that are implemented feebly.The serious humanitarian  political and economicconsequences of the terrorist acts demand unity ofthought and action on the part of all nations. Terrorismmust be rooted out. Yet  as in the conduct of oureveryday life  there is a need for balance andmoderation. Just as the reasons for soul-searching anddoubt in ourselves as civilized beings are compelling  itis my earnest hope that the success of this session willbe marked by the profundity of collective wisdom andcommitment to restore lasting security  peace andnormality."
"28",1125,"BWA",56,2001,"﻿Before I deliver mystatement  please allow me to express the heartfeltcondolences of my delegation to the Governments ofthe United States of America and the DominicanRepublic and to the families of the victims of the tragicair traffic accident in New York on Monday. Duringthis time of grief and sadness  our sympathies are withthose who lost their loved ones.It is with great pleasure that I extend to thePresident and his country  the Republic of Korea  thewarmest congratulations of my delegation on hiselection to the presidency of the United NationsGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. We areconfident that under his able leadership  we will have avery productive session. The President can rest assuredof the full cooperation of the delegation of Botswana inthe discharge of the noble task entrusted to him.I should also like to pay tribute to hispredecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland. The skilfulmanner in which he guided our deliberations during thefifty-fifth session of the General Assembly speaks forhis wealth of diplomatic experience and diligence inhis work.To our Secretary-General  may I express the fullsupport and confidence of my delegation as he begins asecond term of office. We congratulate him for thehighly esteemed Nobel Peace Prize for 2001  bestowedjointly on him and the United Nations system. Thisspecial award is not only to the Secretary-General personally  but also to the many dedicated men andwomen who continue to work tirelessly for the UnitedNations system.It is regrettable that even as we are assembledhere to forge a common future within the same wallswhere just 12 months ago our leaders proclaimed thearrival of a brave new world full of hope and promise our attention should be drawn to acts of internationalterrorism not far from where we are meeting.My delegation wishes to add its voice to those ofother speakers who have condemned  in the strongestlanguage possible  the bombings that occurred in NewYork and Washington  resulting in a huge loss ofhuman life. Immediately after learning of these attacks my Government issued a statement in which wecondemned these terrorist attacks and those whoconceived and perpetrated them. A unified andconcerted effort is required from the internationalcommunity in order to wipe the scourge ofinternational terrorism from the face of the earth  onceand for all.7Among other things  we need to reaffirm ourcommitment to the full implementation of allconventions on combating terrorism. My delegation isconvinced that the international communitycollectively has the resources necessary to win the waragainst terrorism. This is a challenge of our age.The other major challenge that presentsextraordinary danger to humanity is the HIV/AIDSpandemic  whose devastating impact on our societiesand our economies  particularly in Africa  is welldocumented.According to recent estimates  of the 36.1 millionpeople living with HIV globally  25.3 million are insub-Saharan Africa. Of the 5.3 million people infectedwith the virus during 2000  3.8 million were in sub-Saharan Africa. Of the 3.0 million people who died ofHIV/AIDS in 2000  2.4 million were in sub-SaharanAfrica. These statistics present an extremely grimpicture of the HIV/AIDS situation in sub-SaharanAfrica. As delegates are no doubt aware  my country isone of the worst affected on the continent. Unless wejoin forces to tackle this pandemic  it will continue tohave a devastating impact on our societies andeconomies. Funding for the HIV/AIDS programmes isgrossly inadequate and has to be increased in order tomitigate the impact of the scourge.Indeed  the twenty-sixth special session of theUnited Nations General Assembly underscored theimperative of intensified global action to combat thepandemic. The Global HIV/AIDS and Health Fundcould not have come at a more opportune time. It is oursincere hope  therefore  that the donor community willrespond positively to the financing of the trust fund.I want to stress the need to strengthen the role ofthe United Nations in this fight. Our efforts for theprevention and treatment of the disease need to beaugmented and strengthened by concrete measures ofsupport and resources from the internationalcommunity if we are to turn the tide of the spread ofHIV/AIDS.The third issue I wish to highlight is that of“conflict diamonds” versus “development diamonds”.Botswana deplores the fact that diamond resources in anumber of countries in Africa are being plundered byrebels to purchase weapons that are used to causeenormous suffering to innocent people.However  I want to underscore the fact that“conflict diamonds” constitute only 4 per cent or lessof the world trade in diamonds. Legitimate  conflict-free diamonds  such as those produced in my country are used to generate socio-economic growth anddevelopment. I am glad that the contribution ofconflict-free diamonds to the economic growth ofcountries such as mine  and indeed of other countries inSouthern Africa  is being appreciated.We have been active participants in the KimberlyProcess  in which Governments of diamond-producingcountries of Southern Africa and other interestedGovernments  the diamond industry and civil societyorganizations are working together to institute acertification scheme designed to eliminate that smallpercentage of conflict diamonds from world trade. Wesincerely want to see the suffering inflicted upon thepeople of Angola  Sierra Leone  the DemocraticRepublic of Congo and others brought to an end.Regrettably  many more countries in ourcontinent continue to be torn apart by war and conflict.We applaud the efforts of the United Nations and otherinternational players to enhance the capacity of Africancountries to prevent conflict and maintain peace andstability in the continent. We are convinced that thedetermination of many in Africa to consolidatedemocracy will go a long way towards ensuring thatconditions of security and stability are institutedthroughout the continent. The establishment of theAfrican Union  which will be launched next year in theRepublic of South Africa  is the most positiveexpression of a new solidarity  based on an urgentsearch for collective economic security and politicalpartnership. Without underestimating the hurdles westill face as we move our continent towards integration it is our fervent belief that an era of hope has beenushered in on our continent.The most talked about undertaking by Africa inrecent weeks has been the New Partnership for Africa’sDevelopment (NEPAD)  which is aimed at achievingsocio-economic development by alleviating poverty aswell as promoting peace  security  democracy and goodgovernance. Unlike other initiatives that came beforeit  the New Partnership for Africa’s Developmentchallenges African countries to take primaryresponsibility for their own development by ushering ina political environment guaranteeing peace  securityand stability  respect for human rights  democraticprinciples and the rule of law.8The initiative underscores the need for a policyframework and  indeed  regulatory structures that willenhance governance in Africa. I must say  all of theseare achievable objectives  and we as a continent haveunreservedly committed ourselves  our Governmentsand peoples  and the required resources to theirattainment. We also believe that the initiative willusher in a new concept of technical cooperationbetween Africa and our development partners  and thatthe United Nations will have a critical role to play inits implementation.My delegation attaches importance to theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment  scheduled to be held in Mexico in thespring of 2002  and the forthcoming World Summit onSustainable Development  to be held in South Africa inSeptember 2002. These Conferences will offer us anopportunity to examine issues of development in aholistic and pragmatic manner. Issues of environment trade  domestic policy-making  internationalcooperation and partnership with the Bretton Woodsinstitutions  as well as the private sector  will have tofeature prominently at these conferences.Recent developments in Sierra Leone give ushope that peace will now be given a chance in thatcountry. The agreement between the Governmentand the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)  which willsee the latter transformed into a political party  is amajor achievement and an important step forward. TheRUF must now translate its promises into action because this is the only way that the internationalcommunity will be able to provide the much neededsupport for the holding of the envisaged nationalelections  which will provide the basis for therestoration of peace and stability in Sierra Leone.There is a real window of opportunity for peacein the Democratic Republic of the Congo. After manyyears of bloody conflict  which has inflicted immensesuffering on the people of the Congo  the politicalplayers and other stakeholders have embarked on anational dialogue that should bring peace to thecountry. I would like to underline the fact thatdedication and perseverance will be required on thepart of those concerned in order for the inter-Congolesedialogue to be crowned with success. We therefore urgethe players to see the process of negotiations through because the alternative is to slide back down into thesuffering and misery that the Congolese have enduredfor so long. I also wish to call upon the internationalcommunity to provide the necessary support andresources to the Office of the Facilitator  formerPresident Sir Ketumile Masire  to enable thefacilitation process of the inter-Congolese dialogue tosucceed.The peace process in Burundi is moving in theright direction after many years of painful war. Thedeal brokered by former President Mandela hasprovided a way out of the stalemate. The resolve of theparties to remain committed to the peace process is theonly way forward.We continue to be concerned that prospects forpeace in Angola remain distant. At the heart of theimpasse are UNITA’s continuing acts of destabilizationand sabotage. UNITA must understand that there canbe no military solution to the crisis in Angola. Wetherefore wish to appeal to UNITA to reconsider itsposition and choose the path of dialogue.My delegation is seriously concerned at therecent escalation of violence in the Middle East. It isour sincere hope that the Government of Israel and thePalestinian Authority will recognize the urgent need toresume negotiations towards a comprehensive peaceagreement. A lasting solution to this problem isessential.In conclusion  let me reaffirm my country’scommitment to the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter. We are committed to workingwith others to strengthen this Organization in order tosurmount the challenges that face us all as nations andpeoples across the globe. The United Nations is ouronly hope for a stable and prosperous world."
"29",1167,"CAF",56,2001,"﻿The delegation of the Central AfricanRepublic would like first of all to fulfil the taskentrusted to it by His Excellency Mr. Ange-FélixPatassé  President of the Republic and head of State  ofexpressing the solidarity of the Central AfricanRepublic with the American people  as well as itsresolute condemnation of the heinous acts committedagainst freedom  democracy and peace on 11September. We will certainly make our contribution tothe process of reflection that the internationalcommunity will undertake together throughout thissession to elaborate measures aimed at the eradicationof terrorism.Before proceeding  I should like warmly tocongratulate Mr. Han on his election to the presidencyof the General Assembly at this session  as well as theother members of the Bureau. His expertise ininternational affairs  together with his wisdom  willguarantee the success of our work  and the delegationof the Central African Republic would like to assurehim of its cooperation. My delegation greatlyappreciated the skilful way in which his predecessorconducted the work of the Millennium Assembly.We would also like to address  on behalf of theCentral African Republic  our warmest congratulationsto Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-election as Secretary-General. He has been honoured for his commitment tothe cause of the Organization by the award of theNobel Peace Prize  which is a tribute both to him andto the United Nations as a whole. He can continue tocount upon the cooperation of the Central AfricanRepublic in the fulfilment of his extremely difficult10mission  in the wake of last year’s adoption by MemberStates of the Millennium Declaration  whichestablishes a new framework for cooperation betweenStates.Indeed  the Millennium Declaration must beviewed as a strategy within which States should workso as to be able meet the many challenges facing theworld today  which include poverty  conflict intolerance  terrorism  debt  marginalization  endemicdisease and HIV/AIDS. These growing challenges  thepersistence of which leads to global imbalance  can bedealt with only through multilateral cooperation  aboveall in the framework of the United Nations.Such cooperation must first of all aim to eradicatethe causes of certain frustrating problems in the world by  for example  achieving a just and lasting settlementof the question of the Middle East.Likewise  my delegation urges the partiesconcerned to implement the provisions of the LusakaAgreement so that the Democratic Republic of theCongo can regain its territorial integrity and unity andestablish a lasting peace  which will be of benefit to theCentral African Republic.Furthermore  States should cooperate in supportof Africa  which is currently burdened by the weight ofnumerous challenges. The Millennium Summit rightlycommitted the international community to a campaignfor development cooperation so as to make the right todevelopment  like human rights  a reality for all.The Central African Republic  which endorsedthe Millennium Declaration  urges the countries of theNorth to establish a true partnership with Africa  atboth the public and private level  so as to support thedevelopmental efforts of the continent. This willrequire a degree of political will  since  given theconflicts that are taking place today between  and oftenwithin  States  our partners sometimes give in todespair and indifference when confronted with slowprogress  or occasionally allow themselves to beswayed by emotions incited by certain people whowish to discourage initiatives by abusivelymanipulating ideas that promote genocide and ethniccleansing — phenomena that some countries haverecently endured  but that can gain no foothold today ina country such as the Central African Republic.We often forget that the deep-seated sources ofsuch conflicts are the lack of a culture of democracy inour societies and extreme poverty. That is why ourpartners should support our efforts to achievedemocratization and contribute to consolidating thefoundations of our young democracies  above all bypaying priority attention to the economic aspect which  unfortunately  is not always the case.In the case of the Central African Republic  forexample  on 28 May last an attempted coup took placewith the aim of ending the march of democracy in thecountry. That was the fourth such attempt in the fiveyears since 1996. We would like briefly to shed somelight on those events.At its 4261st meeting  on 23 January 2001  theSecurity Council considered the situation in the CentralAfrican Republic. While noting certain shortcomings the Council recognized the efforts of the Governmentand asked it  along with representatives of all parts ofsociety in the Central African Republic  to continuedown the path towards the consolidation of democracyand the preservation of peace. To help in that task  themandate of the United Nations Peace-building SupportOffice in the Central African Republic (BONUCA) hasbeen extended because  with the assistance of others  itis doing remarkable and productive work.Despite everything  the Central African Republicis determined to continue resolutely to be a smallhaven of relative stability in a region torn apart by war as one eminent personality put it recently. The socialand political tension has  indeed  begun to diminish.Since May 2001  there has been an internationalpresence.Contrary to all expectations  the same groups thathave repeatedly subjected the people of the CentralAfrican Republic to acts of terrorism for five yearscommitted an act whose foreseeable and tragicconsequences are well known. When condemned byboth the national and international community  thosegroups rushed to hide behind claims of genocidalpractices in an attempt to justify the unjustifiable  thuscreating ethnic division in various parts of the country.This recurrence of violent crises raises questionsabout justice in our young States  which are trying toestablish the rule of law  but where amnesties aregranted in lieu of justice  allowing impunity to prevailand thus encouraging recidivism.Fortunately  the world has spoken out incondemnation of the most recent coup attempt  and we11would like to take this opportunity  from this rostrum to thank the United Nations  the European Union  theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and theCommunity of Sahel Saharan States  as well asbrotherly and friendly countries  which respondedimmediately  calling for the re-establishment ofconstitutional legality.Any coup  be it failed or successful  always givesrise to actions to undermine freedom  human rights  therights of society and national rights. The CentralAfrican Republic did not want to play that game. Thus a number of appropriate measures have been taken including the creation of a joint judicial inquirycommission; the establishment of contacts among thevarious social sectors and with the chancelleries organizations and accredited institutions in the CentralAfrican Republic at the governmental and presidentiallevels; and diplomatic activity with the countries of thesubregion and the region  which are being pursued.However  beyond the attempted coup of 28 May the entire situation in the Central African Republicmust be assessed as a whole. Just recently  havingrefused to present himself to the commission of judicialinquiry that had been established specifically todetermine the consequences of the attempted coup of28 May  the former army Chief of Staff organizedresistance that threatened to turn into a rebellion andalmost plunged the country into renewed tragedy. Therapid reaction of the Organization of African Unity  theCommunity of Sahelo-Saharan States and neighbouringbrotherly countries has certainly helped to calm thesituation for the moment.All these events  sorely trying to men of goodwill  have again highlighted the question of the marchof democracy in the Central African Republic. Thatmarch has been made even more difficult by thenation’s extreme poverty and fragility  which  becauseof enormous financial hardships  is unable to cover thecosts of sovereignty  creating a veritable breedingground of instability. The attempted coup on 28 Mayexacerbated the country’s situation by plunging it intotragic destitution.This situation has been clearly grasped by theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  which  on 2August  reminded its member States  for theirinformation and possible action  of the decision on thesituation in the Central African Republic  adopted atthe seventy-fourth ordinary session of the Council ofMinisters in Lusaka  which“Appeals to Member States and the rest ofthe international community to provide thenecessary economic and financial assistance forthe reconstruction of the Central AfricanRepublic and in particular calls on the countrieswhich have promised to provide funds at thePledging Conference in favour of the CentralAfrican Republic in New York in May 2000 tohonour their commitments.” (CM/Dec.602(LXXIV)  para. 4)The Central African Republic thanks the OAU forthat decision. We also wish here to express ourgratitude to the Security Council  which has alwaysshown great interest in the situation in our country. Wefurther wish to make special mention here of Gabon France and the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  as well as the friends of the Central AfricanRepublic represented here  for their firm involvementat the side of the Central African Republic. We hopethat they will not despair over these repeated crisesbecause  in spite of everything  we in the CentralAfrican Republic are truly determined to overcome ourproblems.We therefore hope that the United Nations willadvocate even more energetically the cause of ourcountry before the various international financialinstitutions with a view to securing greater assistancefor us  because the repercussions of the series of eventsthat began in 1996 will require significant financialresources to ensure the recovery of the country  thetotal collapse of which would have an impactthroughout our subregion  if not beyond.We are called upon at this session to consider themanner in which States should implement theMillennium Declaration through their conduct. It isonly through cooperation and solidarity that we canachieve this and thus ensure for the world thefulfilment of the objectives set out in the UnitedNations Charter. This cooperation should also allow usto find the necessary means of meeting the commonchallenge of terrorism  which is more apparent todaythan ever before."
"30",1214,"CAN",56,2001,"﻿It is indeed an honour tobe here in New York City and at the General Assembly.That we are gathered here now  just two months sincethe devastating terrorist attacks of 11 September demonstrates both the resilience of this great city andthe determination and defiance of a united globalcommunity.Having spent last Sunday — like my friend PrimeMinister Dzurinda of Slovakia — running through somany streets and communities of the five boroughs ofNew York City in the annual New York City Marathon I have witnessed personally and been quiteoverwhelmed by the deep reserves of courage evidentin this city and in all those individuals who arechoosing to take back their lives and reject the menaceof terror.Our job is to galvanize and to focus the courageof nations — to transform sentiment into commitment and commitment into action. Expressions of a commonoutrage are gratifying but they will never be enough todefeat terrorism. The ultimate success of ourcampaign — this long and extremely complexcampaign — rests upon our collective ability todemonstrate leadership  to harness political will and tosustain the commitment that we have made to eachother and to our citizens: that we will not allow crimesso vile  so immense and so shattering to the world to beunanswered or ever to be repeated.32In order to achieve these goals — and to merit thetrust and fulfil the expectations placed in the UnitedNations and its constituent Member States — wecannot go on as before. There can be no more“business as usual”. There is no more time  there is nomore patience and there are no more resources fordiplomatic gamesmanship and the stoking of dangerousself-interest. National Governments must takeresponsibility and be held accountable for their actionsand decisions — for fighting terrorism  for undertakingpolitical and legal reforms  for resolving disputes andfor establishing the conditions in which democracyflourishes and development is sustained.(spoke in French)The United Nations is now facing its greatest testever since its creation. So far  the United Nations isperforming admirably. The unity of purpose andeffective decision-making that allowed swift passage ofthe landmark Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)and the rapid convening of a special debate onterrorism provide clear evidence of what we canaccomplish together  and further underscore thereasons why this Organization and its esteemedSecretary-General  Kofi Annan  were deservedlyrecognized with the Nobel Peace Prize this year.(spoke in English)We cannot  however  afford to lose ourselves incomplacency  self-congratulation or distraction. Ourwork has only just begun.Horrific as the atrocities perpetrated on 11September were  terrorism did not begin here.Unfortunately  too many of us in this Hall know this alltoo painfully. No  it did not begin here; but we as aglobal community have the responsibility  and now arenewed opportunity  to ensure that we end it — here.The United Nations has a unique andindispensable role to play. While the campaign againstterrorism will be conducted through coalitions ofdifferent State actors  alliances and organizations  thisis where it must ultimately all come together in itspolitical  diplomatic  legal  economic  humanitarianand security dimensions. We in Canada  as long-standing proponents of multilateralism and the UnitedNations system  have strongly welcomed the closecollaboration evident between the United StatesAdministration and the United Nations over these lasttwo months.In Canada  the campaign against terrorism including the obligations we have undertaken here atthe United Nations  is our highest priority. Our country which shares with the United States the longestunmilitarized border in the world and the closest  mostextensive and most profitable bilateral relationshipanywhere  has been deeply affected by this crisis.Canadians  like Americans and citizens of many othernations  are concerned about their security  but alsoabout what kind of a country and what kind of a worldthey are to live in after 11 September. The interlinkedgoals of protecting our citizens  providing assurance toour partners and allies and preserving the character ofour free  democratic and diverse society have guidedthe actions and decisions of Prime Minister Chrétienand the Canadian Government throughout this crisis.We have committed 2000 armed forces personnel ships  aircraft and special forces to the internationalmilitary coalition against terrorism; and at home  wehave introduced a wide range of measures  legislationand new investments to bolster our security framework including at the border and at our airports.Canada welcomes the reporting and monitoringfunctions provided for in Security Council resolution1373 (2001). We have already implemented many of itsprovisions and are moving quickly on the rest. We arewell advanced in the preparation of our report and willprovide it to the Counter-Terrorism Committee wellahead of the 90-day deadline. We urge other Membernations to demonstrate their continued resolve andsolidarity by doing likewise. Canada is prepared tosupport those States for which implementation poses agreat challenge.As we take steps in compliance with resolution1373 (2001)  we are completing our ratification of theConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombingsand the Convention for the Suppression of theFinancing of Terrorism  which will make Canada a fullparty to all 12 existing United Nations counter-terrorism conventions. Negotiations are under way onthe thirteenth convention  the comprehensiveconvention against international terrorism. Thatconvention will ensure that all terrorist acts arecondemned under international law. What is needednow is the political will to complete the negotiations. Ifnot the General Assembly of the United Nations  thenwho? And if not now  then when? The time will neverbe more propitious  or the need greater.33Our international legal framework also requires astrong arms control  non-proliferation and disarmamentregime. Implementation of the Ottawa Conventionbanning anti-personnel mines is proceeding apace. Tokeep weapons of mass destruction from becomingemployed as the instruments of evil  we are also hard atwork to reinforce key instruments such as the NuclearNon-Proliferation Treaty  the International AtomicEnergy Agency safeguards  the Chemical WeaponsConvention and the Biological Weapons Convention all requiring strong multilateral action to ensure theirfull implementation.I would also add that we are now very close tomaking the International Criminal Court a reality  withonly 17 more ratifications to go. The creation of theCourt will represent an extremely significant step in theongoing struggle to eliminate impunity for the worstcrimes known to humankind.These are only the most immediate and mostobvious steps to ensure our collective security  but ouragenda must be far broader than this. Nothing has moreviolently shaken our sense of security than have theevents of 11 September. But our conception of whatconstitutes security and the nature of the threats thatmay be posed to it was already undergoing dramaticevolution prior to the attacks.The denial of human rights  the spread ofHIV/AIDS  persistent mass poverty  uncheckedenvironmental degradation and the blight of drugs andcrime all undermine stability  reduce human potentialand obstruct social and economic progress. They arethreats to human security  as are discrimination andracism  which the Durban Conference was intended toaddress. Unfortunately  it failed to achieve its potentialand instead provided a forum for propagating long-standing hatreds and biases  and the world is poorer forthat.The resolution and prevention of conflict mustalso remain at the highest order of United Nationsbusiness  but leadership and commitment are requiredif we are to move from a culture of reaction to one ofprevention  as proposed by the Secretary-General.Just a week ago  I ended a five-country visit tothe Middle East. I was reassured by the commitmentsof my hosts to the fight against terrorism. As haveothers  I urged Israel and the Palestinians to putimmediately into place measures that will bring themback to the negotiating table. That is their only wayforward. The essential truth is that there is noalternative to peaceful coexistence. That conflictcannot go on forever and leaders must act now to bringit to an end. The international community must alsoincrease its efforts to help bring about a just peace.Finally  there is little that is more debilitating tohumankind than the ravages of extreme poverty. This ismost notable in Africa  which will be a principal focusfor the G-8 in 2002  when Canada will assume the G-8chair. Speaking at this rostrum in 1963  Prime MinisterLester B. Pearson  a Nobel Peace Prize winner  warnedthe world of the dangers of a growing disparity ineconomic and social development between nations. Heurged that this “must be corrected before it creates anunbridgeable gulf between ‘have’ and ‘have-not’nations” (A/PV.1208  para. 60). That was 38 years agoand the challenge remains more acute than ever.The pledges of the Millennium Summit inSeptember 2000 must not be overshadowed by theurgency of the events that have taken place one yearlater. Indeed  their fulfilment can and must form anintegral component of how we create a strong equitable global environment that can be neitherattacked nor exploited by terrorists.Terrorism does not speak to us; it does not speakfor anyone but criminals and murderers and it onlyserves to undermine the causes they purport torepresent. It does not represent Islam; it does notreflect the will of the Afghan people.(spoke in French)The fate of the Afghan people must remainsharply in our focus. That country has been soneglected  so abused and so driven into isolation by itsself-appointed rulers that it could not even be rankedon the most recent United Nations human developmentindex. The rights of its people — notably women andgirls — have been blatantly and repeatedly violated.(spoke in English)An acute humanitarian crisis is building and wemust do more  working with United Nations agenciesand other relief organizations  to ensure thatcivilians — including refugees and internally displacedpersons — are protected and have access to food and toaid.For this reason  Canada responded to the UnitedNations humanitarian appeal  adding further resources34to the $160 million in aid that we had already providedover the last 10 years. We were also pleased at theprompt appointment of Lakhdar Brahimi — who hasplayed such an integral role in the reform of UnitedNations peacekeeping — as the Secretary-General’sSpecial Representative for Afghanistan. Canada haspledged to work with Ambassador Brahimi and othercoalition States to support the Afghan people in thesearch for a stable  fair and effective administrationthat can begin the enormous task of leadingAfghanistan forward to a more secure and hopefulfuture.The opportunities for progress towards a morefree  prosperous and peaceful world have always beenbefore us. In the haze of self-interest and competingpriorities  sometimes our global community has notseen them so clearly. The enormous horror of 11September has offered us that clarity  just as it hasconcentrated minds and catalysed relationships. It hasgiven us a renewed basis for cooperation betweenStates both in and outside the United Nations  drivennot only by the United States and its traditional allies including Canada  but also through opportunities forleadership provided to Russia and China  to India andPakistan  to countries of the Middle East  North Africa Asia and elsewhere in the resolution of this crisis.Terrorism globalizes us. It globalizes outrage andcondemnation  just as it does compassion and the cryfor justice. We must ensure that terrorism alsoglobalizes a sustained commitment to bringing aboutits end.Tomorrow  11 November  Canada and otherUnited Nations Member nations will mark our annualRemembrance Day. On this day  we remember andhonour the men and women who have fought andsacrificed for our freedom. This week in New York  Ihope that we will all take time to remember what it isthat we are together working — and  yes  fighting —for today: for freedom  for peace and for justice  andfor the dignity and realization of the potential of allpeoples everywhere.As we make our speeches  file our papers andpress forward our resolutions in this great Hall  let usalso remember that the words “United Nations” —coined by President Franklin D.

I am26confident that  under your guidance  the work of theAssembly will be successful for the States Members ofthe United Nations.Today New York is receiving us as it always has.Why  then  did we witness  two months ago  a terroristact that shook the world? If I may be allowed to say so it is because New York is the city that best representsthe values that the twentieth century defended at thecost of tremendous suffering. It is a city that welcomesthose persecuted by intolerance of all kinds; respectsall nationalities  races and religions  all ideas  and thefreedom to think and to create; offers opportunities forall to succeed; and protects individual rights throughdemocracy.It is not by chance that it was here in New York on the banks of the East River  that the Headquarters ofthe United Nations was erected. It was built herebecause the values of this city are the values of ouruniversal Organization of nations.The terrorist attack on New York was therefore anattack on the unity of our nations. It was our values our security and our faith in a better world — a worldbased on dialogue and cooperation — that were thetargets of terrorist fanaticism. That is why we have feltso close to the United States during this period: its painis our pain; its grief is our grief; and its response toterrorism is our response.We are here to reiterate our condolences to thepeople and to the Government of the United States. Thesight of thousands of persons bearing photographs oftheir lost family members amid the smoking ruins gaverise to a profound sense of empathy among Chileans.Hence we wish to express our admiration for theunity and courage of the American people and of thecity of New York. We pay tribute to the Government ofthe United States and to President Bush  who  facedwith an attack of this magnitude  has managed to act onthe basis of reason rather than emotion in seekingdiplomatic support and in building an extremely broad-based coalition.The holding of this General Assembly marks asound defeat for the terrorist cause  which seeks toreplace dialogue with the cult of violence  and reflectsour renewed faith in this world forum.We are here to extend to the Secretary-Generaland to the United Nations our warmest congratulationson having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize  whichthis year has recognized the outstanding contribution ofthe United Nations to our quest for peace.Many have remarked that the twentieth centuryhas been one of the most violent and deadly in thehistory of humankind. However  the twentieth centurywas also the century that produced major advances improved our quality of life and eliminated great evilsforever.The First World War was followed by the Leagueof Nations and by a new awareness of the fundamentalequality of peoples. The Second World War wasnecessary to put an end to fascism in its mostmonstrous manifestations  but also out of it emergedthe United Nations  the decolonization process  theBretton Woods economic agreements and a newawareness of the fundamental equality of humanbeings. The cold war brought about a clash betweentwo political and economic visions  but  once ended  itleft in its wake a new awareness of democracy andindividual freedoms.At the dawn of the twenty-first century  we areconfronting a new conflict of global proportions. Ourfirst objective must be to put an end forever tofanaticism and to the kind of intolerance that istranslated into terror.Chile believes that this vast diplomatic alliancemust also pursue other objectives. Like other victoriouscoalitions throughout history  it must begin to ask nowwhat new progress it will seek to achieve for humanityafter its victory. We must start to envision the newworld that must emerge from this tragic period in ourhistory — a world that is better organized and thatshows more solidarity. Indeed  the terrorists will haveachieved their objective if  as a result of their attacks the globalization process changes direction and beginsa trend towards less freedom and decreasedinternational trade.On the other hand  as the Secretary-General hasso rightly said  in order to achieve success in theglobalization process  we must learn how to manage itbetter and  above all  how to manage it better together.I think that it is very important to understand thatof the 6 billion people in the world  half are strugglingto live on less than $2 a day. They have no personalcomputer; they have never made a telephone call. Theyhave never seen these things. Though wealth hasincreased  there has been no significant decrease in the27number of poor people  and the gap between rich andpoor is daily becoming increasingly difficult to bridge.The balance of our world is becoming precarious  andwe must address this issue.The recent tragic events have shown us that nonation on earth that can consider itself invulnerable andthat genuine security can be attained only throughcooperation among peoples and States. What makesour citizens vulnerable today — besides terrorism —are such phenomena as ignorance  hunger  drugtrafficking  climate change  uncontrolled populationmovements  and the erratic flow of $1.5 trillion everyday in financial markets. We must devise ways oftackling these phenomena.Chile therefore supports the coalition of countriesthat  in exercise of the right of self-defence  haveembarked on a campaign aimed at eradicatingterrorism. At stake here are the universal principles andvalues that we share and that we must defend. Theseactions  therefore  are not targeting the Afghan peopleor the Arab world  nor are they aimed at any particularreligion  all of which we deeply respect and admire.In order to put an end to terrorism  there is a needfor broad  ongoing and resolute cooperation. That iswhy Chile has supported the responses decided upon inthis Organization. We are actively implementingSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001). We arealready a party to the 12 global conventions againstterrorism  and today we will deposit with theSecretary-General the respective instruments ofratification. My country has ratified all United Nationsagreements.Similarly  we are working to coordinateAmerica’s response. We are partners in acomprehensive dialogue to review and improve eachcountry’s domestic legislation and legal order to rootout the terrorist threat.We reaffirm the need to strengthen measures topromote mutual confidence and cooperation in the areaof defence. In that regard  Argentina and Chile havestandardized their data on military expenditures  andwe are working towards the same objective with ourneighbour Peru.Yet we cannot conceal our frustration at thedifficulties blocking progress towards limiting themanufacture of and illicit trade in small arms and lightweapons.We also feel obliged to say that we view withhorror the deteriorating situation in the Middle East.That conflict poses a threat to international security.Like other delegations that have spoken today  we hopefor recognition of the inalienable right of thePalestinian people to self-determination  including theright to establish an independent State  as well as theright of Israel to live within secure and internationallyrecognized borders and at peace with its neighbours.Recent acts of international terrorism haveaffected our economies  which are the basis for socialprogress for our peoples. Fear has gripped the markets.The only certainty today is that uncertainty will prevailin the future so long as there is armed action because ofthis conflict. If that proves to be the case  and ifinternational markets fall  terrorism will have achievedan unexpected victory.I therefore want to say that institutions such asthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bankmust address the concerns of the international politicalbodies and devote special attention to the additionalcosts of the response to terrorism. We are confident ofsuccess at the Doha  Qatar  ministerial meeting  whichwill be discussing ways to make trade freer. We want toaddress items of concern to all: agricultural products services  intellectual property  anti-dumping and thesettlement of trade disputes. They are all on theagenda  and they must all be addressed.The great coalition assembled to combatterrorism must also promote cooperation amongGovernments in order to ensure that no areas areexcluded from globalization. That is the best way toguarantee security for us all. To create a safer world we need more and better globalization  not moreautarky. We need more and better democracy  not moredictatorial authoritarianism. We must do a better job ofprotecting human rights. Here  I believe we must actpreventively to safeguard our democracies and toensure respect for human rights.Democracy is strengthened with each free andsecret election with the participation of an informedelectorate. It is strengthened with higher levels ofjustice and social equality. To restore people’sconfidence in democracy  democracy must becomplemented by an end to social injustice. Neitherlack of development nor specific culturalcharacteristics can be used as a pretext to justifycurtailing rights recognized in the Universal28Declaration of Human Rights. The fight againstdiscrimination and intolerance must be a frontal attackon poverty.We need institutions that ensure respect forhuman rights. Hence the importance of theInternational Criminal Court  which should serve as ankey instrument for the universal protection offundamental human rights  whatever the status of theviolator.I have come from afar  from the South of theworld  with an optimistic vision. Before leaving mycountry  I met with young people of varied origins andwith dignitaries of different religions. I met withCatholic and Protestant bishops; with Jewish andMuslim representatives: all those with whom we sharean annual joint religious service — unique in theworld — to celebrate our national independence. I sawin all of them — Jews and Muslims; Catholics Protestants and freethinkers — a renewed capacity forunderstanding and comprehension that I am sure isshared among western and eastern countries  amongethnic groups and religions — in short  among all thosehere today — with the objective of attaining ourcommon objective of peace and progress.Let us learn from our experience in assemblingthis great global coalition to respond politically andmilitarily to the terrorist threat. Let us make it into acoalition that also seeks other goals. In this coalition all are important  irrespective of creed  race  politicalhistory or ideology; in the coalition there are no smallor large countries.Let us ensure that international institutions takedue account of the interests of all countries  large medium-sized and small. Let us ensure that this grandcoalition will bring us security not only againstterrorism but also against hunger  vulnerability anddiscrimination. I propose that we should update theinstitutions that the founders of the United Nationscreated here 50 years ago.That would be the most fitting tribute to thevictims of terrorism and the best gauge of ourcommitment to the weak and powerless of the Earth."
"32",1321,"CHN",56,2001,"﻿Mr. President  first of all  please allow me to warmlycongratulate you on your election as President of thefifty-sixth session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly. I am confident that under your ableguidance and with the close cooperation of alldelegates  this session will be crowned with success. Iwould also like to take this opportunity to express mysincere thanks to Mr. Holkeri for what he did asPresident of the last session of the General Assembly.A year ago  the United Nations convened thehistoric Millennium Summit. The United NationsMillennium Declaration issued by the Summitidentifies the objectives for promoting world peace anddevelopment in the new century.International developments over the past yeardemonstrate that more and more countries have optedfor increasing dialogue and cooperation  preservingworld peace and seeking common development. To besure  the cause of human progress still involves a longand arduous effort. Factors of uncertainty in theinternational situation are on the rise. More effortsshould be made to democratize international relations and there has been no marked change in the irrationalinternational economic order.Terrorism is a widespread scourge that threatensworld peace and stability. We strongly condemn theterrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September and extend our deepest sympathy and condolences tothe families of the innocent victims  as well as to theGovernment and the people of the United States. Chinahas always opposed all forms of terrorism. No matterwhen  where or in what form terrorism strikes  and nomatter whom it is directed against  it should be metwith condemnation and responded to with counter-strikes by the international community  which shouldadopt a unified position on the matter.China has taken an active part in internationalcooperation against terrorism. In addition to joiningmost of the international conventions against terrorism China has ratified the Shanghai Convention onCombating Terrorism  Separatism and Extremism concluded by the member States of the ShanghaiCooperation Organization.China is in favour of a primary role for the UnitedNations and the Security Council in the internationaleffort against terrorism. China supports the relevantresolutions that have been adopted and is in favour ofcloser cooperation and coordination among the variouscountries concerned to this end.China strongly believes that any military actionagainst terrorism should have a clearly defined targetand avoid harming innocent people. All such actionsshould be consistent with the purposes and principlesof the Charter of the United Nations and otheruniversally recognized norms of international law  andshould serve the long-term interests of peace in theregion and the world at large.China believes that terrorism is a tiny fringe ofextreme evil  representing neither one particular ethnicgroup nor one particular religion. They must not therefore  be lumped together. China  too  is threatenedby terrorism. The “Eastern Turkestan” terrorist forcesare trained  equipped and financed by internationalterrorist organizations. The fight against the “EasternTurkestan” group is an important aspect of theinternational fight against terrorism.19In today’s world  the question of security isbecoming increasingly multifaceted and globalized.Only enhanced international cooperation can help useffectively cope with global security challenges andbring about universal and lasting security. Countriesshould endeavour to foster a new security concept based on mutual trust  mutual benefit  equality andcollaboration. They should seek security throughmutual trust and pursue cooperation to their mutualbenefit so as to effectively reduce factors of insecurity.The issue of arms control has always been closelyinterrelated with that of security. In the face of the newsituation  we should go on working for the preservationof the existing legal regime for international armscontrol and disarmament and for the maintenance ofglobal strategic stability  without jeopardizing thesecurity of any country.Tackling regional hot spots is vital to regionaland global security. We are following with deepconcern the current developments in the Middle East.The Israeli-Palestinian conflict that broke out inSeptember last year is continuing unabated. It poses agrave threat to the Middle East peace process and toregional stability. China supports the relevant UnitedNations resolutions and the principle of land for peace.It also supports the Palestinian people in their juststruggle to regain their legitimate national rights andinterests. We hope that the Israeli and Palestinian sideswill take constructive measures and closely coordinatewith the international community in its mediatingefforts so as to create conditions for easing the tensionand reactivating the peace process. China supports agreater role for the Security Council in this respect.We are concerned about the situation in SouthAsia. Given the current complex situation  we hopethat the countries in the region will strengthen mutualunderstanding and mutual trust and coexist in peaceand amity. As a neighbour of Afghanistan  we havebeen following the changing Afghan situation closely.We believe that  in order to find a solution to theAfghan issue  the following principles should beobserved. First  the sovereignty  independence andterritorial integrity of Afghanistan should be ensured.Secondly  the Afghan people should be allowed todecide on a solution independently. Thirdly  the futuregovernment in Afghanistan should be broad-based andembody the interests of all ethnic groups in thecountry; Afghanistan should live in amity with allcountries  particularly its neighbours. Fourthly  thesolution should serve peace and stability in the region.Fifthly  the United Nations should play a more activerole.Since the beginning of this year  the worldeconomy has clearly slowed down  and the situationhas been further aggravated by the incidents of 11September. Developing countries are findingthemselves in increasingly dire straits. Theinternational community must act with a greater senseof urgency and accord higher priority to development.Developed countries should act more vigorouslyto promote development. They should adopt effectivemeasures and make greater efforts to revitalize theglobal economy. We hope that the developed countrieswill demonstrate a broader vision and a cooperativespirit in providing assistance to developing countries.In recent years  anti-globalization activities inmany parts of the world have increased. In fact globalization is neither a panacea for development nora monster causing disaster. The appropriate response toglobalization should maximize its advantages andminimize its disadvantages so that all countries cancome out winners and prosper side by side.Globalization should benefit all people from all socialstrata in all countries.The United Nations has an irreplaceable role toplay in international cooperation in response toglobalization. It should increase its input indevelopment and work more effectively to fulfil thedevelopment objectives set forth in the United NationsMillennium Declaration.China is supportive of the World TradeOrganization’s plans to launch a new round ofmultilateral trade talks. It is our hope that the newround will give full consideration to the concerns andinterests of the developing countries.The Ninth Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation(APEC) Economic Leaders Meeting was heldsuccessfully in October in Shanghai  China. Themeeting was convened at a critical moment  soon afterthe incidents of 11 September  when prospects for theglobal economy seemed grim. Focusing on the theme“Meeting new challenges in the new century:promoting common prosperity through participationand cooperation”  the leaders conducted an in-depthexchange of views and reached broad consensus.Having boosted intra-APEC cooperation among the20members and reinforced their resolve to restoreeconomic growth  the meeting sent out a clear  positivesignal to markets throughout the world and took aresolute step forward in advancing cooperation in theAsia-Pacific region. The meeting will have a positiveand far-reaching impact on Asia-Pacific economiccooperation.President Jiang Zemin made clear to the worldChina’s future objectives  guiding principles anddomestic and foreign policies in the important speechthat he delivered on 1 July this year. The principal taskfor the Chinese people in the new century is to pressahead with the modernization programme  worktowards the grand cause of national reunification safeguard world peace and promote commondevelopment.Indeed  the purpose of China’s foreign policy isto safeguard world peace and promote commondevelopment. China needs an environment offriendship and good-neighbourliness and externalconditions of stability and prosperity. To achieve  andsafeguard  such an international environment servesChina’s national interests. It is also China’s duty as amember of the international community.We believe that all civilizations and socialsystems in the world can  and should  exist side by sideon a long-term basis  complementing one another andmaking progress together  in a spirit of seekingcommon ground while putting aside differences.We stand ready to engage in mutually beneficialcooperation with all countries in the world on an equalfooting towards world peace and development  with theaim of achieving common development. Our entry intothe World Trade Organization will usher in acompletely new phase of our opening-up process.This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of therestoration of China’s lawful seat in the UnitedNations. Tremendous changes have since taken place inthe world  in China and in the United Nations. China’scommitment to the Charter of the United Nations however  remains unchanged. In the new century China will  as always  vigorously support the work ofthe United Nations and continue to work together withother Member States for a better world."
"33",1355,"CIV",56,2001,"﻿The opening of the fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly has coincided with tragic events for the hostcountry and for the entire world. On behalf of theGovernment and the people of Côte d’Ivoire  allow meto take this opportunity to once again express oursincere condolences and sympathy to the Governmentand the people of the United States and to all the othercountries directly affected by this tragedy.The delegation of Côte d’Ivoire is pleased toextend its warm congratulations to the President on hiselection to lead the General Assembly at its fifty-sixthsession. We would also like to extend ourcongratulations to his predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri who so ably guided the work of the Assembly at itsfifty-fifth session.Our Organization and its Secretary-General havejust been honoured with the prestigious Nobel PeacePrize. The Government and the people of Côte d’Ivoirehail this well-deserved international recognition of theimportance and quality of the work done by theOrganization under the leadership of the Secretary-General.My delegation extends to Mr. Kofi Annan itswarm and fraternal congratulations on his historic re-election and on the greatly appreciated work he isdoing as the head of the United Nations. Therecognition he has just received is an illustration of theuniversal appreciation of his great qualities as adiplomat and statesman  which he has put at the serviceof peace and development.In organizing the Millennium Summit and in hispersonal involvement in the holding of the specialsession on HIV/AIDS  as well as his involvement in thespecial session on children  the Secretary-General hasput back on the agenda the concerns of developingcountries in general  including those of Côte d’Ivoire.It is absolutely vital to sensitize the internationalcommunity on matters related to the fight againstpoverty and improving protection of the rights ofwomen and children  to mention just two areas. Côted’Ivoire would like to express its appreciation in thisregard.Finally  the Government and the people of Côted’Ivoire would like to express their gratitude toSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his greatunderstanding of  and support for  Côte d’Ivoirethroughout the very difficult times it has experiencedsince the end of 1999. He demonstrated this once againby sending a personal representative to the forum onnational reconciliation that is now under way. TheGovernment and the people of Côte d’Ivoire and theinternational community have great hopes for thatforum  whose success will help all participants todispel misunderstandings and help Côte d’Ivoire toresume its economic growth in order to be able to playits proper role.My Government attaches great importance to asocial policy aimed at combating poverty and meetingthe needs of all sectors of our population in the areas ofhealth  education  employment and nutrition. As part ofthat policy  a strategy document on poverty reduction isbeing prepared.Beginning in June 2002  a health insurance planwill be in place as part of a national social securitysystem. Through that plan everyone living in Côted’Ivoire will be able to have health insurance regardless of social status. The National Assemblyadopted the necessary laws to that end on 9 October.No effort will spared to ensure that we eliminatethe most serious social shortcomings as soon aspossible. In that regard  our greatest ambition is fordevelopment and growth to reach the most remoteregions and for the necessary basic services of runningwater  electricity  schools and health-care centres to beavailable to all the people in every village of Côted’Ivoire. It is with this goal in mind that theGovernment has established a decentralizationprogramme  thanks to which 58 departments of Côted’Ivoire will be able to administer themselves andoversee their own development on the basis of a33budgetary packet granted to them annually throughlegislative appropriations.In order to attain these various objectives  themacroeconomic framework will have to be improvedthrough rigorous legal and budgetary measures andthrough good governance. Côte d’Ivoire is stronglydetermined to do its very best in this area.Ensuring the well-being of children and theprotection of their rights is a priority for my country.The special session on children will take place in a fewmonths  and our Government places great hope in thefact that it will give us an opportunity to clarify theactions we are taking in favour of children  particularlyin the fight against cross-border trafficking in children.Last June  in this very Hall  States adopted newmeasures and initiatives in order to ensure the effectiveimplementation of the Beijing Declaration andPlatform for Action. Côte d’Ivoire endorses all of theserecommendations and will do everything possiblewithin the framework of a renewal policy to reach asquickly as possible this objective  which is intended toensure equal opportunity among men and women.The problem of HIV/AIDS has become one of themajor concerns of the world today in general and forAfrica in particular. UN/AIDS statistics and those ofmany other institutions state that throughout the worldover 30 million people are infected  of which 1.2million are children. Africa represents only 10 per centof the planet’s population; nevertheless  since thebeginning of this epidemic  83 per cent of all deathsdue to AIDS have fallen to Africa. As the Secretary-General has rightly stressed in his report of 16February 2001  if the epidemic continues to grow at thepresent rate  the most affected nations will see adecrease of at least 25 per cent of their estimatedeconomic growth over the next 20 years. For thisreason we are very glad to see the setting up of aGlobal AIDS and Health Fund at the United NationsSecretary-General’s initiative. It would also be a goodtime to set up mechanisms promoting the exchange ofexperience among those countries which have managedto halt the spread of HIV/AIDS and those which arestill seeking solutions to it.No country can flourish if international peace andsecurity are threatened  which is why Côte d’Ivoire isextremely concerned by an arms race which dares notspeak its name. As party to the Pelindaba Treaty  Côted’Ivoire welcomes the increasing number of treatiesestablishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in differentregions of the world.The illicit proliferation and circulation of smallarms is another phenomenon that affects the Africancontinent  and West Africa in particular. Thisphenomenon constitutes a permanent threat to peaceand slows down development in this region  whereover 15 million light weapons are circulating illegally.Since the end of the Second World War  theinternational community’s attention has focused onnuclear arms. However  it is conventional small armsthat continue to create millions of victims. Here weshare the Secretary-General’s opinion expressed in hisMillennium Report: light weapons are indeed weaponsof mass destruction. They exacerbate regional conflictsand contribute largely to the use of child soldiers. Theykill women  youth and children. The insecurity that thiscreates prohibits any possibility of smooth economicdevelopment.As Members of the General Assembly know  on31 October 1998 in Abuja  Nigeria  the Heads of Stateof the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) decreed a moratorium aimed at reducingthe proliferation and circulation of light weapons inWest Africa. During the recent African summit  whichtook place in Lusaka in July 2001  this moratorium wasextended for a three-year period  starting on 5 July2001. This struggle can be efficient only if it is led bythe international community as a whole  and it has toinvolve  of course  weapons manufacturers  officialusers and civil society. The United Nations Conferenceon the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weaponsin All Its Aspects  which was held in New York from 9to 20 July 2001  is in our opinion headed in the rightdirection. Côte d’Ivoire is greatly interested in theimplementation of the Programme of Action adoptedby the Conference.Eight years ago the General Assembly decided toundertake the reform of the Security Council. As itstands at the moment  the Council cannot be seen as ademocratic and representative body of all UnitedNations Member States. The Council’s functions haveto be reinforced so that it can continue actingefficiently as the United Nations body with the primaryrole of ensuring the maintenance of international peaceand security. In order to do this  it is urgent and rightthat the number of permanent and non-permanentmembers be increased so that the composition of theCouncil is in line with the complexity of a world that34has seen great development  both quantitative andqualitative  in international relations  the key aspectbeing the increased complexity of the problems to besolved.In our view  the expansion of the Council shouldaim at re-adapting the whole mechanism of taking andimplementing decisions. This is why the exercise of theright of veto  equitable representation and expansion ofmembership are all problems that have to be solved assoon as possible  bearing in mind the vital urgency ofreforming the Security Council so that all nations andregions of the world can be reflected within it. In thisregard  the Organization of African Unity (OAU) which has now become the African Union  seeks twopermanent seats and a total of five non-permanent seatsfor the African continent. Of course  Côte d’Ivoiresupports this position.To make the reform of the Security Council areality  it is essential for Member States of the UnitedNations  particularly the five permanent members ofthe Council  to demonstrate their firm will andcommitment to carry out these reforms. The primaryduty of the United Nations  after all  is to preserve andpromote peace throughout the world based ondemocratic principles. But can there be peace withoutjustice or equality in relations between nations?The world as a whole and the African continent inparticular  has been torn apart by regional conflicts andcivil wars that threaten international peace andsecurity. Various solutions proposed by theinternational community for laying down arms and forhalting the suffering of civilian populations have notyet  unfortunately  produced the expected results. Weneed to find innovative and imaginative solutions thatare political  not military. In this perspective  wewelcome the Brahimi report on peacekeepingoperations  and we hope that its recommendations areapplied as soon as possible. The impetus that theBrahimi report is intended to give to peacekeepingoperations has to be encouraged and maintained.The events of 11 September 2001 confirm theCôte d’Ivoire in its condemnation of all terrorist acts ascriminal and unjustifiable  wherever they may becarried out and whoever the perpetrators may be particularly those that violate the purposes andprinciples of the United Nations  pose a threat tointernational peace and security and jeopardize friendlyrelations between countries. This is why theGovernment of Côte d’Ivoire welcomes and firmlyencourages the rapid conclusion of a generalconvention on international terrorism. Such aconvention would undoubtedly contribute greatly tofighting against this scourge and would reinforce aninternational legal regime on terrorism. Côte d’Ivoirewill always respect the international commitments ithas assumed since its independence. We also feel thatthe rule of law should be given top priority.We would like to pay a well-deserved tribute hereto the International Law Commission for its valuablecontribution to the development and codification ofinternational law  in particular law relating to theresponsibility of States  diplomatic protection unilateral acts of States  reservations to treaties andinternational responsibility in case of damagingconsequences arising from activities that are notprohibited by international law.At the dawn of the twenty-first century  the roleof the United Nations is crucial. Our Organizationrepresents  in fact  the collective conscience and is  as arule  the policeman of the world  able to balance theinterests of States — those well endowed and those notso well endowed — within the new globalizingeconomy. This regulatory role for the world economyand for international relations can be carried out fullyonly in an environment of international peace  justiceand equity."
"34",1398,"CMR",56,2001,"﻿I should like at the outset to express theprofound sympathy and condolences of Cameroon tothe Government and the people of the United States ofAmerica and of the Dominican Republic for theaccident involving the American Airlines Airbus on 12November in New York.It was also with great dismay and sadness that welearned of the natural disaster that struck the brotherlypeople of Algeria with such severity. On behalf of thepeople and the Government of Cameroon  I would liketo extend to that country our most profoundcondolences and solidarity.Rarely has a session of the General Assemblybeen such a focus of international public attention oraroused the interest of the worldwide media to theextent that the current session has. The annual sessionof the General Assembly is a powerful symbol of thecoming together of nations  the promotion of culturesand respect for differences and freedoms. This year however  a shadow has been cast over our session bythe recent  terrible attacks of 11 September  which tookplace not far from here. Cameroon addressed thatsubject at length during the debate on internationalterrorism that took place on 5 October. I shouldtherefore simply like to reaffirm  on behalf of HisExcellency Mr. Paul Biya  President of the Republic ofCameroon  our sincere condolences to the families thathave suffered as a result of the tragedy  as well as oursolidarity with the city of New York and theGovernment of the United States.We must  of course  emerge from this period ofmourning. We must unite our forces to eliminate thecentres of destruction that are responsible for thistragedy. Each of the States Members of the UnitedNations  acting together  must nip internationalterrorism in the bud before it spreads any further.Lowering our guard when confronted with this greatperil  or appearing to be helpless in the face of thecriminal fanatics who are sowing terror  would exposeeach State and each individual on earth  turning theminto potential victims of this lethal danger.The President of the General Assembly  Mr. Han comes from Korea  whose patient  wise and resolutepeoples have long been engaged in a courageouspolitical struggle to heal the wounds of the past. We areconvinced that he will be able to guide the Assembly atits fifty-sixth session through this period of greatturbulence. He can rest assured of my delegation’s fullsupport.The delegation of Cameroon would also like toexpress its gratitude to his predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Harri Holkeri  who presided with great skill overthe work of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifthsession. He perfectly reflected the modest  generousand supportive character of Finland.The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the UnitedNations and its Secretary-General is cause for hope andoptimism for the development of the Organization.Cameroon welcomes that dual tribute. As the head ofState of Cameroon said in his message ofcongratulations to the Secretary-General  Africa isproud that the Oslo jury chose to honour Kofi Annan.That award strengthens and reaffirms the unanimityand confidence of the General Assembly  whichpresided over the re-election — an election that seemedquite natural — of that great servant of the peoples ofthe United Nations for a second mandate as Secretary-General of our Organization.Indeed  all States Members of the United Nationsmust be proud that the Nobel Peace Prize was alsoawarded to the Organization. It is the first time in thehistory of the United Nations that the Organizationitself has been honoured with such a distinction. Thatgesture confirms — if such a confirmation wasneeded — that the Organization  in which we are allplayers  is truly a major instrument of world peace thatembodies all of our hopes for a better world.As an instrument of world peace  the UnitedNations took up  the day after the attacks of 11September  both the struggle against internationalterrorism and the crisis in Afghanistan. Theinternational community as a whole  through SecurityCouncil and General Assembly resolutions  was able tosupport the military intervention carried out against thepresumed masterminds of those attacks  their networksand their Taliban protectors.In the same way that we honour the memory ofthe victims of New York  Washington  D.C.  andPennsylvania  we must also honour the memory of the32civilian victims in Afghanistan  including the threeFrench and German journalists.Cameroon  I repeat  believes that the allegedcriminals must be held responsible for their actions.Moreover  we urge the international community tostrive to prevent Afghanistan from re-engaging withthe old demons of conflict between the armed clansthat have defeated the Taliban today. Cameroontherefore calls for an immediate manifestation of theUnited Nations presence in Kabul.Under the powers granted to it by theinternational community  in particular under ChapterVII of the Charter  the Security Council  with theessential support of all Members of our Organization must swiftly undertake all necessary actions to restoreand maintain peace in Afghanistan and to providehumanitarian assistance to people who have been leftdestitute and traumatized by an apparently endless civilwar.We must urgently prevent the flames of war fromspreading inexorably throughout Afghanistan. We mustalso recall from this rostrum  however  that it is hightime to douse the fires that have been burning fordecades in Palestine  a land of peace. We mustextinguish the fires that  conflict after conflict  aredevastating the Democratic Republic of the Congo andthe Great Lakes region  as well as those that haveconsumed Angola for over 25 years. It is high timethat  like those who fought the fires in New York on 11September  we act as firefighters to put an end to thefratricidal wars of the African continent  CentralAmerica and other disadvantaged regions of the planet.We must remain vigilant in preserving the particularlyfragile peace in the Balkans.We are convinced that the best firefighter tocontain the ravages of war and the threats that loomover peace and security throughout the world is theUnited Nations. Without the determination of States however  and the respect of those States forunanimously adopted rules  it is vain to hope to achievethe result targeted for the Organization by the Charter.The activity of the United Nations will have no effect ifthe resolutions it adopts to contribute to settling aconflict are not respected by the parties concerned andinvolved.Why  after more than half a century  have we notbeen able to end the conflict in the Middle East  inwhich Palestinians and Israelis are in ever more brutaland violent opposition? Why can we not find theresources necessary to the United Nations to nip in thebud the fratricidal wars that have bled and disruptedentire regions of the African continent since the dawnof independence? These are the persistent questionsthat haunt international public opinion. Just as all menmust naturally be equal before the law  States must betreated on the same footing of equality out of respectfor international law and the principles defined by theUnited Nations.The implementation of resolutions andrecommendations adopted at the Millennium Summitwould enable great progress to be made towards theworld of harmony that globalization is supposed toestablish. Man and the safeguarding of his life anddignity  wherever he may live  must be restored as ourpriority. Man and the safeguarding of his life anddignity must once again be the central focus of ouractions  thoughts and concerns.The attacks of 11 September in the United Statesand the spotlighting of international terrorism mustprompt us to take action  of course  but it must also andespecially lead us to reflection. We have seen how thepromoters of those who thus endanger the new worldorder also invoke a policy of double standards tojustify their fanatical acts. We have also read in manyof their communiqués their claim to be leading acrusade on behalf of a religious community that according to them  has been treated unfairly by others.We understand  finally  that they have also cited theliving conditions of many hundreds of millions ofpeople  the poorest of the poor  as an argument forfighting that part of the world that plunders anddominates them in a spirit of complete indifference. Wemust do all we can to avoid giving such excuses andpretexts to individuals and groups who in fact havenothing but criminal motives.Cameroon has maintained and continues tomaintain that the United Nations must  more than everbefore  continue to affirm the necessary links ofsolidarity within the international community and theneed for balance in international relations. Support anddevelopment assistance for the poorest regions of theworld are essentials recalled not only in the resolutionsof the Millennium Summit  but also at the most recentThird United Nations Conference on the LeastDeveloped Countries  held this year in Brussels. Therecovery efforts of the countries of the South — interalia  the New African Initiative on economic matters —33must be accompanied and supported by the mostprosperous States. During the annual session of theEconomic and Social Council last summer in Geneva over which Cameroon had the honour of presiding these principles and requirements were broadlyrecalled and  thank goodness  endorsed.In spite of the commitments undertaken at oneworld summit after the other  the gap between theregions of the North and the South is growing wider bythe day. Destitution  poverty  epidemics  the AIDSpandemic and the technology divide are not matters offate. Over and above solidarity  a more just andbalanced practice of commercial exchange  notablythrough the opening of markets to the mostdisadvantaged countries  could also help to bridge thatgap. The forthcoming International Conference onFinancing for Development  to be held next year inMexico under United Nations auspices  should providean opportunity for a deeper reflection on thesepriorities.On 1 January 2002  Cameroon will take its placeat the Security Council table on behalf of Africa as anon-permanent member. I would like to express onbehalf of His Excellency Paul Biya  President of theRepublic of Cameroon  all of our gratitude to all of theMember States of our Organization for the confidenceplaced in my country. In the current internationalcircumstances  we realize the full value of thisconfidence.Cameroon is committed to fully assuming itsofficial duties in making its modest contribution  in theCouncil  to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity."
"35",1442,"COD",56,2001,"﻿Allowme  at the outset  to add my voice to those of thedistinguished speakers before me  to offer you  Sir  onbehalf of the people of the Congo and myself  ourwarmest congratulations on your election as Presidentof the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. TheRepublic of Korea  your country  maintains excellentrelations with mine.May I also use this opportunity to offer our mostheartfelt congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan  adistinguished son of Africa  on his re-election to thepost of Secretary-General and on the Nobel Prize which has been awarded to him in recognition of hiscommitment to the cause of promoting peace in theworld.The people of the Democratic Republic of theCongo  its Government and I condemn unreservedlythe blind acts of terrorism that plunged the UnitedStates and all of humanity into grief on 11 September2001. These were acts of gratuitous violence  whichdeserve only the contempt of the whole internationalcommunity and of all nations that hold peace andjustice dear.By applying and implementing Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001)  my Government is committedto fully cooperate in advancing all initiatives aimed ateliminating terrorism in all its forms.The Congolese people  which is itself theinnocent victim of a war of aggression by Rwanda Uganda and Burundi — another kind of terrorismcharacterized by acts of barbarism that directly orindirectly brought about the death of millions ofCongolese — had no trouble grasping the heinousnature the sad events that took place in the UnitedStates of America on 11 September 2001.It would be tiresome to go back over the originand consequences of the war of aggression that startedon 2 August 1998  in flagrant violation of the Chartersof the United Nations and the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU). Thus  following the logic of peace andwell aware that only non-violent settlements bringlasting peace  I can but welcome the many peace12initiatives that have sought to bring about negotiatedsolutions to the conflicts.I have particularly in mind President Chiluba ofZambia  the appointed mediator of the Lusaka peaceprocess for the Democratic Republic of the Congo.I would also like to mention the Southern AfricaDevelopment Community (SADC)  and in particularAngola  Namibia and Zimbabwe  which  in accordancewith the SADC charter  rallied around my countrywhen it was attacked.I would also like to address my thanks andgratitude to the United Nations and the United NationsOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo (MONUC)  whose arduous work on theground has been very praiseworthy  and to the OAU the European Union and certain other traditionalpartners of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.The situation on the ground has improved in spiteof the bad faith displayed by some of the parties to theLusaka Agreement. The disengagement of forces is inits final stages  and the effective end to hostilitieswhich it has brought has been observed to thesatisfaction of all. However  the return of armedtension has been seen in the eastern part of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  in the part of thecountry that is occupied by Rwanda. These hostilitieshave been wrongly described as fighting that hasmoved to the rear of the Rwandan forces. In fact  whatwe see is the logical consequence of the failure of anew plan by the Rwandan aggressors  who hoped tosweep away all Congolese resistance  the better tooccupy the eastern part of the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo in order to be able to continue to pillage ourwealth unchallenged.As far as the disarmament of the armed groups isconcerned  we should note that a disarmament demobilization  repatriation  resettlement andreintegration (DDRRR) programme  drafted byMONUC and the Joint Military Commission (JMC) was adopted by the Political Committee set up underthe Lusaka Agreement. It provides  first of all  for thevoluntary disarmament of all the armed groups in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. In this respect  theCongolese Government  reaffirming its good faith andits commitment to this plan  has regrouped andconfined 3 000 Rwandan combatants in Kamina inKatanga province  and a MONUC mission has beenthere for several days now in order to identify theseparticular individuals.As far as the withdrawal of foreign forces isconcerned  the definitive and total departure of allNamibian forces has been noted. This movement offoreign forces back to their countries is continuing;now the Zimbabwean  Angolan and Ugandan militaryare beginning their withdrawal. Paradoxically however  and despite the continuing demands by theinternational community through all of the relevantSecurity Council resolutions  Rwanda is actuallyreinforcing its military presence in the Congo.The process of reconciliation  so long awaitedthrough national dialogue  made significant advancesduring the preparatory meetings from 20-24 August2001 in Gaborone  thanks to the Republican pactinitiated by the Government of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo. I would like to take thisopportunity to reiterate solemnly from this rostrum thefull commitment of my Government to participate fullyin the sessions on this dialogue to be held in theRepublic of South Africa. I invite the facilitator to doeverything possible to deal with pending issues in orderto make sure that the forum regains its inclusivecharacter  as provided for by the Lusaka Agreementand the relevant Security Council resolutions.For the Government of the Democratic Republicof the Congo  it is important that representatives of allsectors of our population should be able to participatein this dialogue so as to lay the foundations of ademocratic State. I would invite the internationalcommunity  at the appropriate time  to assist mycountry in organizing free  democratic and transparentelections  which would allow the Congolese people tochoose their own leaders  leaders who will have thelegitimacy that a popular election provides and which in turn  guarantees political stability.I would like to avail myself of this opportunity toinvite the United Nations to institute exemplarysanctions against all those States  their accessories andaccomplices that are pillaging the wealth of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo.I could not conclude my statement withoutthanking the Security Council members for havingunanimously adopted resolution 1376 (2001) on 9November  which condemns the establishment of ajoint force set up by the Congolese rebels  instigated byRwanda in violation of the Lusaka Agreement  in13violation of the DDRRR plan and of all relevantSecurity Council resolutions. This resolution isparticularly welcome for its providing for thedeployment of MONUC’s phase III. It also provides forthe demilitarization of the city of Kisangani  theneutrality of Kindu and the reconstruction of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo.In my statement  I have condemned the infamousacts perpetrated against the people of the United Statesand of the world as a whole. I have also spoken of thecatastrophic situation in my country  which has beenvictim of a war of aggression for the past three years. Ihave also noted the significant advances achieved inthe peace process in the Democratic Republic of theCongo  which unfortunately risks being compromisedthrough the bad faith of Rwanda and its Congoleserebel accomplices.I have stressed how essential the support of theinternational community is if we are to achieve thisprocess successfully and to launch the reconstructionof my country. The Congolese people  who havesuffered so much  are asking only one thing of theUnited Nations and the international community: thatjustice be done for the weak and the strong  for richand poor alike."
"36",1489,"COG",56,2001,"﻿The crashof American Airlines flight 587 two days ago has onceagain cast into mourning the city of New York  whichhas already suffered so much. On behalf of thedelegation of the Congo  I offer my most sincerecondolences to the bereaved families.I wish at the outset to congratulate you sincerely Sir  on your outstanding election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. Thetrust that has been placed in you reflects the14international community’s recognition of your qualitiesas an experienced diplomat and is a tribute to yourcountry  the Republic of Korea  for the decisive role itplays in maintaining peace and security throughout theworld. You may rest assured of the full cooperation ofthe delegation of the Congo.I express our gratitude to your predecessor Mr. Harri Holkeri  for the competence and deftnesswith which he carried out his task.I also take this opportunity once again to offerour sincere congratulations to Secretary-General KofiAnnan on his brilliant re-election and on his receptionof the Nobel Peace Prize  which is a crown on hispersonal contribution and on that of our Organization.We still have in our mind’s eye the terrifying andunbearable images of the attacks perpetrated againstthe United States on 11 September —acts of purebarbarity  blind terrorism that we condemn absolutely as we do all other forms of violence  which must becurbed and eradicated. In keeping with the commitmentundertaken at the Millennium Summit  we must beespecially vigilant and determined in the fight againstthat evil  which has no place in the world today. TheCongo fully endorses all the relevant United Nationsresolutions aimed at strengthening the effectiveness ofthe response of the international community toterrorism  in particular Security Council resolutions1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001).The African continent  which has suffered formany years from violence that has hampered itsdevelopment and integration into the world of today has clearly condemned such acts  which can lead onlyto further destitution and poverty. That is why  at atime when it is launching new initiatives to help it toemerge from crisis and promote development  Africa isdressing its wounds and appealing for various forms oflocal  regional and international mediation. Theseinitiatives have already borne fruit.With regard to the conflict in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  which is of particular concernto my country  we welcome the progress that has beenaccomplished in implementing the Lusaka Agreement which is enabling the United Nations OrganizationMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo(MONUC) to move on to phase III of its deployment.In this context  we welcome the Security Councilmeeting with the Political Committee of the LusakaAgreement. We invite all the parties to continue todemonstrate their goodwill in carrying out thecommitments they have undertaken. We have greathopes for the inter-Congolese dialogue  which isscheduled to take place in South Africa.After years of war and illegal exploitation of itswealth  that brotherly country needs to return to peace national unity and political stability and to fullyrecover its sovereignty so that it can achieve theprogress promised by its enormous potential. Mycountry  for its part  has always maintained good-neighbourly relations with the other side of the CongoRiver  and we will continue to contribute in every waywe can to ensure the peace and normalization that areso greatly desired.We would like to take this opportunity to thankMr. Kofi Annan and  through him  his SpecialRepresentative  Mr. Namanga Ngongi  for the actionthat has been carried out within the framework ofMONUC.As for Burundi  we would like to pay tribute toPresident Nelson Mandela for his mediation  which hasled to the formation of a government of national unity to which we wish every success. This process  whichshould contribute to a return to lasting peace andstability for that country  deserves the full support ofthe international community.In Angola  the consistent resort to terrorism andother acts of sabotage by UNITA  in disregard of therelevant Security Council resolutions  should lead us tostrengthen the sanctions against that organization which is responsible for the continuation of war in thecountry. The Congo reaffirms its solidarity with thepeople and the Government of Angola  who are sparingno effort to restore peace and rebuild their country. Theinternational community must provide all necessaryassistance to Angola.Given the continuing violence in the Middle East a return to the Oslo accords is urgently required if thecurrent deadlock is to be broken. We appeal to theparties in conflict to show a willingness to moveforward so as to re-establish a dialogue  which remainsthe only way to restore lasting peace in an area of theworld that has been troubled for far too long. Wetherefore welcome the constructive proposals made bythe President of the United States of America  HisExcellency George W. Bush  on the coexistence of twoStates  Israel and Palestine  within secure and15recognized borders  as required by Security Councilresolutions.Situations such as these are often and almostsystematically accompanied by the massivedisplacement of populations  which causesdestabilization in neighbouring countries and worsensdomestic problems. Such is the case in my country which is currently hosting more than 200 000 refugeesmainly from the Democratic Republic of the Congo Angola  Rwanda and  more recently  the CentralAfrican Republic. The situation is a great cause forconcern in a country that is only just emerging fromwar itself and is thus confronted by many otherchallenges. Given the seriousness of this situation  Iwould like once again to repeat the appeal of myGovernment for adequate assistance.After the signing  at the end of 1999  ofagreements on the cessation of hostilities  the prioritytasks set out by President Denis Sassou Nguesso werenational reconciliation and relaunching the democraticprocess  with a view to ensuring the reconstruction anddevelopment of the Congo. Today  almost all of theseobjectives are in the process of being achieved.At the political level  we organized inBrazzaville  from 14 March to 17 April 2001  anational dialogue from which no one was barred  underthe auspices of an international mediator  HisExcellency El Hadj Omar Bongo  President of theGabonese Republic  to whom we would like once againto express our deep gratitude. That dialogue has beensanctioned by the signing of the convention for peaceand reconstruction in the Congo  as well as by theadoption of a preliminary draft of the constitution. Thispreliminary draft was approved by the NationalTransitional Council — our transitional parliament —on 2 September  and it will be submitted to areferendum before the end of this year. In preparationfor the constitutional referendum and the generalelections  an administrative census has just beencarried out so as to draw up electoral lists.I would also like to mention the efforts beingmade by the Government within the context ofstrengthening the consolidation of peace. Theseinclude  in particular  the demobilization of over25 000 militia members; the collection of 10 817weapons and rounds of ammunition  of which 6 484have already been destroyed  with the technical supportof the International Organization for Migration;assistance for the reintegration of 6 844 former militiamembers  with the United Nations helping with morethan 2 190 small-scale projects; and the large-scalereturn of displaced persons and refugees to theirnormal domicile.Furthermore  the establishment of a highcommission responsible for reintegrating formercombatants  a Committee for the follow-up of theconvention on peace and reconstruction in the Congo and a national committee to eradicate poverty all formpart of this momentum for the consolidation of peace.Our work will long continue to reflect the painfulbackground against which it is taking place — theterrorist attacks. We have committed ourselves —rightly  unanimously and resolutely — to fighting thisscourge. But this means that we must eradicateanything that might be used as a pretext for acts ofblind destruction. To decrease tension throughout theworld is to deal with situations that can fosterterrorism. But we should remember that an apparentlylocal crisis can have repercussions very far away —sometimes even at the global level. In this context globalization must not be seen solely in economic andcommercial terms. In reality  we are talking about thedaily existence of individuals  peoples and nations closely linked because of the rupture of borders.The eleventh of September just gave us a painfulreminder that the world is one in its suffering  meaningthat we must also remain as one as we seek bettertimes. That is why we must reduce  as quickly aspossible  the gulf that separates the poorest among usfrom the wealthiest.The socio-economic tensions we see throughoutthe world are also the result of extreme poverty indeveloping countries. Over 1 billion men and womenare victims of malnutrition and do not even have accessto drinking water or minimal health services. Unlesswe accelerate growth  poverty will continue to worsen.We must all therefore mobilize generally in order tourgently implement the strategies we ourselves haveadopted here  especially those adopted during theMillennium Summit.We should welcome the recent United Nationsinitiative to set up a Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDSand to respond to the desire of developing countries tohave access to new therapies at a lower cost.16With regard to the particular economic situationin Africa  Congo expects that during this session theinternational community will support the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development. As theAssembly is aware  the New Partnership — whichharmonizes the concerns of the new African Union inthe areas of development and economic integration —is the response that Africa unanimously intends topresent to the challenges of globalization.It is also appropriate now to again look at theessential instrument in that international struggle namely  the United Nations. The conferences andspecial session organized by the United Nations thisyear — on the least developed countries  AIDS  humansettlements  the illicit trade in light weapons in all itsaspects  racism and many other issues — once againproves that our Organization remains a vital andirreplaceable instrument at the service of humankind. Itis also in this framework that the fight against terrorismmust take place.As we stated during the Millennium Summit lastyear  we must  while relying on the United Nations work more resolutely and methodically to findsolutions to all those concerns. It is for this reason thatI would like  in conclusion  to reaffirm my country’scommitment to the United Nations  which must remainthe preferred forum for international coordination anddialogue among civilizations  for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  for the peacefulsettlement of conflict  and for international economiccooperation in the service of all."
"37",1536,"COL",56,2001,"﻿Allow me  on behalf of the Government of Colombia to express our satisfaction at your assumption of thepresidency of this session of the General Assembly.Your experience and leadership are valuable credentialsfor bringing our deliberations to a fruitful result. I wishalso to pay tribute to your predecessor  the Minister ofForeign Affairs of Finland  His Excellency Mr. HarriHolkeri  whose diplomatic skills contributed decisivelyto the Assembly’s work.I want  further  to speak of the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  whose authority  dedication and5meaningful contribution will serve as inspiration forthe decisions that Member States must take at thissession.Let me take this opportunity to reiterate oursatisfaction at the honour accorded to the UnitedNations and to the Secretary-General through theaward of the Nobel Peace Prize. That was a well-deserved tribute to our Organization  to the valuesshared by its Member States  and  in particular  to theSecretary General  whose personal commitment andvisionary approach have given new life to the UnitedNations and have helped to consolidate its internationalcredibility. That decision was more than anacknowledgement of past achievements; it providedencouragement that inspires the work of the UnitedNations in the light of the challenges of the newmillennium.Two months ago the entire world was shaken by aseries of unprecedented terrorist acts. We have allspoken of the dreadful effects of these attacks. We haveall expressed our solidarity to the people of the UnitedStates. And we all agree that those irrational acts notonly affected one single country but were in fact anattack against all mankind. But we must go evenfurther; we must understand why such events occurredand what we must do to ensure that similar acts neverhappen again – never again.The tragedy of 11 September had the positiveeffect of uniting us all against a common enemy:terrorism. And it did something else: it removed thedissembling from our words; it stripped the hypocrisyfrom our discourse; it moved us out of the world ofgrey tones to which we were so accustomed. Now wemust work to replace it with a black-and-white worldthat is free of ambiguity.And what were those greys that are so evidenttoday? They were the ambiguities we all expressed inrespect of violence and the money that finances it. Inthe past  when an act against civilians anywhere in theworld suited our interests  we would speak of ahumanitarian crisis  of defending democracy  ofreasons of State. And we continued on impassively with a clear conscience. But when an act againstcivilians anywhere did not suit our interests  we wouldtake a firm stand  we would react with indignation andwe would speak of terrorism  of attacks againstmankind  of treacherous attacks against democracy andhuman rights.Let there be no more ambiguity or equivocation.The time has come to define our position  with novague half answers: either we side with mankind  itsdignity and its integrity  or we do not.Whenever human dignity or civilians areattacked  that is an act of terrorism. It does not matterwhether it is perpetrated by a group of religiousfanatics or by an organization claiming to havepolitical ideals. There is no pretext for attackingdefenceless civilians. The dividing line is very clear:either we respect human life and dignity or we standagainst humankind.The horrendous acts of 11 September do notrepresent a collision of civilizations  religions orcultures. The only collision is between a violentfanatical minority on the one hand  and all forms ofcivilization on the other. We cannot accept any furtherattempts to justify violence. No matter how much itcosts us — even if it goes against our presentinterests — there is something far more valuable thananything else in the world: human life and humandignity.Today  we must all stand together andunreservedly condemn all acts of violence against anyhuman being  regardless of the pretext. If we do notcast our lot in favour of mankind and human values what will be left for us? What right will we have to callourselves the leaders of a civilization gone adrift?I address the Assembly today with theoverwhelming responsibility and authority vested in meas President of a country  Colombia  that for decadeshas endured an internal conflict where every new daybrings more deaths and kidnappings because of theintransigence of illegal groups seeking to imposethemselves at the cost of the lives of their compatriots.And I address the Assembly today representing acountry  Colombia  that has been the main victim ofworldwide drug addiction  a country that has sufferedtoo many deaths  that has sacrificed natural andfinancial resources to combat a crime that is not itsown. It is a global crime whose vast illegal proceedsremain outside our borders.In those two capacities  I address the internationalcommunity  represented in the General Assembly  todemand  head held high  that we move from rhetoric toaction. The world is distressed by this ominousterrorism. I say candidly that we ourselves have also6suffered from such terrorism for quite some time. Butwe have not always felt the pulse of the internationalcommunity beating firmly by our side.We all know that the world market for illegaldrugs is the number-one source of financing forworldwide terrorism and death. Yet the internationalcommunity has been content simply to suggest ordemand that production centres control drug traffickingthrough law enforcement and through eradication andinterdiction action  forgetting that this scourge is muchmore than just a problem of cultivation and trafficking.It is a global problem with global ramifications.Colombia has always said  and my Governmenthas repeated again and again in every possibleinternational forum  that it is necessary to controlillegal drug production  but that we cannot forget thatthis is a very complex transnational business and thatthe vast proceeds of narcotics trafficking do not stay inour country. No  indeed: those profits move freelythrough international financial markets whereseemingly respectable financiers and businessmenprosper  enjoying the tolerance of the entire world.We must also learn from our misfortunes —especially from our misfortunes — and we havelearned something from the events of 11 September.We have learned that lax control of financialinstitutions and the existence of tax and bankinghavens are like giving criminals a letter of marque tomake and multiply their profits  to amass the fortunesthat finance death.The shared responsibility that my countrydemands in the fight against illegal drugs must also beapplied to the fight against terrorism. This newinternational conviction that we have all been late inimplementing — perhaps because we are still numbedby the so-called post-cold-war era — must betranslated into acts that go beyond rhetoric. There mustbe no more coexisting with money laundering  even ifit means going after the major financial conglomeratesof the world.There must be no more uncontrolled productionand sale of the chemical precursors used in illicit drugproduction.There must be no more illegal or uncontrolledmanufacturing and sale of the weapons that propagatedeath.Only if we  beginning with the developedcountries  translate those principles into reality  withconcrete action and with political will  will we givemeaning and effectiveness to the fight that my country Colombia  has been waging for many years against thecultivation and production of drugs.No country is free from the destructiveconsequences of illegal drugs. There are no epicentresin this illegal business. This criminal activity is globalin nature. The drug problem  and organized crime ingeneral  undermine the institutional framework conspire against democracy  compromise governanceand sow death and violence. They are a hothouse ofcorruption; they erode judicial systems and they thwartthe rule of law. Shared responsibility  therefore  meansthe responsibility to defend democracy  our principlesand institutions.The year 2003 will mark five years since thetwentieth special session of the General Assembly  theso-called world drug summit. We should now begin topromote an in-depth review of all the accomplishments the obstacles encountered along the way  the newchallenges to be faced and the additional action wemust take to break  once and for all  the links thatsupport this global phenomenon.But we must do so without losing ourselves ingrey tones. The commitment of the internationalcommunity must be real and concrete so that we can atlast attack the finances of the traffickers of death. Letus combat the business in which they make all theirprofits.Fortunately  the Security Council has takenimportant decisions in this regard  moving the fightagainst crime in the right direction. Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001) and the measures being takenby all the Governments of the world to combat thefinancing of international terrorism are an essentialstep forward that Colombia supports without hesitation.We must work together to dismantle the structureof the extremists’ financial support. That is the onlyway to create a safer world for our children. It is theonly way to defeat the plague of violence and terrorismat its roots: the transnational empires of drugs.A year ago  we gathered in this same Hall on theoccasion of the Millennium Summit. None of thepriorities identified at that time was stressed as muchas the need to ensure that globalization benefits all the7peoples of the world. The reality of globalization is oneof inequality; it has led to dissatisfaction and conflict.We need  through deep reflection  to become aware ofour responsibility for humanizing globalization andensuring that it reflects the interests of all countries andregions.The Conference on Financing for Development tobe held early next year in Mexico is particularlyimportant in this light. Unless we mobilize thenecessary financial resources and move towards a newarchitecture ensuring a stable international financialsystem  the commitments and the course set out at theMillennium Summit will be a dead letter.Those same criteria must guide next year’s WorldSummit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.On that occasion  we must consolidate a positive visionand devise a road map for achieving real harmonybetween economic growth  social development and thepreservation of the environment.This is the last time I will address the GeneralAssembly as President of Colombia. Each year since1998  I have spoken before the Assembly about thecommitment of my Government and of the people ofColombia to achieving peace  democracy and progressin social justice.More than any other leader of my country I havefully devoted myself to achieving peace. I do not regrethaving done that  because we Colombians are tired ofviolence  intimidation  crime and kidnappings. I hopethat all groups living outside the law will make theright choice at this crucial juncture  not only in thehistory of Colombia but also in the history of allhumankind. It is up to them to decide how they want tobe treated: as terrorists and drug-traffickers or aspolitical insurgents. They must define themselvesthrough their actions. If their actions lead them to betreated as mere terrorists  then they must clearlyunderstand — and I say this vehemently to theworld — that Colombia and the internationalcommunity will honour their commitments and carryout the measures adopted by the Security Council tocombat terrorism.History goes on; it does not stop. Leaders comeand go  but peoples continue along the path laid outbefore them. Even today  I believe that peace ispossible if the will to make peace exists. I still believe with the firm hope of someone who knows the valuesof his people  that the road we started on will not bebarren.During my mandate  the international communityhas shown an unprecedented solidarity with the peopleof Colombia and its quest for peace. I am grateful forthat from the bottom of my heart.I must give special recognition to the SecretaryGeneral’s Special Adviser on International Assistanceto Colombia  Jan Egeland  for his assistance  and to thegenerous contribution of friendly nations during thetalks with insurgent groups. The world has sided withpeace in Colombia  and that is a gesture we understandand appreciate in its full worth.Today I echo the strong and determined voice of40 million Colombians  who are all fighting for a betterand more dignified life  and I reaffirm before the worlda message to the international community that proposesand demands clarity.The time for lamenting is over. It is time fordefinitions.Let us put aside the empty speeches. Let us leavebehind the moral double standards that measure actsthat suit us with one yardstick and the acts that do notwith another. Let us advance  united together  againstall forms of terrorism  whatever their rationales.No more ambiguity. No more justifications ofviolence. Let us never forget that there is nothing moresacred  more valuable or worthier than human life."
"38",1576,"COM",56,2001,"﻿Onbehalf of the Comorian delegation  which I have thehonour to lead  and on my own behalf  I offer you  Sir our warmest congratulations on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at this session. Weexpress the ardent hope that our work  under yourenlightened leadership  will be successful.My delegation and I pay a ringing tribute to yourpredecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri  for the excellentmanner in which he led the work of the previoussession. As to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan I praise the merits of that man of such great talent andexemplary wisdom  and I also pay tribute to hisdedication to the service of our world Organization.The Nobel Peace Prize that was awarded to him together with our Organization  is concrete proof of hisoutstanding values.On 11 September  the entire world was plungedinto gloom and anarchy. Terrorist networks defied theentire international community through theirreprehensible attacks on American interests here inNew York  this global  hospitable and cosmopolitancity — this capital of the entire world.Thus  I cannot fail in my duty to convey  fromthis rostrum  the deep sympathy and compassion of theGovernment and people of the Comoros to theAmerican people and Government following thosepainful  tragic and most unfortunate events. We offerour most grief-stricken condolences in particular to thefamilies of the victims  whose terrible pain we sharefollowing these sudden deaths.Furthermore  we were deeply moved by the lossof lives in the aeroplane accident that took place lastMonday here in New York. We extend our sincerecondolences to the Governments and peoples of theUnited States and the Dominican Republic and to thebereaved families.In the course of the previous session and of theMillennium Summit  the central role that has been andmust continue to be played by our Organization wasbroadly reaffirmed in many statements. The reform ofthe main organ responsible for international peace andsecurity to make it reflect the realities of today’s worldwas seen by all to be a priority. Today more than everbefore  that role must be strengthened  because theUnited Nations responsibility requires it to be betterequipped fully and effectively to assume it.In this respect  it is appropriate to point out thatthis responsibility is of a different order. Above and all it is the responsibility “to save succeeding generationsfrom the scourge of war”  to cite the expression of theCharter that governs our institution. This primaryresponsibility requires the Organization to ensure thepeace and security of peoples. Today  crises of all sortsand the precariousness of the cause of peace in manyregions demonstrate the United Nations highly difficulttask in assuming that responsibility. The varied threatsto peace that are spreading throughout the world callon us to focus greater attention on taking urgentinternational action  for no continent is safe from thedanger.Terrorism is one component of that danger. Wemust not allow extremist groups  regardless of theirpretexts  to plunge the world into perpetual psychosisand to claim millions of innocents as their unfortunatevictims. The attacks of 11 September were a harshblow for all of us  a challenge to all mankind. TheIslamic Federal Republic of the Comoros thereforestrongly condemned those hateful and barbarous acts just as it condemns terrorism in all its forms.Thus  in the framework of mobilizing efforts tocombat terrorism  the conferences held in Doha andDakar last month  in which the Government of theComoros played an active role  reified the commitmentof the Arab world and the African continent to thisdifficult but necessary struggle. In the same way  themeeting in Brussels brought the countries of Europe20together in a manifestation of the continent’s abidingconcern over terrorism.In this approach  however  it is first necessary todefine the notion of terrorism by clearly establishingwhat constitutes State  group and individual terrorism.We must then distinguish between terrorist acts and thelegitimate claims of certain peoples to their right toself-determination  which indubitably cannot beexercised without confrontation  since it is often metwith resistance and even oppression. Finally  it isessential that we in no way confuse terrorism withIslam  since we know  on the one hand  that everyterrorist act is the expression of an extremism that is byno means linked to a given religion or nation  and that on the other  Islam is known for its great tolerance andopenness  advocating love of one’s fellow man  peaceand solidarity.With respect to my country  the Islamic FederalRepublic of the Comoros  the concern of our highestauthorities vis-à-vis this problem has led them toestablish a national mechanism to combat terrorism which has been placed under the leadership of thePrime Minister. In January 2000  my country alsosigned the International Convention for theSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism. In additionto such national commitments on the part of every oneof our countries  it is clear that we will need to engagein international action by joining regional andcontinental forces to fight this scourge  which threatensworld peace and destabilizes the economies of ourcountries.This requires an objective political reading of thesituation prevailing in areas of tension throughout theworld. From that perspective  the situation in theoccupied Arab territories  among other problems  callsfor our attention today. The Palestinian people has thesame right as every other nation on Earth to life happiness  prosperity  peace and security. That is why in respect for the law and in order to reach a just lasting and definitive solution to this problem  theComorian Government believes that an independentPalestinian State  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital is necessary. From another point of view  the UnitedNations has the responsibility to safeguard the welfareof peoples. That entails guaranteeing the conditions fora better life by protecting fundamental human rights.Indeed  the serious diseases affecting ourcountries  in particular the developing ones; difficultaccess to better education and health care; the faminethat afflicts several regions of the world; thedeterioration of our environment; and the violation ofhuman rights remain the major challenges to ourmillennium. Some of these evils  such as famine serious disease and the extreme poverty afflicting manycountries  are in themselves very eloquentmanifestations of a gap between North and South thatwe will ultimately have to bridge.As to disease  AIDS is at the heart of ourdiscussions and concerns  because it kills  emptiesentire regions and every year creates millions oforphans whose future is bleak. Thus  in the IslamicFederal Republic of the Comoros  despite a relativelylow rate of incidence  the Government remains awarethat the country’s geographical position and theprevalence of tourism in our island subregion arefactors that could contribute to the rapid spread of thedisease  given the influx of tourists and seasonalholiday-makers.That is why our Government is devoted tomaking the national programme against AIDS a usefultool by giving it  as much as possible  the appropriatemeans  with the undeniable help of the World HealthOrganization and Joint United Nations Programme onHIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). The commitment of theGovernment of Comoros to this fight against AIDS isalso expressed by its participation in all regional orinternational measures to this effect. Thus  a delegationfrom Comoros  led by His Excellency Mr. HamadaMadi Boléro  the Prime Minister  took part last June inthe special session of the General Assembly on AIDS held in this city. The recommendations from thatsession were borne in mind by our national authorities.Speaking of diseases  I should not overlookmalaria  which still affects many regions. In Comoros it affects all layers of society and becomes a source ofmajor concern for the national authorities. This is why beyond the national provisions within the framework ofthe national strategy to fight malaria  my countrywelcomes the initiative to proclaim the period 2001-2010 the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Africa.I spoke earlier about the gap that separateseconomies of the North from those of the South. Fromthis point of view  the Third United NationsConference on the Least Developed Countries  held inBrussels in May 2001  is of particular interest for ourcountries  and we count on more resolute commitment21from all of us  rich and poor countries  so that therecommendations made on that occasion and those thatwill be adopted within the framework of the conferencethat is currently being held in Doha  in Qatar  will leadto positive changes and lay a solid basis for sustainableand effective development by revitalizing oureconomies.Our peoples expect much from our Organization recognized as offering the best framework to guaranteethe fundamental rights of all. This is why  confident inthe United Nations to ensure the respect for unity andterritorial integrity of our respective countries  theIslamic Federal Republic of the Comoros urges ourOrganization to consider the legitimate claim of theChinese Government with respect to the reintegrationof the Chinese province of Taiwan in its natural entity.My country  especially sensitive to this problem  as weourselves have had a painful secessionist experience believes firmly in the need to find swift solutions tothis type of situation  which could undermine thestability of regions.The Millennium Summit prompted great hopes which we must turn into reality  in order to thusrecognize all the importance that it has in the eyes ofhumanity. This means that there should be a follow-upof the recommendations made on this occasion. We canonly strongly wish that everyone will take due accountof the true diagnosis made of our world in order to seektogether the appropriate remedies.Everyone’s interest and survival depends on this because when our neighbour’s peace is threatened  noone is safe; likewise  as long as hunger  disease ignorance  violence  injustice and poverty still subsistin certain regions  they will be a cause of shame for allhumanity and a potential threat to peace and stability.A year after the last session  during which I spokefrom this high rostrum on  among other points  thegeneral situation that prevailed in my country  theIslamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  I would liketo speak about certain aspects of the way the situationis evolving. I am pleased to announce today that theprocess of national reconciliation  led by the Head ofState of my country  His Excellency Colonel AzaliAssoumani  in which he opted for direct dialogue withour brothers from the island of Anjouan  is makingprogress daily.Indeed  at the present time  a draft constitution which would govern the future of the whole of theComoros  has just been handed to the Head of Stateand will be submitted to a referendum before the end ofthis year. All of the political parties took part indrafting this document  and we also benefited from theassistance of the entire international community including the Organization of African Unity  theOrganization of la Francophonie and the League ofArab States with respect to expertise in constitutionallaw.Alongside these efforts  provisions are beingmade to prepare the upcoming elections  for which theinternational community  through the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and the EuropeanUnion  will also provide considerable technicalassistance.In this transitional phase towards theestablishment of new institutions  the Government ofComoros is not sparing any effort to improve thecurrent conditions in order to allow our population tolead a decent and acceptable life. These significantefforts must of course be supported by the internationalcommunity in order to help the social sectors indifficulty. The great challenge for our Government  inaddition to this reconstruction now under way  remainsthe achievement of harmonious social and economicdevelopment.This is why  on behalf of the Government ofComoros  I launch an urgent appeal to the entireinternational community to continue to provide itsvaluable support in this period of nationalreconciliation for the reconstruction and establishmentof institutions.The secessionist crisis did not make us lose sightof the problem of the Comoran island of Mayotte which is a major concern for the people andGovernment of my country. This island of Comoros administered by France  is completely cut off from therest of the archipelago  thus limiting the free movementof people and goods among islands and leading toconsiderable human loss for people who want to reachtheir families in Mayotte.While the Government of Comoros is confidentof the willingness of the French authorities tocooperate fully with their Comoran counterparts inorder to find a lasting and negotiated solution to theproblem of the Comoran island of Mayotte  wereiterate our desire to see the international communitytake part in this approach  out of respect for the law22and in accordance with the relevant resolutions of theUnited Nations that admitted Comoros to the UnitedNations  once the new Comoran entity is set up toallow the return of Mayotte to its natural fold.Lastly  I would like to extend our profound andsincere thanks to our fraternal countries and friends  tothe partners of Comoros that accompanied us in everyway they could  in the search for a lasting solution tothe crisis that has shaken our country and is stillpresent in our struggle to preserve and perpetuate theprecious gains that we have made from the change of30 April 1999. May all the crises that are affecting theworld today see a fortunate conclusion in the interest ofour peoples."
"39",1615,"CPV",56,2001,"﻿Allow me tojoin the delegations that preceded me in congratulatingMr. Han Seung-soo on his election to preside over theproceedings of the fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly  being held at an especially complicatedmoment in international life. His long and brilliantcareer as an eminent diplomat and distinguishedstatesman in his country assures us that his term asPresident of the Assembly will be a productive one  ashas been clearly evident since this session wasconvened. I assure him that he can count on the fullcooperation of the delegation of Cape Verde.To his predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland I wish to express our recognition of the skill andefficiency with which he managed the major globalissues that came before this lofty forum during theprevious session  particularly during the MillenniumSummit.My delegation is also pleased with the re-electionof Mr. Kofi Annan as Secretary-General of the UnitedNations. The unanimity of his re-election reflects thetremendous prestige he has gained in the internationalcommunity because of his vision  as well as the trustplaced in him to pursue the reforms under way and toconsolidate the prestige of the United Nations.Like the delegations that preceded me  I also wishto take this opportunity to reiterate my congratulationsto the United Nations and its Secretary-General as jointrecipients of the Nobel Peace Prize  an award thatreinforces their moral authority  so necessary in theseturbulent times. This distinction  both well-deservedand heartening  helps emphasize the importance of the29work of our Organization  under the enlightenedguidance of Mr. Annan  in fostering an internationalatmosphere conducive to a more just  tolerant andmutually supportive world.This is a gigantic and complex task  undertakenin the midst of enormous difficulties and risks andcontinually posing new challenges to our collectivemind as we search for solutions to large and ever-growing problems that humanity must solve.Now  when international peace and security areseriously threatened  that recent honour not onlyconstitutes well-deserved recognition of a high degreeof dedication to the cause of peace and the preventionand resolution of conflicts; it also bears a message ofhope that the shining ideals of justice  democracy human rights and development for all will shape theentire world to the benefit of future generations.We in our country understand and properlyappreciate the role and the importance of the UnitedNations. It was partly due to the persistent andunconditional support of the United Nations that ourstruggle for national liberation culminated in success with the proclamation of our independence. It wascertainly due to the support of the United Nations andits specialized agencies that Cape Verde has been ableto take important steps on the road to development andshow encouraging signs of progress  year after year  asdocumented in the Human Development Reports of theUnited Nations Development Programme.The tragedy that recently struck the homeland ofthe United States of America  causing the loss ofthousands of innocent lives and destroying one of themost prestigious landmarks in this city  can only be theobject of our most vehement and total condemnation.The United States is home to the largest overseasCape Verdean community. That part of our diaspora hasalso felt violated by the barbarous attacks of 11September  and along with them  my country and indeed  all Cape Verdeans share in the mourning andthe distress experienced by the American people andfamilies of so many other nationalities.Cape Verde has stood ready from the outset tosupport actions intended to combat terrorism  in thecontext of a broad international coalition under theauspices of the United Nations. Therefore  myGovernment is committed to implementing SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) to combat this scourge.Important steps have already been taken  particularlyregarding the endorsement of international anti-terrorism instruments.We believe that all States have a moral andcollective obligation to fight the perversion of thehuman spirit represented by this phenomenon. Theseriousness and the scope of the 11 September terroristacts show that  from now on  terrorism must beconfronted resolutely  with appropriate responses andpreventive action  in order to stem the criminalviolence that masquerades as being prompted bypolitical or religious motivations.No country is safe from similar attacks or fromattempts to use its own territory for the perpetration ofterrorist acts. Therefore  any strategy designed topermanently eliminate this dangerous threat tointernational peace and stability must be a commonone  with broad participation  in which the UnitedNations plays a crucial role.In participating in the global effort to eliminateterrorism  the developing countries are  once again  at aserious disadvantage. On the one hand  their scarcity ofresources and their lack of sophisticated means ofdetection and prevention make them more vulnerableto infiltration by terrorist organizations and to actionslaunched within their own borders. On the other hand when they attempt to respond to demands from theinternational community  they are forced to mobilizeresources that would otherwise be dedicated to theireconomic and social development and to meeting thebasic needs of their peoples.Added to this is the fact that  as was emphasizedsome days ago by the Secretary-General  the poorereconomies are the ones that will pay most dearly forthe direct consequences of the terrorist attacks on theworld economy. My own country  which dependsheavily on tourism revenues  is already feeling therepercussions of the worldwide crisis in thetransportation and hospitality industries.There is therefore a critical need for theinternational community to effectively help thedeveloping countries  particularly the least developedamong them  to bear the added burden that the battleagainst terrorism is placing on their economies. Theindustrialized countries must display increasedsolidarity and generosity in assisting developingcountries  since the effort that developing countrieshave agreed to make and the sacrifices imposed on30their populations will also benefit the industrializednations.A little more than a year ago  the MillenniumSummit was held in this Hall. It drew approximately150 heads of State or Government. The dialogue wasactive and innovative to an extent unprecedented in thehistory of the Organization. A tremendous variety ofsectors of civil society participated directly. Not onlydid the Summit provide a succinct overview of theactivities of the United Nations since its founding  italso constituted a unique opportunity to present anintegrated picture of the strategic objectives for thetwenty-first century  thereby opening new avenues foraddressing the challenges of globalization.The conclusions of the Summit rekindled theflame of hope among the peoples of the world  inparticular among those who believe that it is possibleto find effective ways of giving all countries realopportunities for development by improving theirinstitutional and productive infrastructure and bycreating an international atmosphere conducive toproviding them with access to the means  both publicand private  to fund their development. The drafting ofthe road map towards the implementation of the UnitedNations Millennium Declaration (A/56/326) gives theinternational community a powerful tool for joiningforces in the implementation of the major policy linesadopted at the Summit.Important events have taken place since theMillennium Summit. Of particular interest were theThird United Nations Conference on the LeastDeveloped Countries  the special session of theGeneral Assembly on HIV/AIDS and the DurbanWorld Conference Against Racism  RacialDiscrimination  Xenophobia and Related Intolerance.Now  we are preparing to hold  in the near future  theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment  a special Assembly session on children and the Johannesburg World Summit on SustainableDevelopment.The specific manner in which those issues affectthe African continent  which is home to the greatmajority of the least developed countries  has certainlyhelped accelerate the decision-making processes withregard to regional integration  leading to importantsteps that may open the way to a more promisingfuture  despite the clouds hanging over theinternational scene.As we know  a complicated combination ofendogenous and exogenous phenomena has left theAfrican continent feeling increasingly marginalized.The pace of economic growth has not been able toreduce poverty significantly. Diseases such as malariaand AIDS continue to cut lives short at a frighteningrate. Several countries are the scene of instability;many of them are engaged in armed conflicts and areexperiencing terrorist activities that kill thousands ofinnocents  systematically destroy property  disrupt theoperations of Governments and displace populationgroups. The scanty positive results from the manyplans and initiatives conceived and implemented todeal with the serious problems Africa has faced overthe years have resulted in well known and widespreaddissatisfaction  both in the international communityand among African leaders.Yet  despite the rather discouraging internationalclimate  Africa has taken important steps that may openthe way to a more promising future. With a view tocreating the instruments and mobilizing the will to faceup to an increasingly complex global situation  Africanleaders proclaimed the African Union with a newvision for our continent. Moreover  they adopted theNew Initiative for Africa  recently designated as theNew Partnership for the Development of Africa  underwhich Africans assume full responsibility foreradicating poverty and putting their countries on thepath of economic growth and development at the sametime as they offer a partnership that is mutuallybeneficial to the international community in meetingthe challenges of the new millennium.The adoption of those two instruments and thefirm commitment to promote transparent stewardshipwill surely open up new prospects for the establishmentof peace  stability  democracy and development thatcan lead the continent to occupy the prominent place inthe global economy that is justified by its immensepotential.Doubtless  there is a long road to travel before weachieve political integration based on democraticinstitutions and grounded in popular participation good governance and action aimed at the promotion ofsustainable development on the economic  social andcultural levels. But we believe that  with the emergenceof new leadership dedicated to economic rebirth  withthe consolidation of democracy and good governanceand with the anticipated support of the international31community  conditions will be present for afundamental and historic turnaround in Africa.Two of the most critical problems faced by theOrganization and by the African continent  whosesolution cannot be postponed  now loom larger becauseof their interconnection and because of their bottleneckeffect. I refer to poverty and armed conflicts. Allavailable data reinforce our apprehensions about thesuccess of the battle against poverty in the world. Thismakes it necessary to adopt a strategy to win that war since attaining the objective of a 50 per cent reductionin the number of persons living in extreme poverty by2015 appears ever more problematic. Without measuresthat can effectively reverse the process of socio-economic degradation and  especially  without politicalwill on the part of the international community as awhole  that goal of the Millennium Summit cannot beachieved.It is an undisputed fact that  as a rule  conflictsoccur in countries that are marked by poverty. Thiscause-and-effect relationship has become a viciouscircle that cannot be terminated without efficientcoordination between the preventive diplomacy andsocial action of the United Nations on the one hand andmore effective engagement by the industrializedcountries on the other.Despite the efforts of the internationalcommunity  the United Nations and the Secretary-General towards peace and stabilization in internationalrelations and towards democracy and human rights certain regions of the world continue to be the scene ofarmed conflicts that threaten to spread and endangerpeace and stability in those regions.The terrorist acts of 11 September have added anew measure of instability  provoking an anti-terroristmilitary intervention in Afghanistan whose durationand consequences are difficult to assess.The impasse in the search for a lasting solution tothe Palestine question  which is primarily a result ofthe intransigence of Israel and the cycle of violencethat has been set in motion  has created one of the mostdangerous focal points of tension and a threat to worldpeace. The implementation of the Oslo Agreementmust be resumed. Violence must be brought to an endand the internationally recognized rights of thePalestinians must be respected  including their right totheir own State  while guaranteeing the Israeli peoplethe right to live in peace in their country withininternationally recognized borders.Africa  today the scene of the greatest number ofarmed conflicts  has taken some positive steps in thedirection of peace  with the active involvement of theUnited Nations  the Organization of African Unity many friendly countries and a number of multilateralactors  non-governmental organizations and elementsof civil society. However the persistence of acts ofviolence  namely the perpetration of criminal actsagainst civilian targets  bears evidence that the road topolitical and social stabilization leading in turn to therestoration of peace is still long and difficult.In Angola  for example  we have seen freshoutbreaks of armed action by UNITA  which continuesto spread death and destruction. The Security Councilonce again strongly condemned the actions of the rebelmovement  while maintaining its sanctions against thatorganization. But it is vital that all countries cooperatewithout reservation by denying UNITA the means tocarry out its criminal actions  so that it can bepersuaded to lay down its weapons and fully abide bythe Lusaka Agreement.Cape Verde is pleased at the success representedby the transition of East Timor towards independence a process that constitutes a remarkable and exemplarysuccess achieved by our Organization and particularlyby the United Nations Transitional Administration inEast Timor. From the very outset and in the mostdifficult moments  the Cape Verdean Government andpeople have always been on the side of the people ofEast Timor in their struggle for independence. We willcelebrate this occasion together on 20 May 2002  whenEast Timor takes its destiny into its own hands andjoins our great family here in the United Nations.I conclude by expressing the hope that theoutcome of this session may make an effectivecontribution to a better world  a more just and mutuallysupportive world of peace and cooperation and especially  a world of tolerance and concord."
"40",1661,"CRI",56,2001,"﻿Allow me at the outset to congratulate you Sir  on your well-deserved election to preside over thework of this General Assembly. We are familiar withyour valuable personal qualities and appreciate theleadership of your country  the Republic of Korea  inthe concert of nations. I would also like to express mygratitude to the outgoing President  Mr. Harri Holkeri for his excellent work.I should like to express the deepest condolencesof the people and Government of Costa Rica to theGovernment of the Dominican Republic and to therelatives and friends of the more than 200 Dominicannationals who lost their lives in the tragic aeroplaneaccident that occurred here yesterday.This year  the General Assembly is meeting inextraordinary circumstances. Only two moths ago  thiscity fell victim to the most dreadful and despicableterrorist attack in world history. Even today  just a fewkilometres from this Hall  we can contemplate bewildered  the column of smoke that marks theremains of the twin towers. The rubble reminds us ofthe destruction  pain and death caused by violence andirrational hatred. Therefore  I cannot let pass thisopportunity without reiterating the deepest condolencesof the people and Government of Costa Rica to thepeople and Government of the United States.On 11 September  the terrorists targeted not onlyNew York  but the whole of humankind. Today  we allare victims of terrorism. Costa Rica realizes thatterrorism is an extremely grave crime against humanitythat victimizes the innocent civil population andendangers the international community as a whole. Forthis reason  we condemn terrorism categorically in allits forms and manifestations  wherever and bywhomever committed  while we proclaim that there isno political  philosophical  racial  ethnic or religiousjustification that legitimizes the commission of thiscrime.The recent terrorist attacks force us to rethink theconcept of international security and to renew ourcommitment to mankind’s basic values. When facedwith cruel fear and hatred  we must raise the flag ofcivilization  tolerance and brotherhood. In the face ofirrational violence  we must take up the arms of reason law and order. Against terrorism  we must resort to therule of law  justice and due process throughinternational cooperation in the judicial and lawenforcement fields.Faced with new treats to international security the community of nations must create effective andprecise mechanisms to ensure peace and developmentfor all peoples. In this context  we welcome theadoption of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). Itconstitutes a firm  proportionate and necessary answerto the despicable acts of 11 September.Furthermore  we welcome the progress achievedin the negotiation of a comprehensive convention toproscribe and punish terrorism in all its forms. Mydelegation has taken active part in the recentnegotiations to solve the outstanding issues  and we aregrateful to the Secretary-General for his personalinvolvement in obtaining a consensus solution. We callupon all delegations to be flexible and to agree to theconsensus formula proposed by the coordinator of thecontact group on this issue.The struggle against terrorism must lead us tobuild a true culture of peace and life. Right now  wehave the duty to plant the seeds of peace in order tosubstitute the vices of destruction and conflict with the30virtues of fraternity  tolerance and cooperation amongall men and women.Currently  thanks to scientific and technologicalprogress  we can defeat disease  poverty  famine  hatredand war. We now posses the necessary economic technological and philosophical means to guarantee toeach and every person the highest standards of life andthe necessary conditions for their fullest physical intellectual and spiritual development.In this context  the United Nations could andshould play a central role in building a future of peaceand freedom. This Organization must be a bastionagainst war  hatred and poverty. This institution mustbe a beacon that lights the way and points towards thefinal goal.To this end  the respect of human rights andpromotion of human dignity  in all spheres  must be thecrux of the activities of the United Nations. Theprotection of human beings is the only justification forpeacekeeping activities. The promotion of humandignity is the only legitimate reason for pursuingsustainable development. The protection of human lifeis the only justification for the protection of theenvironment or search for economic development. Thephilosophy of this Organization must therefore bedeeply humane.The protection of human rights is the cornerstoneof Costa Rica’s foreign policy. Costa Ricans loatheevery violation of fundamental rights. We rejectintolerance  hatred  inequality and war. We condemnextrajudicial executions  the death penalty  abortion forced displacement  torture  rape and hostage-taking.We categorically condemn all restrictions on freedomof speech and thought. The ethical values of the CostaRican identity make us proclaim a more just andhumane society and demand greater solidarity.This Organization’s work in the area of humanrights is outstanding. The codification efforts and theperiodic conferences have provided the internationalcommunity with clear guidelines of conduct. Now  wemust concentrate our efforts in the implementation ofthose norms at all levels of society  placing specialemphasis on the fulfilment of economic  social andcultural rights.In particular  it is necessary to rationalize andcoordinate the work of the monitoring organs including the Commission on Human Rights  in orderto make them more effective. Costa Rica considers itnecessary to review the national reports system in orderto make it more transparent and expeditious. Webelieve that Member States must open their borders ina candid and forthright manner to the human rightsrapporteurs that are appointed by the Commission. Thisobligation flows directly from the commitmentsundertaken under Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter.Simultaneously  we must respond positively to therequest for additional resources made by the HighCommissioner for Human Rights. Moreover  theUnited Nations must remain vigilant so as to deal withthe new challenges that threaten the enjoyment ofhuman rights.We are concerned by the recent developments inthe area of cloning and biotechnology. For this reason we welcome the proposal by France and Germany tonegotiate an international agreement to prohibit thereproductive cloning of human beings. We believe thatsuch an instrument should also forbid other forms ofexperimentation in biotechnology that are contrary toboth human life and dignity.We must strengthen the family as the basicbuilding block of society. The family is indispensablefor the formation of healthy  productive andresponsible citizens. We must also make additionalefforts to support parents in the education of theirchildren. In this regard  my country recently enacted aspecial law on responsible parenthood that ensures through unprecedented and resolute judicial means that all biological fathers will be responsible for theeducation and care of any offspring born out ofwedlock.The efforts to maintain international peace andsecurity must also be seen from the point of view ofhuman rights. Armed conflicts produce continuoushumanitarian crises and atrocities. As long as warexists  it will be impossible to ensure respect for thebasic human rights. In situations of armed conflict  allnecessary measures must be taken to protect thesecurity of innocent civilians. It is crucial to providethem with immediate assistance  in order to preventgreater loss of life and destruction. It is also necessaryto protect the human rights of refugees and displacedpersons. Furthermore  at the end of an armed conflict greater international cooperation is required to rebuildthe national economy and lost infrastructure and toreturn life to normal.31For several years  my delegation has advocatedthe strengthening of the Security Council. We have saidthat it is the only mechanism that humanity has toconfront the threats that beset it. Costa Rica hasquestioned the Council when it has ignored its dutiesand has been reduced to irrelevance. We have criticizedit when it has confined itself to giving weak andinadequate answers to the gravest political andhumanitarian emergencies. We have denounced it whenit has been unable to act because of an irresponsibleuse of the veto or the defence of national interests ofcertain of its members. Today  the adoption ofresolution 1373 (2001) gives us new hope. We areconfident that  in the future  the Security Council willconfront other emergency situations with the samedecisiveness  promptness and effectiveness.Weapons are a catalyst for armed conflicts. Theirproliferation fans the flames of violence; exacerbatesfighting and hatred; aggravates crime and terrorism;and fosters political and social instability. Militaryarsenals prolong armed conflicts and impede peaceprocesses  while the armies consume insatiably themeagre national resources. To attain peace  it isnecessary to forbid the transfer of arms to rebel extremist or terrorist groups. The transfer of weaponsto Governments that commit systematic human rightsviolations  do not respect democratic principles or havenot ratified the main instruments of internationalhumanitarian law should also be forbidden. We believethat it is essential to regulate the possession of lightweapons by civilians.My country condemns the unilateral anddisproportionate use of force and countermeasures while it supports the mechanisms and principlesenshrined in international law. We must embracenegotiation  dialogue  mediation and the judicialresolution of disputes. For this reason  Costa Rica fullyendorses and has full confidence in the excellent workof the International Court of Justice. We believe thatthe voluntary acceptance of its obligatory jurisdiction through optional declarations  is clear proof of goodfaith. However  we cannot fail to express our deepconcern about the existence and emergence of newreservations on the voluntary acceptance of the Court’sjurisdiction. Good faith in international relationsdemands the withdrawal of those reservations.True and sustainable peace can be achieved onlywhen decent living conditions are guaranteed to allpeople; when there is a level of economic developmentsufficiently advanced so that everyone can satisfy hisor her basic needs; when basic human rights arerespected; and when social and political differences areresolved through democratic means  dialogue andnegotiation. Therefore  it is essential to investintensively and systematically in our human resources devoting all necessary resources to education andhealth. Only an educated population can live infreedom  only a healthy population can work fordevelopment and only a cultured population canintegrate itself in the globalized contemporary world.Similarly  it is necessary to ensure the sustainableuse and management of natural resources. Without ahealthy environment it is impossible to attain decentliving conditions  both for the present and for thefuture. We cannot ignore the damage caused to futuregenerations by the destruction of thousands of squarekilometres of the earth’s forests.Costa Rica has developed a national system ofpayments for environmental services with a view toalleviating the impact of greenhouse gases andpreserving our forests for mankind. My country hasdevoted one quarter of its national territory to theprotection of its forests. The production ofenvironmental goods and the provision ofenvironmental services have become an engine ofnational development. For these reasons  my countrywill be honoured to be the host country of the firstministerial meeting of the United Nations Forum onForests  which will be held in March 2002. We lookforward to the active and constructive participation ofall Member States in that meeting.My delegation notes with concern the growinginequality in the area of vulnerability. The States withthe most fragile economies and whose inhabitants havefewer resources for prevention and reconstruction arethe ones that suffer most from the effects of naturaldisasters. In our region  Central America  we have beenthe victims of several disasters that  in the course of thepast decade  have caused very serious human andmaterial losses. The lack of financial resources imposesa harsh limit on the poorest nations’ capacity to preventhumanitarian emergencies. Therefore  we advocate anincrease in international cooperation with developingnations to enable them to design and implementprogrammes to reduce their vulnerability.In this context  I would like to mention thebilateral assistance that the Republic of China in32Taiwan has given our region to face these emergencies.Costa Rica understands and supports the repeatedefforts of the Republic of China in Taiwan  with 23million inhabitants and a firm process of democraticdevelopment and strengthening  to obtainrepresentation within this Organization. That countryalso constitutes one of the main industrial centres ofthe Asian basin  with which most Member States havestrong commercial and technical exchange ties. Wehope that all differences will soon be put aside so thatit will be possible to achieve agreements and bothbranches of the Chinese people will be able toparticipate jointly in international forums.Just a couple of months ago we witnessed thebloody and abominable impact of internationalterrorism. Those despicable acts shook the conscienceof humanity as a whole. In these circumstances  theworld awaits the guidance of the United Nations. Ourpeoples demand the decisive and firm action of theinternational community. Humanity as a whole calls onus to fulfil the lofty goals that we undertook when weestablished this Organization."
"41",1730,"CUB",56,2001,"﻿Before delivering my statement  I would like to expressour condolences to the United States  the DominicanRepublic and other countries represented here that havelost citizens among the many passengers and crewmembers who perished in yesterday’s tragic crash ofAmerican Airlines flight 587  and I hereby extend thesecondolences to their families.The war in Afghanistan must be stopped. TheGovernment of the United States must acknowledgethat it has made a mistake  and must halt its ineffective unjustifiable bombing campaign against the Afghanpeople.Judging by its results  it would seem that this warhas targeted children  the civilian population and thehospitals and facilities of the International Committeeof the Red Cross. As to its methods  no honest voicewould be raised in this Hall to defend the endlessslaughter  with the most sophisticated weaponry  of adispossessed  starving  helpless people. As to itsdoubtful purposes  this war will never be justified fromthe point of view of ethics and international law. Thoseresponsible for it will one day be judged by history.Cuba has opposed this war from the verybeginning as an absurd  inefficient method to eradicateterrorism  and reiterates that it can only bring morehatred and ever-increasing dangers of new actions ofthis kind. No one has the right to continue murderingchildren  aggravating the humanitarian crisis andvisiting impoverishment and death on millions ofrefugees.If the United States obtained a military victory byeliminating all regular and irregular Afghanresistance — something that is not at all easy inpractice and extremely costly on a moral level  for itwould represent a real genocide without attaining theobjective that we must pursue — the world would befarther away than ever from achieving peace  securityand the eradication of terrorism.Cuba’s discourse is not founded on ill feelingsagainst the country that has been our most pitilessadversary for over 40 years. It is inspired by a sincere constructive spirit and a sense of respect for andsympathy towards the people of the United States which suffered an unjustifiable and atrocious terroristattack. It is also based on the aspiration for peace andjustice for all the peoples of the world.What Cuba expresses in this Hall  with fullopenness  may not be to the liking of those who run theUnited States today  but it will be understood one dayby the American people  whose generosity and sense ofjustice were proved to the Cuban people when it hadthe support of 80 percent of the public opinion in thiscountry in our struggle to prevent a kidnapped Cubanchild from being torn away from his family andsubjected to ludicrous political manipulations and cruelpsychological tortures.What Cuba is saying from this rostrum  as wewell know  is what many people have been saying inthe corridors of this building. What internationalcoalition are we talking about? What is its legitimacybased on if it has started by scandalously disregardingthe General Assembly? The United States has notfostered international cooperation. It has ratherimposed its war on a unilateral basis and has stated inan unprecedented way that whoever does not secondthem is for terrorism. How long will the precarioussupport obtained last  since it is not based onharmonized objectives and voluntary agreement  but onthe imposition of will through threats and pressures?You can be the strongest  but not necessarilyright. You can inspire dread  but not sympathy andrespect. Only from genuine internationalcooperation — in which all countries  big and small participate with a full understanding of everyone’spositions  with broadmindedness and tolerance in the21methods used  within the framework of the UnitedNations and the strict respect for the principlesenshrined in its Charter — can a truly effective andlasting alliance emerge to fight terrorism.The world was surprised to learn of the officialannouncement of the United States to the SecurityCouncil that it reserved the right to decide on an attackagainst other countries in the future. What is left of theCharter after this? Can this unprecedented threat byany chance be interpreted as an exercise of the right tolegitimate defence  enshrined in the Charter as the rightof a State to deal with acts of aggression until theCouncil adopts the necessary measures  and not as avulgar excuse to unleash attacks against othercountries? Is this announcement  or is it not  theproclamation of the right of a super-Power to trampleupon the still fragile and incomplete standards thatprotect the sovereignty  security and rights of peoples?Cuba calmly and firmly rejects that language. Wehave not done so out of concern for our own security because there is no power in the world that can subdueour spirit of independence  freedom and social justiceand the courage to defend it at any cost. We did so because we believe that it is still possible to halt theescalation of a useless  brutal war that threatens tofurther plunge into hopelessness  insecurity and deaththe poor peoples of the planet  who are by no meansresponsible for any act of terrorism  but will be — andalready are — the main victims of this senselessness.Only under the leadership of the United Nationswill we be able to defeat terrorism. Cooperation  andnot war  is the way. The coordination of actions  andnot the imposition of will  is the method. Our objectivemust be to obliterate terrorism by removing its rootcauses — and not the hegemonic assertion of thestrength of a super-Power  thus turning us intoaccomplices to its arrogance and arbitrariness.Therefore  Cuba — which has already respondedto the Secretary-General’s appeal by deciding toimmediately ratify all of the international legalinstruments on terrorism — resolutely supports theadoption of a general convention on internationalterrorism. Of course  this will be possible only in thecontext of the General Assembly  which — though nowcompletely ignored by those who are promoting thenew campaign — has  over the past 10 years  despitethe silence and apathy of the Security Council  adoptedthe principal resolutions and declarations calling for anoutright combat against terrorism.This will allow us finally to define terrorism withaccuracy. We have to prevent attempts from beingmade by a handful of actors with vested interests to tryto label as such the right of nations to fight for theirself-determination or against foreign aggression. Itmust be clearly established that the support  abetting financing or concealment of terrorist actions by a Stateis also an act of terrorism.Cuba  which is working on its own anti-terrorismlaw  which should be in effect shortly  unreservedlyendorses the proposal to convene an internationalconference on terrorism under the auspices of theUnited Nations. This has been a longtime aspiration ofthe Non-Aligned Movement and should enable us  as aresult of open discussions  collective action andrespectful and non-discriminatory agreement — andnot of threats  terror or force — to find a way to fullyeliminate terrorism and its causes. Here I am speakingof terrorism committed not only against the UnitedStates but against any other country — even ifemanating from the territory of the United States  ortolerated by  or with the complicity of  its authorities as has been Cuba’s painful experience for over fourdecades.Only four days ago  the Pakistani mediaattributed to a character who is well known and veryfamiliar to the United States a statement supposedlymade from Afghan territory saying that he haschemical and nuclear weapons and is threatening to usethem against the United States if it uses similarweapons against Afghanistan.Everybody knows that Afghanistan does not havethe slightest ability to produce or launch nuclear orchemical weapons. Only a terrorist organization orleader could come up with the idea of executing anaction of this kind using nuclear or chemical weapons.Of course  theoretically this could be possible  as aconsequence of the irresponsible behaviour of themajor nuclear Powers and as a result of the arms trade corruption and illegal trafficking in all sorts of militarytechnology. Indeed  several of those Powers have actedas accomplices to  and taken part in  the traffic infissile material and the transfer of nuclear technology as suits their interests. However  in reality  given theconditions of war in Afghanistan  it would beridiculous to resort to those threats. To do so would be22to show tremendous political and military ignorance. Ifone lacked such means  this would be a dangerousbluff  and if one did have them  it would be absolutemadness to threaten to use them.If the threats contained in the statement publishedby two Pakistani newspapers are true  they deserve thestrongest condemnation  as would the eventual use ofsuch weapons against Afghanistan. That would be astupid reaction  since  under those circumstances  theonly thing that poor  suffering country would have togain would be a universal condemnation of the use ofsuch weapons. Such threats serve only the interests ofthe extremist and belligerent forces within the UnitedStates  which favour the use of the most sophisticatedweapons of mass destruction against the Afghanpeople. The best weapon for a country that is thevictim of aggression is to earn and keep the sympathyof the world  and not to allow anyone to violate theethical principle that no one has the right to killchildren  not even if others are doing it. There is nojustice in killing innocent people to avenge the death ofother innocents.Cuba has stated without hesitation that it isopposed to terrorism and to war. Cuba  which is notunder obligation to anyone  will continue to beconsistent in its positions. Truth and ethicalconsiderations should prevail above all else.The way events have unfolded  the increasedlevel of hatred and the intensification of passions andpotential dangers have shown the absolute truth of theassertion that war has never been  is not  and never willbe the way to eradicate terrorism.The most critical socio-economic crisis ever —the result  halfway through the last decade  of theresounding and irreversible failure of neo-liberalismand neo-liberal globalization — has been dramaticallyaggravated by this war  which was imposed by one sidebut whose consequences we all have to bear.This war must be stopped  not only because itsconsequences for the Afghan civilian population  butalso because of the danger of destabilization in thatregion. It must be stopped in order not only to savethousands of Americans — mostly young — andthousands of Afghans and other nationals from asenseless death  and not only to preserve internationalpeace and stability  but because this conflict makes itimpossible to achieve the objective set by the UnitedNations 15 years ago: the right to development for all and an equal opportunity to attain it  and because itrenders obsolete the decision made only a year ago towork together in order to eliminate poverty from theface of the Earth.Will we be willing to organize a coalition againstpoverty  famine  ignorance  diseases and the scourge ofAIDS that is currently decimating the Africancontinent; a coalition for sustainable development  forthe preservation of the environment and against thedestruction of the planet?A coalition has been assembled to avenge thegrievous and unjustifiable death of over 4 000 innocentpeople in the United States. Let us come together toseek justice for this great crime — and let us do sowithout war; let us come together to save from deaththe hundreds of thousands of poor women who dieduring childbirth every year; let us come together tosave from death the 12 million children who die ofpreventable diseases before the age of 5 every year inthe third world; let us come together to bring medicinefor AIDS to the 25 million Africans who today arehopelessly awaiting death; let us come together toinvest in development at least a portion of the billionsalready spent on bombing a country in which almostnothing has been left standing.Cuba demands that the General Assembly  theSecurity Council and the United Nations Organizationas a whole take up once again  as top priorities  thedebate of these problems on which depend the lives of4.5 billion inhabitants of the third world  whose rightsand hopes have also been buried under the rubble ofthe World Trade Center.Cuba reiterates its categorical condemnation ofthe terrorist acts committed last 11 September. Cubareiterates its condemnation of terrorism in all its formsand manifestations. Cuba reiterates that it will notallow its territory ever to be used for terrorist actsagainst the people of the United States or of any othercountry.Cuba has the will to do this because it hassuffered terrorist acts for over 40 years; because inCuba there are still the relatives of the nearly 3 500Cubans killed as a result of acts of aggression andterrorism; and because justice is still demanded by themore than 2 000 Cubans disabled by acts of aggressionand terrorism. Some of Cuba’s sons and daughters whofought against terrorism have become the victims of23cruel persecutions  merciless treatment and unjust andslanderous trials.The people of the United States are victims notonly of terrorism and panic but also of the lack oftruthful information  manipulation and the questionablecurbing of their freedoms. Cuba does not nurture anyhatred towards the American people  whom we do nothold responsible for our suffering caused by terrorism acts of aggression and the unfair economic war that wehave had to withstand during almost an entire lifetime.We share with the American people the aspiration ofone day having relations based on respect andcooperation.If anyone here takes offence at these wordsuttered on behalf of a small  generous and courageouspeople  I apologize. We speak in a straightforwardmanner. Words exist to uphold the truth  not to concealit. We rebel against injustice and oppression. We havethe moral resolution. We defend our ideals with ourlives. Our support can be won for any just cause  butwe will not be overcome by force  or allow absurdslogans or shameful campaigns to be forced upon us.For many years now  we have proclaimed that forus Cubans  the historical dilemma is: “Motherland orDeath!” From this comes our confidence and surenessthat we are and will continue to be a worthy  sovereignand just people."
"42",1776,"CYP",56,2001,"﻿I would like to extend mywarmest congratulations to you  Mr. President  on yourwell-deserved election as President of the fifty-sixthsession of the General Assembly. I also extend myappreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri  forhis effective leadership during his presidency.The heinous terrorists attacks of 11 Septemberhave undeniably transformed international relations.The United Nations is called upon to reinforce itsprimary role as the standard bearer of the principlesthat will shape the new environment and unitehumanity in the pursuit of justice  tolerance  the dignityof human beings  respect for human rights  thepromotion of peace and zero-tolerance for the darkforces of terrorism.On behalf of the Government and people ofCyprus  I reiterate our deep condolences and sympathyto the American people for the tragic loss of innocentlives caused by the abhorrent terrorist acts of 11September. We unreservedly condemn these barbaricacts  which we consider to be attacks against the valuesand principles of humanity.The community of nations must individually andcollectively take concerted and resolute action againstterrorism. We believe that there is no justification orexcuse for terrorism and  at the same time  we rejectany notion of linking this scourge with any particularreligious faith or ethnic group. We renew ourcommitment to implement fully Security Councilresolutions on terrorism  in particular resolution 1373(2001). Cyprus is actively participating in the commoneffort. It has ratified or acceded to nine of the 12international conventions pertaining to internationalterrorism. Furthermore  we expect an early ratificationof the most recent Convention for the Suppression ofthe Financing of Terrorism  which is already before theHouse of Representatives.The Council of Ministers of the Republic ofCyprus approved on 20 September a comprehensiveproposal for the establishment of a task force to combatinternational terrorism.The United Nations continues to be faced withold and new tasks: globalization  good governance protection of the environment and the need forsustainable development. The elimination of povertyand pandemics  securing a world free from the threat of2weapons of mass destruction and maintaininginternational peace and security remain high on theagenda. That is why we consider it imperative and theduty of each and every Member to provide thenecessary resources and support to our Organization.Cyprus strongly supports the implementation ofthe commitments we undertook last year in theMillennium Declaration. We also advocate thestrengthening and rationalization of the United Nationssystem  and we welcome the commitment of theSecretary-General  Kofi Annan  to strive for a betterand more just world. We congratulate him on the awardof this year’s Nobel Peace Prize  which is well-deserved recognition of the central role of the UnitedNations and a tribute to its achievements  as well as tohis personal devotion and commitment.At the beginning of this new millennium  we havea special obligation to place new emphasis on thepromotion and the protection of human rights and thedefeat of terrorism.However  the adoption of declarations and legalinstruments in the area of human rights is not enough.We need to make accountable those violators of humanrights and decisively strike at the culture of impunity.This is why Cyprus strongly supports the early entryinto force of the International Criminal Court.We are also deeply concerned with the increasingnumber and scope of humanitarian emergencies leadingto an ever-rising number of refugees and internallydisplaced persons. The plight of these unfortunatepeople merits special attention and coordinated action.The tragic events of 11 September havehighlighted the need to continue and accelerate effortsto prevent and resolve regional conflicts. The inabilityof the international community to put an end to theunacceptable situation in the Middle East underminesthe credibility of the system of collective security.Cyprus  as a neighbouring country with close relationsto the peoples of the region  is particularly pained bythe continuing cycle of violence  the tragic loss ofinnocent human lives and the plight of the Palestinianpopulation.We look forward to a region living in peace stability and security for all States  including the Stateof Israel. We reiterate our support for the fulfilment ofthe inalienable rights of the Palestinian people including the creation of their own State. We urge bothparties to work immediately towards finding ways toput an end to this cycle of violence and to respect theprovisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Weconsider the implementation of the recommendationsof the Mitchell report as an absolutely necessary firststep in this direction. Cyprus reiterates its long-heldposition for the implementation of Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).We follow the situation in the Balkans withparticular interest. Cyprus supports the implementationof Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) on Kosovo.We hope that the forces of peace and reconciliation willprevail and welcome the recent positive developmentsin the country. We support respect for human rights andfundamental freedoms  including the right of return ofrefugees and the return of property of displacedpersons  and the principle of the inviolability ofborders and territorial integrity.Resolution of the Cyprus problem is longoverdue. I cannot conceal my deep disappointment shared by the Security Council in its statement to thePress of 26 September  at the refusal of the Turkishside to continue with the proximity talks to help theSecretary-General’s efforts to find a comprehensivesettlement. The refusal of Turkish Cypriot leaderMr. Denktash  with the support of Ankara  to resumethe talks that he abandoned a year ago  despite theofficial invitation extended by the Secretary-General inSeptember  is particularly disturbing.The Secretary-General is now trying to invigoratethe process of negotiation. Therefore  in order tofacilitate the Secretary-General’s effort  I will refrainfrom making remarks that normally I would havemade  other than to identify the reason for the failure tomake progress  which is the lack of political will on thepart of Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leader Mr. Denktash.The Turkish side has abandoned the concept of abi-zonal  bi-communal federal Cyprus  which SecurityCouncil resolutions have provided as the basis for thesolution. The Turkish side is also calling theinternational community to accept the so-calledrealities  which is the legalization of Turkey’soccupation of 37 per cent of Cypriot territory  in breachof international law  the forceful expulsion of GreekCypriot refugees from the occupied area and thesubsequent importation of 120 000 settlers frommainland Turkey in an effort to change the3demographic character of Cyprus. As is well known the international community  through a plethora ofUnited Nations resolutions  has repeatedly rejected thispolicy. Acceptance of these so-called realities wouldcreate a very dangerous precedent in internationalaffairs  striking at the very heart of the cherishedprinciples of State sovereignty and territorial integrity.I would like to refer to the purely humanitarianproblem of missing persons  the resolution of whichremains one of the most pressing issues for theGovernment of the Republic of Cyprus and for allCypriots.Unfortunately  Mr. President  I must once againreport to you that the agreement on missing persons of31 July 1997 between Mr. Rauf Denktash and myself providing for the exchange of information and forinformation on the location of graves of Greek Cypriotand Turkish Cypriot missing persons  has not beenimplemented because of the continuing negativeattitude of the Turkish side. We appeal again to theGovernment of Turkey to show the necessary politicalwill in order to bring a final solution to this tragichumanitarian issue and abide by the l0 May 2001judgement of the European Court of Human Rights.In the face of current difficulties  we do notdespair. Our vision for Cyprus is a departure from thepassions of the past. History is often described as thebest teacher of wise men. We see as the future of ourcountry: a reunited federal State  member of theEuropean Union  with human and other rights of eachand every citizen fully protected under the process ofdemocracy and the rule of law. We see a State with asingle citizenship  sovereignty and internationalpersonality  a demilitarized State enjoying the fruits ofits labours in the wider European family  while at thesame time playing its rightful role in our immediateregion of the Eastern Mediterranean.I recommend to the leadership of Turkey that itabandon its threats to annex the occupied part ofCyprus. I urge them to consider the obvious advantagesof the solution of the Cyprus problem for stability inour region  the consolidation of the Greco-Turkishrapprochement and the promotion of Turkey’saspirations to join the process of European integration.I urge the Turkish Cypriot leader  Mr. Denktash to join me in sharing the vision of a Cyprus too smallto be divided but huge for the common prosperity of allits inhabitants. I urge him to look to the future and notto the past  to listen to the increasingly desperatevoices of our Turkish Cypriot compatriots and stopplacing obstacles  at each turn  to the good offices ofthe Secretary-General for a solution to the Cyprusproblem.It is noteworthy that the economic prospects for apost-settlement Cyprus are truly impressive. Thisgrowth will be even greater for our Turkish Cypriotcompatriots  who are currently suffering because of thedire political and economic situation in the occupiedarea. Tragically  almost 50 per cent have been forced totake the cruel road of emigration. The Turkish Cypriotswill benefit considerably from the accession of ourcountry to the European Union.I urge Mr. Denktash to realize that he and I arenot getting any younger and that we owe it to theyounger generations of Cypriots to do away with thewalls of division. For my part  I reiterate my readinessto engage in the process of negotiations with thenecessary political will and good faith for finding a fairand viable solution based on the United Nationsresolutions  meeting the legitimate interests of allCypriots."
"43",1800,"CZE",56,2001,"﻿Let mecongratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election to thepresidency of the fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly and wish him every success in this importantpost. At the same time  I take this opportunity to offermy most sincere congratulations to the Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  and the entire United Nations onthe occasion of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize award  andto express my gratitude for their determination todefend the ideas of tolerance and mutual respect amongnations.Allow me to extend my own and my country’sdeepest sympathy to all those who lost loved ones inthe horrible terrorist attacks of 11 September. We aredeeply moved by the unspeakable tragedy and share thegrief of the American people and of all those affected.We perceive the horrifying attack as an attack againstthe entire civilized international community against theprinciples of freedom  democracy and peace  theprinciples upon which the Organization stands. In theaftermath of the attacks of 11 September  the conceptsof security  peace and solidarity are acquiring a newand distinct meaning. We recognize the growinginterdependency of individual actors on theinternational scene. The dangers of the new threats andrisks that confront our civilization come to theforefront. To conquer them we must not only moveenergetically against the perpetrators  but alsoconcentrate on the causes that propel them.At the same time  we are witnessing significantprogress leading to the creation of new relationships inthe international community. The fact that we wereable to create such a wide anti-terrorist coalition soswiftly is very encouraging indeed. It is imperative tostrengthen that coalition and enable it not only to fighteffectively against terrorism but also to contribute tosolving other pressing problems  especially thosewhose solution will strengthen the struggle againstterrorism by reducing tension and promoting justiceand stability. The current  unusually wide  internationalcoalition against terrorism presents  I believe  a uniqueopportunity that we should seize. We should do ourutmost to make it effective and operational. We shoulddo our utmost not to let it collapse for reasons thatwould not stand up to the inevitable future scrutiny ofour sons and daughters. We should do our utmost toavoid the trap of allowing the struggle againstterrorism  the struggle for peace  justice  stability andcoexistence  to be replaced by a clash of civilizations by the very war that Osama bin Laden is calling for  bya war against Islam. That would be a tragedy.The international community has at its disposalgreat potential to address even the most complexproblems and crises. It must now reach an agreementon how to approach them and on which tools it willemploy to address them. International organizations and the United Nations specifically  play anirreplaceable role in this process.The Czech Republic is determined to contributeto the search for effective ways to meet the mostpressing challenges of today and to support theinternational response to terrorism and the actionsundertaken so far  especially if the military operationcontinues to be targeted as accurately as possibleagainst military targets  in this  it is hoped  the finalstage of the Taliban’s defeat. We view these actions aslegitimate and in accordance with the United NationsCharter and United Nations Security Council resolution1368 (2001). Today more than ever we feel it our dutyand obligation to preserve and cherish the uniqueness as well as the open and universal character  of theUnited Nations and push more decisively for astrengthening of the role we have entrusted to it.When we approach these most pressingchallenges we must be proactive. For its part  theCzech Republic is determined to carry its share. TheCzech Republic has submitted its candidacy for thepresidency of the fifty-seventh session of the General8Assembly of the United Nations. We hold this highlydemanding and prestigious position in great respect andare determined to actively participate in the realizationof the demanding tasks ahead of us  in the mostresponsible manner. We are prepared to be attentive toyour voices and concerns and to serve the entiremembership. We obviously wish to help with theimplementation of the Millennium Declaration including the eradication of extreme poverty and theintegration of human rights into every aspect of ourwork  as we were so eloquently reminded by Secretary-General Kofi Annan a few days ago. We need to inchforward the necessary reform of the United Nationssystem  strengthen the role of the United NationsGeneral Assembly  help to challenge themarginalization of important continents such as Africa Latin America and parts of Asia. We need also to helpthe United Nations to play an effective role in thestruggle against international terrorism.It is clear that accomplishing the objective offinding and bringing to justice the perpetrators of theattacks on the United States is most urgent and topical.However  other phases can be embarked upon at thesame time. I agree with the President of Pakistan General Pervez Musharraf  who said at this Assemblythat a three-pronged strategy is needed: first  to go afterthe main culprits  the individual terrorists; secondly  tomove decisively against the terrorist organizations; andthirdly — what in my opinion is very important — toaddress unresolved disputes  which proliferatethroughout the world and must be resolved in a helpfuland just manner. As I listened carefully to speechesdelivered here over the last few days by many leadingpoliticians of the world  I was pleased to confirm myconviction that not only the Czech Republic or theEuropean Union  but also many other countries arguethat the fight against terrorism should combine thenecessary military operations with  above all  decisiveattempts to eradicate the root causes of terrorism. It istherefore necessary to pay far greater attention toconflicts that provide fertile soil for terrorism  becauseif conflicts remain unresolved for decades  they giverise to feelings of frustration  despair andpowerlessness or  as the President of the IslamicRepublic of Iran put it  to alienation  extremism andlawlessness. Political solutions of conflicts  many ofwhich are essentially political conflicts  will reducetensions  promote peace and fairness and  especially take the wind out of the sails of those who put forwardthe absurd myth that terrorist actions can bring aboutanything other than loss of the lives of innocent peopleand the exacerbation of problems and conflicts.In our fight against terrorism we need to look forcomprehensive solutions and to that end employ allavailable tools to identify  isolate and destroy theterrorist networks and to combat terrorism as a whole.Our anti-terrorist striving must equally concentrate oncombating international organized crime  peoplesmuggling  and drug and arms trafficking. On thefinancial front it is necessary to cut terrorists off fromtheir resources. A determined focus on preventingmoney-laundering is a crucial aspect of this effort.Long-term and extensive development assistance aimedat alleviating the most pressing problems of thedeveloping world should be an integral part of theseefforts by the international community.The Czech Republic sees the upholding of theunity and operational readiness of the internationalcoalition combating terrorism as the most imperativetask of the day. We  the international community should not lose this unique opportunity but should takedecisive action. The fight against terrorism is a long-term mission and will have an impact on all aspects ofour lives. At the national level  the Czech Republic ispreparing a national plan for combating terrorism which is inspired by the Action Plan of the EuropeanUnion.In recent weeks the United Nations has shown itsrenewed resolve to combat international terrorism. Wecommend the Security Council for its swift action andwe support the adoption of Security Councilresolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) to combatthreats to international peace and security caused byterrorist acts. The Czech Republic is taking allnecessary steps towards the full implementation of theprovisions of resolution 1373 (2001)  and fullysupports the actions of the relevant Counter-TerrorismCommittee.My strong belief in the need for political anddiplomatic moves does not in any way suggest that oneshould negotiate with the terrorists. Just the contrary.Terrorists have to be defeated and brought to justice.There can be no negotiations with the terrorists. Theevil of terrorism must be eradicated. The fight againstterrorism has a higher priority than ever before  andnobody can stay neutral in this fight. The CzechRepublic is proud that it was able to offer both militaryand humanitarian help to the efforts led by the United9States. The Czech Republic is proud that some of itshelp was accepted and thus that some of our bestsoldiers can now actively contribute to these jointendeavours.As I have said  conflicts can be a breeding groundfor terrorism. Terrorism fully exploits unresolvedconflicts and profits from their expansion. Thereforeour intensified fight against terrorism pointsunequivocally to the need for the internationalcommunity to pay far greater attention to conflictresolution in various regions. The United Nations mustcontinue its major role in maintaining peace andsecurity throughout the world by applying an integratedapproach of conflict prevention  peacekeepingoperations and post-conflict reconstruction.Recognition of the roots of conflicts andeducation towards tolerance must be incorporated intoour preventive strategies. We fully support theimplementation of the comprehensive overhaul of thepeacekeeping operations as proposed by the Brahimireport (A/55/305) and other recent reports focusing onthis issue. The recent liberation of Mazar-e-Sharif innorthern Afghanistan  and even the most recent fall ofKabul  improve our possibilities of supplying theAfghan people with the humanitarian aid that they sobadly need. That must remain at the forefront of ourendeavours. We should do our utmost to alleviate thesuffering of the innocent Afghan people. I believe thereis an extremely important role for the United Nationsto play in the consolidation of the post-Taliban AfghanState that is so desperately needed. We should fullysupport the current efforts of the United Nations  andespecially those of Ambassador Brahimi  to form assoon as possible a stable  broad-based Government thatwill reflect the ethnic diversity of the country. I agreewith Foreign Secretary Jack Straw that the oneinstitution in the world that can deliver that betterfuture is the United Nations.The greatest tensions today undoubtedly prevailin the Middle East. It is regrettable that much of theprogress achieved in the past few years seems to havebeen squandered. But the uphill struggle that faces usthere is no reason for doing nothing and letting thingsget worse and would only mean that more people willsuffer and die. The Czech Republic is a traditional andactive supporter of the peace process in the MiddleEast. We cannot reconcile ourselves with the currentsetbacks. The political violence must be halted.Diplomatic initiatives aimed at bringing the partiesback to the negotiating table must be fully supported.The Czech Republic fully supports the right of thePalestinians to their own viable and independent State.Nevertheless  its final shape should be the result ofbilateral Palestinian-Israeli negotiations with the fullbacking of the international community.The international community has beenencouraged by the change in political leadership in theBalkans  which offers a new opportunity to securegenuine peace and economic reconstruction. Theupcoming local parliamentary elections in Kosovo willbe an important moment in the stabilization process. Ishould like to use this opportunity to pay tribute to theSecretary-General and his Special Representative inKosovo  Hans Haekkerup  for their work in the region.Our admiration also goes to the United Nations InterimAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and theKosovo Force (KFOR).In Africa  despite some progress  not onlypoverty and AIDS but also armed conflict remainmajor challenges to the United Nations and the entireinternational community. Although the destiny of thecontinent lies in the hands of the Africans  theinternational community should strengthen its efforts toassist Africa in its struggle to achieve durable peaceand especially to acquire higher levels of development.The struggle to reduce poverty has to stand at theforefront of our joint endeavours. Debt relief andmarket access are crucial elements of the economicdevelopment of developing countries. The UnitedNations must continue with its activities to promotesustainable development and continue its programmesaimed at providing basic health care and education fighting the HIV/AIDS pandemic  and averting thedevastation of the environment. A gender perspectiveshould be included in all these efforts. The gapbetween the rich and poor countries continues to growand is further exacerbated by the imbalance in thedistribution of globalization benefits. The digital divideis just an additional symptom of the growing disparitybetween the developed and developing countries. TheUnited Nations  in cooperation with nationalgovernments  the Bretton Woods institutions  the WorldTrade Organization (WTO)  the private sector  the non-governmental sphere and civil society  must beprepared to address the challenges of globalization. Inshort  we should respond to the globalization of capitalby the globalization of solidarity and social justice.10We need to create a functioning internationallegal environment in order to prosecute crimes againsthumanity. The Czech Republic fully supports the entryinto force of the Rome Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court  an institution that I believe will be agreat asset for the maintenance of international law.The protection of human rights will continue to shapethe fate of human society. Human rights are universaland indivisible  and it is in the interests of UnitedNations Member States to support their Organization inits strenuous effort to secure the protection of humanrights in today’s globally interconnected world. Wemust not remain indifferent to manifestations ofracism  xenophobia  religious or political persecution discrimination against minorities  violence againstwomen or the violation of the rights of the child regardless of where they take place. In this regardallow me to mention the World Conference in Durban South Africa. However difficult the negotiations haveshown themselves to be  they point to the fact thatextreme intolerance and terrorism are closelyinterlinked.The implementation of United Nations reform isimperative in order to make the work of ourOrganization more effective. As I said at the beginningof my statement  as a candidate for the presidency ofthe fifty-seventh session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly  I fully support the reaffirmation of thecentral role of the General Assembly  the revitalizationof its work  and improvement of its proceduralmethods. Equally  the reform of the Security Council including its enlargement in the categories of bothpermanent and non-permanent members and limitationof the veto  would enhance the authority of that body.A re-evaluation of the application of the sanctionsmechanism must also play an important part in theCouncil’s work. The United Nations  more than anyother international forum  is where people of allcultures and religions meet. We come here fromvarious parts of our planet to solve the problems oftoday’s world. Despite our different backgrounds wegather here to approach the problems that face usbound by the universal human values that unite us. Thehighest of them all is the value of human life. We havebeen tragically reminded that we need to promote theculture of peace and to build an environment in whichthe principles of these universally shared values willtake root. Now more than ever we must strive toovercome our differences and be guided by ourcommon interests. Let us unite our efforts and ensurethat our work during this session of the GeneralAssembly contributes to a better  safer and more justworld."
"44",1862,"DEU",56,2001,"﻿Only a few moments ago  we were informed of thecrash of a commercial airliner not far from here  inQueens. At the moment  we do not know the cause ofthis disaster  but we are shocked and horrified. I wouldexpress to the bereaved families and to the Americanpeople our sincere condolences and sympathy.It has been only two months since thousands ofinnocent persons lost their lives in the World TradeCenter here in New York. Today  we are seeing theextent to which the people here have been affected. Inthe entire history of the United Nations  there has neverbeen a situation like this one.Throughout the world  people have expressedtheir sincere solidarity with and commiseration for thevictims and their families. These horrific terroristattacks struck not just Americans  but also innocentpeople from over 80 countries  members of all themajor world religions and cultures. They targeted usall. It must therefore be a common concern of humanityto prevent a recurrence of this tragedy or indeedsomething even worse.The events of 11 September thrust a dangerousfuture upon the world. We now live in the terribleknowledge that no country in the globalized world isinvulnerable and that enemies within  who aredetermined to kill and to die  can perpetrate massmurder at any time. This eerie  awful danger has at astroke dramatically altered the foundations of securitypolicy as we know it. The fight against internationallyoperative terrorist networks will require new responsesfrom the community of States. International terrorismis a challenge above all for politics  the military  thepolice and the judiciary  as well as for the economyand — very importantly — for culture. At the dawn ofthe twenty-first century  the issue of peace and securityhas thus taken on an entirely new perspective.Humanity has rarely been as united as it was onthat terrible day two months ago. This unity was bornnot only of horror and compassion  but also of therealization that we can successfully counter this newdeadly threat only if we combine our full force andenergy. The day of 11 September was a definingmoment that altered the direction of world politics. Anew alliance was created. It must now be strengthenedand developed into a genuine partnership. If this isachieved  11 September could go down in history notonly as a horrific day for humanity  but also as thebeginning of a new era of cooperation andmultilateralism.What drives people to commit theseinconceivable crimes and to blow up themselves andthousands of innocents? From where does suchuncontrollable hatred come? How can it be curbed?How can it be conquered? It is certain that in anyattempt to develop an effective counter-strategy wemust  while waging the war on terrorism  analyse thefull range of causes and circumstances that permit suchhatred and violence to grow.The United Nations is uniquely suited to the taskahead. It provides the forum required for the creation12of a universal coalition. Only it can give internationallegitimacy to the response to terrorism. It has at itsdisposal the instruments to manage political conflictsand the underlying development problems that nurturehatred and despair.A comprehensive strategy against terrorism mustconcentrate primarily on prevention. Developing such astrategy means nothing less than drafting a policy for acooperative world order for the twenty-first century  apolicy that no longer tolerates areas characterized by abreakdown of order  a policy that has as its goal aworld order under which all peoples can claim theirfull and equitable share. This includes makingeconomic globalization more socially just for morepeople and supplementing it with the politicalglobalization so urgently needed.The Security Council responded to 11 Septemberwith rare solidarity and  with resolutions 1368 (2001)and 1373 (2001)  took decisions on concrete internationally binding anti-terrorism measures thatpoint the way ahead. The General Assembly  too severely condemned the terrorist attacks and called forjoint action against international terrorism.This path must now be rigorously pursued withthe rapid and universal ratification and implementationof the 12 United Nations anti-terrorism conventionsand the adoption of a comprehensive convention oninternational terrorism. We must endeavour anew tobring this project  on which we all place so much hope to a successful conclusion. I therefore call upon allStates that have not yet approved the presentcompromise to reconsider their position.The International Criminal Court can also becomea valuable instrument in the fight against terrorism.Under article 7  paragraph 1  of its statute  it will havejurisdiction to try cases of murder “when committed aspart of a widespread or systematic attack directedagainst any civilian population”. There can be no doubtthat the attacks on New York  Washington andPennsylvania fulfil this requirement. For this reason  Iwould like to ask you all once again to ratify the RomeStatute as quickly as possible.The attack on the World Trade Center was awake-up call to the profound threat to world peace thatcan be posed by failing States. Areas where politicaland social order has collapsed offer terrorists a safehaven from which they can organize their murderousnetworks worldwide. The community of States urgentlyneeds to take a closer and preventive look at theproblem of failing States — but not just inAfghanistan  and not only after a catastrophe hasoccurred.No conflict prevention measures have ever beenundertaken in Afghanistan. Far from it. This hasproved to be a fatal error. For more than 20 years  ahumanitarian catastrophe has been playing itself outbefore the eyes of the world  in which women andchildren  in particular  have suffered. Civil war  humanrights violations and abject misery have also been thenourishing ground for the unprecedented symbiosisbetween the terrorists of the Al Qaeda group and theTaliban regime.From there the trail leads directly to the horrificattacks in the United States. As hard as this decisionmay be  without the use of military means  this threatcannot be averted. We must not forget that the sufferingof the people in Afghanistan is above all the work ofthe Taliban. It was the Taliban that  long before 11September  increasingly impeded effectivehumanitarian relief  robbed women and girls of all theirrights and actively supported terrorism  also with thegoal of destabilizing Arab and Muslim States.Not to react would indeed be to invite furtherterror and oppression and would be extremelydangerous for world peace. The dramatic nature of thisthreat is illustrated by Osama bin Laden’s statementthat he will not shrink from using even nuclearweapons. Civilian means alone are unfortunately notalways enough to put an end to violence and terror.This was the case in the Balkans.In Afghanistan  too  the root of the tragic conflictis profoundly political  and so the solution  too  canultimately only be a political one. It must come fromwithin  must reflect the diversity of peoples in Afghansociety and must be accepted by the Afghan people.But a peaceful solution also requires assistance fromthe international community. Afghanistan must not beleft alone with its problems yet again.A clear political and humanitarian perspective forAfghanistan is now crucial. The United Nations shouldbe the coordinating agency for all peace efforts. It isindispensable as the framework for the politicalprocess and as the guarantor of internal agreementswithin Afghanistan. Only a peace process under theauspices of the United Nations will succeed inexcluding external involvement in the future and13ensuring a peaceful future for the country in harmonywith its neighbours. Germany and the European Unionare willing to play their part towards a politicalsolution for Afghanistan and to participate in the longterm in the economic and social reconstruction ofAfghanistan.More than anything  the refugees and the civilianpopulation must be helped. We cannot tolerate the factthat the Taliban is hindering humanitarian access and isusing the civilian population as a shield. Especiallybecause of the approaching winter  we must doeverything in our power to provide the people with atleast the most basic necessities and to alleviate theirdespair and hardship. Is it possible to establishhumanitarian protected areas  to use the expulsion ofthe Taliban from Mazar-e-Sharif and other towns toimprove the humanitarian situation  and to make atown like Kabul an open city? Of course this will bevery difficult  but let us nevertheless think withouttaboos about absolutely all ways in which we couldhelp the people. As chair of the Afghanistan SupportGroup  Germany has issued an invitation to a meetingin Berlin at the beginning of December. I appeal to allStates to make a great humanitarian effort now and tocome to the aid of the downtrodden Afghan people.Solving regional conflicts will be of criticalimportance in the fight against terrorism. The MiddleEast conflict is a top priority. Our hearts go out to themany innocent victims on all sides. Both the Israeli andPalestinian peoples have a right to live free of fear  indignity and in peace. This is indivisible not only fromIsrael’s right of statehood  as recognized in Madrid —which is  in our view  inviolable — but also from itssecurity. Germany bears a special responsibilitytowards Israel stemming from its past. Any policy thataims at destroying Israel by means of terrorism orotherwise will face determined opposition fromGermany. However  we equally advocate thePalestinians’ right to self-determination and their rightto their own State  Palestine. In the European UnionBerlin Declaration of March 1999 we stated that “thecreation of a democratic  viable and peaceful sovereignPalestinian State on the basis of existing agreementsand through negotiations would be the best guaranteeof Israel’s security”. This is truer today than everbefore.Never before has there been broader internationalbacking for a solution to the Israeli-Palestinianconflict. The Mitchell recommendations still form thebasis for the timetable accepted by all sides  and intheir spirit we call on Israelis and Palestinians alike toput an immediate and lasting end to violence andconfrontation  to resume the agreed direct talks withoutdelay and to seriously implement the negotiatedceasefires. These talks must lead to genuinenegotiations on a viable political solution.The real aim of the terrorists is to trigger a clashof civilizations and to inflame the situation in the Nearand Middle East. Under no circumstances can we allowourselves to be drawn into such a conflict. We arefighting international terrorism  not Islam.We must counter the terrorist strategy designed tobring about the clash of civilizations with a dialogue ofcultures and religions. We need a spiritual debate basedon mutual understanding that attempts to reach genuineagreement on the fundamental values that unite us.Such a dialogue presupposes the existence of sharedvalues  but also respect for other traditions anddifferences between peoples. However  one thing mustbe clear: human rights are universal  not Westernvalues. Consensus was reached on them by theinternational community of States in the Charter of theUnited Nations and the human rights conventions.Any dialogue must build on the universality ofhuman rights. It must be conducted with respect for thedignity of all involved  in tolerance and openness. Itmust start at home  within cultures themselves. It canbear fruit only if it is pursued free of all constraint.And it has a purpose only if all participants are alsoready to offer self-criticism.The insidious anthrax attacks since 11 Septembershow that the threat from weapons of mass destructionin terrorist hands  which yesterday seemed abstract  istoday a real and deadly danger. The community ofStates must do everything in its power to counter itwith a new push for non-proliferation and globaldisarmament.The dangers of the dissemination of weapons tonon-State groups and of regional arms races requirenew answers and effective  internationally enforceablecriminal sanctions. In the nuclear field  thecommitment contained in the Non-Proliferation Treatyto complete nuclear disarmament remains crucial. Asregards biological weapons  in view of the acute threat effective global control mechanisms must finally becreated. The Chemical Weapons Convention must bemore rigorously implemented. All States are called14upon to participate in the negotiation of aninternational code of conduct on ballistic missileproliferation.The fight now beginning against terrorism mustbuild on the awareness that the first world cannot in thelong term live secure and safe from the tensions andconflicts of the third world. Almost one quarter of theworld population is starving. Ninety-five per cent ofthose infected with AIDS live in developing countries.Africa is particularly hard hit. At present only aminority of the world’s citizens profit from theopportunities for growth offered by globalization andfrom the use of the new information technologies. Thisstate of affairs cannot be accepted  even by the richcountries — for moral reasons  but also becausetensions and conflicts today spread much more quicklyand widely than ever before.The battle against poverty cannot be won unlesswe take equally determined steps to preserve thenatural resources on which life depends. At the comingWorld Summit in Johannesburg we must make aquantum leap forward towards sustainabledevelopment  improved poverty eradication and bettermanagement of our natural resources. The KyotoProtocol must enter into force next year. And we muststrengthen the sole advocate of the global environment the United Nations Environment Programme institutionally  operationally and financially.11 September made it horrifyingly clear that thehuman race will not be able to live in peace andsecurity in the absence of political order at the globaland regional levels.Germany will continue to do its utmost to bringabout the strengthening of the United Nations and itscapacity to act  so that the world will be a morepeaceful  just and humane place in the twenty-firstcentury than it was in the twentieth century. The futurebelongs to responsible governance for one world governance based not on hegemonic claims  but oncooperation  solidarity and multilateralism. If togetherwe succeed in implementing such a policy  we will notjust ultimately win the war against terrorism but willalso be able to eradicate its roots forever."
"45",1900,"DJI",56,2001,"﻿In viewof the catastrophic events that took place on 11September  it is only fitting that first and foremost weonce again offer our deepest condolences to theGovernment and people of the United States. This wasa hateful and diabolical act of terrorism that claimedthousands of precious human lives and caused untoldphysical destruction  without parallel in history. Thisbrutal attack has put us all on notice. It was truly theday the world changed.One way or another  this tragedy affects us all.Not a single country is immune from terrorism inasmuch as it is beyond the capacity of any one27country to counter it. The international communitymust work together  ideally through the UnitedNations  so that the counter-measures take the form oflegitimacy and acceptability. In this respect  SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) provides us with thenecessary framework.We in Djibouti have already established a suitablemechanism to counter terrorism  in all its aspects  thatcould come from our territory. We are also in theprocess of examining the existing internationalconventions and protocols on terrorism with a view tosigning and ratifying them all. However  while doingall this  we must not lose sight of the plight of thepeople of Afghanistan — the terror  the desperationand the starvation facing impoverished people duringthis grave crisis. Also  we must not squander theextraordinary opportunity we now have to examine allpossible or probable causes and deep roots ofterrorism  including attitudes  frustrations and currenteconomic and political conditions.May I join the delegations that preceded me tooffer the President our congratulations on his brilliantelection as President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-sixth session. His vast experience anddemonstrated capacity and skills will indeed be vital toour deliberations. We also wish to express ourappreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri ofFinland  whose leadership at the fifty-fifth session hasresulted in tangible achievements.Permit me also to congratulate Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan on his re-election and for the work heaccomplished during his first term  most notably forthe extent to which he was able to institute much-needed reforms and restore the relevance and centralrole of the United Nations  while enhancing itscapacity and effectiveness. He has recognized that fartoo many people live on the margins of society reduced to silence by endemic poverty  debt  the AIDSpandemic  tuberculosis and malaria. He has  in effect become the voice of the world’s silent majority. It isnot by chance  therefore  that  together with theOrganization he heads  he has received the NobelPeace Prize. We congratulate him wholeheartedly forthis distinct and rare honour bestowed upon him andthe United Nations system.May I pay tribute to the Secretary-General for thebreadth and relevance of his report on the work of theOrganization. The United Nations has a vital role toplay in today’s rapidly evolving world  and the reportoffers a comprehensive update on all its activities. Withreference to peace and security  as the Secretary-General has stressed  we must all be struck by thenumber of conflicts raging in the world today.Preventing the recurrence of conflict is a centralpriority  and this means that our focus needs to shiftfrom a culture of management and control to one ofprevention and long-term development.Besides conflict  we are witness to enormoushuman suffering caused by natural disasters andcomplex situations that continue to grow in scale escalating the need for humanitarian assistance.We are pleased to note that the Secretary-Generalcontinues to place importance on the fight againstendemic poverty and that the international communityhas launched a sustained campaign to make the right todevelopment a palpable reality for everyone. Theparticipation of the poor must become a priority inorder to eradicate rural poverty  to ensure the well-being of children and to strengthen the earningpotential of women.If we are to reduce by half the number of peopleliving in poverty by 2015  as called for in theMillennium Declaration  we must substantially increaseOfficial Development Assistance  alleviate the debtburden of the poorest countries and dismantle theprotectionist barriers of developed countries. The LeastDeveloped Countries  in particular  face enormousobstacles  such as declining inflows of capital inadequate social services and the lack ofinfrastructure  in addition to environmental constraints.In essence  the Brussels Declaration and Programme ofAction for the Least Developed Countries for theDecade 2001-2010 call for an increase in foreigncapital inflows  including Official DevelopmentAssistance; direct foreign investment; an expansion ofdebt relief; greater preferential market access andincreased technical assistance.Silently but very quickly  the world is driftingtowards another dangerous crisis: water scarcity. By2025  one in every three people worldwide will beaffected by the lack of water. Some 2.7 billion peoplelive in regions facing severe water shortages and  onceagain  Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa  which are themost densely populated areas and among the areas ofleast income  will be the hardest hit. Currently  450million people living in 29 countries  including my28own  Djibouti  are experiencing acute drinking watershortages. Unlike oil and most other strategicresources  drinking water has no substitute. Whetherwater is needed for drinking  agriculture orenvironment-related purposes  such as the survival oflakes and rivers  we have on our hands a potentialcrisis that risks causing an unprecedented disaster forfood security and the fight against hunger and poverty.A combination of global warming  wasteful habits aridity and the lack of rainfall means that the watersources millions traditionally rely on are now slowlydrying up. There is no longer enough water for all ourneeds. Beyond the international treaties andinstitutional mechanisms  the international communitymust act to mitigate this crisis. Now is the time to act.While the recent international terrorist attacks inthe United States have rightly dominated the world’sattention  other pressing problems  such as the AIDSpandemic  must still be urgently attended to. Thespecial session of the General Assembly devoted to thisscourge  held in June  took a decisive step towardsfinding collective solutions  actions and commitments.However  there is still concern that these non-bindingcommitments may not be carried out. The global AIDSfund launched by the Secretary-General has made someprogress  but contributions to date have fallen far shortof the expected target. We are now unfortunatelyfamiliar with the statistics of deaths and the social andeconomic devastation caused by this scourge particularly in Africa. In the search for a solution andwhat measures to take  the debate has centred ontreatment versus prevention. Ideally  the best hopewould be for a preventative vaccine  but that solutiondoes not look promising. As one expert put it  “We areat the end of the beginning of this epidemic  not at thebeginning of its end!”The growth and exponential spread ofinformation technology  coupled with the demise of thecold war  have  over the past decade  been determiningfactors in shaping our views on development and theglobal economy. With the advent of globalization  tradeexpanded  capital flowed  investments increased economies liberalized and barriers to trade werelowered. In addition  the private sector took on acentral role.Unfortunately  as many have correctly observed the number of countries and individuals excluded fromthe benefits of this phenomenon has risen inexorably.The attempt to explain this dichotomy has led to manytroubling conclusions. For the poverty-stricken wholive on $1 per day  talk of technology  economicgrowth  opportunity and prosperity is no more thannice-sounding words. Their greatest daily concern isthe fear of not having enough to eat. Finding enough toeat is a daily challenge for more than three billionpeople on this planet. Despite the conflicts in Africacurrently making headlines  it is the precariousexistence of those left behind that has defined life onthe African continent for more than two generations.Whatever the reasons for this endemic poverty the fact remains that unless we address the problem ofpoverty in all its aspects  we will not get to the roots ofthe problem. It is well known that millions of people inAfrica and throughout the world are simply too poor toparticipate in the phenomenon of globalization and thusmiss out on the benefits of globalization. The Presidentof the World Bank has aptly put the issue of poverty inperspective:“... if you cannot deal with the question ofpoverty  if you cannot deal with the issue ofequity  then you are not dealing with the questionof peace.”He added:“We will not solve the problems of poverty orglobal peace or stability unless we change ourperception of poor people from the objects ofcharity to an asset on which you can build a betterworld.”The persistence and spread of poverty hamper allefforts for peace  security  development  democracyand good governance. Peace and security requireincreasing and strengthening the United Nationscapacity to prevent crises  to react to emerging threatsand to implement peace-building programmes. In thisregard  the Security Council has a preponderant role. Itis obvious that our inability to reform the Council sothat it can respond to the needs of the internationalreality of today can only diminish the legitimacy of itsfunctioning and decisions.During the fifty-fourth session of the GeneralAssembly in September 1999  my President  IsmailOmar Guelleh  outlined a series of proposals on the re-establishment of peace in Somalia. A year later  duringthe fifty-fifth session  he related to this Assembly theextraordinary sacrifices and burdens borne by theGovernment and people of Djibouti  together with a29number of Governments and organizations of goodwill  to bring together the true representatives of theSomali people so that they might seize control of theirown destiny and forge a new direction for theirdevastated country.Ultimately  after eight months of intense anddifficult negotiations at Arta  Djibouti  in August 2000 the Somali State was reborn through the establishmentof the Transitional National Government  the NationalAssembly and other institutions. The course has notbeen easy  but the Transitional National Governmenthas persisted and pursued its commitments  gaining therespect  sympathy and support of the internationalcommunity  despite myriad attempts to undermine itsefforts to achieve lasting peace.The Transitional National Government is areality. It represents the will of the people of Somalia who have spoken and made their choice. As myPresident has repeatedly stated  if we wish to saveSomalia from disintegration and chaos  we musteschew the standard practice of revolving around a fewall-too-familiar individuals who held the Somali peoplehostage for a decade. He suggested  inter alia  that itwas time to move beyond them  to restore power to thepeople  and for the Somali people to assume leadershipand responsibility for their own destiny.We are gratified that the Transitional NationalGovernment is fully committed to bringing aboutlasting peace in Somalia through a constructive spiritof dialogue and tolerance. Building upon the outcomeof the Arta process  the Transitional NationalGovernment has consistently and tirelesslydemonstrated its unwavering commitment toreconciling with its adversaries without preconditions.Its efforts to that end have been greatly appreciated bythe Organization of African Unity and by the SecurityCouncil. Both entities have recently condemned thoseindividuals and faction leaders who remain outside theArta peace process and who stubbornly persist inblocking the peace efforts in Somalia.In this respect  the efforts of the President ofKenya  Mr. Daniel Arap Moi  earlier this month tobring some of these recalcitrants into the Arta processare to be strongly commended. That is what is expectedof us; it is a moral and political duty we owe to thepeople of Somalia. That was the message of theSecurity Council’s presidential statement on Somalialast month:“[T]he situation in Somalia and the objective oflong-term regional stability can most effectivelybe addressed if neighbouring States play apositive role  including in the process ofrebuilding national institutions in Somalia.”(S/PRST/2001/30  p. 2)While the Republic of Djibouti is not in the habitof challenging anyone on the veracity of informationwithin their purview  it has nonetheless a moral duty toissue a caution about the source  motivation  accuracy objectivity and reliability of such information particularly as it relates to the crucial and sensitiveissue of the existence of terrorist cells in one country oranother. I am convinced that close consultation andcooperation with all countries in the region on thisimportant issue will yield realistic and impartialinformation in the assessment of any particularsituation. It must be pointed out  however  that hasteand rash  uncorroborated conclusions will only harmthe unity of the international coalition againstterrorism  which we all vigorously support.At a time when the attention of the internationalcommunity is squarely focused on the issue ofterrorism  the brutality and destructive force usedagainst the Palestinians have increased dramatically.Israel has created the conditions for chaos and anarchyto justify its reoccupation and even annexation ofPalestinian territory. The recent incursions representthe broadest military operations in years in Palestinian-controlled territory. Each day we drift closer to anunacceptable conflagration between two parties that areunequal in power  means  resources and internationalinfluence.Insisting on a ceasefire without offering anythingin return  Israel is determined to pursue its defiance ofinternational opinion. Living conditions in theoccupied territories continue to be seriously affected bythe Israeli blockade. Rising unemployment  failingbusinesses  falling incomes  restrictions on themovement of goods and people and the banning ofconstruction while Jewish settlement activitiescontinue all combine to inflame an already incendiarysituation. One wonders  therefore  what more theIsraelis want to hear than the imploring words ofPresident Arafat: “Let us go back to implementing theaccords. Let us go back to saving the peace processwith no conditions and no military pressures.”30We call on Israel to relinquish Orient House andother Palestinian offices in and around Jerusalem. Wealso urge it to return to the negotiating table and among other things  to implement the proposalscontained in the Mitchell Committee report. Israel mustrelease the millions of dollars in tax money owed to thePalestinian Authority in order to alleviate the economicand financial hardships inflicted upon the Palestinianpeople.In the final analysis  Israel’s security largelydepends on the implementation of the principle of aviable Palestinian State. We hope that the internationalcommunity will also commit itself to restoring dignityand respect to the Palestinian people. Like all peopleseverywhere  they have a right to live in peace and toenjoy a decent existence.In our subregion of the Horn of Africa  there hasbeen some reduction in hostilities despite lingeringdifferences and antagonisms. The people in that area ofthe world have suffered too long and desire nothingmore than a relaxation of tensions  the free movementof people and goods  lasting peace  stability development and cooperation. It is high time that wedevoted our meagre resources to development and toimproving the living conditions and meeting the needsof our own people. Let us give our people a break and abetter future.Djibouti truly believes in regional cooperation good-neighbourliness and the opportunities they canafford for all our people. We are committed to workinghand in hand with our friends in the subregion toresolve outstanding issues in complete harmony andtrust. As a nation  we are challenged by scant resourcesand declining international assistance  which have beenexacerbated by the huge influx of drought-affectedpeople and economic migrants. Our capital city  inparticular  is overburdened by an influx of peopledisplaced by drought or political tensions in the region thus further straining our limited infrastructure andsocial services. We appeal to the internationalcommunity to help us overcome these unsustainablechallenges and pressures that have been with us for toolong and are beyond our limited means."
"46",1921,"DMA",56,2001,"﻿I am pleased andhonoured to address the Assembly on behalf of theGovernment and the people of the Commonwealth ofDominica. I wish to extend my congratulations to you Sir  and your country  the Republic of Korea  on yourelection to the high office of President of the fifty-sixthsession of the General Assembly  confident that yourproven diplomatic skills will serve you well in guidingthe affairs of the General Assembly with efficiency andpurpose. Your immediate predecessor  Mr. HarriHolkeri  is most deserving of our thanks andappreciation for the very able manner in which hepresided over the Millennium Summit and the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Permit mefurther to congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  on his election to a second term and on theaward of the Nobel Peace Prize to him and the UnitedNations.This general debate is being conducted in unusualcircumstances. The horrendous terrorist acts of 11September 2001 have altered the lives of many in waystraumatic and fundamentally tragic. I must againextend deepest condolences and pledge the full supportand solidarity of the Government and the people of theCommonwealth of Dominica to the Government andthe people of the United States of America and to allbereaved families  including those who lost their lovedones on flight 587.The ripple effects of those acts have resonated inlocations far removed from New York City Washington  D.C.  and Pennsylvania  aggravatingeconomic and social conditions and seriouslydisrupting efforts aimed at meeting the manychallenges confronting the United Nations and theinternational community. In short  in one way oranother and to a lesser or greater degree  we are allvictims of those acts of terrorism that were visitedupon the United States of America two months ago.The Commonwealth of Dominica condemns without reservation  what is undoubtedly the worstterrorist act of our times. We are in strong accord withthe sentiments and mandates contained in SecurityCouncil resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) andGeneral Assembly resolution 56/1  all of which call2upon the international community to take unified andcooperative action to prevent and eradicate acts ofterrorism. We understand the need for the exercise ofthe right of self-defence in pursuit of those objectives and we support the actions being taken to bring justiceto the perpetrators  organizers and sponsors of theterrorist acts of 11 September 2001.Cognizant of the importance of internationalcooperation in the fight against terrorism  Dominicahas proceeded to establish a task force to put in placethe necessary legislative and executive measures forthe implementation of Security Council resolution 1373(2001). But to be effective beyond the immediatecrisis  counter-terrorism measures  mechanisms andstrategies must be sustained through a comprehensiveapproach that seeks to create and strengthen  throughthe United Nations  a legal framework againstinternational terrorism  complemented by strenuousefforts aimed at improving the social and economicconditions which adversely affect the poor anddispossessed.Beyond the immediate peace and security issuesaffected by the events of 11 September  there has beena considerable impact on the global economy  whichhas been thrown into an accelerated decline  withconsequences that are particularly disturbing for smalldeveloping countries like the Commonwealth ofDominica. In the Caribbean there is strong evidence ofdamage to vital sectors of our economy  such astourism  financial services and agriculture. The actualand projected losses of jobs in the region are in thethousands  and for those countries that were alreadyexperiencing fiscal pressures the prospect of higherunemployment and decreased revenues is daunting.Complicating the problem is the great concernthat in the fight against terrorism and in the drive toenforce counter-terrorism measures  certain areas inwhich developing countries in the Caribbean regionhave a competitive advantage  such as the financialservices sector  may be subjected to inordinate pressureand be unfairly targeted and linked to illegal activitiessuch as money-laundering. We are convinced that well-regulated  competitive tax jurisdictions should betreated separately and distinctly from illegal activitiessuch as money-laundering. The Commonwealth ofDominica remains firmly committed to the struggleagainst international terrorism to the same extent thatwe strive to ensure that our financial services sector  amajor pillar of our economic diversification thrust does not provide support to the perpetrators of criminalactivity in the financing of terrorism.The current effort against international terrorismis important  and our focus on that activity iswarranted. There are  however  other dimensions of theglobal agenda which should command the attention ofthe international community and the United Nations.They cannot be relegated to the back burner of ourconcerns. They comprise a wide range of economic social  political and humanitarian problems faced on adaily basis and  for the most part  by the poor anddisadvantaged of the world. Indeed  some of them arelikely to be exacerbated by the fight against terrorism and their successful resolution will continue to be thegreatest challenge of the United Nations and theinternational community.At the Millennium Summit last year there wasgeneral agreement on the issues needing urgentattention and the goals to be achieved. One year laterthose goals appear to be as far from being realized asever. Commitment appears to be lacking on all fronts.The objective of a 50 per cent reduction in the numberof persons living in poverty worldwide by the year2015 suffers from the perennially tepid effort to dealwith the root causes of poverty. Contributions from theindustrial countries are woefully inadequate  and therequired adjustment of the strategies of theinternational financial institutions is slow in coming.The outcome is less than desirable in creating andmaintaining an enabling environment for the moreeffective management of projects geared to povertyreduction.That lack of commitment is evident in otherareas. A year after the Millennium Summit and sixmonths after the General Assembly special session onHIV/AIDS  the international community seems to havelost interest in a crisis that the Secretary-Generallabelled the greatest public health challenge of ourtimes. As front-page news  HIV/AIDS claimedattention for only a short time after the special session but the disease claimed millions of lives last year andcreated millions of orphans in sub-Saharan Africa which continues to have the highest rates of infection.The Caribbean region ranks a close second.The Global Fund for AIDS and Health proposedby the Secretary-General is clearly not realizing itsspending target of $7 billion to $10 billion  and will notbe able to achieve the stated goal of reversing the3spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015  as declared by worldleaders at the Millennium Summit. The majority ofpeople infected with HIV/AIDS live in the developingworld and the high incidence of HIV/AIDS infection isconsidered a function of poverty. The circularity of theproblem has tremendous implications for economicdevelopment  poverty reduction and efforts to raiseliving standards in developing countries. The acceptedpremise is that international development cooperationplays a vital role in the development of the mechanismsnecessary for enhancing the trade competitiveness ofdeveloping countries  strengthening financial systems and developing human resources  but that role isclearly undermined by the declining trend in officialdevelopment assistance (ODA).Once again we see the lack of commitment to thefulfilment of a stated goal. It is generally accepted thatwere industrialized countries to meet their promisedofficial development assistance of 0.7 per cent of grossnational product (GNP)  the countries of thedeveloping world would be much nearer to solvingmany of the problems with which they are plagued. Asa substitute for the failed promise  developingcountries have been told to place greater reliance onforeign direct investment  most of which bypasses themost needy and the smallest economies. TheCommonwealth of Dominica falls into that category ofStates for which official development assistance isvitally critical to the development of their economies.That is why the Commonwealth of Dominica and otherStates in the region attach such importance to theconvening of the International Conference onFinancing for Development  which will be held inMexico from 18 to 22 March 2002. Given the changingglobal realities that are impacting adversely on theeconomies of developing States  the Conference willprovide an opportunity for us to assess the impact ofdeclining official development assistance and forcreating new mechanisms for financing development.Over the past several years and in many differentforums  particularly in the World Trade Organization(WTO)  we have been calling for the formalrecognition of the special problems facing smallvulnerable economies. We fear that without suchrecognition it will be impossible for small States to befully integrated into the multilateral trading system ofthe globalized world. Our fears have been confirmedboth by the generally poor performance of small Statesunder WTO arrangements and by a very authoritativereport by the World Bank and CommonwealthSecretariat on the issue of smallness and vulnerability.The unique characteristics of small vulnerableeconomies  which have been articulated in numerousstudies  give a clear indication of the challenges thatthese economies face in improving their developmentprospects and in adjusting to liberalization andglobalization. Many of these economies are at acrossroads. The reality is that trade preferences areeroding; official flows are declining  while historicalties with former partners in development are fading. Itis therefore imperative that in order to prevent furthermarginalization of small economies  steps must betaken in the multilateral trading system and elsewhereto address the concerns of those economies and toensure their growth and development.The exclusion of the Republic of China onTaiwan from membership of the United Nations makeslittle sense in today’s world of globalization andinterdependence  particularly in light of the fact thatthis sovereign State  with a democratically electedGovernment  is the world’s seventeenth largesteconomy  the fifteenth largest in international trade  theeighth largest foreign investor  the fourth largest interms of foreign exchange reserves  and the thirdlargest exporter of information technology (IT)products. The Commonwealth of Dominica intends nointerference in the internal affairs of any MemberState  nor can such interpretation be validly applied toour action. Our plea is a simple call for justice for the23 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwanand an appeal for the recognition of their right to betreated in international affairs no differently fromcitizens of any other country.The eleventh of September 2001 will undoubtedlybe remembered for the horrifying nature of the terroristacts  the magnitude of the senseless destruction of livesand property and the forced recognition of our commonvulnerability. But the heroism  the extraordinaryfortitude and selflessness of ordinary men and women and the demonstrated triumph of the human spirit overthe worst manifestation of evil  inspire us to hope thatwith dedicated commitment we can create for allmankind a world that is measurably better than thatwhich we have today. The time to begin is now."
"47",1965,"DNK",56,2001,"﻿The Danish Governmentassociates itself with the statement made by theMinister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium on behalf ofthe European Union.On 11 September a brutal blow was delivered tothe people of the United States of America. At thesame time  it was a strike against the foundations of theUnited Nations and against its mission to secure peaceand prosperity for mankind in a spirit of collaborationand shared values. Extremists have seen fit to take thelives of thousands of innocent people to press theirmessage. The Danish people have reacted with outrageand sorrow. We strongly condemn the criminal andcowardly act; our thoughts and our compassion arewith the victims  their families and their friends.This year the Nobel Peace Prize went to theSecretary-General and to the United Nations. May Icongratulate both the Secretary-General and the UnitedNations and its staff. The choice could not have beenbetter or the timing more acute.The horrific terrorist attack on the United Stateschanged the agenda of the General Assembly. From theoutset  the international community has demonstratedits resolve to confront the menace of terrorism. TheGeneral Assembly and the Security Council havepassed resolutions unanimously condemning in thestrongest terms the terrorist attacks  and countries andother international organizations have followed with ahost of other initiatives to that end. The internationalcommunity has stood up to the challenge united.Denmark welcomes the broad coalition ofcountries that has rallied behind the United Statesresponse to the terrorist attacks in order to effectivelybring to justice the perpetrators  organizers andsponsors of international terrorism.By acting together  by acting resolutely  byredoubling our efforts  we will stop the terror. At theinternational level  we need the United Nations toprovide the norms and the international legalframework required to define and criminalize acts ofterror. The United Nations has already put importantparts of the legal machinery in place with the 12existing conventions aimed at combating specific formsof terror. Furthermore  work is well under way towardsa comprehensive convention on international terrorism.At the national level  countries must urgently takeconcrete steps to implement Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001). States must have nationallegislation in place in order to prosecute personssupporting or committing acts of terrorism. At the sametime  countries must be ready to take steps to precludein all possible ways the operation and financing ofterrorist networks within their territories. All countriesshould accede to and enforce the 12 conventionsagainst international terrorism and should ensureprompt follow-up of Security Council resolution 1373(2001).Three weeks ago  the Danish Governmentsubmitted a draft bill on national follow-up in ourParliament  and I can assure the Assembly thatDenmark will do its utmost to cooperate with theCounter-Terrorism Committee established pursuant toresolution 1373 (2001).These measures form part of our overall efforts tocreate a better world  in which human dignity isguaranteed and human rights and fundamentalfreedoms are fully respected. Indeed  recent eventsunderscore further the need to make the world a betterplace  in particular for those vast groups of people wholive in poverty. For poor people who see no possibilityof improving their economic and social standing turning to extremist religious and ideological viewsand networks may be tempting. We need to secure realpolitical  economic and social opportunities for theworld’s poor and disadvantaged.The goals identified by world leaders during theMillennium Summit give our work direction in thedecades to come.35Armed conflicts cause inconceivable humansuffering and material destruction and are often themain obstacles to development. An effective responseto present-day conflicts requires a long-term politicalcommitment from a united international community inthe form of a diplomatic  political  economic  militaryand civil engagement. The United Nations is theinternational body vested with a universal mandate tosecure support for conflict prevention. Often  it is alsothe only body capable of legitimate conflictmanagement. Thus many people around the world aredependent on the effective and prompt reaction of theUnited Nations.Fortunately  we have in recent years witnessedquite a number of successful United Nationsoperations. Let me single out three examples  in threedifferent parts of the world.First  in East Timor the United Nations presencehas furthered political progress towards the building ofa new nation State  set for May next year.Secondly  the United Nations Mission in Ethiopiaand Eritrea has demonstrated the readiness of theinternational community to resolve conflicts and hasstrengthened the credibility of United Nationspeacekeeping in Africa. That Mission also marked thefirst and successful deployment of the MultinationalUnited Nations Stand-by Forces High ReadinessBrigade (SHIRBRIG).Thirdly  the day after tomorrow is an importantmilestone for the United Nations InterimAdministration Mission in Kosovo and for the peopleof Kosovo. Hopefully  the latter will participate ingreat numbers in the elections. The DanishGovernment has noted with satisfaction that both theSerbian and the Yugoslav Governments have endorsedKosovo Serb participation in the elections.However  other conflicts  not least in Africa continue to cause tremendous suffering to the peopleaffected and to challenge the international community.The prevention and management of violent conflictshave therefore become an integral part of Denmark’scomprehensive engagement in developing countries.The United Nations has a unique role to play inhelping Afghanistan to rebuild itself and to re-enter theinternational community. Denmark strongly supportsthe work of the Special Representative of theSecretary-General  Ambassador Brahimi. We are readyto contribute further to the ongoing relief andhumanitarian efforts  as well as to the immense taskthat lies ahead: reconstructing Afghanistan.A conflict of particular concern is that in theMiddle East  which threatens to escalate beyondcontrol. The Mitchell report and the Tenet Plan stillprovide important windows of opportunity. The UnitedNations  the European Union  the United States andneighbouring States must redouble their efforts to getthe parties to take immediate action to stop theviolence and to create the atmosphere necessary torestart negotiations.The Millennium development goals provide theframework for each and every country to act in aconcerted fashion on a range of key developmentchallenges.In this connection  I should like to refer to theSecretary-General’s road map for the implementationof the Millennium Summit Declaration  in which hestated that we have just emerged from an era ofcommitment and stressed that we must now enter anera of implementation. This timely reminder has ourfull support.The last 10 years have seen more countries thanever before commit themselves to a democratic andaccountable political system. This trend is encouraging.Open societies committed to democracy are morelikely to respect the rule of law  human rights andfundamental freedoms and to foster accountablegovernments. National responsibilities fordevelopment  as expressed through good governanceand the promotion of human rights and democracy  arekey to the peaceful settlement of conflicts and essentialtools for economic development. The New Partnershipfor Africa’s Development is an encouraging step in thisdirection.In building on these positive trends  we must goeven further. We must take concerted steps forward ona whole range of key issues  from security  humanrights and trade to development.In this regard  our planning prior to 11 Septemberis now showing unexpected rewards. The World TradeOrganization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Doha the International Conference on Financing forDevelopment in Monterrey  and the World Summit onSustainable Development in Johannesburg are all partof the same  global process. They are a unique36opportunity for us to show that multilateral cooperationin the economic field can make a difference and thatwe can achieve globalization with a human face.Our primary target is clearly to eradicate poverty.This objective should be at the heart of theinternational effort in the coming weeks and months.We need a “Global Deal” that encompasses all humanbeings  with the aim of achieving long-term sustainabledevelopment  based on global coherence betweeneconomic  social and environmental policies.Thus  we need partnerships between developedand developing countries; between all developmentactors  including the wider United Nations family comprising the WTO  the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)  and drawing uponcivil society and the private sector. All partners need tobe on board to achieve a balance between national international and systemic endeavours.The Financing for Development Conference inMexico  to be held in March 2002  is a first andimportant opportunity to demonstrate our new resolveon development. We could leave Monterrey withimportant elements of a global framework that wouldhelp us pull an unprecedented number of people out ofpoverty over the coming 15 years. The human andsecurity benefits at stake are compelling.We face a great responsibility in the days  weeksand months ahead. Both developed and developingcountries need to set their priorities straight in order tostrike this Global Deal. In that sense  a globalcommitment to realizing the national potential fordevelopment of the developing countries should bemet  in the spirit of partnership  by the developedcountries  with full support for reaching these goals.We also reiterate the call on the industrializedcountries to grant more generous developmentassistance and to increase their official developmentassistance so that  as a minimum  it reaches theestablished United Nations target of 0.7 per cent ofgross domestic product that is necessary to achieve theMillennium goals.Recent events have demonstrated thatinternational cooperation is indispensable. The UnitedNations is the right forum for dealing with many ofthese challenges. Let us equip the Organization to meetthem effectively. By closing a Global Deal  we can takedevelopment forward on the broad front."
"48",2010,"DOM",56,2001,"﻿I address this General Assembly grief-stricken at the death of 260 people in the tragicaviation accident yesterday in this city of New York.Most of the individuals stricken were  like myself  ofDominican nationality. Our profound appreciation goesto the heads of State and Government  to Ministers andto representatives who have expressed theircondolences to the people and Government of theDominican Republic at this tragedy. I am much obligedto you  Sir.On behalf of the Government of the DominicanRepublic I offer our congratulations to the President onhis election to the stewardship of this session of theGeneral Assembly  convinced as we are that he willindeed succeed in guiding this session in the very bestinterests  and for the good  of the internationalcommunity. Likewise  we offer our most heartfeltcongratulations to the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  on his having been awarded the Nobel PeacePrize. That honour  together with that bestowed uponthe United Nations  proves and ratifies the confidenceand recognition felt for the work being done by theinternational community represented in thisOrganization on behalf of all mankind.Despite the fact that in September this year — onthe heels of the events of 11 September in New Yorkand in Washington  D.C. — the United Nations devoted11a number of plenary meetings to the issue of terrorism it is still today impossible for us to separate this fromthe other items that we must deal with on the agenda ofthis session. The significance of these tragicdevelopments is of such magnitude that it is imperativefor us  as a matter of conscience  to stop and think ingreater depth about their complexity and theirrepercussions on the history that it is our lot to have tolive through  and about the most relevant ways for usto prevent and combat this scourge. That is so becauseit is plain to see that in the time that has elapsedbetween September and these days of November  wehave managed to go further and into greater depth gaining new insights about the terrorist phenomenon.We absolutely agree with those who have alreadyspoken that terrorism cannot be justified in any way and that the excuses some would seek to advance tovalidate these deeds based on the existence of certaineconomic  social  cultural or political situations  areunacceptable. However paradoxical it may seem tosome  the conviction has also been stressed that  whileterrorism is unjustifiable and inexcusable  it is in thosevery situations where terrorism finds its breedinggrounds  where frustrations and lack of prospects canfan hatred and irrationality  where being shut out andhaving no hope  being shunted to the sidelines andsuffering from poverty can incubate and give birth andimpetus to twisted feelings of indiscriminate andirrational vengeance.Faced with the sad reality of the events of 11September just past  we are absolutely convinced thatthe direction set for us by the Millennium Summit wasthe right one  that is  the path of peace and offellowship among people. At that historic gathering therationale was analysed and the framework set foraction by the international community to promotehuman rights  security  disarmament  economicdevelopment  equality of nations  and the fight againsthunger  poverty  disease  exclusion  social  racial andgender prejudice  and the abandonment of children  thedisabled and the elderly. There can be no doubt thatthese are the priority objectives for the prevention ofviolence and crime  that is to say  for the struggleagainst wars  against genocide and against terrorism.The full weight  pain and inhumanity of theprovocations of 11 September must not divert us fromthe goals that we set for ourselves in the MillenniumSummit Declaration  nor draw us into anydisproportionate violence. When last month weaddressed this Assembly we stated that the most prizedvirtue  indeed the democratic essence of thisOrganization  that is of the United Nations  is itscommitment and determination to uphold respect forhuman rights. It follows that although we know thatterrorism is the antithesis of that virtue  we must nottherefore act to confront it while failing to live up tothe obligation to protect those very rights. While actingin a legitimate reaction of self-defence  we should notbe overcome by a spirit of retaliation but should ratherseek to apply international law and justice. That is whythe Dominican Republic cannot ignore the politicalmeasures that surely will also contribute to preventingand combating terrorism. Thus  we must resolutelysupport Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) adopted on 28 September  and feel ourselves alsobound by earlier resolutions and covenants the UnitedNations has worked out over time in its fight againstterrorism.In 1945 the United Nations Charter highlighted asits core concern the need to preserve peace. That wasonly to be expected after a war that had brought deathto millions of human beings and had wreaked havoc inthe life of many nations. The time that has elapsed hasbrought us to the conviction that there is no better wayto preserve peace than to do all that we possibly can toprevent war. The United Nations is ever morenecessary to attain that end  because within it we findthe underpinnings for promoting a healthy and creativeunderstanding among nations. Our fidelity to thefoundations of the Organization must be backed up bya shared political will leading to actions that proveirrefutably that we believe in and live up to what wesay and promise.The unanimous adoption of the MillenniumDeclaration  inasmuch as it represented a profoundcommitment by the vast majority of the world’sleaders  amounted to a kind of rebirth and renewal ofthe United Nations in coming to grips with theproblems and challenges confronting us in the twenty-first century. In that Declaration it was decided to doall that we could to establish a just and lasting peace inaccordance with the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter  and the determination wasreaffirmed to support all efforts aimed at ensuring thesovereign equality of States  respect for their territorialintegrity and political independence and the right toself-determination of peoples that remain undercolonial domination and foreign occupation.12That pledge makes it incumbent upon us to bringour full moral force to bear and to avail ourselves of allpossibilities afforded us by the machinery of theOrganization to resolve the conflicts that keep anumber of States around the globe in a state of war. Wehave no doubt whatever that the conflict between Israeland the Palestinian state must come to an end viacompliance with the multiple resolutions towards thatend that have emanated from the General Assembly thus honouring what we agreed upon in thatMillennium Declaration.Moreover  we set for ourselves the purpose ofspurring forward reform of the United Nations Charterand respecting the equality of the rights of nations.Ratifying the Millennium Declaration means that therecan be no delay in turning the Security Council into abody that would respond to the historic realities of thepresent world and in establishing a logical set ofdemocratic balances based on those realities. It seemsto us fair for the non-permanent members to participatein the Security Council via a rotational system thatwould give to all the same opportunity. By the sametoken  the Dominican Republic believes that it is also amatter of equity and historical realism for us to acceptthe Republic of China on Taiwan as a Member of theUnited Nations. Geopolitical reasons must not overridesituations of fact that have been recognized in bringingother States into the United Nations.In the Millennium Declaration the problem ofglobalization was addressed with the following words:“We recognize that developing countriesand countries with economies in transition facespecial difficulties in responding to this centralchallenge. Thus  only through broad andsustained efforts to create a shared future  basedupon our common humanity in all its diversity can globalization be made fully inclusive andequitable.” (resolution 55/2  para. 5)As we speak  a Ministerial Meeting of the countriesmembers of the World Trade Organization (WTO) isbeing held in Doha  Qatar. Most countries with smalleconomies are rightfully calling for the fulfilment of allthe agreements of the Uruguay Round. We hope thatthey will not be saddled with unbearable new burdens that their calls will be heard and that generoussolidarity and cooperation will be shown  as well asunderstanding of the imbalances  differences andasymmetries in the pace of development whencomparing rich countries to poor  small ones.Among the objectives of the World TradeOrganization are respect for human rights strengthening democracy and preserving theenvironment. All that will not be possible if the processof globalization is not carried out with a sincere andresolute determination to show understanding and toprovide cooperation and technical assistance to helpthe majority of the nations on this planet to achievedevelopment. How are we to understand the deadlinesset by the World Trade Organization for attainingcertain economic objectives  in some cases as soon as2003 and in others 2005  when the MillenniumDeclaration  aware of the inequalities and difficultiesfacing most nations  seeks to redress no sooner than2015 — and only to a certain degree — the poverty ofmillions upon millions of human beings whose incomeis less than $1 a day? We hope that at the conferencesscheduled by the United Nations  such as theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment and the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  light can be shed on these problems inan effective way  yielding equitable measures designedto reduce the inequalities separating peoples one fromthe other.Allow me finally to refer to an aspect mostintimately tied to respect for and recognition of humanrights  something that also coincides with theMillennium Declaration inasmuch as it refers to thedemands of women and gender equality. Indeed  theInternational Research and Training Institute for theAdvancement of Women (INSTRAW)  based in theDominican Republic  is one of the few United Nationsinstitutions located in a developing country  and theonly international institute devoted to research on andtraining for the advancement of women. The Secretary-General  in his report to the General Assemblypresented in the Third Committee on 17 October 2001 said that  notwithstanding the difficulties anduncertainties that INSTRAW has encountered in thelast two years it has managed to obtain the minimumresources for fulfilling the mandate assigned to it bythe Assembly and the Economic and Social Council.He went on to say that inasmuch as the Institutehas begun to produce tangible results via theinformation system and contact networks in creating anawareness of gender issues  perhaps the Assemblywould wish to adopt a decision on how Institute would13be able to operate productively and cost-effectivelybeyond the year 2001.Let us not let INSTRAW — that noble institution a pioneer in the advancement of women  particularly ofwomen in developing countries — perish for lack ofresources. Let us make a consistent and generousgesture  demonstrating solidarity  so that the GeneralAssembly will ensure the continued existence of thisinstitution beyond this year of 2001  by allocating inthe United Nations budget the funds necessary for it tocontinue to work towards its fruitful humanitarianends."
"49",2057,"DZA",56,2001,"﻿Thissession is taking place at a time when there is a newinternational awareness of the global nature ofproblems of peace  security and development. Thebarbaric terrorist attacks against the United States on11 September  and their alarming consequences  madeit clear that terrorism is now a factor for worldwidepolitical and economic destabilization.Algeria has conveyed its deepest sympathy to thefamilies of the victims of those horrible acts. It did sowith all the more sincerity and feeling because formore than a decade Algeria itself has been enduring thehorrors of terrorism. The international reaction to thisdevastating scourge has been a heartening collectivewake-up call. Mobilization and multifaceted action tocombat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations isnow worldwide. In that regard  Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001) unquestionably constituted amajor breakthrough. It was adopted under Chapter VIIof the Charter and obliges all States unequivocally anddutifully to outlaw terrorist activities and theirsupporters and sponsors  wherever they may be.Algeria is fully cooperating with the internationalcommunity in the implementation of that universalcollective endeavour. Algeria stresses how important itis that the resolution be strictly implemented andreaffirms the imperative need for universal adherenceto existing international anti-terrorism instruments andfor the ratification of relevant regional instruments.Algeria believes  inter alia  that the adoption of acomprehensive convention to combat terrorism isessential. For its part  my country is ready to cooperatewith other nations to achieve this as quickly aspossible.The dangers that terrorism poses to global peaceand security highlight the need for a ruthless struggleagainst it  in particular through dismantling bases andnetworks  draining sources of financing  cooperating inexchanging information and providing properequipment to countries that are victims of terrorism and reviewing permissive national legislation regardingthe right of asylum as well as the justification formurder or planning criminal activities to be committedin third countries.While the urgency of this struggle has made itpossible to achieve notable progress in a few weeks we must be unanimous in our determination if we areto confront the roots of terrorism — that is  we mustaddress the problems that constitute a breeding groundfor extremism and intolerance throughout the world.This means that Islam  a religion of peace andtolerance  cannot in any way be associated withterrorism  which is alien to its values. It alsounderscores the importance of ensuring that the anti-terrorist struggle is not aimed at any one country religion  culture or civilization.The United Nations  which has often diagnosedand analysed the state of our world  has rightlyemphasized that problems tend to be of an economic political and social nature and that their causes are bothnational and international. The denial of the right ofpeoples to self-determination  the exacerbatedphenomena of exclusion and poverty  the persistence ofeconomic imbalances  the intensification of socialinequalities  the continued deterioration of theenvironment and the pursuit of the arms race are allproblems awaiting solutions and concrete measuresthat  in many cases  United Nations forums havealready defined and adopted in many cases adopted.The commitments undertaken recently to makeglobalization a factor of integration rather than ofexclusion — in particular the objectives enshrined inthe Millennium Declaration — take on full importancehere  since they highlight the urgent need for effectivemeasures to build a stable and united world on a solidfoundation. Today  reality amply demonstrates thatglobalization  despite its enormous potential andopportunities  has not yet yielded the expected resultswith regard to the universal improvement of livingconditions. The processes to which it leads have toooften widened the existing cracks within societies andexacerbated differences among nations. This hasencouraged marginal groups to exploit the difficultsocial situations to which many peoples are subject andto promote isolationism and rejection of the other.The Declaration and Plan of Action adopted bythe Durban World Conference against Racism  RacialDiscrimination  Xenophobia and Related Intoleranceprovide a framework for inspiration and action to buildmore harmonious and fraternal relations among people.First of all  there is a need at the United Nationslevel to set aright unacceptable situations of injusticeand denial of rights. In Palestine  the serious situationthat prevails as a result of the continued Israelioccupation and its oppressive practices requires theattention of the entire international community. Itdemands urgent action to put an end to the daily trialsof the Palestinian people  who are subjected to adeliberate policy by the Israeli army of intimidation 25abuse and murder. This policy is likely to endanger theresumption of the peace process  taking the entireregion to the brink of a conflagration with incalculableconsequences.Given the situation  Algeria reaffirms its totalsolidarity with the Palestinian people and theirinalienable right to an independent State with Al-Qudsal-Sharif as its capital. Algeria urgently calls upon theinternational community to ensure the protection of thePalestinian people by sending international observersto the region.Algeria wishes to emphasize that only a solutionbased on international legality — in particular SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) — aswell as on the principle of land for peace  adopted atthe Madrid Conference  can ensure just and lastingpeace and security for all the peoples of the region  asChairman Yasser Arafat indicated in his speech thismorning. Algeria would also like to reaffirm itssolidarity with the brotherly peoples of Syria andLebanon for the restoration of their lands still underIsraeli occupation. In addition  Algeria welcomes thedecision of the Security Council to lift the sanctions onthe brotherly people of Sudan and seizes theopportunity to renew its appeal for the lifting of thesanctions on the brotherly Iraqi and Libyan peoples.The situation in the Western Sahara  where thesettlement process has been halted for more than a yearand a half  is also a source of great concern and a factorof instability in the Maghreb and in Africa as a whole.The United Nations Mission for the Referendum inWestern Sahara (MINURSO) has not been able tocontinue the implementation of the settlement plan ofthe United Nations and the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU)  though it had been accepted by the twoparties to the conflict  the Kingdom of Morocco andthe Frente Popular para la Liberación de Saguia el-Hamra y del R'o de Oro (POLISARIO)  in particularbecause of the many challenges that followed theidentification stage.Action by the United Nations in the WesternSahara  carried out through MINURSO since 1991 should be commended  and the progress made withinthe framework of the implementation of the settlementplan — in particular the identification of the electoralbody — should be maintained and consolidated. Here the two parties should be reminded of their obligationto cooperate openly and sincerely with MINURSO  toconclude the referendum process and to call upon thebodies of the United Nations that deal with this issue tostrictly respect their mandate.The unswerving position of Algeria on the issueof the Western Sahara stems from its dedication tointernational legality and to respect for the right ofpeople to self-determination. Algeria therefore supportsthe holding of a free and transparent referendum organized by the United Nations that will allow thispeople to decide on its destiny. Any effort or initiativeto settle that dispute must be part of the framework ofinternational legality and  in particular  of theresolutions on decolonization adopted by the GeneralAssembly.Elsewhere on the African continent  thedetermination of African peoples and leaders and thesupport of the international community are starting tobear fruit in the areas of conflict prevention andsettlement. The Peace Agreement concluded in Algiersin June 2000 between Ethiopia and Eritrea put an endto a devastating two-year war between those twobrotherly African countries and opened the way to apeaceful settlement of their dispute. The progress madesince the full deployment of the United NationsMission in Ethiopia and Eritrea attests to thecommitment of those two countries to strengtheningthe basis for a lasting peace and for mutually beneficialcooperation.Similarly  the implementation of the LusakaCeasefire Agreement  which has long been plagued bynumerous difficulties  is now well under way. Theinternational community must pursue its efforts tomake the settlement process irreversible and tofacilitate the inter-Congolese dialogue.Africa also welcomes the progress made in SierraLeone in the implementation of its disarmament demobilization and reintegration programmes  whichhave been made possible by the courageous anddetermined action of the United Nations Mission inSierra Leone.Despite the positive developments that haveoccurred in Angola there  UNITA continues to sowdeath and destruction among the people of that country.A return to security will require strict respect by allStates for the punitive measures laid down by theSecurity Council against UNITA.26Finally  regarding recent events in Burundi  mycountry welcomes the decision of the parties to theconflict there to establish a transitional Governmentthat guarantees the participation of all the inhabitantsof that country in the management of their own affairs.We hail the important role played by Mr. NelsonMandela in achieving understanding among the partiesin Burundi in the implementation of the ArushaAgreement.The end of the cold war eased the climate ofsuspicion and distrust that permeated internationalrelations and was replaced by a measure of optimismbased on new prospects. We hope that this optimismwill signal an end to outdated doctrines and theories ofnuclear deterrence and the balance of terror and that itwill open the way to a bold approach to guaranteeingthe security of all States. Given this qualitativetransformation in international relations  our hope ofseeing our planet forever free of nuclear weapons andother weapons of mass destruction is indeedstrengthened.The need to establish renewable internationalcooperation based on mutual interests and shared dutiesand responsibilities is more urgent than ever before.This new spirit must become an incentive for launchingcomprehensive initiatives to seek a genuineunderstanding of the problems plaguing the entireworld. In brief  we must prepare for internationalgovernance that truly reflects the requirements ofrationality  transparency  justice  democraticparticipation and responsibility  without which anydiscussion of a new world order is meaningless and ofno use to humanity.The progress that has been achieved at thepolitical and economic levels in several regions andcountries must be consolidated and enhanced throughthe international promotion of good governance. In thisrespect  the direct and indirect threats to sustainabledevelopment that jeopardize the survival of our planetrequire us all to mobilize on a vast scale in the contextof the World Summit on Sustainable Development.Urgent measures must be taken to halt the devastatingeffects of various means and types of production andconsumption that have become untenable. These mustbe transformed in a qualitative way  taking into accountthe needs of mankind as a whole.In the same vein  the ministerial conference of theWorld Trade Organization that opened in Doha twodays ago and the International Conference onFinancing for Development  to be held in a few monthsin Mexico  are promising prospects for the lastingresumption of growth in the developing countries andfor improving the living standards of their peoples.Four months ago  African countries  meeting atthe 37th Assembly of Heads of State and Governmentof the Organization of African Unity in Lusaka  clearlyexpressed Africa’s official response to the new needsand aspirations of its peoples through their solemnlaunching of the transitional process towards theAfrican Union and their adoption of the New AfricanInitiative. These steps form an integral part of thereform process undertaken over the past few years bythe African countries at the national  regional andcontinental levels to bring Africa into step with anever-changing world.Aware of the magnitude of the challenges facingthe continent and of the need to acquire a globalintegrated programme for the social and economicrecovery of the continent  African leaders at the Lusakasummit adopted a plan that was conceived by and forAfrica. Algeria  which actively participated in thecreation and drafting of the New Partnership forAfrican Development  believes that this programmewill open the way to practical solutions to theeconomic and social problems of Africa. Thus  in orderfor our Organization to bolster its credibility andeffectiveness  to address the great changes on theinternational scene and to be more responsive to theaspirations of this global village  it must earnestlypursue its transformation and be more open to theworld and to itself.It is also necessary to ensure greater democracyand fairness within the United Nations system  inparticular in the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. The Security Council incontestably requires adrastic reform of its processes and membership. In aword  the United Nations must serve the great familyof mankind as a whole."
"50",2104,"ECU",56,2001,"﻿I congratulate you  Sir  on your well-deserved electionas President of the General Assembly. You are a worthyrepresentative of the Republic of Korea  a country veryclose to my own through our important ties offriendship and cooperation. I also congratulate yourpredecessor on the highly efficient and responsible wayin which he oversaw the work of the previous sessionof the Assembly.The Government of Ecuador received withspecial satisfaction the news of the award of the 2001Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations and theSecretary-General  Kofi Annan. We congratulate theSecretary-General on this well-deserved recognition ofhis work  which has promoted among Member Statesthe benefits of international association and solidarity.This session of the Assembly began in anatmosphere of profound distress for all members of theinternational community. The tragically terribleterrorist attacks in the United States on 11 Septemberare shocking to the human conscience. Those whoseperverse and irrational actions took the lives ofthousands of innocent people — including manyEcuadorians — committed a grave attack oninternational peace and security.From this rostrum  I wish to affirm to the peopleand the Government of the United States of Americathe profound condolences and solidarity of the peopleand the Government of Ecuador following thisimmense tragedy and to reiterate our strongestcondemnation of those criminal acts  which have doneviolence to all peoples  as well as to universalprinciples and values.That is why Ecuador — a peace-loving countryconvinced of the predominant role of the UnitedNations as the key institution for decisions affectingthe world — praises the action of the GeneralAssembly and the Security Council in response toterrorism  particularly the Council’s adoption ofresolution 1373 (2001)  which contains the guidelinesfor all Member States to work urgently and in concertto prevent and suppress terrorist acts. Likewise  theinternational community must conclude negotiations ona comprehensive convention on international terrorismto strengthen the relevant judicial framework withconcrete measures to prevent  sanction and combat thisscourge. Ecuador is committed at the national  regionaland international levels to the fight against terrorism inall its forms and manifestations.In the final years of the twentieth century  greatchanges took place in the world  which led to newinternational trends  especially in terms of the processof globalization and threats to international peace andsecurity.The developing countries  such as my own  beganadapting their national structures to deal with thedemands of a decidedly competitive environment.However  it must be said that it is obvious that theadjustments and changes those countries have made totheir policies and strategies are not enough inthemselves to achieve complete results as long as thestructural causes of the disparity between the level ofdevelopment of highly industrialized economies andthat of economies in need of capital and advancedtechnology persist. That disparity continues to widenbecause of financial difficulties caused by unstableshort-term capital flows  persistent external debt andobstacles to truly international trade.There are signs that current internationaleconomic trends are far from providing the equilibriumand justice needed to overcome the unfavourableburdens inherited from the twentieth century. Povertyhas grown at alarming rates in all regions. Internationalorganized crime has exacerbated violence andinsecurity in society. Massive international migrationtowards developed regions continues to increase. Thesephenomena  along with many others  result from thelack of real  universal agreements to assist thedevelopment of human beings.21The problems that the world faces today respectno national borders. They are threats demanding notunilateral action but responses based on solidarity andconcerted action. That interdependence is what enabledthe heads of Government and State  at the MillenniumAssembly  to agree on making the United Nations  thesupreme multilateral forum  a suitable and effectiveinstrument to fight for the development of all peoplesof the world; to fight against poverty  ignorance anddisease; to fight against injustice  violence  terror andcrime; and to fight against the deterioration anddestruction of the planet. They also committedthemselves to freeing all people from the scourge ofwar  to eradicating the dangers posed by weapons ofmass destruction and to strengthening respect for therule of law in national and international affairs.Ecuador  as a country that believes in andpractices the peaceful settlement of internationaldisputes  regrets and condemns conflicts betweenStates  as well as those within States caused by civilwar  ethnic conflict or other reasons. The Governmentof Ecuador is concerned by the uncontrolled violenceoccurring between the peoples of Palestine and Israel which continues to reap a tragic harvest of death anddestruction. We recognize the right of the Palestinianpeople to a free and independent State  as well as theState of Israel’s right to exist within secure andinternationally recognized borders. Ecuador reiteratesits appeal to both parties to quickly return to peacenegotiations.Last August  Ecuador assumed the presidency ofthe Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Itsleadership is guided by its profound commitment to thecause of general and complete disarmament undereffective international control  which would make itpossible to foster peace and confidence among nations.We are witnessing the intensification of aphenomenon as old as humanity itself  undoubtedlylinked to the historical development of civilization. Iam referring to the enormous challenge posed by theincrease in human migration  especially from thecountries of the South towards the North.While migration has been positive in that it hascontributed to fruitful exchange between variouspeoples and has deepened dialogue processes andmutual enrichment between diverse cultures  in mostcases the reason for it stems from the individual’sdesire to seek better living conditions and broadereconomic prospects. We cannot think of human historywithout the constant and ever present phenomenon ofmigration  and the current era is no exception. In thepresent age of the globalization of markets and thepossibility of a new round of multilateral tradenegotiations in the World Trade Organization (WTO) the liberalization of the administration of servicesthrough the free movement of persons must beemphasized.Today many developing countries of the world afflicted by the serious consequences of economiccrisis and the prevalence of structural failures that aredifficult to overcome  have become net producers ofmigrants  men and women who feel compelled to seekbroader horizons legally. Ecuador is one of thosecountries because of the most serious economic crisisof its recorded history  exacerbated by external factorsthat changed the momentum of the nationaldevelopment process. Internal and external factorsmerged in recent years  deepening this crisis  which weare overcoming in a positive way at enormoussacrifice.While migration tends to be a positivephenomenon in terms of historic objectives  theconsequences for individuals are painful and stir ourconscience. Because of that  my country has taken aseries of actions to protect the rights of migrants andtheir families. With the support of the InternationalOrganization for Migration  we have held severalmeetings in which the State and civil society haveparticipated. They have enabled us  on the one hand  tohave direct testimony about the serious problems ofthis group of individuals who have left their countriesvoluntarily to find better opportunities and  on theother hand  to obtain concrete commitments aimed atprotecting and defending human rights. I wish tounderline the transnational nature of the migrationproblem  which requires active cooperation betweencountries of origin and countries receiving immigrants as well as international bodies. In this context  I amhappy to point out that Ecuador and Spain signed anagreement aimed at regulating migration  whichundoubtedly has been beneficial for migrant citizensand signatory countries.Ecuador appeals to all Governments and sectorsof civil society  but particularly to those of thedeveloped world — receivers of migrant workers - toredouble their efforts aimed at protecting the rights ofthis vulnerable sector of society in a non-22discriminatory way  conscious of all the positive andfruitful aspects that the migration phenomenon bringsto the general development of countries  asdemonstrated by European history of recent centuriesand the integration of the Americas into the West.If the twentieth century was the stage for some ofthe greatest humanitarian tragedies recorded by history it is true that in that period we also witnessed the birthof a new global awareness of the urgency to protect andpromote human rights and to preserve man’s home land and environment.My country has fully assumed this globalchallenge. We are signatories to the main instrumentson this important item at both the international and thehemispheric level  and we have national tools thatenable us to achieve such objectives. The National Planon Human Rights  adopted as a State policy in June1998 by civil society and the State  is perhaps the mostinnovative and visionary instrument that has beendeveloped in our country. We hope that it will enableus to promote a real culture of tolerance and respectbetween the ethnic  social and cultural groups of oursociety. With this plan  Ecuador also complied with themandate of the 1993 Vienna Declaration andProgramme of Action.In keeping with all the above-mentioned points Ecuador places importance on one of the mandates ofthe Carabobo Act  signed in July 2001 by thePresidents of the Andean Community of Nations  andhas begun work on a draft Andean Charter of HumanRights  aimed at consolidating the ideas of respect forand the promotion of the fundamental rights andfreedoms of the individual in the specific areas ofculture and ethnic plurality characteristic of theAndean subregion. Ecuador was a pioneer in thisimportant matter when  in 1980  within the subregionalframework  it spurred on the adoption of the RiobambaCharter  which includes among its postulates theprotection of human rights as an internationalobligation of all States and the condition that legitimatejoint action carried out in protecting such rights mustnot violate the principle of non-intervention. Withinthis same context  Ecuador signed the Rome Statute ofthe International Court of Justice of July 1998  and it istaking measures for its prompt ratification.Turning to the WTO and the Free Trade Area ofthe Americas (FTAA)  there is no doubt that one of themost important items on the foreign policy agenda ofStates is international economic relations. Ecuadorwishes to express some views on this  at the momentwhen the Fourth WTO Ministerial Conference is takingplace in Qatar.Ecuador deems it fundamental to pursue theprocess of opening up trade  reducing tariffs andeliminating unnecessary trade barriers. However  mycountry also shares the doubts of some developingcountries about the advantages of launching a newround of multilateral trade negotiations when thecommitments of the Uruguay Round have not yet beenfully implemented  particularly those relating to thereduction and the elimination of agricultural subsidiesand to agreement on special and differential treatmentprovisions in favour of developing countries. These arepriority items of interest for Ecuador  as is theexpansion of openness in agricultural trade.We emphasize the necessary reform required bythe WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding tostrengthen the implementation regime of the decisionsof the relevant ad hoc groups and the appeals body. Forexample  Ecuador was never able to obtain thecompensation to which it was entitled  in spite ofhaving won the banana dispute in all the proceedingsbefore the WTO Dispute Settlement Body and anarbitration award of $201.4 million annually  theamount of the damages caused to my country by anillegal import  sales and distribution scheme of thatproduct in Europe.Given our own experience in this dispute  webelieve that compensation must be binding  if we arereally speaking about free markets in the full sense ofthe word  and that retaliatory measures in the samesector or in cross-sectors is not sufficient to repair thedamages caused  particularly to the economies ofdeveloping countries. It would also be worth evaluatingother types of compensation  such as increasingtechnical cooperation  as a European country isproposing at this time with respect to Ecuador.Progress in trade negotiations and the fulfilmentof commitments already made will make it possible forus to have an international economic and financialclimate conducive to investment and to growth of theworld economy  which will make a positivecontribution to social and human development. Thesesame proposals give us hope in the negotiations of theFTAA — the Trade Negotiations Committee of whichEcuador is currently president. Our efforts take into23account the various positions of countries  as well astheir different levels of development and sizes of theireconomies  since we must seek consensus on decisionsin a way that makes all the parties involved feel thattheir interests are guaranteed. For least developedcountries  the establishment of a hemisphere-wide free-trade zone poses a challenge and at the same timeoffers an exceptional opportunity to be fully integratedinto world economy in this new phase.I turn next to the question of external debt anddevelopment financing. The enormous limitationsfaced by heavily indebted developing countries such asEcuador  resulting from disproportionately largeexternal-debt servicing costs and from persistentobstacles to marketing our exports  work againstnational efforts to engender economic stability andsustainable development. Ecuador’s total external debtnow stands at about 64 per cent of our gross domesticproduct and nearly 40 per cent of our national budget;this has a negative impact on the financing of socialdevelopment projects.External debt is mortgaging the economic presentand future of developing countries; it has extremelyadverse effects because it devours vast resources thatwould otherwise be used in the fight against poverty  inpromoting public health and education  and in meetingmany other urgent social needs. The situation thus hasan increasing negative effect on market-orientednational policies and the political and democraticstability of many countries. It is therefore time for theinternational community to adopt effective  fair lasting  development-oriented measures so as to makeprogress in easing this serious problem — a problemthat highly indebted medium-income countries too arefacing.Ecuador attaches the greatest importance to theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment to be held next March at Monterrey. Itwill be a good opportunity to define  from thefinancing perspective  a new kind of world cooperationthat will effectively support development  especiallythe development of the countries of the South.I am pleased to announce the conclusion andsignature of an agreement between the WorldMeteorological Organization and the Government ofEcuador on the establishment at Guayaquil of aninternational centre for research on El Niño. I urgentlyappeal to the United Nations and its specializedagencies  to the international community and tointernational and regional financial institutions forresolute cooperation to ensure that the centre begins itswork promptly.Finally  as an Ecuadorian  I wish to address thequestion of the Colombian conflict. I wish to say thatmy country is following closely the internal politicalconflict in Colombia and the unfolding of a peaceprocess in that country. In conformity with our policyof promoting dialogue and negotiation as the best wayto overcome problems  we have frequently stated ourunreserved political support for the ColombianGovernment’s efforts to reach a negotiated peace witharmed irregular groups operating in its country.Ecuador applauds the peace initiatives of PresidentAndrés Pastrana and expresses the hope that they willbe meet with a matching response from those groups.Peace in Colombia is a top priority throughout theAmericas; it should also be a top priority for theinternational community. It is in the interest of all tohelp ensure that the Colombian conflict does not spreadto the rest of the subregion.Ecuador has committed itself to a broad andimaginative programme of development for our areasnear the Colombian border; these are aimed atsubstantial improvements in the living conditions ofthe inhabitants  with a view to eliminating the severepoverty that gives rise to the violence of drugtrafficking. That programme has recently receivedmajor backing from the international communitythrough the advisory group set up last month atBrussels. I appeal to our brethren and neighbours inColombia to join with us in similar programmes. Iurgently appeal too to developed countries to continueto cooperate with such initiatives  which in the finalanalysis are the best way to guarantee peace andsecurity.The challenges facing mankind at the outset ofthe twenty-first century must be tackled by allcountries  jointly and in solidarity. This is thebeginning of a new era for major internationaldecisions. The world Organization is the forum inwhich we can carry out a vast mission: equitably tosolve global problems and to buttress collectivesecurity. Ecuador again commits itself to workceaselessly to attain those noble goals."
"51",2149,"EGY",56,2001,"﻿Allow me to read the statement that was to be deliveredby the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the ArabRepublic of Egypt  Mr. Ahmed Maher El Sayed  who unfortunately  was unable to come to New York toparticipate in this important debate.“It gives me pleasure to express throughyou  Sir  to the friendly people of Korea  my mostsincere congratulations on the confidencebestowed by the General Assembly uponPresident Han Seung-soo in his election asPresident of the current session. I would like toassure him of our full cooperation in ensuring thesuccess of our work. With my personalknowledge of his abilities  experience and skills  Iam fully confident that our efforts will becrowned with success through the activation ofthe Charter and the strengthening of itscontribution to the building of a better world.“We gather here under extremely sensitivecircumstances born from injustice and violence.We must face them resolutely and boldly so asnot to allow the forces of evil to overcome ouraspirations  which cause us to gather here everyyear. Among the circumstances which I wouldlike to highlight here today is  first  the continueddenial of the legitimate rights of the Palestinianpeople  including their right to the establishmentof their independent State on the territoriesoccupied since June 1967  including EastJerusalem. The second circumstance I wish tomention is the harrowing events that took place inthe United States as a result of criminal terroristacts that took a heavy toll in innocent lives.Thirdly  peoples continue to suffer from violence poverty  underdevelopment and injustice. We areduty-bound to stand united against thesephenomena  because the oppression of one peopleis the oppression of all peoples  the killing of onesoul is the same as killing the entire world  achild who goes to bed hungry spells hunger forthe whole world and the demolition of a singlehome condemns the whole of humanity to sleepin the wilderness  deprived of the shelter oflegitimacy and law.“The events of 11 September in the UnitedStates were not the beginning of terrorism. Wehave been suffering from terrorism for manyyears. We stood alone in combating it andovercoming the obstacles placed by some deliberately or unwittingly  in the path of ourstruggle  until it was vanquished. The tragicevents of 11 September have brought the wholequestion into the sharp focus of internationalconcern. This fact was reflected in a resoluteinternational consensus to deal not only with themanifestations of terrorism but also with its rootcauses.“There is a consensus to address terrorismwithin the framework of international law  asrepresented by this great Organization  throughthe use of a whole range of actions. These includelegislation  laws  security measures and thedissemination of enlightened thought. There mustalso be a constant search for justice  truth anddevelopment. For the battle against terrorism tobe successful  it must extend to all aspects of life including the political  economic  social  culturaland security aspects.“A search for the root causes is not ajustification  rather  a diagnosis. A disease cannotbe cured by dealing with the symptoms alone;there must  rather  be a thorough analysis and athorough investigation of the germs that spewvenom in human hearts  souls and bodies.Discovering the pathogen opens the path foreffective treatment.“No germ is more lethal to the future ofhumanity than that of poverty. We look forwardto the forthcoming United Nations InternationalConference on Financing for Development to beheld in Mexico; we hope that it will result in anew international consensus on an internationaleconomic framework serving the interests of allStates  developed and developing alike. We alsohope that it will create a new spirit ofconstructive partnership among all members ofthe international community. This partnershipshould seek to eliminate the imbalances ofglobalization  to maximize the opportunity for allto benefit from it and to achieve prosperity andpolitical and economic stability.“In this context  I would like to highlightthe new initiative adopted by the African leadersat their recent summit in Lusaka to combatpoverty and build a brighter future for the peoplesof the continent — namely  the New Partnershipfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD). Thisinitiative reflects a clear vision of the spirit of ourtimes and a recognition by the peoples of Africa38of the reality that they bear the primaryresponsibility for determining their future and foreliminating the political  social and economicobstacles standing before them. We look forwardto the international community providing thenecessary backing and support for thisconstructive collective action in order to ensure asuccessful outcome to the efforts aimed at thedevelopment  stability and prosperity in Africa.“At the same time  it is important to preventthe spread of another disease: the so-called clashof civilizations and religions  which couldundermine all of the progress made by humanityso far towards constructive interaction andcoexistence. Therefore  we call for the conveningof an international conference to lay thefoundation for cooperation among all Statesagainst terrorism. The conference should definethe obligations of States  from which there can beno deviation. It should chart the path towards thecomplete elimination of this scourge. It isanathema to the right of all peoples to live in anatmosphere of security  equality and justice thatenables all to build the edifices of prosperity andprogress.“We also call for a genuine dialogue amongcivilizations that would turn diversity into aconstructive force for mutual enrichment anddeep enlightenment. Such dialogue should allowus all to avoid surrendering to the forces ofbarbarism  which wish to fabricate a clash or aconflict where there is none. There is but onesingle  unified march towards a better world.Differences will not disappear in that betterworld; what will disappear are the rejection humiliation and persecution of others on thegrounds of religion  race or gender.“That is the true sense of globalization thatwe must uphold. It must be an expression ofinterdependence among the peoples and countriesof the world and of the exchange of human andsocial experience and economic and technologicalpotential. Globalization means dealing with thechanging world in a spirit of understanding thatdoes not attempt to impose or control — a spiritthat does not claim absolute distinction or attemptto impose hegemony under any pretext. With thisspirit  an all-encompassing democracy willemerge in international life. All States  big andsmall  will make their contribution to globaladvancement through their implementation of theprinciples adopted by the world after painfulexperience of war and disasters.“This leads me to address a worrisomephenomenon that has grown stronger since thetragic events of 11 September: the attempt toassociate the charges of terrorism andbackwardness with Islam and the resultantpersecution of Arabs and Muslims. This attemptcan spring only from ignorance and blindprejudice. Islam is a religion based on truth justice and respect for human rights  particularlythe right to life and to be free from poverty ignorance and disease. In Islam  people have theduty to interact with others through fair means understanding and mutual respect.“I commend those Governments  includingthe United States Government  that have takenmeasures to put an end to such heinous practices which recall the dark ages. Nevertheless  we allneed to do much more to reveal the truth and todispel the darkness of ignorance and arrogance.All must know that human progress andknowledge are a river that has flowed ceaselesslysince the dawn of history. Every civilization hasbeen both a beneficiary and a tributary of theachievements of other cultures. The Arab Islamic Christian and pharaonic civilizations have allmade contributions that remain with us to thisvery day. Without those contributions  the worldwould not have been able to reach its currentlevel of progress. Had it not been for thosecontributions  the backward forces of darknesswould never have been reined in.“I stand before this Assembly at the end ofthe first year of the third millennium  fully 10years after the Madrid Conference whichreaffirmed the basis for a settlement in the MiddleEast  and yet the Arab-Israeli conflict and thequestion of Palestine at its core still await a justand comprehensive settlement. That is truly hardto believe.“It is most regrettable that the Syrian andPalestinian territories occupied in 1967 and partsof the territory of Lebanon continue to languishunder the heavy yoke of Israeli occupation. Thatoccupation continues to give rise to injustice 39destruction  frustration and anger. Israel continuesto refuse to comply with the terms ofinternational legitimacy. It continues to defy thewill of the world. This unjust situation takes usdirectly back to the dark ages which the UnitedNations was established to end  and createssuffering and agony for a people whose onlycrime is to demand their rights. It also creates anunhealthy climate exploited by those who wish tofish in troubled waters in order to propagatedarkness  misery  chaos and pain.“The international and regional situations in addition to the humanitarian and legalrequirements and interests of all peoples  can nolonger tolerate the continued occupation usurpation and settlement by Israel of theterritories of others. They can no longer brook anarmy of hateful occupation using the mostsophisticated and lethal weapons to brutalizeunarmed civilians  demolish their homes anduproot their trees. All these actions areundertaken under a false pretext that disguises thefact that this army is only defending theoccupation of the land of another people — thepeople of Palestine.“Similarly  the international situation can nolonger bear the declaration by an occupyingPower that it will not return the land it has seizedand that  if it should return any  it will do sounder unfair conditions. Equally untenable is itsposition that peace can only mean its hegemonyand control in one form or another. Theannouncement by a Government of its officialdecision to resort to a policy of targeted killingsis also unacceptable.“Like all nations and peoples  Israel mustunderstand that the world has changed. It mustrealize that it is in its own interest to comply withthe international will. The only guarantee for thesecurity of Israel and of the whole region is forIsrael to put an end to its occupation  policies andpractices and to coexist with the peoples of theregion on the basis of equality  understanding andrespect for international legality and theresolutions of the United Nations. Security cannotbe achieved with continued occupation. Peace isincompatible with the doctrines of hegemony andsuperiority. Free cooperation alone can ensureprosperity for all.“Sometimes I feel that  while the Arabshave accepted Israel’s existence among them Israel has not yet accepted the existence of aPalestinian people in the land of their ancestors with the right to live in a sovereign  independentState with Arab Jerusalem as its capital. No Arab Muslim or Christian can abandon their holy sitesin Jerusalem. Those sites are constantlythreatened by attempts to desecrate or destroythem by Israeli extremists  with the support ofthose ostensibly less extreme.“A political settlement of the question ofPalestine  the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict requires the following.“First  Israel must demonstrate its clear willto abandon its continued occupation of Arablands as an alleged means to maintain its security.Israel needs to understand that its position in theMiddle East will not improve in any real senseuntil it evinces the resolve to return to the bordersof 4 June 1967.“Secondly  Israel must realize that anypeaceful settlement of the question of Palestinerequires the return of East Jerusalem toPalestinian sovereignty. Failure to understand thisfact will always be an obstacle to all peacefulefforts to establish peace in the Middle East.“Thirdly  any political or securityarrangements for the settlement of the Palestinianquestion must lead to the establishment of aviable Palestinian State exercising sovereigntyover its land  water and airspace. There must be ajust settlement  based on United Nationsresolutions and the norms of justice andlegitimacy  of the oldest refugee problem inmodern history  namely  that of Palestinianrefugees.“Fourthly  Egypt does not accept a situationin which Israel remains the sole nuclear Power inthe Middle East. The Middle East must be a zonefree from weapons of mass destruction. Thecountries of the world  particularly the fivenuclear-weapon States  must shoulder theirresponsibilities under international nuclear non-proliferation instruments.“When such conditions prevail and aresupported forcefully and decisively by the40world’s nations — including the friends ofIsrael — because they are just and right  then thepainful chapters of this long-lasting conflict canfinally be closed. Only then will it be possible toraise new generations living in peace andtolerance instead of living in the frustration violence and hatred that are born of illegal  unjustoccupation.“I cannot fail to refer to the central andimportant role of the United States of America inassisting the parties to reach a final and justsettlement. Egypt looks with satisfaction to theresumption of the active role of the United States.In this regard  Egypt also welcomes the role ofthe European Union  the Russian Federation andthe indispensable role of the United Nations inthe establishment of a just  lasting andcomprehensive peace in our region. Egypt willcontinue to play its role in support of thebrotherly Palestinian people and on the side ofjustice  right and legitimacy.“Our part of the world  located in the areafrom West Asia to the southern shores of theMediterranean  requires peace in order to achievethe objective of social  economic and politicaldevelopment. To that end  a just settlement mustbe achieved quickly. Undoubtedly  the wholeinternational community will support such asettlement  which will also require thepresentation of a major and integrated economicprogramme that would provide the economiccapabilities for unleashing the creative potentialof the region  opening the door to constructivecooperation among all its peoples and nations and helping it to overcome the tragedies it haslived through for more than a century.“Perhaps time does not allow us to addressall the problems facing the world. Suffice it forme to reaffirm that Egypt will always eagerlycontinue its efforts to uphold the noble principlesthat the Charter of this great Organizationenshrines in a manner that serves the purposesand principles of all peoples. We assure theAssembly that we will continue our effectiveparticipation and enhance our active contributionto any collective action that guarantees to theUnited Nations the capacities and tools it needs toenable it to undertake the great responsibilitieswith which we the Member States have chargedit  as well as to confront the multiple challengesimposed by the changing nature of our world.”"
"52",2173,"ERI",56,2001,"﻿Pleaseallow me to extend to you  Sir  on behalf of thedelegation of Eritrea  warm congratulations on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly atits fifty-sixth session. I am confident that  under yourwise and able leadership  our deliberations will cometo a fruitful conclusion. The Eritrean delegation assuresyou of its full cooperation and support.May I also extend to your predecessor  Mr. HarriHolkeri of Finland  our deep appreciation for theskilful and wise manner in which he conducted thedeliberations of the fifty-fifth session.I also wish to take this opportunity to extendheartfelt congratulations  on behalf of the people andGovernment of the State of Eritrea  to Mr. Kofi Annanupon his well-deserved election for a second term. I amcertain that our Organization will benefit immenselyduring his second term  as it did during his first  fromhis vision  wisdom  competent leadership and selflessdedication. I also wish to congratulate him and theUnited Nations on their well-deserved awarding of the2001 Nobel Peace Prize.Allow me to express  on behalf of the people andGovernment of the State of Eritrea  profound sorrowand to extend sincere condolences to the people andGovernment of the United States of America in thistheir time of grief following the hateful attacks of 11September. We also wish to extend our heartfeltsympathy and condolences for the victims of thepainful aeroplane crash of 12 November.The Government of Eritrea condemns thebarbaric act committed against innocent civilians by afew craven terrorists. From the outset  we declaredsolidarity with the people and Government of theUnited States against those heinous acts.Terrorism violates the most basic of humanrights: the right to life. Therefore  we must all unite inthe protection of all our citizens against thesedastardly  desperate acts perpetrated by individuals ororganized terrorist networks. There should be noimpunity for such criminals.Humankind entered the new millennium withoptimism and hope — and for good reason. It hadrecognized  through bitter experience  the folly of warand conflict and the virtue of peace  good-neighbourliness and cooperative relations. It had hadthe opportunity to review past achievements and errorsand to identify sources of strength and weakness. It hadevolved lofty norms  values and principles. It hadestablished refined procedures and created effectivemechanisms to guarantee their implementation.Unfortunately  however  humankind had not yetmustered the necessary determination or the collectivewill to translate that vision into reality. It is evidentthat it has not yet learned the ways of comprehensivepeace. The full blooming of a culture of peace anddevelopment remains so near and yet so distant.Consequently  two years into the new millennium we continue to witness with dismay immense povertyand want in the midst of massive wealth in the world deprivation in spite of the enormous advances inscience and technology  wilful violations of human6rights and manifestations of mutual hatred andhostility.The statistics are dismal. Yet  we must not beunduly alarmed  if only because it is too early to bediscouraged by unfulfilled and unkept promises. On thecontrary  we must decide to confront the challenges including the depressing disparity between the rich andthe poor  and issues of war and peace and violations ofhuman rights.We must collectively address the new forces thatare being unleashed by science and technology including globalization. Globalization can serve as aneffective instrument for establishing an equitable andjust relationship between the rich and the poor and forpromoting sustainable development to the mutualbenefit of all. However  this can be achieved only if acooperative mechanism is established immediately during this critically early stage of the twenty-firstcentury  before we are overtaken by the speed of thetechnology and information revolution. It is equallyimportant that the capacities of the poor nations beincreased without delay in order to ensure theireffective participation in the global economy.It must also be acknowledged that peace  securityand stability are closely linked to development. It neednot be emphasized that there is no development withoutpeace  and no peace without security. To this end  allefforts must also include development concerns.The world continues to be plagued by wars andconflicts that have spilled over from the previouscentury  in spite of the international community’sefforts and full commitment to peace  security andstability.The African continent has perhaps fared the worstin the last few years  as it has been beleaguered byrepeated economic catastrophes  political disruptionsand inter-State and intra-State conflicts.It is a source of deep concern to us thatglobalization has had a severely negative impact onAfrican economies. It has deepened theirmarginalization and kept them from benefiting fromthe global economy. Africa suffers more than any otherregion from extreme poverty and  indeed  fromrecurrent famine. Plagues like malaria  tuberculosis HIV/AIDS  diarrhoea and a host of other debilitatingand fatal tropical diseases have  in many cases  reachedbiblical proportions. The decimation of populations hashad horrendous consequences on many already weakeconomies.In addition to economic crises and poverty conflicts  wars and civil strife have prominentlyafflicted Africa during the past decade and a half. In1999  close to 20 conflicts were wreaking havoc on thecontinent. It was in acknowledgement of the gravity ofthe matter that the Organization of African UnitySummit  held in Algiers in 1999  decided to declare2000 as the year for ending conflicts and givingmomentum to peace.It was an auspicious year. There wereencouraging signs in the Sudan  Somalia and theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  and acomprehensive peace agreement was signed betweenEritrea and Ethiopia. Yet much remains to be done. It isencouraging to note that Africans are making great andsustained efforts to resolve the conflicts in SierraLeone  Guinea  Guinea Bissau  the Great Lakes region Somalia and the Sudan at the regional level.In the same vein  a just and durable solution tothe problem in the Middle East must be found throughthe creation of a fully independent Palestinian State.The international community must be involvedmore meaningfully in assisting the peoples of thesecountries. Yet  the primary responsibility for resolvingconflict  achieving national reconciliation andestablishing peace  security and stability lies with thepeoples and leaders of these countries. It must also beemphasized that  while any regional assistancerendered is to be appreciated  it must be predicatedupon the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of theassisted countries. Such assistance should be based onlofty principles and aimed at serving the interests andwell-being of the countries in question.The Horn of Africa has been a zone of conflictfor the past four decades. Peace  security  stability anddevelopment are the collective responsibility of theStates of the region. It behoves them to earnestlypromote  protect and consolidate cooperative relationson the basis of mutual respect for each other’ssovereignty  unity and territorial integrity  renunciationof the threat or use of force  peaceful settlement ofdisputes  good-neighbourly relations and peacefulcoexistence.Since its independence in 1993  the State ofEritrea has espoused national security and development7policies and programmes based on the premise that oursecurity and development interests are closely linked toregional security and prosperity. To this end  it activelyengaged itself in the revitalization of theIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)and the propagation of IGAD’s new mission. IGAD isnow fully engaged in peacemaking and conflictresolution and coordinating cooperative efforts amongits member States. In this context  my delegationwishes to extend special thanks to President Danielarap Moi of Kenya and President Ismail Omar Guellehof Djibouti for their dedicated  unbiased and untiringefforts to bring peace to the Sudan and Somaliarespectively.The search for durable peace  security andstability must be the collective commitment of allmember States of IGAD and it must be anchored solelyin the welfare and best interests of the peoplesconcerned. Peace in Somalia is vital  and it should notbe held hostage by any Government under the pretextof preserving its national security. History and theSomali people will make them responsible if theybecome an obstacle or try to hinder peacemakingefforts in the region.The world welcomed the signing of theAgreement on Cessation of Hostilities  acomprehensive peace Agreement between Eritrea andEthiopia. It has expressed the hope that theimplementation of the Agreement will proceedsmoothly and will lead to a durable peace.Both countries owe it to their people and to theentire international community to establish a durablepeace as soon as possible. We face the challenge ofmeeting the hopes and great expectations of our peopleand of the international community. Eritrea solemnlyreiterates not only its abiding commitment to the peaceAgreement and its speedy implementation  but also itsundertaking to fully cooperate with all its partners inthe peace process.The peace process has made significant progress.However  I should like to inform the Assembly that keyprovisions of the peace Agreement remainunimplemented because the Government of Ethiopiahas failed to comply with its obligations. It has  to date obstructed the establishment of the temporary securityzone and the establishment of a direct air routebetween the capitals of the two countries. Moreover  ithas refused to submit operationally useful informationon its minefields in the temporary security zone and torelease civilian detainees and war prisoners.It has also resumed the deportation of Eritreansand Ethiopians of Eritrean origin  in blatant violationof the comprehensive peace Agreement between thetwo countries. The last round of deportation occurredon 25 June 2001 and was strongly condemned by theUnited Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea(UNMEE) and the International Committee of the RedCross.Under these circumstances  it is surprising thatEthiopia has recently accused Eritrea of placing itsarmy on high alert and of deploying its troops along thecommon border. This baseless accusation  refuted bythe Secretary-General’s Special Representative inEritrea and Ethiopia  is designed to hide Ethiopia’splans and intentions to sabotage the peace process byprovoking hostilities.The Government of Eritrea has consistentlyundertaken  in good faith  to comply fully with theprovisions of the Algiers Agreement  in spite of theintransigence of the Government of Ethiopia and itsviolation of it.The Government of Eritrea wishes to extendsincere appreciation to  and applauds the effort of  thepeace partners  particularly the United Nations  theEuropean Union  the Organization of African Unityand the Governments of the United States and Algeria.It also extends its profound thanks to the friends ofUNMEE for their immense contribution to the peaceprocess. At the same time  it urges the internationalcommunity to exert extra effort to persuade theEthiopian Government to fulfil its legal obligationsunder the Algiers peace Agreement and the UnitedNations Charter without delay.Eritrea has always been consistent in itscondemnation of terrorism  irrespective of theperpetrators or victims. It has itself become the victimof terrorist attacks by elements organized  financed trained and armed by the Ethiopian Government. Theseterrorists are often joined by Ethiopian troops andmilitias in their heinous crimes against innocentcivilians. We urge the international community tocondemn these barbarous acts and to demand that theEthiopian Government cease its activities and hostileacts as soon as possible.8In conclusion  despite its regrettable experiencewith the United Nations in the early days  Eritrea isfully convinced that the Organization has played acrucial role in the maintenance of international peaceand security and has contributed immensely to thepromotion and protection of human rights  as well as toeconomic development and social progress.Eritrea is fully and unequivocally committed tostrengthening the United Nations. To this end  webelieve that the United Nations must proceed with aprocess of change and reform that will reinforce theprinciple of equality among all its Members andguarantee its impartiality and neutrality. Hence  wefully endorse the position of the Non-AlignedMovement on membership of the Security Council andthe question of a periodic review of its structure andfunctions. We are confident that much will be achievedunder the visionary leadership of Mr. Kofi Annanduring his second term of office."
"53",2219,"ESP",56,2001,"﻿First ofall  I would like to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo onhis election as President of this fifty-sixth session ofthe General Assembly of the United Nations. Likewise I would like to congratulate the Organization itself andits Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  on having beenawarded this year's Nobel Peace Prize. Mr. Annan'sre-election guarantees the continuous leadership ofsomeone who has enormously contributed tostrengthening the prestige of the United Nations and itsrole in the world.I also wish to emphasize my full support for thestatement made in this Hall by the Minister for Foreign32Affairs of Belgium on behalf of the presidency of theEuropean Union.The horror of the terrorist attacks of 11September shocked the world. We were all attacked onthat day  all of us who defend freedom  tolerance andrespect for the dignity of human beings. Spain knowswell the cruelty of terrorism and the grief that it cancause. Therefore  Spain  its Government and itscitizens are in complete solidarity with the Americanpeople  the families of the victims and this city of NewYork  which is also our city  the city of the UnitedNations.Once again  I wish to express my solidarity andmy condolences to the families of the victims oftoday's tragedy.After 11 September  we cannot continue acting inthe same way. There has been change in the politicalparadigm  the coordinates that have guided us untilnow. The paradigm has changed  and now the politicalculture must also change. Terrorism cannot continue tobe regarded as an inevitable evil for our peoples  butrather as a mortal enemy of them all. There can beneither excuses nor pretexts: this is the time todemonstrate the political will of each and every one ofus to take effective measures for internationalcooperation against terrorism  measures which Spainhas been promoting for years  to take a qualitativeleap forward.Since 11 September  an important internationalconsensus has emerged on the need to confrontterrorism. This shows that terrorism has nothing to dowith the differences between North and South or Eastand West  much less with a supposed conflict betweencivilizations. Many Islamic countries are among itsmain victims. It does have to do  however  with thedifference between those who commit these kinds ofacts or give them their support  and those who considerthem to be atrocities and violations of the mostelementary principles of human coexistence  which arecommon to all the great civilizations.The United Nations has risen to the occasion. Itsaction has been quick and effective  demonstrating thatthe Organization is indispensable at the dawning of thenew millennium. Resolution 1368 (2001) made itpossible for a coalition of wills  of which Spain is apart  to emerge in order to respond to the attacks.Resolution 1373 (2001) expresses the determination ofthe international community to maintain concertedaction for as long as necessary against terrorism:against terrorism without adjectives  against theterrorists themselves  and also against those who lendthem any type of support  active or passive.Progress has also been made in the negotiation ofa general convention against international terrorism overcoming some of the obstacles that had blocked thenegotiations for years. Now that we are close toreaching an agreement  we must make an effort toeliminate the problems that are still pending. The goalmust be to draw up an operative and effectiveinstrument against terrorism that cannot be paralysedby interminable discussions of a political rather than alegal nature. The subject is of pivotal importance  andthe very credibility of the United Nations is at stake.We have a historical opportunity before us; it would bea shame if we were to squander it.To their cynicism and disdain for elementaryhuman values  terrorists often add a shamelessopportunism in order to manipulate particularsituations to their advantage. These situationsundoubtedly require a solution on account of theirintrinsic nature  on their own merits  without anyrelation to terrorist claims. We must all work togetherto find that solution.These situations involve structural problems suchas poverty and the marginalization in which manymillions of people live all over the world. They alsohave to do with regional conflicts  such as that in theMiddle East  where there is an urgent need to stop theblind cycle of violence and return to the negotiatingtable. If the political will exists  negotiations arepossible. Madrid  Oslo and the advances made at CampDavid and Taba prove this. There is no alternative tothe peace process and  at the end of the road  the Stateof Israel and the Palestinian State will coexistpeacefully within secure borders.Terrorist attacks against innocent civilians causealarm among our peoples  but they are not the onlycause for uncertainty at the beginning of the newmillennium.When the political and ideological confrontationsthat had defined the second half of the twentiethcentury were largely overcome  other types of conflictsemerged with force. These tend to be not international but rather internal  conflicts and are therefore difficultto address with the instruments of traditional33diplomacy. Some of them have given rise to serioushumanitarian crises that have afflicted our peoples.At a time when we have decoded the humangenome and the advances of biotechnology pose newdilemmas  millions of people continue to live inconditions of extreme poverty  with less than a dollarper day to cover all their needs.As we witness the interconnection of economiesworldwide and can send information instantly to anycorner of the Earth  we see how globalizationdistributes its benefits unequally  making more visibleand intolerable the breach between rich and poor  thepowerful and the weak  the haves and the have-nots.These situations give rise to uncertainty  but theyalso give rise to a demand for solutions. Our peoplesturn to us  Governments and internationalorganizations  and they ask us to act  especially theUnited Nations. Its global vision  its universalcomposition and its vocation to defend the interests ofall humanity give it a unique legitimacy in the eyes ofour citizens.In order not to disappoint these expectations  theUnited Nations must face the challenge of itsmodernization  following the path charted by theMillennium Summit.My country has also undergone a significantprocess of modernization in recent years  which hasenabled it to become fully incorporated intointernational life. Spain has been able to break awayfrom the inertia of the past and seek new solutions toits new problems. It has done so without renouncing itsidentity as a bridge between different cultures andregions of the world. That is the perspective fromwhich my country backs the process of reform andmodernization. It will continue to do so from thepresidency of the European Union  which it will holdduring the first half of next year.The phenomenon of globalization is responsiblefor much of the current uncertainty facing theprocesses of change. The United Nations  which thinksglobally  is the natural forum for managingglobalization.In addition to the fight against terrorism  effectiveinstruments must be developed to combat drugs andtransnational organized crime. This year  progress mustbe made in the preparation of a convention againstcorruption.The International Criminal Court is one of thekey instruments of international relations that we willneed in the new millennium. Spain has been involvedfrom the start in the fight against the culture ofimpunity with regard to the most heinous crimes. Itnow seems more necessary than ever for the Court tostart to act. The different legal systems of the worldmust be duly represented in the court  becauseglobalization does not mean homogenization. Nocountry must be marginalized from this historicprocess; all must be able to contribute to the Courttheir own views regarding international criminaljustice.Arms control  disarmament and non-proliferationrequire greater attention from the internationalcommunity. Progress in the destruction and prohibitionof anti-personnel mines as a result of the OttawaConvention and the results of the Programme of Actionof the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade inSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects areencouraging.The need to protect the environment is real  andthe solutions cannot be postponed. The Kyoto Protocoloffers some answers to this problem. Those who do notaccept Kyoto will have to propose a better solution. Inthe meantime  its ratification will be the only practicalmeasure taken in this field. That is why we welcomethe agreement reached in Marrakech  which we believeto be a step in the right direction.New conflicts require new solutions. We mustdeal with all the stages of a particular conflict througha comprehensive approach that includes efforts toprevent the causes  to keep the peace when crisiserupts  to consolidate that peace and  afterwards  tobegin economic and institutional reconstruction. Thisidea has inspired the efforts being made by my country in cooperation with the Russian Federation  in thedemining project in southern Lebanon. It alsomotivates efforts  in which Spain is an activeparticipant  to strengthen African capabilities toprevent and settle conflicts. For that reason  Spain wasvery pleased to welcome the birth of the African Unionat the Lusaka Summit  as well as the New AfricanInitiative that was adopted there.This approach must also be applied tointernational action in support of the Afghan people whose situation is particularly dire. We must urgentlyhelp them to meet their basic humanitarian needs 34especially given the approach of winter. Thisinternational action  to which Spain is contributing must also include clear support for the economic andinstitutional reconstruction of the country. The futureof Afghanistan is something that only the Afghanpeople can decide. Nevertheless  the internationalcommunity must support them so that they canestablish a stable Government and maintain normalrelations with their neighbours and the rest of theworld. In this task  the United Nations must play afundamental role.The new diplomatic instruments that are requiredmust accord special attention to humanitarian affairs.The need to protect the rights of refugees and internallydisplaced persons  access to humanitarian assistancefor affected populations and the situation of children inarmed conflicts  in addition to the security problem ofUnited Nations and associated personnel  all theseissues require effective solutions. If some States fail tomeet their responsibilities in this area  it will benecessary to draw attention to their attitude repeatedly until it changes.Peacekeeping is an essential instrument in thiscomprehensive approach to dealing with conflict. TheGeneral Assembly must take concrete steps toimplement the recommendations of the Brahimi reporton peacekeeping operations by increasing the size ofthe Department of Peacekeeping Operations in theSecretariat  improving the participation of the troop-contributing countries in the decision-making processand strengthening civil police operations  in whichSpain has played an active role.None of this will be enough if peacekeepingoperations do not receive clear and adequate mandates backed with the firm political support of the SecurityCouncil. If mandates are not clear and adequate  it willnot be possible to send United Nations units to placesin which they may have to use force. No country isprepared to risk the lives of its soldiers to defendempty words.This brings us to the need to conclude the processof reforming the Security Council. We need a morerepresentative  democratic  effective and transparentSecurity Council. Spain  which is a candidate fornon-permanent membership of the Security Council inthe elections to be held during the fifty-seventh sessionof the General Assembly  will strive  if elected  toincrease the quantity and improve the quality of theconsultations with non-member States  especially withthose most affected by the issues being debated by theCouncil.Human rights and fundamental freedoms  civiland political  as well as economic and social  are thebirthright of all humanity and not just of a particulargroup of States. Their violation today provokescondemnation in a way that it did not in the past. Wemust continue to strengthen such points of agreement incorporating the concerns of all.It is therefore important that the DurbanConference was able to adopt a final document. Spain like the rest of the European Union  upheld to the endits commitment to the objectives of the Conference. Wemust take advantage of the agreement reached atDurban to continue to make progress in this field.Along the same lines  my country will organize  in thenext few days in Madrid  in cooperation with the Officeof the United Nations High Commissioner for HumanRights  an international consultative conference onstudent education in relation to freedom of religion orbeliefs  tolerance and non-discrimination.I cannot fail to refer to the question of Gibraltar.As has already been communicated to the Secretary-General  the United Kingdom and Spain agreed  on 26July in London  to relaunch their talks within theframework of the Brussels Declaration  issuing to thisend a communiquÈ in which they underlined theirpolitical will to overcome all of their differences overGibraltar and to conclude these talks promptly andsuccessfully for the benefit of all the parties involved.Furthermore  they invited the Chief Minister ofGibraltar to participate in ministerial meetings withinthe framework of this process.The problem of development is central to theactivities of the Organization. The MillenniumDeclaration constitutes the basic framework for theseactivities and must be implemented in its entirety. Atthis session  the General Assembly must set in motionan effective monitoring mechanism for the Declaration.Spain is also working to define new fields fordevelopment cooperation. For example  Spain is apioneer in the development of microcredits  whichconstitute a particularly suitable instrument for thedevelopment of the less advanced countries. This year Spain organized in Las Palmas a high-level meeting ontourism and development in less developed countrieswith a view to placing its extensive experience in this35field at the service of tourism development in suchcountries  some of which  such as the small islandStates  have comparative advantages in this field fromwhich they could benefit.Next April  Spain will also organize the SecondWorld Assembly on Ageing  thus responding to theneed to pay special attention to vulnerablepopulations  those most likely to suffer the highestrates of poverty. The eradication of poverty is theprimary objective of both the Millennium Declarationand Spain's policy for cooperation in development.If there is one group of people who are vulnerableby definition  it is people who are ill. The specialsession of General Assembly on AIDS and otherinfectious diseases highlighted the urgency of haltingtheir spread. Spain will make a major contribution tothe Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis andMalaria  which has been created for this purpose.The United Nations will not be able toaccomplish all of these tasks if it does not have thenecessary resources to do so. The budget for thecoming two-year period will be discussed during thisAssembly's session. The effort to impose budgetarydiscipline must continue  but rigid positions thatprevent the Organization from facing up to itsresponsibilities must be avoided.Evading responsibility is something that theUnited Nations cannot afford to do  especially today.Unique legitimacy imposes a unique responsibility. TheUnited Nations will be judged in this new millenniumby its effectiveness in addressing the new problemsconfronting it  by its ability to transform uncertaintiesinto solutions  insecurity into confidence and fear intohope.In conclusion  I would like to make one furthercomment. In his statement  the Minister for ForeignAffairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom of Moroccoreferred to the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla andto other Spanish territories. In the context of therelations of friendship and good-neighbourliness thatexist between Spain and Morocco  I wish to stress thatthe cities of Ceuta and Melilla  and the adjacentislands  are an integral part of the territory of Spain andthat their citizens are represented in the Spanishparliament in the same capacity and under the sameterms as the rest of their compatriots."
"54",2245,"EST",56,2001,"﻿First of all  allow me tocongratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan and all ofmy colleagues on having received the Nobel PeacePrize. There is no doubt that without the UnitedNations  our world would be much less secure  with farfewer prospects for resolving conflicts. I would alsolike to commend the efforts that have been madeduring the last few years to reform this Organization sothat it can better deal with the new challenges it has toface. In addition  please allow me  Sir  to congratulateyou on having been elected President of the fifty-sixthsession of the General Assembly.After the terrorist attacks of 11 September  itbecame apparent that  when we are all confronted witha common threat  many existing disputes and12differences become insignificant. The United NationsMember States together have condemned the terroristacts. It is of the utmost importance to maintain thatunity and persistently to reinforce it with concreteactions. Terrorism is the ultimate challenge to ourcommon values  and our struggle against that threat hasonly begun.The destruction and elimination of terroristnetworks is a time-consuming task for which there areno instant solutions. The United Nations does however  have effective measures at its disposal forfighting terrorism: the international conventions thatthe United Nations has adopted over the years and thesanctions that can be applied to hamper terroristactivities. The ratification of those conventions and theenforcement of those sanctions by every UnitedNations Member State is  at this moment  one of thosetruly important tasks that it behoves all Members tocarry out. I am glad to be able to confirm that Estoniahas either already ratified  or is the middle of theparliamentary procedures for ratifying  all of theappropriate United Nations conventions. Estonia hastaken all necessary steps to apply Security Councilresolutions 1333 (2000) and 1373 (2001).Estonia has improved and intensified cooperationand the exchange of information with its neighboursand partners. We have expressed our solidarity andunreserved support to the United States in the fightagainst terrorism. We have aligned ourselves with theEuropean Union’s 21 September anti-terrorist summit’sfinal document and action plan. With our neighboursLatvia and Lithuania  we have also formulatedcommon measures for preventing possible terroristattacks and for applying coordinated tactics in case webecome the victims of terrorist activities. We haveintensified international border controls and policecooperation.Many programmes that had been adopted earlierare now proving to be extremely useful in the struggleagainst terrorism. The Financial Action Task Force onMoney Laundering  for example  has given a highrating to Estonia’s anti-money-laundering legislation.A recent audit shows that Estonian banks have nocontractual relations with any organization orindividual alleged to be connected with internationalterrorism.The international political atmosphere inEstonia’s immediate vicinity  the Baltic Sea region  is  Iam glad to report  peaceful  which is conducive tostable development and good-neighbourly cooperation.Up to now  Estonians have hardly had to deal with thedirect results of terrorism. But this fall’s terroristattacks were aimed directly at international peace andstability. This means that now we  too  keenly sense thedanger that faces us all. This places the United Nations as the world Organization  at the centre of the ongoingstruggle.The reform processes launched during the lastfew years to reorganize and reform the United Nationsare also appropriate for dealing with current problems.Now  however  we must ask ourselves if there is someway that we can speed up and intensify these reformsso as to better deal with the urgency of the prevailingsituation. In our new situation  I would bring forththree well-worn and proven principles that apply notonly specifically to the United Nations  but to otheraspects of international cooperation as well.First  we must once again ask ourselves howexactly each of us can make the most fruitfulcontribution. Secondly  what can we do to increase theefficiency of the Organization? And thirdly  I wouldlike to stress the principle of openness.First of all  let us deal with the matter of everyMember’s individual contribution. The United Nationsbrings together Member States with a wide range ofresources and capabilities. Even the most successfulnation’s reserves and capacities  however  have a limit.Therefore  it is only natural that every Member Statecarefully evaluate how it can be the most useful. It isequally important for Members to realistically assesshow high a level of development they have achieved and  when appropriate  to refrain from accepting aid infavour of those who need it the most.This is the flip side of development. As one risesout of poverty and underdevelopment  one should alsogrow up and become more responsible  acknowledgingthat obligations rise along with living standards. Lastyear  for example  Estonia decided to relinquish itsright to pay reduced contributions to the peacekeepingbudget. For Estonia  to give up the rights to such adiscount was not a step taken lightly — it was adecision based on the Government’s realization thatwith our rapid development  we had acquired newresponsibilities. The United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) had  after all  found that Estoniahad developed to the point where the UNDP could13terminate the activities of its mission in Estonia inDecember 2000.Of course  we miss working together with such auseful cooperative agency as the UNDP representationin Estonia. Yet we realize quite well that there aremany regions in the world which badly need theirassistance  while for Estonia the presence of the UNDPmission is no longer essential. In other words maintaining the representation would be irresponsibleon our part  as it would use resources for which there isa greater need elsewhere. This means that Estonia’scooperation with the United Nations and its agencieshas qualitatively advanced to a higher level. This hasbeen clearly demonstrated by the founding of theUnited Nations Building project in Estonia. Theintention is to have the representation of various UnitedNations agencies all under one roof. The fact that theUnited Nations is gaining importance in the eyes of theEstonian public is evidenced by  inter alia  the fact thatthe Estonian United Nations Association has beensteadily increasing its activities.During the last few years  Estonia has clearlyprogressed from an aid recipient to an aid provider.This transformation has been confirmed by  amongothers  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD) Development AssistanceCommittee  which  in its 2000 yearbook  lists Estoniafor the first time as a donor nation. Therefore  thosewho assisted Estonia during its now completedtransition phase can clearly see now that their aid hasborne fruit. We  in turn  are willing to share theexperience that we have gained in the course of the last10 years. As a matter of fact  we have alreadyestablished cooperative efforts of this nature withseveral countries.I spoke earlier about how every Member State hasan obligation to evaluate how it can best help theUnited Nations in its endeavours. Of equal importanceare the ongoing efforts to increase the effectiveness ofthe Organization as a whole. In this light  I wouldemphasize two aspects: reform of the Security Counciland the Brahimi report on improving United Nationspeacekeeping operations.We must ensure that our cooperative efforts forsolving the urgent problems confronting us do notbecome entangled in the deficiencies of the structure orthe working order of the Security Council. We all knowvery well what these deficiencies are  and therefore ourcommon goal is quite clear: to increase therepresentativeness  transparency and efficiency of theSecurity Council. The enlivened discussions and theshift towards greater openness in the work of theSecurity Council give us hope. We supported thestrenuous efforts of Harri Holkeri  the GeneralAssembly’s previous President  to intensify theactivities of the Working Group dealing with reform.We share the view that it is time to move fromdiscussions on to the negotiating phase.Estonia supports the enlargement of the SecurityCouncil in both the permanent and non-permanentcategories of membership  just as we support reform ofthe Security Council’s decision-making process. In theconfrontational context of the cold war  the veto in theSecurity Council was a means for the great Powers toprotect their interests. Even then it was avoided  andany light-handed use of the veto resulted incondemnation by the international community. Now however  the sense of trust among the Security Councilmembers has grown immensely  and a limitation of theuse of the veto would be an appropriate reflection ofthis improved atmosphere.The composition of the Council  which stillreflects the power relationships that prevailed in 1945 is another issue that cries out for resolution. From theinception of the United Nations that year until just adecade ago  the people of my country were affordedonly rare glimpses of the goings-on at the UnitedNations through fissures in the iron curtain. When wefinally established our independence in 1991  weemerged into the international arena only to discoverthat the Security Council  judging by its composition was still stuck back in the year 1945. This strikesEstonia as being anachronistic  if not wrong-headed.The guarantors and greatest contributors to stability inthe world have  in the course of half a century  changedfundamentally. We need not fear opening a discussionon whether the moral and legal reasoning underlyingSecurity Council membership in the wake of theSecond World War is still appropriate in the post-cold-war era — or this post-11 September era. Nothingunderscores the need to come back to this questionmore than the challenge that we are currently facing.Participation in the United Nations peacekeepingoperations is an inseparable part of Estonia’s nationalsecurity policy. We therefore fully support theendeavours outlined in the Brahimi report concerningthe reformation of United Nations peacekeeping.14Estonia is in full agreement with the report’scomprehensive and long-term approach to theprevention and solution of conflicts. Although we oftentalk about the need for limiting expenditures  in thiscase it is clear that in order to increase efficiency means must be found for increasing the budget ofUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. We arepleased to say  as I mentioned earlier  that we havecontributed to this effort to increase thoseexpenditures.Let me proceed to my third theme  namely openness. Openness and transparency are essential formany reasons. Terrorist attacks have been directed ateveryday interpersonal relations and at our usual meansof communication  such as the postal system and airtravel. Therefore  we need to make concerted efforts toensure that the movement of people and ideas will notsuffer from the threat of terrorism. Terrorism itself isfed primarily by misinformation  disinformation andmisperceptions. Here too  openness is important; it isessential to communicate our intentions and ideas bothto those who support us as well as to those who doubtus.Openness is also essential in more conventionalsituations  for example  in the traditional politicaldecision-making process  be it in the international ordomestic arena. Here  Estonia can share experiences inthe sphere of information technology. Last year  theEstonian Government began to hold its cabinetmeetings electronically. All information concerninggovernment activities now moves through electronicchannels — through the Internet. In addition tospeeding up decision-making and providing monetarysavings  information now becomes available to thegeneral public through the Internet  much faster andmore efficiently. More and more Estonians are makinguse of the opportunities offered by the public sector —the services of the revenue office  local governmentsand federal agencies — through the Internet. Havingnow connected all Estonian public schools to theInternet  the Government also plans to bring all publiclibraries online. This last summer  the Estonian StateChancellery launched a unique new project by openinga direct democracy portal called “Today I Decide”.This portal allows everyone to present ideas  initiativesand proposals  as well as to comment upon proposedlegislation. New ideas that have been proposed byportal users are passed on to the appropriategovernment offices and agencies for action. Many ofyou may be interested in finding out more about theinitiatives I have described  and we are more thanhappy to share our experiences with you.Finally  I would like to stress the fact that thegrave events that have affected all of us in the last fewmonths will not prevent us from moving ahead. Ourdecisiveness and sense of unity have only beenreinforced by what has happened. We must not discardor forget all the common projects initiated before 11September. In many parts of the world  nothing haschanged for those who suffer from poverty  hunger andpersecution. Thinking about our projects for the future I am especially pleased that the United Nations specialsession on children  which was postponed owing to theterrorist attacks  will nevertheless take place in Maynext year. The goal of this upcoming special session  tocreate better conditions and opportunities for childreneverywhere  continues to be of the utmost importanceto us. It is precisely for initiatives of this kind  whichendeavour to achieve a better future for mankind  thatthe United Nations Organization has earned the NobelPeace Prize.In conclusion  please allow me to express mypersonal condolences and the condolences of allEstonians to the families of those who perished in theair tragedy that occurred just a few days ago in theborough of Queens."
"55",2291,"ETH",56,2001,"﻿At the outset  allow me toexpress my sincere congratulations to the President onhis election to lead the fifty-sixth session of theGeneral Assembly. I am fully confident that under hispresidency  we will have productive discussions andreach a fruitful conclusion. I would also like to conveymy appreciation to the outgoing President for hisconduct of the work of the last session.Let me also take this opportunity to once againconvey my Government’s warmest congratulations toour Secretary-General on his appointment to lead ourOrganization for a second term. Indeed  his re-electionis well deserved. We are also delighted that the UnitedNations and the Secretary-General were awarded theNobel Peace Prize for this year. It is a testimony to anda recognition of the important work the United Nationshas been doing.It is now over two months since the terribleevents of 11 September. What happened on that daytouched not only the people of the United States butalso the whole world. Not only because scores ofcountries lost nationals  but also because New York the seat of the United Nations  is in many ways thecapital of the world. The terrorists might havesucceeded in committing this unimaginable andbarbaric crime  but we have no doubt that they havefailed to extinguish the hope and vitality that New Yorksymbolizes and embodies.Terrorism is not new to Ethiopia. For the past 10years  we have been victims of terrorist attacks  and wehave combated it. That is why we remain committed todoing our utmost to enhance the international effort toroot out terrorism.23Over the long term  terrorism will be defeatedwhen the ideological cover it is wearing is removedand shown to be empty. But this can be achieved onlywhen those who are capable of perpetrating heinouscrimes are not only denied safe havens  but alsodeprived of any alibi. This is where  among otherthings  the fight against poverty becomes all the morecritical.The fight against poverty is not as elusive as thefight against terrorism. For the former  we know thecauses  and we know how to fight it and which tools touse. What we lack is the global political will to act.The grimness of conditions in Africa in this regard isobvious. There is no need for me to go into detailregarding the statistics on the situation in Africa.African leaders have taken the conclusions of theMillennium Assembly a step further and have come upwith the New African Initiative  now called the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). Theyhave drawn a broad plan on how to bring peace security and development to a continent that has beenplagued by conflict  overwhelmed with insecurity andmired in underdevelopment. The main thrust of theinitiative is that we in Africa have duly acknowledgedthe responsibility for our continent’s fate. Hence  wefully accept that peace  security  democracy  goodgovernance and sound economic management areessential conditions for economic growth andsustainable development. At the same time  we arefully aware that Africa at present lacks the requiredresources and capacity to implement this initiative.This new African initiative thus calls for acomplementary obligation on the part of theinternational community.I would like to point out the importance of thismutual obligation. Without it  we cannot look forwardto the future with confidence; without it  theconsequences are bound to be grave. This is thechallenge that we face in Africa. The internationalcommunity must confront it with renewed vigour anddedication.On the subject of our national effort to seize theopportunity presented by the prevailing peace in mycountry  I have the pleasure to inform the Assemblythat we are now back on track in terms of playing ourproper role for peace and investing all our energy andresources in fighting poverty at the national level. Thisis a war  and we count on our partners to stand with usin waging it. Our strategy in fighting poverty toucheson everything we do — in politics  diplomacy and theeconomic domain.We want to succeed in the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic affecting our country. This majorscourge must be defeated. We are determined to fightagainst corruption  and our record is unambiguous inthis area. We are committed to pursuing this withoutany let-up.I would now like to turn to the political andsecurity situation in our subregion  which  for obviousreasons  is critical for us  as it should be a source ofconcern for the international community.The problem in Somalia needs to be resolved asspeedily as possible. There is no reason why thesituation should be allowed to continue festering  to thedetriment of the people of Somalia and of thesubregion in general. The parties to the conflict have tosit down without preconditions to establish a broad-based Government. That is what was called for by theIntergovernmental Authority on Development at themeeting at the summit level in November 2000. Thishas to be implemented. This is the most viablealternative. To do less would amount to abandoningSomalia for international terrorists to wreak havocthere and in the subregion. The establishment of abroad-based Government in Somalia that includes allthe major political forces in the country is a crucialstep towards peace-making in Somalia  for which thereis no substitute. Ethiopia intends  along with othermembers of the IGAD subcommittee on Somalia  toplay a more proactive role for the realization of thisobjective.We are also prepared to do our level best to assistin the process of national reconciliation in Sudan. Weplan to be more active in this undertaking as well. Webelieve that to bring the peace process forward  the willand determination of the parties is critical. But theyneed to be assisted  and assist we will  in good faithand with all the necessary responsibility.With regard to the situation between Ethiopia andEritrea and the implementation of the Algiers PeaceAgreement  it is neither prudent nor proper for me toconceal from the international community both ourdisappointment and  more importantly  our growingconcern. But let me  right from the outset  lest I bemisunderstood  make one important point absolutelyclear. Ethiopia is committed to the peace process and to24the scrupulous implementation of the AlgiersAgreement. This is how we intend to continue in thefuture. We want the United Nations Mission inEthiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) to succeed.However  success in this or in any other conflictsituation cannot be achieved by the efforts of one of theparties alone. This describes the situation we are facingin the peace process between Ethiopia and Eritrea.Prudence dictates that we call a spade a spade. Eritreais not complying with the Algiers Agreement  anagreement which we believe is fair and in the interestof both parties to protect.The Temporary Security Zone established by theAlgiers Agreement is required to be a demilitarizedzone separating the two forces. This is the most criticalprovision of the Algiers Agreement  whose violationwould logically unravel the whole peace process.Eritrea has continued to refuse to maintain the integrityof the Temporary Security Zone as a demilitarizedbuffer area between the two forces. Regrettably  thisviolation is taking place under UNMEE’s nose. Wehave continued to complain  but in vain.UNMEE might have felt that Eritrea’s compliancewould eventually be secured through appeasement andby ignoring Ethiopia’s legitimate concern. But ourexperience has made it unmistakably clear thatappeasement has never worked with Eritrea. And it isnot working now. What we have started witnessinglately is an ever-increasing mobilization of troops byEritrea along the common border. Under thesecircumstances  lack of vigilance on the part of UNMEEand its policy of appeasement appears to be makinganother round of fighting close to inevitable. TheEritrean authorities might have felt that tension alongthe common border is useful in the light of domesticpolitical necessities. It might serve a purpose fordiverting popular attention from the domestic front  butit is manifestly reckless and dangerous. Under thecircumstances  we call on the United Nations  as a co-guarantor of the Algiers Peace Agreement  to shoulderits full responsibility to ensure that the Agreement isscrupulously followed. The Security Council shouldsend an unambiguous message to Eritrea toimmediately desist from all actions that endanger thepeace process.UNMEE needs to wake up and take Ethiopia’sreal concern seriously. Let there be no doubt aboutEthiopia’s continuing commitment to the scrupulousobservance of the Algiers Agreement and to the peaceprocess. Ethiopia will continue to do this faithfully.Ethiopia is also equally determined to respond to realthreats  and reserves its right to act in self-defence.There should be no doubt about Ethiopia’scommitment to peace and stability and to carrying outits responsibilities to the best of its abilities on mattersthat affect the international community as a whole ─first of all in its own subregion and in Africa. Itscommitment to the United Nations endures. Ethiopia isa country that has always been true to principles ofinternational law and to their scrupulous observance.We are proud of this tradition and we cherish it. This isa tradition we will continue to be guided by."
"56",2337,"FIN",56,2001,"﻿The terrorist attacks of11 September are going to thoroughly change theworld  but we do not yet know how. The aftermath ofthese events has shown that there are more issues thatunite us than issues that separate us. We also know thatpreventing terrorism and other global threats requiresthe broadest possible cooperation. The United Nationsis the main forum for such cooperation. This wasdemonstrated immediately after the attacks  when boththe General Assembly and the Security Councilpromptly condemned the terrorist attacks as threats tointernational peace and security and expressed theirreadiness to combat all forms of terrorism. Now it isextremely urgent to finalize the negotiations on acomprehensive convention on the suppression ofinternational terrorism. I appeal to everyone to quicklyagree on the outstanding draft in question.These attacks have also profoundly affected oursense of security  both as Member States and asindividuals. Fear and insecurity were globalizedovernight. But democratic societies cannot bedestroyed by such acts. When faced with threats ourcommon values and democracy will only get stronger.Finland condemns terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations  and whoever its victims may be. Thereis no justification for it.I extend  on behalf of the Government of Finland our condolences to the families of the victims  to thecitizens of New York and to all Americans  includingPresident Bush. We have expressed our solidarity withthe United States  as we would have done with anyother country affected by such attacks.The rapidly changing world and the new threatsrequire changed thinking in the internationalorganizations. We must respond quickly and efficientlyto the challenges of the real world. We cannot buryourselves in old rhetoric and positions when peopleoutside require concrete action and help. Internationalcooperation  after all  benefits all States  big and small.23I hope that the unique coalition and cooperation againstterrorism will be reflected on other issues of commonconcern to us.The statement in the Millennium Declaration thatthe United Nations is“the indispensable common house of the entirehuman family  through which we will seek torealize our universal aspirations for peace cooperation and development” (resolution 55/2 para. 32)is now truer than ever. The fight against terrorism andthe Afghan situation are at the top of the UnitedNations agenda  but there are other issues andprocesses that require true cooperation in order to besuccessful. In this context  I would like to underline theestablishment of the International Criminal Court andthe world conferences on sustainable development financing for development and children.One of our common responsibilities is themaintenance of international peace and security. This isone of the issues that unites us and is in everybody’sinterest. The United Nations is the only internationalorganization with global competence in the area ofsecurity policies. Ongoing crises are  however  socomplex that they require united efforts and combinedresources. This is particularly true of the Middle East where a return to the peace process is an urgentnecessity. To this end  we will have to pressure bothparties  as well as those who can influence them.The complexity of international crises hasrequired a close and comprehensive look by the UnitedNations at how to improve its performance in peaceoperations. The whole continuum that reaches fromconflict prevention  through crisis management to post-conflict peace-building  with a strong emphasis onpreventive action in every phase  requires a freshapproach  as proposed in the report of the BrahimiPanel and in the comprehensive review of theDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations. Finlandsupports the full implementation of such an approach.The report of the Secretary-General on theprevention of armed conflicts and its recommendationsare important contributions to the core activities of theUnited Nations. The Secretary-General’s call reiterated by the Security Council  on the developmentof a comprehensive conflict-prevention strategy istimely and warranted. By the adoption of theProgramme for the Prevention of Violent Conflicts  theEuropean Union has underlined its politicalcommitment to pursue conflict prevention as one of themain objectives in its external relations. This is also agood example of mutually supportive actions by theUnited Nations and the European Union. This is againan issue that requires a holistic view and a system-wideapproach.Finland supports increased focus on the part ofthe United Nations on crisis prevention and the rootcauses of conflicts. Promotion of democracy  humanrights  the rule of law  increased equality and socialdevelopment  as well as the prevention ofenvironmental threats and the eradication of poverty discrimination  racism and impunity  all point in thesame direction.The complexity of current crises — be they inAfghanistan  the Middle East  the Balkans or Africa —and the limited resources available have made differentorganizations seek cooperation and complementarity intheir actions. Chapter VIII of the United NationsCharter puts strong emphasis on regional arrangementsaimed at dealing with issues relating to internationalpeace and security. The Security Council should utilizesuch regional arrangements for enforcement action.The European Union is in the process ofdeveloping its own crisis-management capability  interms of both civilian and military capacities. In thiswork  Finland  just like the entire European Union  iscommitted to contributing to international peace andsecurity  in accordance with the principles of theUnited Nations Charter.The European Union has adopted conclusions onits cooperation in conflict prevention and crisismanagement with the United Nations. Areas andmodalities for such cooperation have been identified inclose cooperation with the United Nations. It willprogress as the European Common Security andDefence Policy develops its focus on substantive issuesand concrete needs in a pragmatic manner. Thiscooperation focuses on conflict prevention  civilian andmilitary aspects of crisis management and on regionalcrises like the ones in the western Balkans  the MiddleEast and Africa.There will be a wider and more concrete scopefor cooperation within two years when the EuropeanUnion achieves its military capability. At present  it isdifficult to say what kind of operations the European24Union could or would execute and when it could do so.In Finland’s case  our law requires that either theUnited Nations or the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe mandate such an operation.In today’s complex crises civilian aspects of crisismanagement have and will become all the morerelevant in all organizations. The European Union hasdeveloped its civilian capabilities in four priority areas namely civilian police  strengthening the rule of law strengthening civilian administration and civilprotection. In these areas  the European Union and theUnited Nations  as well as other internationalorganizations  must also seek synergies andcomplementarity.The Millennium Summit and the MillenniumDeclaration are outstanding achievements in the historyof the United Nations. The Declaration manifests aunique commitment to multilateralism by all theMember States of the United Nations. It sets anambitious agenda and goals for the United Nations foryears to come. However  without effectiveimplementation it is only a piece of paper. Itsimplementation also requires common action andstrengthened commitment to multilateralism. TheSecretary-General’s road map gives us guidance onhow to maintain the millennium momentum and how toproceed  although the onus is on the Member States.This year alone the United Nations has organizedfive conferences and special sessions and hundreds ofother meetings that are an integral part of the follow-upand implementation of the Millennium Declaration.These processes should show the same kind ofcommitment as was encountered in the Summit.Unfortunately  I have to say that none of these recentconferences and special sessions has come close toreflecting the commitment that was so noticeable in theMillennium Summit. We need invigorated commonefforts to genuinely implement the ambitious agendaadopted only a year ago and to uphold multilateralism.I hope we can see improvement in this respect incoming summits and conferences.The moral and political commitment to theDeclaration should lead to its effective implementation.The strong support for these common objectives andour determination to achieve them need much moreaction in order to become a reality. Such challenges ashalving  by the year 2015  the proportion of peopleliving in poverty should not be jeopardized by narrownational interests.Globalization and harnessing it to benefit allhumankind remain one of the major challenges to theinternational community. A common approach isneeded in this work too. We have to learn how to dealwith the paradox of democracy spreading across theworld  and there is much disillusionment about itsworkings. The key to explaining this paradox isglobalization. It poses a demand to develop strong new  democratic policies and institutions forinternational and global governance. They must bedeveloped in the United Nations  but also at theregional level  such as in the European Union.The Government of Finland recently prepared astudy on Finnish policies on globalization. One of itsmain conclusions was that in resolving multinationalcrises created by globalization  the role of cooperationbetween national Governments will be growing  notdiminishing. The United Nations is the most universalforum for intergovernmental cooperation. Finlandsupports the United Nations as one of the central actorsin harnessing globalization at the universal level."
"57",2381,"FJI",56,2001,"﻿Fiji mourns the recent lossesand world-changing tragedies which the United Statesof America has endured. We remember the many liveslost in that adversity  and we express the hope thatpeace and goodwill may prevail. Now is the time tomake haste to galvanize collaborative efforts bydeveloped and developing nations in the global fightagainst terrorism.We congratulate His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo and the Government of the Republic of Korea onAmbassador Han’s assumption of the presidency of the25General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. We pledgecomplete support during his term of office  fully awarethat the qualities that have marked his eminent anddistinguished career promise a resounding conclusionto the fifty-sixth session of the General Assemblydespite its difficult start.Fitting tribute is also due to his predecessor Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland. His leadership over theprevious year successfully concluded a truly hectic andfull schedule of business  including some difficultissues and special sessions during the period of thefifty-fifth session. He leaves an indelible mark in theannals of the United Nations.My Government congratulates His ExcellencyMr. Kofi Annan on his appointment as Secretary-General for a second term; this signifies the trust andconfidence that the United Nations places in him. Hehas aptly been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize  whichhe shares with the United Nations. Fiji welcomes theroad map he has outlined for the Organization  which under his creative and competent leadership  willdeliver the reforms needed to launch the Organizationinto the twenty-first century.In the wake of the political crisis that triggeredinstability in Fiji in 2000  my Government set itselftwo immediate tasks: to restore constitutionaldemocracy and to stabilize our fragile economy. Thosegoals are being achieved. Moreover  my Government iscontinuing to pursue strong economic performancethrough increased investment and development.I am honoured to inform the Assembly that  only18 months after its political crisis  Fiji successfullyconcluded the general elections and formed amultiparty Government in September 2001. MyGovernment is confident that  with the support of theUnited Nations and the international community  Fiji’sforward-looking policies will steer it ahead on a path ofdemocratic rule and sustainable economicdevelopment.Fiji acknowledges the support rendered to us bythe United Nations and by Member States in thedeployment of the United Nations electoral observationteam during our elections. The team discharged itsduties professionally and impartially. We are confidentthat it will provide the Assembly with a positiveappraisal of the conduct of the elections as free andfair — conduct to which we have been wellaccustomed throughout our electoral history.I should like to convey my Government’s deepgratitude to those Member States that supported Fijiand to those that sponsored resolution 55/280  whichenabled the participation of the United Nationsobserver team.Our leaders are committed  under the MillenniumDeclaration of 2000  to the principles of human dignity equality and equity  especially with respect to thosewho are most vulnerable  in particular the children who are our future. It is a timely and constructivecommitment that creates the necessary globalframework for addressing the plight of the poor and thevulnerable in the face of the accelerating impact ofglobalization and trade liberalization.Poverty is at the root of many problems. As themost powerful destabilizing force  it threatensdemocracy and good governance. It is thus our mostinsidious enemy. Successive Human DevelopmentReports amply document abysmal accounts of povertyand poverty indicators. A total of 1.2 billion peoplelive on less than $1 a day  more than a billion people indeveloping countries lack access to safe water  andmore than 2.4 billion people lack adequate sanitation.We are talking not millions  but billions.Poverty reduction is therefore our greatestchallenge today. The Millennium Declaration set atarget to halve global extreme poverty by 2015. Thisgoal must be the cornerstone of all developmentefforts. It demands an ongoing commitment andeffective measures on the part of the internationalcommunity.In this connection  my Government has created anew Ministry for Poverty Alleviation  which is a keypolicy factor in our triennial Strategic DevelopmentPlan. We recognize that economic  social and politicalstability are inextricably tied to reducing the gapbetween rich and poor. That equation must alsorecognize the unique vulnerabilities that beset thefragile economies of developing countries such as Fiji.Complementary legislation is also beingdeveloped in the Social Justice Bill to translate intopolicy the constitutional provision for social equity.Primarily  the Bill will regulate affirmative actionpolicies for disadvantaged groups in the areas and inthe manner prescribed in the Fiji Constitution. This is acritical step in Fiji’s efforts towards national unity andnation-building and its efforts to address issues ofsocial  ethnic and economic development and harmony.26Today  in our journey in this world  we aremeeting with unprecedented challenges anduncertainties  ranging from widespread global conflictto escalating terrorist activities and economicmarginalization. The Assembly and the United Nationssystem must devise appropriate  creative responses tothese difficult questions  in ways that are compatiblewith the goals of world peace and security  asenshrined in the United Nations Charter.Current organizational reform plans presentconstructive and necessary platforms for meeting thesespecific challenges. An amicable agreement on theexpansion of the permanent or non-permanentmembership of the Security Council could well presentus with new and fresh avenues for solutions. Mydelegation reiterates our full support for an expansionof both membership categories of the Security Council.We congratulate the Security Council on the supportthat its landmark resolution 1325 (2000) received  aresolution whose implementation will allow forincreased involvement on the part of women in theprocess of achieving peace and security.Fiji has excelled in its efforts to achieve thepeacekeeping goals of the United Nations Charter. Weremain fully committed to this goal and to the Brahimirecommendations for reform. Our military is serving invarious United Nations missions  including in Lebanon East Timor and Kuwait. Our police officers are servingin Bosnia and Kosovo. It is gratifying to see positiveconclusions to several peacekeeping mandates and theirimpending withdrawal or downsizing. We wouldcaution  however  against any exit without strategy  inorder to give credence to the huge investment ofgoodwill and resources by the United Nations and theinternational community  and to avoid a situation ofdouble jeopardy for the people trapped in armedconflict.In this regard  we support new measures tostrengthen the protective regime of the Convention onthe Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel.Its scope needs to include United Nations andhumanitarian personnel on the ground  who need realprotection and security while working to ensure thesafety of  and caring for  civilians.Fiji has consistently advocated decolonizationand self-determination since joining the UnitedNations. We note the delay in the implementation ofthe Declaration on the Granting of Independence toColonial Countries and Peoples. Fiji supports theongoing work of the Committee of 24 and recognizesthe political and diplomatic constraints involved.Early on in this Second Decade for theEradication of Colonialism  the 17 Non-Self-GoverningTerritories  mostly small island Territories in theCaribbean and Pacific regions  need our focusedattention  so that their legitimate aspirations for self-determination can be recognized.The Declaration of Commitment on theHIV/AIDS pandemic demands that we exercise greatervigilance and focus sincerely on safeguarding ourdevelopment gains and on our future goals. We in thePacific are seeking to maintain our low infection ratetrend  as we stand to lose the most if we fail to abideby that Declaration. Only collaboration and solidarityat the international  regional and national levels cansave humanity from this invasive scourge.Despite the recent political disturbances in Fiji respect for the rule of law and for international humanrights standards has been maintained. The continuedexistence and independence of the Fiji Human RightsCommission is testimony to our commitment to humanrights.Fiji  along with several of its Pacific Islandneighbours  is for the first time facing the dilemmasposed by refugees and asylum seekers. Internationalhuman trafficking has brought them to our shores despite the vast distances between our lands.International refugees are the direct result of violationsand breaches of human rights. As a State party to theConvention relating to the Status of Refugees and to itsProtocol  Fiji pleads with Member States to respect therights of refugees and to support the work of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees. At the veryleast  Member States are obligated to protect the rightsof their citizens in their own homeland.Fiji co-sponsored the resolution on Korean peace security and reunification during the fifty-fifth sessionof the General Assembly. We are elated to see peaceand reunification initiatives in the Korean peninsula.Likewise  the small island developing States areseeking continually to enhance our internationalparticipation. Strengthening future relations betweenthe United Nations and the Pacific Islands Forum is amutually beneficial avenue. This will allow for oureffective participation in the United Nations system. It27also affords the United Nations with a unique andauthentic Pacific perspective and voice. Cooperationbetween the Pacific Islands Forum and the UnitedNations is a welcome addition to this session’s agendaand promises greater returns  with the support ofMember States.Our Pacific Islands Forum leaders will meet inFiji in 2002. It is therefore opportune to renew ourinvitation to Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General  tovisit the Pacific Islands Forum region. Recent politicalevents in the Pacific and the successful domestic regional and international initiatives to address theseconcerns can only be positively reinforced by such ahigh-level  goodwill visit by the Secretary-General  totake place early  rather than later  in his second term ofoffice.Our global development agenda demands of theUnited Nations an increased facilitating role in thecoordination of economic  financial  trade and socialissues. At the International Conference on Financingfor Development in March 2002  stakeholders willdeliberate on enhancing coherence and coordinationbetween development and social objectives. Fiji hopesthat the Conference will inspire the internationalcommunity and financial institutions  including theBretton Woods institutions  to support and devise newstandards and indicators  such as the vulnerabilityindex  to effectively address poverty and otherdisparities.Growing imbalances and marginalization in theworld economy are a threat to humanity  in particularto Fiji and other small island developing States (SIDS).Sustainable development depends on a given level ofresources to propel our fragile economies forward.Moreover  these resources are needed to sustain long-term  sound  economic and environmentally friendlydevelopment. The critical role of the internationalcommunity is to assist us in nation-building andefficient resource utilization so that we can fulfil oursocial obligations.Fiji has long expounded to the internationalcommunity how vulnerable and heavily dependent oureconomies are on the vagaries and whims of the globaleconomy. Our small size  extremely remote distancefrom the international markets and increasingsusceptibility to natural disasters do not lendthemselves well to economies of scale of production  tobuilding export-based trade or to gaining competitiveaccess to foreign markets for our products. Clearly  ourability to benefit fully from globalization is doomedfrom the start  further aggravating the divide betweenthe rich and poor. It is my Government’s aspiration thatthe scope of equitable and tangible benefits fromglobalization and trade liberalization is still to be fullyrealized if we are to meaningfully tackle global andhuman poverty.As a member of the World Trade Organization Fiji is concerned at the fast erosion of trade preferencesin the world trade in agricultural products  sugar beinga mainstay of our economy. Increasingly  we fear thatsmall island States like my own  which dependpredominantly on agricultural export commodities  willbe seriously affected without adequate marketsafeguards. We are forced to question the efficacy of amultilateral trade framework as a fair mechanism inpromoting the interests of SIDS like Fiji.In this context  we welcome the current work onfinancing for development and preparations for theWorld Summit on Sustainable Development. Targetedassistance and official development assistanceprogrammes to enable us to fully implement andstrengthen investment and productivity mustnecessarily complement our efforts through regional ormultilateral trading agreements. We are optimistic thatnext year’s high-level conferences will flag ourconcerns in line with the Barbados Programme ofAction and the development goals that are set out in theMillennium Declaration."
"58",2428,"FRA",56,2001,"﻿At theoutset  it is a great pleasure for me to congratulate thePresident on his election  which is a sign of the esteemin which he and his country are held.Coming after his re-election to a second term ─which is a sign of the general confidence he hasearned ─ the Nobel Peace Prize that has been awardedto the Secretary-General is a well-deserved tribute tohis work and  through him  to the United NationsOrganization as a whole  thereby inspiring greater hopethan ever before.On this my third visit to New York since thetragedy of 11 September  I also want to express onceagain my profound emotion and pay homage to thepeople of New York  who are being so severely tested and to their courageous mayor  who is now finishinghis term.The unprecedented magnitude and gravity of theterrorist attacks on New York and Washington on 11September warrant our unfailing solidarity and anexceptional response. In its resolution 1368 (2001) which was adopted unanimously  the Security Councilrightly qualified those acts as attacks and  hence  aslegitimately meriting a defensive response underArticle 51 of the Charter. The United States is thusentirely within its legal and political rights in carryingout its targeted military response against the terroristorganizations responsible for those acts. The militaryaction under way was therefore inevitable  and must bepursued until all its objectives have been achieved.Given the preliminary results achieved yesterday  Ihope that those objectives will be met as soon aspossible. The leaders of these terrorist networks andthose who support them must be decisively preventedfrom committing further harm.But that military action should  as a matter ofcourse  form part of an overarching strategy thatincludes immediate  broad-scale humanitarian actionthat is better adapted to the needs of people in distress.France has put forward several proposals in this regardand supports the current initiatives for bettercoordination. That overarching strategy should alsoinclude a political solution — something that has nowbecome urgent — and strive to ensure that the demiseof the Taliban regime does not lead to factionalinfighting and chaos; and it must once again make theAfghan people masters of their own future. That is theaim of the action plan for Afghanistan that Franceproposed back on 1 October  and of the othercontributions it has made with the same goals in mind.We await Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi’s proposals withinterest; they should set forth broad outlines of actionfor the United Nations. On these bases  the SecurityCouncil should be able to adopt a framework resolutionwithin a few days  endorsing Mr. Brahimi’s proposalsand spelling out the modalities of United Nationssupport for the establishment of an Afghan26Government representative of the various constituentsof the population. There is no question of imposing onAfghanistan some ready-made solution concocted byoutsiders. I call on all the constituents of the Afghannation and all neighbouring countries to heed thegeneral interest of Afghanistan and its people. This iscompatible with respect for the legitimate interests ofthe various parties concerned and it is the only way toturn our backs on the past.Beyond immediate military  diplomatic andhumanitarian action  our common fight againstterrorism needs to be pursued in all its forms  includingpolice  judicial and others. The United Nations willhave a crucial role to play in this difficult struggle laying down universal obligations for each State andthe framework for our action. A series of conventionshas already been concluded  particularly theInternational Convention for the Suppression of theFinancing of Terrorism  which I proposed in this veryplace in 1999. We must speed up the signature andratification of those conventions. The GeneralAssembly must quickly conclude the negotiations onthe comprehensive convention on internationalterrorism. For its part  the Security Council shouldoversee the coordinated implementation by States of itsresolution 1373 (2001).Action against terrorism also needs to be carriedout through other organizations  in conjunction withthe United Nations and consistent with its policies. Forits part  the European Union (EU) has just takenunprecedented steps to strengthen police and judicialcooperation among its member States  including thecreation of a European arrest warrant. An ambitiousaction plan has been agreed. The 29 members of theFinancial Action Task Force (FATF) have decided toextend the fight against money-laundering to the fightagainst the financing of terrorism. Beyond that  Ipropose the creation of a dialogue forum to move us inthis direction. Several other organizations  too  willhave a role to play  so that at the end of the day everycountry will be making a contribution.Leaving aside the hoped-for short-term results the obstacles notwithstanding  we will not achievelasting victory against all forms of terrorism unless wesucceed in depriving terrorists of their breeding groundand eliminating the pretexts from which theyfallaciously draw their justification  and unless weeradicate them in the true sense of the term. Thatimplies nothing short of changing our world. And letno one claim that this would be tantamount tojustifying the terrorists. For neither my country  norEurope  nor the United Nations — in other words  noneof us — waited for 11 September to discover  condemnand seek to remedy the ills of the world. Yet how manygood intentions have come to naught? How manyresolutions have gone unimplemented? How manyannouncements have failed to materialize  which nowfeed a sense of bitterness and incomprehension? It ispointless to condemn or deny the theory of a clash ofcivilizations. Rather  we must fight against such a risk which is by no means wholly imaginary  and againstthose who would make it a reality.This should be one more pressing reason for usall to find a solution to regional crises  particularly inthe Middle East. Since 1982  France has called for thecreation of a Palestinian State. Naturally  it would haveto be viable  democratic and peaceful  and it shouldgive credible undertakings as regards Israel’s security.Guarantees will be needed  yet the Palestinian State isnot the problem; it is the solution for reasons based onrights  humanity and security. Such is the EU’scommon stance today. This morning  before theAssembly  President Bush himself has made this hisobjective. It is the path of reason — the only path thatcan halt the murderous spiral of conflict between thetwo peoples.Admittedly  responsibility for a lasting peaceagreement lies first and foremost with the protagonists.Unless they make the move  no one else will be able toovercome their fears and resentment and put an end tothe suffering of these two peoples. Yet  the increasingthreat that this conflict poses to international peace andsecurity requires that those who have the will and themeans join forces in a push for peace  given that themain players are evidently unable to do so unaided.The urgency of the situation in the Near Eastobviously should not make us forget Iraq. Regionalsecurity still needs to be secured by restoring aninternational monitoring capability and by alleviatingthe suffering of the Iraqi people through the lifting ofthe embargo on civilian goods. I hope the discussionsnow in progress in the Security Council will finallybring this about.Nor should we forget the Caucasus  where ancientquarrels live on and where new ones are rising to thefore. Yet  here again there is no other way than to seeknegotiated political solutions.27In the Balkans  we realized that internationalinvolvement must be sustainable. Thanks to it  andthanks to new leaders  noteworthy progress has beenachieved towards democracy  reconciliation andregional cooperation over the last two years. We mustmake sure these positive changes are not challenged byoutmoded patterns of behaviour. We must maintain andpursue the Europeanization of the Balkans.Turning to the Great Lakes region  we know thatthe lasting resolution of the conflict  which involvesmore than eight countries  will be a negotiated solutionthat will ensure the restoration of the sovereignty of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo and include as wellsafeguard clauses to protect the security of each of theStates. The Lusaka Agreement and the relevantSecurity Council resolutions provide the framework forending this crisis  but they should be applied as quicklyas possible. To halt the illegal use of the resources ofthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  which oftenoccurs in association with forced child labour  shouldbe an immediate priority.In all the cases I have just referred to briefly —and there are others — the problem we have to resolveis the coexistence of peoples who are at once close andantagonistic  deeply affected and divided by historyand separated by fear and the spirit of revenge. We willachieve this only through perseverance and a clearunderstanding of each particular situation  guided bythe principles of the United Nations.Even if we managed to resolve all these regionalcrises and others as well  our task would still not beover because  at the global level  the gulf betweenintentions for the world as stated at internationalmeetings and actual realities is becoming intolerablefor many peoples. We must redouble our efforts tocreate humane globalization. We saw this in Seattle  wesaw it in Genoa  and even more so in Durban. We cansee it in the reactions to the Afghan crisis and to manyother issues. Despite the United Nations and our goodresolutions  there is still no real universal consensus.What we call “the international community” has yet tobe built. Is this a reason to throw in the towel? To thecontrary – absolutely not. France has long beendetermined to add its stone to this edifice. We havealready put forward numerous proposals to that end andwill continue to do so  with increased conviction.Need I recall our well-known major objectives forthe world?First  we must achieve a fairer distribution ofwealth; 3 billion people currently live on less than 2dollars per day  and the global income gap between therichest and the poorest has doubled over the last 40years.Second  we must end impunity.Third  we must guarantee sustainabledevelopment everywhere — “sustainable”  that littleword that makes all the difference  or which shouldmake all the difference. The World Summit inJohannesburg in September 2002 will provide anopportunity to affirm a vision and a benchmark ofdevelopment based on three intimately linked pillars:economic  social and environmental.Fourth  we must help refugees and fully respectthe right of asylum.Fifth  we must manage population movements ina humanitarian manner.Sixth  we must draft international standards in ademocratic way to ensure that they are entirelylegitimate and that everyone will consequently bebound to comply with them.Seventh  we must no longer tolerate situations ofhuman distress. State sovereignty  which remains anessential feature of the international system  cannot  inextreme emergencies  be regarded as an absoluteprinciple serving as a pretext for inaction. The SecurityCouncil must be able to fully assume itsresponsibilities in cases of gross human rightsviolations  for these also pose threats to internationalpeace and security.Eighth  we must aim at promoting balanced andnegotiated disarmament  which strengthens securityand strategic stability.Ninth  we must strive to allow all languages cultures and civilizations to exist while maintaining adialogue with one another.Tenth  we must seek to improve the state ofhealth worldwide  which for one thing means devotingmore resources to combating HIV/AIDS. I would hopethat the new Global AIDS and Health Fund will bemade operational by the beginning of 2002.But we are undoubtedly now more aware than inrecent years that the attainment of these objectives which are both indispensable  and very ambitious  calls28different rules and different mechanisms  starting withthe reform and enlargement of the Security Council which we have waited for all too long; with respect forthe role of the General Assembly; with the ratificationof the major multilateral instruments — I am thinkingof the Statute of the International Criminal Court andthe Kyoto Protocol  among others; with a moreappropriate and less indiscriminate use of sanctionswhen they are needed; with a clarification of therespective and legitimate roles of Governments andcivil society; with an agreement on the modalities ofinterference to deal with large-scale and extremeemergency situations; with a regulation anddevelopment round at the World Trade Organization(WTO)  which is starting today in Doha; with closercooperation and greater consistency between the WTOand the International Labour Organization; with thecreation of a world environmental organization; andwith reform of the international financial institutions. Ishall stop this list here. I could go on  for there is somuch that remains to be done.All of us  as Members of the United Nations  arefaced with this challenge. But I do not hesitate to sayhere that the rich countries — in other words  the Westand a handful of other countries from the Organizationfor Economic Cooperation and Development  wheresome 1.135 billion men and women live  have evenmore responsibility than others. Now that the illusionsof the last 10 years have been dispelled  the choicebefore us is harsh  but clear: either a world so unjustthat we have conflict with no foreseeable end  or  onthe contrary  an international community of the UnitedNations  at last worthy of the name  to solve togetherhumanity’s common problems and ensure its future.But building this community  instead of just talkingabout it or yearning for it  will mean for some of usgiving up privileges  sharing wealth and power in newways  and rewriting certain rules hitherto held to beinviolable. As the Nobel Prize-winning economistJoseph Stiglitz has written  free trade was designed byWestern countries for the Western countries. This isdebatable  of course  but none of this will happenwithout sacrifices  above all on the part of the rich andpowerful countries.At this very moment  a reshuffling of diplomaticcards on a grand scale is under way between the UnitedStates  Russia  China  Europe  the Arab or Muslimworld  the other coalition partners  the rest of the worldand the United Nations. I hope — I truly hope — thatthis will help to bring about a vital awakening and thatmy country  Europe and the United Nations will follownew avenues  in deeds and not just words  and that allof us  together  will successfully extend the neededcoalition against terrorism to turn it into a coalition foran equitable world  and that this will lay thegroundwork for a renewal of the international system."
"59",2453,"FSM",56,2001,"﻿I would like to take thisopportunity to congratulate you  Sir  on your election.My Government hails the selection of a leader withsuch esteemed qualifications  and we are confident youwill lead the work of this body with the same highcompetence and spirit as did your distinguishedpredecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland. We alsoshare the pride felt by every Member of this body inthe award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the UnitedNations Organization and to its highly admiredSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. We take greatsatisfaction in his re-election to another term especially in this critical period.Words cannot describe the horror of my people atthe tragic event which unfolded here in New York  inWashington and other locations in September — andthe one yesterday. On behalf of my people  pleaseallow me to reiterate our deepest and most sincerecondolences to the Government of the United Statesand to the victims and their families from all over theworld. Our resolve to combat international terrorism isunwavering. My country will stand ready to assist inany way it can in order to help bring those responsiblefor these heinous acts to justice and to ease thesuffering of those affected by their actions.The recently completed special debate onterrorism by this body makes it clear that we are allbrothers in this fight  with a shared determination to dowhat it takes to eradicate this blight on civilization.But  despite the great sadness in all our hearts over therecent and ongoing events  the regular work of thisbody cannot be derailed. Part of winning this battle isto demonstrate the commitment and capacity of thisbody to carry on with the great work of the Charter andon all sides.Thus  in addition to other actions that are beingtaken to confront the current crisis  I call upon allMember States to ratify and bring into force as soon aspossible the International Convention for theSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism  which wasadopted by a resolution of the General Assembly on 9December 1999. I signed this important Conventionyesterday on behalf of the Federated States ofMicronesia  and I anticipate its prompt ratification byour Congress.2I take pleasure in saying that this year marks thetenth anniversary of the Federated States ofMicronesia’s membership in the United Nations. Inthose 10 years  my nation and the world at large haveundergone unprecedented change. With the assistanceof the United Nations system  the Micronesian peoplehave worked tirelessly to forge our own identity at theinternational level.Fifteen years ago  we entered into a relationshipof Free Association with the United States of America.It is a relationship largely unprecedented ininternational relations. This arrangement was subject togreat scrutiny by the United Nations  which ultimatelyapproved the end of our status as a United NationsTrust Territory. It is testimony to the efforts of thisbody and the United Nations system that I stand beforeyou today as the representative of a nation — an equalin the community of nations.For hundreds of years  our culture was isolatedfrom the rest of the world. In the past 10 years  ourmembership in the United Nations has opened up newhorizons  new partnerships and a new understanding ofpeoples. We also note our appreciation for the specialknowledge we have gained through our interactionswith all of you here in this forum and elsewhere in theUnited Nations system.In the past 10 years  the world  like Micronesiaitself  has changed at a pace heretofore unknown.Although we may celebrate some victories in conflictprevention  clearly  other grave challenges remain  andnew threats to international peace and security haveemerged. We are encouraged at seeing the UnitedNations assert its leadership in combating theseproblems.The past year has brought an ambitious slate ofnew United Nations initiatives to enhance the well-being of peoples throughout the world. There are farmore noteworthy new initiatives than I have time tomention here. But please allow me to highlight a few ofthem.While the effects of some grave threats to theFederated States of Micronesia will gradually manifestthemselves over the coming decades  my nation iscurrently grappling with an ongoing and immediateconcern: poverty. I am not speaking of the poverty ofhunger and unchecked disease  but of the all-too-common developing world condition that has resultedfrom the persistent failure of all nations to achieveequal and equitable sharing of the world’s bounties.Unfortunately  we are not alone  but this provides littlesolace. We applaud the United Nations as it continuesits heroic work to reduce poverty and to bring a betterstandard of living to all peoples of the world. We willcontinue to work with our colleagues within the Groupof 77 and China to further poverty reduction measuresand to improve the standard of living of all humankind.The historic isolation of the Federated States ofMicronesia has sheltered us from the scourge of manycommunicable diseases  such as AIDS. Our integrationwith the world community has brought about changehere as well. In this past year my country experiencedits first domestic case of HIV infection. This is minorin comparison to the experience of those countries thathave been devastated by the disease  but it is cause forconcern  nonetheless  in a country of little more than100 000 people. We wholeheartedly support UnitedNations initiatives in this regard  such as the recentlyconcluded General Assembly special session onHIV/AIDS.Traditional conflicts remain and  most troubling many old animosities have spilled over into openhostilities. This serves to underscore the importance ofUnited Nations initiatives  such as this year’s WorldConference against Racism  Racial Discrimination Xenophobia and Related Intolerance  which recentlyconcluded in Durban  South Africa.After many years of overall peace andtranquillity  our region of the Pacific islands hasrecently seen a few long-standing conflicts erupt intoviolence of disturbing proportions. We applaud theefforts of the United Nations aimed at arriving atpeaceful settlements  and the Federated States ofMicronesia lends its full support to ongoing measuresdesigned to keep the peace.In the Pacific  one of the most effective means tothat end has always been the Pacific Islands Forum. Inthe 30 years of its existence  the Pacific Islands Forumhas played a pivotal role in maintaining the peace andsecurity of our region. It has also contributed to notableprogress on a broad slate of economic and socialissues. I was pleased to participate in the recentmeeting of the Forum and can express my country’sfull support for this year’s communiqué  which hasbeen issued as a document of this session of theGeneral Assembly.3As a nation with one of the youngest populationsin the world  the issues of children and youth are ofutmost concern to us. We therefore commend thedecision to hold the special session of the GeneralAssembly on children. We understand fully the need toreschedule it and are gratified that the Assembly hasdecided to hold this session next May in order to givethe issues of children and youth the prominence theydeserve. On a related note  I am pleased to report thatthe Federated States of Micronesia has begun theprocess of evaluation with a view to signing andratifying the two Optional Protocols to the Conventionon the Rights of the Child.Given the monumental pace of change  it is notsurprising that in some respects the United Nationsitself has been unable to keep pace with developments.We are appreciative of ongoing reform efforts  but wewould encourage redoubled efforts on remainingmatters that cry out for attention  such as thereconstitution of the Security Council.While my nation grapples with the entirespectrum of transnational problems  such as drugtrafficking and other aspects of international criminalactivity  there is one threat that has our specialattention. I am speaking  of course  about theaccelerated rise in sea level caused by global climatechange. We now know that the production ofgreenhouse gases by human activity plays a prominentrole. It is this global issue that threatens my country’sfuture as no other.The Federated States of Micronesia contributesonly in an infinitesimal way to the problem of human-induced climate change; yet we are among the “front-line” States that must deal with its impacts. We arecomprised of a geologically diverse range of islands from low-level coral atolls to mountainous volcanicoutcrops. All share one common denominator — sincethe dawn of time  our people’s livelihood has been tiedto the sea. Even on our high islands  such as Pohnpeiand Kosrae  the vast majority of the population on allislands lives in the coastal plain. On most islands  thepossibility of moving to higher ground does not exist.The distinguished scientists of theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)have confirmed that the climate is changing and thathuman activities are playing a significant part in thewarming of our planet. Credible scientific evidencesuggests that the magnitude of the impact of thatwarming may be greater than even the most extremeestimates just 10 years ago. Indeed  it may already betoo late to save my country and many others like itworldwide.Already  our region has seen the beginnings of themovement of its peoples as a result of the rise in sealevel caused by global warming. This year  Tuvalu  oneof our similarly situated neighbours in the region announced that it had begun examining relocationoptions. Unfortunately  its initial results were notencouraging  as there is no uniform willingness amongmore fortunate countries to provide a haven for thesefirst “climate change refugees”. Undoubtedly  it will bethe outlying atolls of the Federated States ofMicronesia  home to about half of our population  thatare among the next to join the people of Tuvalu ifcurrent trends continue.These developments point with new urgency tothe need for constructive discussion of adaptationstrategies and funding for small island developingStates. We are encouraged by the new attention paid tothese issues at the recent conference in Bonn  and wewelcome the constructive outcomes of the conferencejust completed in Marrakesh with regard to suchimportant issues as the enforcement of compliance.We and all other parties to the FrameworkConvention on Climate Change  signed nine years ago were motivated by the “precautionary principle” whereby the lack of airtight scientific certainty couldnot be the basis for inaction. Today  virtually nouncertainty remains as to the reality of the mainproblem. Yet we are dismayed to see that in the mediaand elsewhere a handful of “greenhouse gas sceptics”are often still given a podium equal to that given to thedistinguished scientists of the Intergovernmental Panelon Climate Change.In the past 10 years we have seen some progressin the form of the Framework Convention and theKyoto Protocol  thanks to the tireless efforts of manydelegations and good will on the part of Governments.However  a change in the position of several keysignatories to the Protocol  which are also among theworld’s largest generators of greenhouse gases undermines the success of the recent Bonn andMarrakesh talks  and has created a great deal ofconcern on the part of all low-lying island States. Wewarmly applaud those countries that have stood bytheir commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.4We call upon those that have not to find the politicalwill to take the actions that are  after all  in their ownlong-term best interests.I do not mean to ignore the initial economichardships these changes might entail; we understandthem all too well. In the last five years  the FederatedStates of Micronesia has taken unprecedented measuresto reduce the size of its public sector  far and away thelargest employer in my country. These moves werevastly unpopular politically. Still  they were necessaryand have put us on the right footing for a sustainableeconomic future. Similarly  longer-term economicbenefits and competitive advantage can be gained bythose nations that adopt a progressive climate changestrategy.We Micronesians are a proud people. Throughoutthe centuries  we have endured seeminglyinsurmountable difficulties. The threat from climatechange is only the latest of these. Like some others wehave faced  it is not of our own making  and it is notsomething that we can overcome by ourselves. TheKyoto Protocol  as it has been hammered out inMarrakesh  provides a necessary mechanism withwhich most nations can begin to attack globalwarming. I congratulate the negotiators on theirsignificant  even historic  accomplishment. Theemission cuts agreed to  however  amount to only asmall first step.In conclusion  I want to reiterate the sincerecondolences of the people of the Federated States ofMicronesia to those in all regions of the world who aresuffering today from violence  poverty  terrorism andthe violation of human rights. We pray for a peacefulend to the current conflicts raging throughout manyregions.We are reassured that the spirit and principles ofthe United Nations will guide leaders as they strive toprevent future outbreaks of violence while seeking torelieve current suffering. My delegation is proud of itscontributions during our first 10 years of membershipand pledges to do its utmost to continue to advance thegoals of the United Nations for the betterment of allpeople throughout the world."
"60",2496,"GAB",56,2001,"﻿I would like to begin by congratulating the Presidenton his outstanding election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at this session. His election reflectsthe recognition by the international community of theplace and the role that the Republic of Korea  a greatfriend of Gabon  plays in the world and particularly inAsia. I would like to assure him of our full cooperationduring his period of office.To his predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland I express the satisfaction of my delegation for theexcellent work done in the course of the last session.And to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  Iwould like to reaffirm the highest appreciation of theGovernment and the head of State of Gabon  HisExcellency El Hadj Omar Bongo  for the dedicationand determination with which he has endeavoured tomake a reality of the ideals of peace  justice andwelfare contained in the United Nations Charter. TheNobel Peace Prize  which has just been awarded to himas well as to the United Nations  is eloquent testimonyto the work being done by the United Nations system topromote peace and build a more prosperous world. Hecan rest assured of Gabon’s support for his efforts inthe service of the United Nations.It is little more than a year ago that the heads ofState and Government of the Member States of theUnited Nations met here in New York at the historicMillennium Summit. On that occasion  they laid downthe guidelines for the future work of the internationalcommunity and reaffirmed their commitment to thepurposes and principles set forth in the Charter of ourOrganization. The Millennium Summit thus enabledour nations to renew their commitment to act in unityand solidarity in order to take up the numerouschallenges facing the world.The tragedy which took place on 11 September2001 in the United States of America has  more thanever  strengthened our determination to combatinternational terrorism. We must put an end to it by allpossible means — military  diplomatic and political. Itis for this reason that Gabon unreservedly supportsSecurity Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373(2001) as well as the adoption of a comprehensiveconvention on terrorism.There is no possible doubt that the coalitionwhich has been created will be victorious in the fightagainst terrorism. In this surge of solidarity  theinternational community must  in parallel  findappropriate responses to the world problems that canserve as a pretext for certain radical groups. There is anurgent need to act to find solutions to the conflicts andeconomic and social problems of our time.31As far as armed conflicts are concerned  we areconvinced that if illicit trafficking in small arms andlight weapons could be ended  it would be easier toarrive at a prompt and lasting settlement. Theimplementation by everyone of the recommendationsof the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade inSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects  heldhere in New York last July  would enable us to reachthat goal.Faithful to the commitment of President OmarBongo  Gabon remains committed to and involved inefforts to restore peace in the world  particularly inAfrica. Here  I would like to express our satisfaction atthe return of peace to Congo (Brazzaville) following anational dialogue involving all parties  under theauspices of the international mediator. The stabilitywhich has been restored to this brother country hasmade possible the voluntary return of the numerousCongolese refugees from my country to their homessince August  thanks to excellent cooperation betweenthe High Commissioner for Refugees  the Gaboneseauthorities and the Congolese authorities. Similarly  wewelcome the significant progress that has been made inthe Burundi peace process  which on 1 November 2001culminated in the establishment of a transitionalgovernment.I would like to pay deserved tribute to formerPresident Nelson Mandela for the dedication anddetermination with which he conducted the process tothat important stage. For his part  the President of theGabonese Republic will  at the request of the membersof the Burundi Peace Initiative  pursue his efforts witha view to consolidating the peace process in thatcountry.Concerning the situation in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  we welcome the importantefforts already undertaken in establishing the UnitedNations peacekeeping mission. We earnestly hope thatthe Johannesburg phase will make possible the start ofan effective inter-Congolese dialogue.The situation in the Middle East  because of thethreat it presents to international peace and security  isalso a source of deep concern. I therefore urge theparties to resume negotiations  the only way to arrive ata lasting peace.At the very moment when the process ofglobalization of financial markets and trade is affectingevery aspect of the life of our societies  one mustrecognize that an ever-growing number of the world’speoples risk being marginalized if concrete measuresare not taken on their behalf. The internationalcommunity therefore needs to mobilize new andadditional resources to enable them to narrowconsiderably the gap separating them from others. Theforthcoming International Conference on Financing forDevelopment  scheduled for March 2002 at Monterrey Mexico  accordingly arouses great hopes. If thisimportant conference is well prepared  it will help us tosatisfy these legitimate expectations.Leaders have understood that Africa holds thekey to its own development. The creation of theAfrican Union and the New Partnership for Africa’sDevelopment are part of this logic. Much remains to bedone for development to blossom  but the foundationshave already been laid. To achieve full success however  Africa needs the assistance of the UnitedNations and the international community.Another question vital to our planet’s future at thebeginning of the third millennium is that of theprotection and preservation of the environment. TheWorld Summit on Sustainable Development  which isto be held in Johannesburg from 2 to 11 September2002  will provide us a further opportunity to evaluatethe progress made in implementing policies reflectingthe commitments we undertook in Rio de Janeiro 10years ago. What conclusions will we be able to draw asto the implementation of Agenda 21? What chance ofsuccess will we be prepared to give the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change and theKyoto Protocol  the United Nations Convention toCombat Desertification in Those CountriesExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification and the Convention on Biodiversity? In other words what we must do is to respond more simply anddirectly to the issue of the choices and concessions weare prepared to make to be able to pass on to futuregenerations a preserved environment that is similar tothe heritage we ourselves received from our fathers.Any efforts made by the countries of Africa toensure better economic growth will be in vain if nolarge-scale effort is mounted against such diseases asHIV/AIDS  tuberculosis  malaria and  not to beforgotten  arterial hypertension  which is another of themain causes of death in Africa. There is therefore anurgent need to implement the United Nationsrecommendations on AIDS  particularly with regard tocare  support and treatment. There is also an urgent32need to make operational the special Trust Fundcreated for that purpose.At a time when the United Nations  and inparticular the Security Council — the body primarilyresponsible for the maintenance of peace in theworld — is increasingly called upon to take on thenumerous challenges posed by the third millennium the matter of reforming that body continues to behighly relevant. Indeed  it is difficult to conceive how acontinent like Africa can be without permanentrepresentation on the Council.The reality of today’s world  divided betweenuniversalism and particular interests and identities clearly illustrates that humanity is still searching forharmony and unity. That is why we are firmlyconvinced that a solution to the concerns I have justmentioned is to be found in the internationalcommunity’s promotion of the virtues of dialogue andsolidarity  which are the pillars of the new humanism.Without respect for those values  the dream cherishedby the founders of our Organization to build a peacefuland united world will remain a chimera. Workingtowards establishing a new humanity free fromselfishness  hatred  passions and injustice mustconstitute our common concern."
"61",2543,"GBR",56,2001,"﻿Please allow mewarmly to congratulate you  Sir  on your assumption ofthe presidency of the fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly.This day  11 November  is the anniversary of theArmistice which ended the slaughter of the First WorldWar and is a day of remembrance here in the UnitedStates  in the United Kingdom and across much of theworld. It is a day when all of us remember the sacrificeof those who  over the last century  gave their lives thatothers might live in freedom.For our parents and grandparents  the end of theSecond World War stood as a turning point  a momentto establish a new world order. Their vision wasinscribed at the very beginning of the Charter of theUnited Nations:“We the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations fromthe scourge of war”.With these words  they founded the internationalcommunity.For some of us  the subsequent half-century hasbeen the most peaceful era of our history. Yet we knowthat no one’s freedom can be secure while others suffer.On this Remembrance Day  we remembersomething else — the thousands who died just twomonths ago  on 11 September. A third of the nationsrepresented here in the General Assembly lost citizensat the World Trade Center. But just as our predecessorssaw hope in the midst of despair  so we now face thetask of building a new and better world.It is fitting that it was here at the United Nations on 12 September  that the world began to fight backagainst the terrorist threat. We showed our jointresolve  in the Security Council and in the GeneralAssembly  when we adopted resolutions demandingthat terrorists and those who harbour them be held toaccount for their evil actions.I applaud Security Council resolution 1373(2001)  which established the Counter-terrorismCommittee and which requires all Member States torespond to the global terrorist threat.21We do surely have to take every effectivemeasure against international terrorist networks  whosemalign influence is felt in every part of the globe  notleast by adopting a comprehensive convention onterrorism and the draft Nuclear Terrorism Convention.We also have to confront an unpalatable truth:that we still face a real and immediate danger. Themurderous groups who plotted the terrible events of 11September could strike again at any time. Thus our firstduty  to our citizens and to each other  is to defendourselves against that threat.When the nations of the world agreed the UnitedNations Charter  they recognized the right of self-defence in Article 51. It is in exercise of this right thatthe military coalition is now engaged in action againstAl Qaeda and the Taliban regime which harbours them.Taking military action is always a tough decision.But here it truly was unavoidable  and we all owe adebt of gratitude to President Bush for the steadfast andcareful manner in which the United States proceeded.But in defending the world from terror  we haveto do our utmost to spare innocent Afghan peoplefurther suffering. For decades  the Afghans have seentheir country exploited by outside powers and riven byconflict. In five years  their society has beensystematically destroyed by one of the most brutalregimes the world has ever known.But at last today  the international community isunited in its efforts to feed and shelter the millions ofrefugees through this harsh winter  and it is determinedto help build a new Afghanistan.For the first time in decades  there is consensus inthe Security Council as a whole  and amongAfghanistan’s neighbours  that there should be a broad-based government in Kabul  reflecting Afghanistan’srich ethnic diversity  and that the future of Afghanistanmust be put into the hands of the Afghan people. Theremust be no more Great Games with Afghan people asthe pawns  and no more regional rivalries  with Afghanpeople as the victims.We know that the one institution in the worldwhich can deliver this better future is here now: theUnited Nations. We should all give AmbassadorBrahimi every support in planning a future that leads toAfghanistan retaking its place as a fully fledgedmember of the international community  able to protectand promote the interests of all of its people.That nations have come so closely together tofight terrorism shows how the world is changing.However  we have to build a deeper and widerconsensus to tackle the other great issues which weface. It is not just the Afghan people who have beenexcluded from the values on which the United Nationswas founded.Conflict  poverty  discrimination and injusticestill blight the lives of millions in every part of theglobe. Individuals’ rights  especially women’s rights are ignored with impunity  and then the very structureof communities collapses. Where this happens  wheresocieties disintegrate or States fail  we put at risk thebasis of global society itself.If 11 September teaches us anything  it is surelythis: that if we ignore our moral responsibilities to eachother  we will be forced later to face painfulconsequences.Nowhere is the need for action now more obviousthan in Africa. Yes  there has been some progress there.International work on the ground to resolve conflict hasbrought hope to Sierra Leone and to the Great Lakesregion. Responsible Governments working across thecontinent in partnership with effective internationaldonors have succeeded in reducing poverty. But weshould not delude ourselves about the scale of the taskthat remains in Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa averageincome today is much lower than it was 30 years ago.The New Partnership for African Developmenttherefore requires the support of the whole communityof nations. Africa deserves the same opportunities thatwe in the West take for granted. We in the West mustacknowledge that while removing barriers to globaltrade and to finance  we have not always dismantledbarriers to dignity and equality. In theory  global freetrade should have created the conditions for everyeconomy to exploit its comparative advantage in theworld marketplace. In practice  protectionist barriersstill survive  especially against trade in agriculture damaging Africa’s interests today  and all our intereststomorrow.As we meet here in New York  our colleagues atthe World Trade Organization meeting in Doha havethe opportunity to begin to put these injustices right.Launching a new trade round would be the clearestpossible signal of the world’s determination to spreadthe benefits of wealth and of prosperity more fairly.22Our predecessors gave us the United Nations. Inthe succeeding years  it developed expertise inpeacekeeping  in conflict prevention  in human rightsand in reconstruction  to consolidate the gains of 1945.My message today is that our generation faces asdaunting a task  but a different one. That task is todefeat international terrorism. But to do that we have tocombine the agenda of 10 September with the agendaof 11 September  as the Secretary-General emphasizedin his powerful speech yesterday. And we must take notonly military action  but also diplomatic action toreduce tensions that terrorists exploit.Nowhere are those tensions greater than in theMiddle East. The path to a settlement there is plain. Ithas to be based on a political process that implementsUnited Nations resolutions. It must deliver security forIsrael within recognized borders while at the same timecreating a viable Palestinian State. We should give theparties every help to reach a settlement. But our effortswill be wasted unless the parties themselves show thepolitical will to bring violence to a halt  and thepolitical courage to make a deal.We have seen  in the most graphic and brutal waypossible  that chaos in one part of the world canundermine security in all parts of the world. Againstthat chaos we must set our vision of peacefulcooperation among stable nations. Achieving thatvision has now taken on a new urgency. Indeed  we areat a moment of strategic opportunity  which comes nomore than once to any generation. We owe it to thosewho founded the international community to seize thismoment. Most of all  we owe it to those who will comeafter us.Today we remember with sorrow the sacrificesthat earlier generations made. We remember with pridethe brave decisions that they took to build a betterworld for us  and we salute the reconciliation andrecovery that followed. My hope is that our childrenand our grandchildren will look back on this periodwith no less pride  and that future generations will beable to say that we here faced up to a great evil; we didnot duck the decisions we had to take; we establishedpeace in Afghanistan  constructive coexistence in theMiddle East and sustained development in Africa. Wemade the necessary endeavour in the finest tradition ofthe United Nations.The United Nations stands for everything theterrorist seeks to destroy. My hope is that oursuccessors will look back on this era and say that wesaved succeeding generations from the scourge ofterrorism as well as from the scourge of war."
"62",2567,"GEO",56,2001,"﻿Let me congratulateyou  Sir  on your election to the demanding job of thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixthsession. It is a fitting recognition of Korea’s role in theinternational community and of your extensiveexperience and able leadership.I would also like to extend our congratulations toMr. Kofi Annan and the United Nations for the muchdeserved award of the Nobel Peace Prize. It shouldserve as an added source of inspiration for him in hissecond term as Secretary-General and for all of us here.The fifty-sixth session of the General Assemblyruns parallel to dramatic events for the development ofmankind. On behalf of the Government and the peopleof Georgia  I wish once again to express my sincerecondolences and compassion to the American peoplefor the tragic events of 11 September.15Ominous threats we had been talking about for solong have become real. Georgia  a country that over thepast decade has suffered terribly from differentmanifestations of terrorism  is an active participant inthe campaign against terror. The time is ripe forincreased cooperation from all States and peoples ofgood will in this fight against terror.I am referring not only to cooperation in themilitary field. Overcoming this evil requires closecooperation in development  the protection of humanrights  eradicating poverty and in many other fields.Today’s realities are a lesson to mankind on theconsequences and cost of indifference and a lack ofattention to what is happening all around the world.The United Nations is certainly a uniqueOrganization  where we  the Member States  can shapecommon strategies to combat many of the ills andproblems of the day. These strategies and action plansare worked into various United Nations resolutions decisions and declarations.The United Nations Millennium Declaration is agreat achievement in this regard. It is virtually a pledgeon the part of nations to a common fight against themanifold challenges we face today. Without any furtherdelay  Georgia  its people and all the peoples of theworld need a clear demonstration of readiness toimplement the commitments made in the Declaration.We are hopeful that the report of the Secretary-General entitled “Road map towards the implementation of theUnited Nations Millennium Declaration” (A/56/326).will become a guide for Governments around theworld.Strengthening the capacity of the United Nationsin the area of conflict settlement is crucial to thecreation of a new world order based on common valuesand principles. The world order of the twenty-firstcentury is clearly incompatible with the widespreadviolations of human rights  and this could lead to adestabilization of the international system.The reforms should also encompass UnitedNations peacekeeping operations. Georgia supports themeasures to enhance the effectiveness of UnitedNations preventive mechanisms. In the same context the early deployment of peacekeeping contingentsshould be more coherent and systematic in order toquell conflicts in their early stages. The launching of apeacekeeping operation or a change in its mandaterequires the consent of all sides involved. We areinclined to think that this approach requires revision.The cause of peace should rank as a higher priority forthe United Nations than the consent of any sideinvolved in the conflict.In the words of the Secretary-General “the international community must remainprepared to engage politically  and if necessarymilitarily  to contain menace and ultimatelyresolve conflicts that have got out of hand. Thiswill require a better functioning of the collectivesecurity system than exists at the moment. It willrequire  above all  a greater willingness tointervene to prevent gross violations of humanrights.”Internal conflicts spawned by separatism are noless dangerous to international security than theconfrontations of the cold-war period or conflicts ofinternational character. The reformed United Nationsmust be more concrete and decisive in terms ofemploying the compulsory measures provided for inChapter VII of the United Nations Charter.Georgia fully shares the view that there is a needto improve the United Nations rapid response system.We support the timely creation of a United Nationsrapid deployment force  whose utilization in the earlystage of peacekeeping operations would contribute tothe prevention of many conflicts.I would like in particular to note the work of theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) andother structures under the United Nations umbrella inGeorgia. Their assistance is many-faceted  and thesestructures in particular are making a great contributionto the process of Georgia’s democratic transformation.However  a new agenda for cooperation is alsorequired.I wish to underscore the joint initiative of theUnited Nations and the International Monetary Fundwith regard to creating a programme for the eradicationof poverty. Georgia is one of the most activeparticipants in this programme. An interesting part ofits effort is the elaboration of a programme ofemploying internally displaced persons in smallbusinesses. All of these processes are taking placeunder very difficult conditions and in an environmentof numerous problems.Over the past two years the perspectives of rapiddevelopment in Georgia have been countered by the16absence of progress in the peace process in Abkhazia Georgia. It is time to put an end to the spiritual andphysical suffering of the people of Georgian  Abkhazand other nationalities who have been forced from theirhomes and lands by the tragedy of war. Mostimportantly  we cannot instil hatred and enmity in thecoming generations. The value of peace in the region istoo high to be sacrificed to the political andcommercial ambitions of a single group.The time has come to react duly to the ethniccleansing carried out in Abkhazia  Georgia. Theseparatists  with the help of outside forces  expelledabout 300 000 people from their places of residence.The inalienable right of people to live in theirhomeland is still being flagrantly trampled.On numerous occasions Georgia has expressed itsdeep concern about the presence of uncontrolledregions within the territories of the sovereign State ruled by de facto separatist regimes. Theencouragement of these regimes is totally unacceptableand fraught with dangerous consequences. The tragicdowning of a United Nations helicopter over Abkhazia Georgia  is one such heartbreaking example. I wish totake this opportunity to once again express our deepcondolences to the families of the victims  who paidthe ultimate price for upholding the noble principles ofthe United Nations.I would like to use this important rostrum to bringto the Assembly’s attention the danger of large-scaleprovocation that Georgia is facing today. I am referringto the violation of Georgia’s airspace and the bombingof our territory. Such attacks have taken place before aswell  but  despite our protests  no adequate reactionwas forthcoming. Georgia views these acts as aninfringement of our sovereignty and an attempt bysome forces to subvert the peace process.All of this is taking place at a time when theUnited States  together with the internationalcommunity  is mobilized against the most evil enemyof humankind: international terrorism. Georgia clearlyvisualizes its place in this fight  and PresidentShevardnadze has repeatedly expressed readiness forcooperation. But it is unacceptable that some States usethis noble cause of fighting terrorism as a disguise inorder to reassert influence in the post-Soviet context.The Government of Georgia reiterates itscommitment to the peaceful settlement of the conflictin Abkhazia  Georgia. We believe that the use of forceruns contrary to our political interests  in particular theinterests of our multi-ethnic population  including theAbkhazians. At the same time  it is becomingincreasingly difficult for the Government of Georgia todissuade those people who have lost their faith in apeaceful resolution of the conflict from using othermeans.We are offering a special programme forresolving the conflict in Abkhazia  Georgia  to all ourpolitical partners  the Security Council and theEuropean bodies. This programme has to beimplemented without delay  notwithstanding changes itmay undergo or substantial concessions it may requirefrom the parties involved in order to reach agreementand to put the programme into action.For two years the document on the distribution ofconstitutional competencies between Tbilisi andSukhumi  drafted by the Special Representative of theSecretary-General  has been kept within the confines ofthe Group of Friends of the Secretary-General onGeorgia. This document has to constitute the basis formeaningful negotiations on the scope of autonomy forAbkhazia.The Government of Georgia is ready to grantAbkhazia the widest form of autonomy practisedaround the world today. Considerable internationalsupport is needed to restore confidence between theparties  as indicated in the Declaration of the Yaltameeting that took place with the assistance of brotherlyUkraine.Let me stress again that we attach greatimportance  and we are anxious to begin discussing the economic rehabilitation strategy for the region. Wealso look forward to carrying out projects beneficial toall and to preserving the unique Abkhaz people.We need working relations with Russia that areboth cordial and at the same time equitable. Russia is acountry with which we have cultural and friendly tiesthat are centuries old. We can only value its specialrole as the regional leader  member of the internationalanti-terrorist coalition  permanent member of theSecurity Council and the facilitator of the peaceprocess in Abkhazia  Georgia. We expect that all thiswill be utilized in the best interests of all the people ofGeorgia. The continuation of misunderstanding andconfrontation is unacceptable.17We must exert every effort to put an end to theuse of separatist regimes by certain countries as a wayof exerting pressure on neighbouring nations.We support the dialogue among civilizations as ameans of achieving better understanding between allthe peoples of the world. We would be honoured tohost a forum dedicated to this issue. As a country onthe crossroads between Europe and Asia  Georgia  withits ancient and multifaceted culture  is an appropriateplace for such a meeting.In closing  let me stress again that it is dialogueand cooperation that should determine the fate ofmankind. For that purpose we need a United Nationswith broad  coherent and determined capabilities."
"63",2614,"GHA",56,2001,"﻿Mr. Han’s election to thefifty-sixth session of the General Assembly is a tributeto his vast experience and accomplished diplomaticskills. It is also an honour to his country  the Republicof Korea  with which my country enjoys the mostcordial and friendly relations. I ask him to pleaseaccept our congratulations.May I also express our gratitude and appreciationto his immediate predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri ofFinland  for the able manner in which he guided thework of the fifty-fifth session.I wish to express the heartfelt gratitude of theGovernment and the people of Ghana to the StatesMembers of the United Nations for having placed theirtrust and the destiny of this universal Organizationonce again in the hands of an illustrious son of Ghanaand of Africa  Mr. Kofi Annan  for the next five years.The Nobel Peace Prize  awarded jointly to theSecretary-General and the United Nations  is inrecognition of their devotion to the pursuit of globalpeace and security. On this occasion  I can onlyendorse the sentiments expressed by Mr. Annan thatthe award should serve as an impetus to record greaterachievements in the service of humanity.The last century witnessed laudable achievementsin the political  economic  scientific and technologicalspheres. Despite these positive developments  history in the end  will remember it for the numerous conflictsthat marked it  with their attendant socio-economicdisruptions  environmental degradation  the emergenceof hitherto-unknown diseases and the persistence ofpoverty among the majority of our people.The tragic terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001awakened the world to the new challenges confrontinginternational peace and security. The fight againstterrorism must be a collective action  guided by thepurposes and principles of the United Nations Charterand of international law. Ghana welcomes theinternational community’s response in confronting thisthreat to peace and security. We also applaud the swiftresponse of the Security Council and of the GeneralAssembly  which not only condemned the attacks  butalso took measures aimed at confronting terrorism.Resolution 1373 (2001)  which outlines the measuresthat all countries — irrespective of size  wealth ormight — should adopt to forestall and combat terrorismmust be pursued by all peace-loving nations.As we forge ahead  our quest to free the world ofterrorism will be enhanced if we adequately address24both the symptoms and the underlying causes that giverise to such criminal acts. Developing countries shouldbe provided with the necessary resources to play ameaningful role in confronting these challenges.The recent threats and crimes against humanityhave reinforced our belief in the need for the earlyestablishment of the International Criminal Court  inorder to enable the global community to dealappropriately with such phenomena. We therefore urgeall Member States that have not yet ratified the Statuteto do so to enable it to enter into force.The proliferation of conventional weapons notably small arms and light weapons  has been ofgreat concern to the Government and the people ofGhana. They are now the weapons of choice and thetools for promoting violence and conflicts in Africa.Such weapons have always been used against the mostvulnerable in society  especially women and children.We therefore welcome the Programme of Actionadopted at the recent United Nations Conference on theIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in AllIts Aspects. While it does not respond to all of ourconcerns or meet all of our expectations  we stillconsider it to be the beginning of a process that willlead to an internationally binding instrument onmanaging and controlling such weapons.Conflicts  particularly in the developing world have robbed us of the opportunity to improve thecircumstances of our people. Sustainable developmentcan be achieved only in an environment of peace andsecurity. Ghana will continue to live up to its Charterobligations and to play an active role in internationalpeacekeeping  with a view to assisting the UnitedNations in its task of maintaining global peace andsecurity.Only a year ago  world leaders  at the MillenniumSummit  committed themselves to providing leadershipto create a better world  one which would upholdhuman dignity  equality and equity at the global level through the elimination of poverty and the creation of aconducive environment for development.To achieve this  it is imperative that theinternational community take steps to assist countriesthat have created the necessary environment for soundeconomic development. This will enable them to reachtheir potential for sustained growth through conducivepolicies concerning debt  market access  transfer oftechnology  increased flows of capital and foreigndirect investment  and enhanced official developmentassistance.It is important  particularly at this moment whenthe fourth Ministerial Conference of the World TradeOrganization is taking place in Doha  to emphasize thecritical role of global trade in generating the resourcesfor financing development in developing countries. Theoutcome of the Doha Conference  our commitment topursuing the decisions and processes emanating fromthat Conference  the implementation of thecommitments made in the Uruguay Round and how weaddress intellectual property rights should clearlydetermine our commitment to eradicating povertythroughout the world.We believe that the success of our efforts at theglobal level will depend largely on the quality ofgovernance in our respective countries. We cannotclaim to uphold the dignity of every human being ormake claims to social equity if we fail to upholddemocracy and the rule of law  combat corruption andstrengthen the institutions of governance. It is thereforegratifying to note that in the past few years democracyhas begun to take root in Africa. This trend should beencouraged and consolidated with support from theinternational community.It is for this reason that Ghana fully endorsed theConstitutive Act of the African Union  which  amongother things  rejects unconstitutional changes ofGovernment and reaffirms respect for democraticprinciples  human rights  the rule of law and goodgovernance. The decisions we took in Lusaka duringthe last summit of the Organization of African Unity(OAU) on the African Union and the New Partnershipfor African Development have reasserted Africa’sleadership and responsibility for the continent’sdevelopment agenda. Ghana intends to play its partthrough positive diplomacy and cooperation with otherAfrican countries to accelerate regional integration andmake Africa a zone of economic empowerment.Africa accepts its primary responsibility for itsown development. However  the contribution of itsdevelopment partners will continue to be crucial. Inthis connection  the outcomes of the InternationalConference on Financing for Development  to be heldnext year in Monterrey  Mexico  and of the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development  to be held inJohannesburg  will be critical tests of our willingness25to tackle concretely the challenges we set for ourselvesin the Millennium Declaration.At the onset of the new millennium  we hope thatgender issues will continue to engage the attention ofthe international community. The adoption of theBeijing Declaration and Platform for Action  in 1995 and the subsequent adoption of further actions andinitiatives by the twenty-third special session of theGeneral Assembly  last year  indicate the universalrecognition of the need to empower women as partnersin socio-economic development. As a result of thegreat importance that Ghana attaches to theadvancement of women  our Government has elevatedthe national machinery for the advancement of womeninto a full-fledged ministry headed by a cabinetminister. We are determined  through practicalmeasures  to make our women full and effectivepartners in the development of our country.Ghana welcomes the remarkable success achievedby the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session withthe adoption  after protracted negotiations  of theresolutions on the scale of assessments for the regularand peacekeeping budgets. It is therefore ourconsidered view that both resolutions should ensure thefinancial solvency and viability of the Organization.In conclusion  I wish to reassure the Assembly ofGhana’s abiding commitment to the United Nations andits ideals. The Organization is the best means availablefor maintaining international peace and security andpromoting fruitful international cooperation. We mustall resolve to strengthen our will to make it moreeffective and to redeem the majority of our people fromwars  disease and poverty by providing it with financialand material resources commensurate with itsresponsibilities."
"64",2660,"GIN",56,2001,"﻿Ishould like to associate my country and delegation withthe expressions of sympathy for the great sufferingendured by the city of New York following the crash ofthe American Airlines plane yesterday. To theGovernment of the United States  our host city and allthe bereaved families  I address the condolences of theGovernment and people of Guinea.A year ago in this Hall  the great leaders of theworld  in a unanimous surge  committed themselves tothinking together about the role of this Organization the United Nations  in the twenty-first century  andabout ways of achieving its objectives fully  with aview to constructing together a world of peace progress and solidarity. The historic Declaration whichemerged from the Millennium Summit emphasized theneed to open a new era of international relations.It was when the international community waspreparing to review the implementation of therecommendations and decisions of that Summit thatunprecedented terrorist acts cast a shadow over ourhopes. These acts  to which the United States fellvictim on 11 September 2001  profoundly shocked theconscience of all peoples. The barbarity and violenceof these terrorist attacks  and also the threat ofbioterrorism  are serious attacks on international peaceand security.My delegation would like once again to expressits sympathy to the American people  especially thefamilies of the many victims. The Republic of Guineacondemns those intolerable acts and believes that itshould be the concern of all States to combat anderadicate terrorism. We firmly support any measuresaimed at eliminating the bases of internationalterrorism and fully associate ourselves with theinternational community in its global response to thatscourge.The fifty-sixth session of the General Assemblyis thus taking place within the context of a new andalarming situation for international peace and security.My delegation is therefore very pleased to see you  Sir presiding over the Assembly during this session. Weare convinced that your wealth of experience  as wellas your great diplomatic skill  will ensure the successof our discussions. I would like to assure you of thecooperation and support of the delegation of Guinea.I should also like to thank your predecessor Mr. Harri Holkeri  for the excellent work accomplishedunder his presidency.17My delegation would like once again to conveythe warm congratulations of General Lansana Conté President of the Republic of Guinea  to our brother Kofi Annan  on his well-deserved re-election as thehead of our Organization. The unanimous tribute thathas been paid to him brings honour to the whole of theAfrican continent and bears witness to his greatqualities and his commitment to achieving theobjectives of the United Nations. The Nobel PeacePrize recently awarded jointly to him and to theOrganization is eloquent testimony to that commitmentand an encouragement to continue to act in the serviceof peace and understanding among peoples.The award of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize to theUnited Nations is  without doubt  a recognition of itsrole in the implementation of its objectives — themaintenance of international peace and security development and cooperation among nations.Increasingly  the Organization is proving to be thenecessary crucible for dialogue among States.However  almost all Members earnestly desire thestrengthening and improvement of the entire system.While reaffirming its support for the reformprocess initiated by the Secretary-General  my country the Republic of Guinea  would like to emphasize theneed to strengthen the principal organs of theOrganization. We welcome the actions taken by yourpredecessor  Sir  to streamline the working methods ofthe General Assembly so as to give it fresh dynamism.We hope that that impetus will continue.My delegation would also like to reaffirm itssupport for restructuring the Security Council  in itsmembership as well as its working methods  so as toenable it to better protect the interests of all MemberStates. I should like to take this opportunity to express on behalf of my Government  our gratitude to all Statesfor the unanimous support that enabled Guinea to beelected a non-permanent member of the SecurityCouncil for 2002 and 2003. During its mandate  theRepublic of Guinea will make every effort to contributeactively to the maintenance of peace and security in theworld.Peace and security continue to be threatened inmany parts of the world. In the Middle East intolerance and intransigence have led to a dangerousescalation of violence  which  if not controlled in time could cause the whole region to go up in flames. TheRepublic of Guinea would like to appeal to all theparties to exercise greater restraint so as to facilitate aresumption of the peace process. My country supportsthe full application of the recommendations of theMitchell commission and the implementation ofeffective follow-up mechanisms. Dispatchinginternational observers could contribute to ending theviolence and returning peace to all the peoples there.However  the indifference of the internationalcommunity and its failure to take action could  in thelong term  prove to be prejudicial to security in theMiddle East.My delegation condemns all acts of violence which can lead only to a worsening of the situation. Inthe light of the serious events that have taken place inrecent months  the international community must do allthat it can to lead all parties to accept a ceasefire and toresume the peace process. Arms must give way todialogue  which should lead to a just  equitable andlasting peace. The legitimate rights of the Palestinianpeople should be respected. Likewise  the existenceand security of Israel must be guaranteed.One year ago  my country became the victim ofaggression committed by rebel groups. That barbaricaggression caused great loss of life and materialdamage. My Government would like to express its fullappreciation for the subsequent role played by theUnited Nations in adopting appropriate measures tocreate conditions conducive to the restoration of peaceand stability in the subregion. My delegation wouldalso like to take this opportunity to thank all theindividuals and States that contributed to the adoptionand implementation of those measures. One year later the fact that a dialogue has been initiated by civilsociety in the three countries concerned — SierraLeone  Liberia and Guinea — means that we havereached an important stage in the search for peace.The Republic of Guinea  which has always shownits determination to maintain and strengthen friendship brotherhood and cooperation with all African countriesin general and neighbouring countries in particular would like to reaffirm to the Assembly its readiness tomake the Mano River Union a model of economicintegration  social cohesion and political stability.However  relaunching the activities of the Unionwill depend upon respect for the relevant provisions ofthe Non-aggression and Security Cooperation Treatysigned by the three countries and of the 15th Protocolto the Mano River Declaration  signed at Conakry on 818May 2000. That is what is required for productivedialogue among the three countries.In the framework of the process of re-establishingconfidence and dialogue among the countries membersof the Mano River Union  meetings have been held atthe ministerial level in Monrovia  Freetown andConakry. Those meetings made it possible to discussimportant problems relating to the activities of armedgroups in the subregion  the situation of refugees measures to rebuild confidence  peace and security  andthe need to reactivate the various bodies of the ManoRiver Union.My Government welcomes the encouragingdevelopments in Sierra Leone  particularly theprogramme for disarmament  demobilization andreintegration (DDR). The DDR programme that hasbeen implemented will have to be consolidated if it isto lead to the true demobilization of all theRevolutionary United Front combatants and if themistakes made in Liberia are to be avoided. In Liberia the restoration of peace after 10 years of civil war hasnot  unfortunately  been accompanied by a true DDRprogramme or by post-conflict financial support.I would like to express regret with regard to theinadequate results of the Paris conference convened todeal with the problem of Sierra Leone  and to call onthe international community to provide the necessarymaterial and financial support to guarantee lastingpeace in that country. My delegation bases its appealon the relevant recommendations contained in theBrahimi report  which have been accepted by theprincipal organs of the Organization. The Republic ofGuinea will continue to support the efforts of theUnited Nations and the Economic Community of WestAfrican States in restoring peace  security and nationalreconciliation in Sierra Leone.The question of refugees is still a matter of greatconcern for my Government. The enormous economic social  environmental and security impact of thecontinued presence of hundreds of thousands of SierraLeonean and Liberian refugees continues to impose aheavy burden on the economic and social life of mycountry. The situation of the refugees is a matter ofgreat concern for the international community at a timewhen rebel attacks against my country are beingcarried out  as the countries hosting refugees are themain target of the aggressors. Following thisaggression  the Government took appropriate measures in cooperation with the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees  to relocate refugeesin zones far from the borders in order to ensure theirsecurity.The Secretary-General’s report on strengtheningof the coordination of emergency humanitarianassistance amply describes the context of humanitarianassistance and the difficulties to be overcome particularly in complex emergency situations.We welcome the missions undertaken in thesubregion of West Africa by various United Nationsbodies  as well as the conclusions they reached. Whilethe resolution of most issues identified by thosemissions requires an integrated approach  it isnonetheless true that problems peculiar to certaincountries require particular attention. With respect toGuinea  a victim of the consequences of the conflicts inthe subregion  it would be desirable for theinternational community to provide greater support. Inthat regard  I wish to reiterate the appeal to convene aconference on solidarity with Guinea in order to help itaddress the consequences of the prolonged presence ofrefugees on its territory. I would stress that this appealof the Guinean Government is supported by the UnitedNations inter-agency mission that recently visited ourcountry.Before I conclude on this topic  I wish towelcome the proposal to create a United Nations officefor West Africa  in accordance with therecommendation of the Fall mission report. Thecreation of such a body would demonstrate theOrganization’s clear interest in making the WestAfrican region a zone of peace  security andcooperation. My country will spare no effort incooperating fully with that office.How can we discuss the conflicts in Africawithout highlighting the links between the illegalexploitation of natural resources  the traffic in weaponsand the perpetuation of conflict? The reports of thevarious groups of experts established by the SecurityCouncil are edifying on this subject. In Sierra Leone Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo these links have clearly shown the involvement  inaddition to rebel groups  of certain authorities in thatillegal activity.My Government therefore fully supports theactions of the Security Council to impose sanctionsagainst any Government or group involved in the19pillaging of a country’s natural resources  inaccordance with the relevant provisions of internationallaw. The Republic of Guinea feels that if energeticdeterrent measures are not taken against theperpetrators of such crimes  which are emerging as anew kind of threat to peace  the entire Africancontinent may once again fall victim to conflict.With regard to the Democratic Republic of theCongo  my country calls for scrupulous respect for theLusaka Agreement and for all pertinent SecurityCouncil resolutions  and in particular for thewithdrawal of foreign troops  safeguarding the integrityof Congolese territory and the pursuit of the inter-Congolese dialogue.In the Western Sahara  my country welcomes theefforts of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General.We are following with great interest the new initiativesunder way to find an acceptable solution to the crisis.The phenomenon of globalization  characteristicof international life today  calls for greater attentionfrom our States. My delegation is aware of thenecessary interdependence of nations and wishes onceagain to stress that there can be no shared destinywithout a minimum of justice and solidarity ininternational relations. We must work together to makeinternational economic relations more human and toeradicate poverty.There is no need here to point out that poverty destitution and illiteracy  which are unfortunately thelot of a large majority of nations  provide fertile groundfor the propagation of the extremism and fanaticismthat  regrettably  underlie terrorist tendenciesthroughout the world. The eradication of povertyshould be the objective of all countries in strengtheningthe bases of lasting peace and security in the world.Allow me to reiterate the appeal to the richcountries to listen more closely to the poorer nationsand to support them in their development efforts. Inthis respect  I renew the appeal for the adoption of abetter approach to the question of the debt of Africancountries  for appropriate payment for raw materialsand for an increase in official development assistance.On another level  the Marrakesh Agreementestablishing the World Trade Organization (WTO)sought to institute an equitable multilateral tradesystem with special reference to the particular situationof the least developed countries. It is regrettable to notetoday  however  that the least developed countries arebeing increasingly marginalized in the globalizationprocess and that their share of the world trade market isonly 0.4 per cent.The Republic of Guinea hopes that this trend willbe reversed and that decisions to that end will be takenat the fourth WTO Ministerial Conference in Doha.These decisions will have to address  inter alia  theissue of the implementation of WTO accords  theconsolidation of special and differentiated treatment setforth in the various WTO agreements  consolidatedmarket access for the products of the least developedcountries to the markets of the developed countries and access to essential drugs for the poorestpopulations of the world that are particularlyvulnerable to HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis. Ialso welcome the People’s Republic of China’saccession to full membership of the WTO and reiteratethe support of the Guinean Government for the positionpositing a single China.In addition  we would like to see the InternationalConference on Financing for Development  to be heldin March in Mexico  become an opportunity for allparties to agree on solutions promoting sustainabledevelopment for all members of the internationalcommunity  in particular the developing countries andespecially those on the African continent.In stressing the interdependence ofenvironmental  economic and social factors  mydelegation feels that the forthcoming World Summit onSustainable Development  to be held in South Africa should encourage the financing of projects. Mydelegation urges greater involvement by theinternational financial institutions in the search forways to promote international cooperation fordevelopment. In the framework of operational activitiesfor development  the funds and programmes of theUnited Nations must more than ever harmonize andstress their interaction on the African continent so as toallow it to rise above conflict and underdevelopment.I also take this opportunity to appeal to theinternational community to give special attention to theNew African Initiative  adopted at the recent Assemblyof Heads of State and Government of the Organizationof African Unity  held in Lusaka in July  in order tohelp Africa to participate actively in the worldeconomy and international political life and thus to20escape exclusion from a planet undergoing full-scaleglobalization.The United Nations was born last century. Itcontinues to exist in this new century. This is a sourceof satisfaction to humanity. It is therefore essential thatwe return to the ideals on which the Organization wasfounded and that we give it the means to achieve aworld of peace  progress  solidarity and concord. Theachievement of such a world is possible if we want it.Let us work together to make the noble idealscontained in the Millennium Declaration a reality sothat we may lay the foundations of a planetary villagefree of threats to the survival of mankind  such as thescourge of war  poverty  injustice and intolerance. I cansolemnly assure the Assembly that my country willcooperate to achieve that end."
"65",2699,"GMB",56,2001,"﻿On behalf of mydelegation  I should like to present our heartfeltcondolences to the grieving families following thetragic plane accident yesterday.Let me at the outset congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his unanimous election to preside over the fifty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly.With his wealth of experience and wisdom we have nodoubt that our deliberations will always be crownedwith success. He may rest assured that in carrying outthe important mandate entrusted to him  he will notfind the cooperation of the Gambian delegationwanting. On behalf of my delegation I should also liketo pay a special tribute to his predecessor for a job welldone.As for our indefatigable Secretary-General  I addmy voice to those of previous speakers incongratulating him  and the United Nations  onwinning the Nobel Peace Prize. In addition to that  mydelegation commends him for his effective andinspiring leadership  in turning the United Nationsaround in such a way that much of the hope that waslost has since been restored. Mr. Secretary-General you deserve our respect and admiration.The circumstances in which we are meeting thistime are far different from previous sessions forreasons well known to all of us. The terrorist attacks onNew York  Washington  D.C.  and Pennsylvania on 11September took the whole world by surprise because oftheir cataclysmic proportions. Nothing can ever justifysuch barbaric acts. Unfortunately  like so manycountries present here today  we too were bereavedfollowing the attack on the World Trade Center. Ishould like at this juncture to express profoundgratitude to President George W. Bush for his kindremarks. The Government and people of the Gambia as well as the families concerned  are deeply moved bythe President’s thoughtfulness. All of this shows thatterrorism has no boundaries and  worse still  it has norespect for the sanctity of life. It is incumbent upon allof us therefore not to offer sanctuary to any terroristsor their sponsors.In the Gambia  His Excellency the PresidentAlhaji Dr. Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh  declared three daysof national mourning and requested all mosques andchurches to pray for the deceased in solidarity with thefriendly people of the United States and theirGovernment. While we continue to pray and mourn individually and collectively  we in the Gambiasubscribe unreservedly to Security Council resolutions1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001)  of 12 and 28 September2001  respectively. Similarly  we welcome the adoptionof the Dakar Declaration on terrorism by theConference of African Heads of State and Government held in Dakar  Senegal  on 17 October 2001.Having said that  I would  however  hasten topoint out that it is one thing to adopt resolutions anddeclarations but it is quite another to implement themfully. It goes without saying that the fight againstinternational terrorism is neither easy nor the businessof a select group of countries alone. Certainly not. Thisinternational scourge can only be dealt with effectivelythrough concerted international effort. However  it willserve no useful purpose to request Member States toreport on measures taken in the fight against terrorismwhen the requisite means to do so are not available.This will be a long and difficult engagement  but at thesame time it is not an impossible task. In the process no country should be excluded. Consequently  as a firststep  the Security Council should inquire of MemberStates what they need  at the national level  to equipthem in the fight against terrorism  especially in termsof training and logistics. In our view  that is the priority14of priorities  because no category of countries can beconsidered safe unless and until all categories ofcountries are seen to be safe.Let me mention en passant one very importantpoint. The Gambia  where I come from  ispredominantly Muslim  but we do not at all subscribeto the misleading concept that the struggle againstterrorism is one between Islam and Christianity. Forthat reason we in the Gambia are committed to signingand ratifying all the relevant United Nationsconventions against terrorism.Allow me now to dwell a little on some domesticissues. As was widely reported all over the world  thepresidential elections that were held in the Gambia on18 October 2001 received the unanimous endorsementof the entire international community as free  fair andtransparent. All international observers present in thecountry expressed the same views. The 1996 electionswere also free  fair and transparent  but we were givena mere pass. In the 2001 elections we passed withflying colours. As of right  therefore  we expect ourprincipal partners in development  who were stillsceptical in 1996  now to show the way forward byembracing the Government and people of the Gambiain a new spirit of solidarity geared towards a fresh andreinvigorated partnership. We have kept our part of thebargain as a nation. We have delivered what wasexpected of us — in fact  we did more and better thanexpected. What happened immediately after theelection results were announced is ampledemonstration of political maturity. Let me give agraphic illustration of what I am talking about byborrowing a paragraph or two from His ExcellencyPresident Jammeh’s victory statement.“Fellow Gambians  [...] I would want toenjoin you all after the celebrations to put thecampaign and all the euphoria and the differencesand misunderstandings of politics behind us andcome together as one people to work with myGovernment  supporters and non-supporters alike to further develop this country.”President Jammeh then went on to thank the principalleaders of the opposition for their courage and maturitydisplayed in extending their congratulations to him in atelephone conversation. The President then said:“The gesture was indeed most welcome and Iwould want to restate my expectation that withthe elections now behind us  we would put ourdifferences of political ideology aside and worktogether as members of the same family to pursuethe development agenda we in this country haveset for ourselves  in the best interest of ourbeloved people.”That indeed was the icing on the cake. It can nowbe proclaimed without any fear of contradiction thatthe Gambia  despite all the odds  is consolidating itsposition among the leading democracies in Africa  andindeed in the whole world.Elsewhere on the African continent  while wecannot claim that the same pattern of free and fairelections and the rule of law prevail  we can note withsatisfaction that the signs are encouraging  although alot more remains to be done. In neighbouring SierraLeone we commend the United Nations Mission inSierra Leone (UNAMSIL) for what has been achievedso far. As elections are fast approaching it becomeseven more urgent to accelerate the process ofdisarmament  demobilization and reintegration.The importance of a regional approach to conflictresolution cannot be overemphasized. We will have tosound our own trumpet by commending the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) for thepreponderant role that it has played in the quest for alasting solution to the problems in the Mano Riverarea. With regard to another neighbouring country Guinea-Bissau  the Gambia  in its capacity ascoordinator of the Group of Friends of Guinea-Bissau would like to launch an appeal to the donor communityto cooperate closely with the Group with a view toconvening the long overdue round-table donors’conference. As stated in the Fall report following amission to West Africa some time ago  certaincountries in transition  such as Guinea-Bissau  needspecial and urgent attention. I am referring to theimportant report by Assistant Secretary-GeneralIbrahima Fall. We are not done with that report yet  forit raises such serious issues as the regional approach toconflict resolution.We are also following very closely the situationin the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It isgratifying to note that the Security Council adoptedresolution 1376 (2001) by which it gave the green lightfor the launching of phase III of the deployment of theUnited Nations Organization Mission in the15Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC). Mydelegation also encourages the parties concerned topursue the inter-Congolese dialogue with renewedvigour and to cooperate with the Facilitator. We aresaddened  however  by the illegal exploitation ofnatural resources and other forms of wealth in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. There is obviouslya direct link between such practices and theprolongation of the conflict. Still  in the Great Lakesregion  we pay a special tribute to former PresidentMandela for his laudable efforts to bring peace toBurundi. Concerning the situation in Angola  mydelegation continues to believe that UNITA’s ability towage war must be further reduced through tightersanctions. In this context we note with satisfaction theextension of the mandate of the MonitoringMechanism.Turning to other parts of the continent  mydelegation welcomes the decision of the SecurityCouncil to terminate the sanctions that were imposedon the Sudan. We are also calling on the Council tomake a bold move and lift the sanctions imposed onLibya. The international community demanded that theLibyan authorities hand over the Lockerbie suspects fortrial in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Theinternational community must now honour itsobligations and stop moving the goal-posts.Outside Africa we also continue to expressconcern about a number of conflict situations.Seemingly  the most intractable of the lot is thesituation in the Middle East  and  notably  thePalestinian problem. There can be no lasting peace inthe Middle East without resolving the Palestinianquestion. We in the Gambia have always held the viewthat  while recognizing the right of Israel to existwithin secure borders  we also believe that the relevantUnited Nations resolutions on the Arab-Israeli conflictshould be implemented  culminating in the creation ofan independent Palestinian state.In the situation between Kuwait and Iraq  we inthe Gambia have always maintained that theinternational community should  as a matter ofurgency  find ways of alleviating the suffering of theIraqi people. But at the same time  the Iraqi leadershipmust be accountable for the Kuwaiti prisoners of warand missing persons. The families of the prisoners ofwar and missing persons have also been suffering fortoo long and  therefore  we call upon the IraqiGovernment to respect and comply with the relevantSecurity Council resolutions in order to achieve peaceand stability in the Gulf region.It is an irony that long after the end of the coldwar  the situation in the Korean peninsula remainsbasically the same. We in the Gambia were  however very much encouraged by the visit to North Korea ofPresident Kim Dae Jung of South Korea in June lastyear. It is only through dialogue and the exchange ofsuch high-level visits that the peaceful unification ofthe Korean peninsula will be achieved.Similarly  it is our fervent hope that one day theRepublic of China on Taiwan and the People’sRepublic of China will unite but  as the saying goes  letus put first things first. As clearly stated by mydelegation during the meeting of the GeneralCommittee  the Government of the Gambia would liketo reiterate that the exceptional situation of theRepublic of China on Taiwan needs to be reconsideredby this body. Only a few days ago  the Republic ofChina on Taiwan was admitted to the World TradeOrganization (WTO). That is no mean achievementand  therefore  my delegation would like to take thisopportunity to congratulate the Government and the 23million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan. Wein the Gambia have no doubt that they will makeconstructive contributions to the work of the WTO. Itwill be recalled that the Republic of China on Taiwanis now the world’s seventeenth largest economy interms of gross national product (GNP) and the fifteenthmost important trading nation. Considering that theRepublic of China on Taiwan possesses the world’sthird largest foreign reserves  in addition to its strategicposition as the sixteenth largest foreign direct investor it does not make much sense to continue to exclude itfrom the United Nations. Politics aside  the Republic ofChina on Taiwan has a lot to offer the internationalcommunity. For instance  in the crucial area ofinformation and communication technologies (ICT) the real revolution of our times  the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan is in the vanguard. We all know that theissue of ICT is among the top priorities of the UnitedNations and we therefore look forward to the specialevent on Tuesday  20 November  when the Secretary-General will launch the United Nations Informationand Communication Technologies (ICT) Task Force.How will we be able to benefit from the expertise ofthe Republic of China on Taiwan when it is excludedfrom the work of the United Nations?16The Republic of China on Taiwan is active inother important areas as well  especially developmentcooperation  by providing experts and throughinternational financial institutions  and  likewise  in thehumanitarian field by providing disaster relief tocountries in need. The case of the Republic of China onTaiwan is unique. It is exceptional and should betreated as such  quite apart from observing theprinciple of universality.Another country which has much to offer theinternational community is Cuba  ranging frommedicine to sports. After more than three decades  thesanctions imposed on Cuba should now be lifted. Thesesanctions can no longer be justified; in fact  they arecounterproductive.Prior to the tragic events of 11 September  we hadalready identified a number of areas for increasedinternational cooperation within the framework of theMillennium Declaration. Foremost among these is theeradication of poverty. It is made a priority of prioritiesin the Millennium Declaration  if not the priority. In theWorld Development Report 2000-2001 entitled“Attacking poverty”  the President of the World Bankin his foreword stated that “Poverty amid plenty is theworld’s greatest challenge.” We are also of the viewthat poverty constitutes a serious threat to internationalpeace and security  knowing that 1.2 billion people liveon less than $1 a day. That is why our leadersundertook to cut by half the proportion of people livingin extreme poverty by the year 2015. Of the 1.2 billionwho live on less than $1 a day  300 million are inAfrica. Under these circumstances the New AfricanInitiative is indeed a timely response. We only hopethat unlike previous blueprints for Africa’s socio-economic development  the New Initiative will not beleft to gather dust. It would appear for the first time that we  the Africans  are in the driver’s seat. That is aclear demonstration of ownership and commitment.Our principal partners in development should alsocomplement our efforts by providing the necessaryresources as a matter of urgency. The EconomicCommission for Africa should work closely with thevarious regional economic groupings to ensure properand effective coordination. We are confident that themomentum generated by the adoption of the NewAfrican Initiative will be intensified with theconvening of the International Conference onFinancing for Development at the summit level inMonterrey  Mexico  next year. That Conference willprovide a unique opportunity for the internationalcommunity to translate into reality the global solidarityspelled out in the Millennium Declaration  especially insuch vital areas as official development assistance(ODA)  foreign direct investment (FDI) and debtreduction  or outright cancellation in some cases  andmarket access — to mention only a few.Similarly  the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment (Rio+10)  to be held in South Africa nextyear  will also provide a golden opportunity forstocktaking  notably for a comprehensive review of theimplementation of Agenda 21.All efforts geared towards the eradication ofpoverty would be incomplete without addressing theissue of food security. My delegation therefore looksforward to the convening of the World Food Summit inJune next year. A related issue is health. We in WestAfrica  particularly we in the Gambia  would like toeradicate malaria as a matter of urgency and  as a firststep  our leaders have adopted the Rollback MalariaProgramme. We will need the support and solidarity ofthe entire international community in this endeavour especially within the context of the Global Alliance forVaccines and Immunization.With special reference to the least developedcountries  it will be recalled that the Third UnitedNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries held recently  adopted yet another Programme ofAction for the decade 2001-2010 aimed essentially atthe eradication of poverty. We hope that the rest of thedonor community will support that Programme fully bymaking available the resources necessary for itsimplementation. In any poverty eradicationprogramme  the most vulnerable groups  that is  womenand children  should be given special attention. That iswhy the Government of the Gambia remains committedto the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action including the further actions and initiatives thatemanated from the Beijing+5 Conference held lastJune. The same applies to the Nairobi forward-lookingstrategies for the advancement of women and all otherinitiatives that promote the advancement of women andthe girl child. In fact  His Excellency President YahyaJammeh has now decided that all girls in the Gambiafrom grades 1 to 12  in virtually all parts of thecountry  will no longer pay school fees.Finally  experience has shown that our collectivesecurity can only be guaranteed if and when all17members of the comity of nations are equallyguaranteed freedom from want and freedom from fear.That can be achieved only through genuineinternational solidarity. The tendency to look the otherway when another needs a helping hand should be athing of the past. Each time in our history when we arefaced with major difficulties  we suddenly realize howmuch we need one another. We close our ranks andtake up the challenges together. We are again at acrossroads. That is why we are all here to renew faithin multilateralism. There is no alternative to the UnitedNations. We are now strengthened in our convictionthat our Organization is nowhere near being a “sunset”Organization. It is a “sunrise” Organization. But itshould shine even brighter once the Security Council isreformed to reflect the realities of the twenty-firstcentury. Unless that is done  the Security Council runsthe serious risk of becoming irrelevant because it isanchored in the past. We do not want that to happen. Itis too vital an organ to be sidelined  but it must adaptand adjust. It is time to move on. Let us be forward-looking. Whatever the outcome may be  Africa must beadequately represented."
"66",2739,"GNB",56,2001,"﻿Allow me  on behalf of the Government of Guinea-Bissau and its delegation  to express sincerecondolences to the people and Government of theUnited States and to the people and Government of theDominican Republic for the tragic event of 12November in New York   resulting in great loss of life.Allow me to congratulate you  Mr. President  onyour election to the presidency of the fifty-sixthsession of the General Assembly  which will certainlybe crowned with success thanks to your experienceddiplomatic skills and deep understanding of thisuniversal Organization.The delegation of Guinea-Bissau  which I havethe honour of heading  would like to assure you at thistime of its full cooperation in carrying out your noblemandate. I also extend my warm congratulations toyour predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland  on theconstructive way in which he led the work of the lastsession.In addition  I would like to reaffirm myGovernment’s confidence in and regard for theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his clearleadership of the United Nations and his incessantsearch for peaceful and realistic solutions to thevarious conflicts and problems that affect humanity.The Nobel Peace Prize  awarded in October toour Secretary-General and to the United Nations  whichhe so ably leads  proves not only his commitment to theattainment of peace and security  but also his importantrole of working in the interests of humanity. For thisreason  I extend to him my most sincerecongratulations and wishes for success in the secondterm of office to which he was elected  and encouragehim to continue his efforts to reform and adapt theOrganization to the needs of our time  in the service ofpeace  progress and international cooperation.In this vein  I urge the widening and deepening ofthe reforms already undertaken and appeal once againfor a reform of the Security Council to increase thenumber of both permanent and non-permanentmembers and to bring the right of veto into line withthe needs of today.This first General Assembly session of thetwenty-first century represents  as was stated in theMillennium Declaration  a historic challenge for thebuilding of new international relations. At theMillennium Summit  our dignitaries worked hard toenvision the role that the Organization must play in thetwenty-first century. They solemnly reaffirmed theircommitment to the noble ideals of the United Nations as well as their conviction that the role of the UnitedNations is indispensable in the service of peace progress and international cooperation  and in supportof the primacy of law. During that event  our heads ofState and Government also discussed new perspectivesfrom which to confront the great challenges ofglobalization for the promotion of a new internationalhuman order.In this context  the year 2001 was marked byimportant international conferences: the recent WorldConference against Racism  Racial Discrimination Xenophobia and Related Intolerance  which took placein Durban  and whose final Declaration not onlydefines slavery as a “crime against humanity” but alsolaunches an appeal for appropriate and efficientmeasures to reverse the consequences of slavery. It alsorecognizes that those “historical injustices” contributeto poverty  underdevelopment  marginalization  socialexclusion  economic disparities and the insecurity ofmany peoples  especially in developing countries.9Despite those prospects for a new historicalperspective  this session takes place at a moment ofdeep disquiet for our countries and peoples. In fact  thewave of attacks perpetrated on 11 September this yearagainst the Pentagon in Washington and the WorldTrade Center in New York  just a few kilometres fromthe Assembly  is reason for great concern for myGovernment and the President of the Republic Mr. Kumba Yalá  who promptly and stronglycondemned the cowardly terrorist acts perpetratedagainst the United States of America. Today I reaffirmbefore the Assembly our unreserved condemnation ofterrorism in all its forms  wherever or whenever itoccurs and whatever its origins  since it constitutes athreat to security  peaceful relations between States democratic institutions and the fulfilment of humanrights.Today more than ever before  it is necessary toadopt a broad strategy for the entire internationalcommunity to combat terrorism. In that context Guinea-Bissau appeals for greater internationalcooperation on the issue of terrorism  specifically through the ratification of already existing regional andinternational instruments and the approval  within thecontext of the United Nations  of a comprehensiveconvention that covers all aspects of terrorism  from auniversally accepted definition to its suppression.It is in precisely this regard that my country Guinea-Bissau  became a party to the Organization ofAfrican Unity Convention on the Prevention andCombating of Terrorism  adopted in 1999 at Algiers and to the Dakar Declaration on this same scourge issued last October. We are determined to acceleratethe ratification and implementation processes of all theagreements that seek to fight terrorism.The beginning of the twenty-first century  whichcoincides with the threshold of the new millennium  ismarked by areas of tension and armed conflict thatthreaten peace and security and fuel the proliferation ofand illicit traffic in small arms. In this context  thesubregional and regional organizations  with thesupport of the international community  through theUnited Nations  are fully engaged in the search forpolitical solutions to conflicts. From Sierra Leone toAngola  from the Democratic Republic of the Congo toBurundi  from Somalia to Kosovo  from East Timor tothe Middle East  the ghosts of conflict still hover as weseek to find solutions to existing conflicts.At present in Sierra Leone  a country of oursubregion  the Lomé Agreement  concluded under theauspices of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS)  and the subsequent success of theUnited Nations-supported programme for disarming theparties involved in the conflict  allow us to hope for alegitimate peace.In Angola  a member of the Community ofPortuguese-speaking Countries  cruel and destabilizingacts continue to take place  causing enormous pain toour Angolan brothers  who have endured the nightmareof four decades of war. I would like to express oursolidarity with the Angolan people and Government and appeal for dialogue as part of the solution to thatconflict.In East Timor  with the elections for theConstituent Assembly already held  an important stepwas taken in the transition to the independence thatwill be proclaimed in May next year  and towards itsacceptance as a fully fledged member of global society.We hope that the international community willcontinue to offer its valuable assistance to our Mauberebrothers  who can finally aspire to rebuild their countryin peace.In the Middle East  the conflict between Israeland Palestine is at the crux of the situation. It is in thatcontext that we appeal to the parties  in accordancewith the Mitchell plan  to implement the accordswithout delay and reaffirm the fundamental principlesestablished at Madrid and Oslo  as well as thesubsequent agreements. This requires the parties toabstain from all actions that endanger the peace processand all activity that is contrary to international law.Finally  the embargoes imposed upon certaincountries  such as Cuba  continue to be a source ofconcern because of their very negative repercussionson the vulnerable populations of those countries  aboveall women and children. The populations involvedappeal for dialogue with a view to a definitive solutionto those issues.The sombre scene characterized by areas ofconflict and tension in the world  particularly in Africa places on us a moral obligation to continue to act witheven greater determination and courage to end thoseconflicts and the sources of those tensions. Along theselines  allow me to congratulate the Secretary-General Kofi Annan  on his last report on the causes of conflictand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable10development in Africa  a document of great interest forthe African continent.The global economic situation — particularlyafter the events of 11 September — and its negativeimpact  felt especially in the least developed countries is also an issue of concern for my Government. Thesolutions to the specific problems on the internationalagenda require not only concerted action  but also bothbilateral and multilateral contacts  which Guinea-Bissau has always supported. My Government believesin concerted and combined efforts with a view tofostering economic growth and full employment in afairer global economy. Bearing in mind that a majorityof African countries have agriculture as their economicbase  we appeal to our development partners  such asthe European Union  the United States and Japan among others  to open their markets to the flow ofagricultural products from our countries.By virtue of its important mission to generate anauthentic North-South dialogue  the United Nations isour universal conscience  whose highest priority is tomeet the needs of developing countries. Theprogrammes of action originating from the series ofmajor conferences of the last decade and from otherimportant meetings which took place this year are ofspecial importance in that they contribute to identifyingneeds  formulating objectives and defining strategiesfor the realization of sustainable development rooted insustainable economic growth  social justice and theprotection of the environment. We are now waiting forthose results to be translated into concrete benefits thus opening the way for a better global economicsituation.As all Members know  Guinea-Bissau continuesto live with the effects of the absurd and disastrousarmed conflict of 1998 and 1999  which  apart from theirreparable loss of human lives  caused deep trauma toour entire society and destroyed or damaged thecountry’s existing basic infrastructure. In addition  themarked decline in foreign aid and the slump in exportprices of cashew nuts  our main export commodity constitute the basic reason for our lack of resources andfor the increase in poverty. This runs counter to theinterests of our citizens and makes them morevulnerable.However  an unshakeable will to rebuild thecountry has led my Government  together with somedevelopment partners  to redouble its efforts to define astrategy for sustainable development and to takemeasures in the realm of human rights andreconciliation. The programme for the reconstructionand rehabilitation of infrastructure and for nationalreconciliation  the multi-year convergence programmesfor stability  growth and solidarity elaborated in theframework of the West African Economic andMonetary Union  the programmes of demobilization reintegration and social reinsertion of combatants  thefight against poverty  the fight against AIDS and otherprogrammes are clear examples of the will andcommitment of the Government to create a new realityfor society and a new action programme intended toeffect change in that society. The President of theRepublic  Mr. Kumba Yalá  is the main mentor andguarantor of those programmes by virtue of the sacredresponsibility given to him  the highest rankingofficial  by the voters of Guinea-Bissau.The programme of action requires not onlyinternal but also external efforts. That is why theGovernment is strengthening its cooperation with othercountries at the subregional  regional and internationallevels. Despite all its efforts  Guinea-Bissau continuesto need the valuable assistance of its developmentpartners and of the international community to face thedifficult economic and social challenges that lie ahead.In that regard  we appeal to the internationalcommunity to bolster its support for Guinea-Bissau andto make donors aware of the importance ofparticipating actively in next year’s round table onassistance to my country.The celebration this year of the United NationsYear of Dialogue among Civilizations and of theInternational Year of Mobilization against Racism Racial Discrimination  Xenophobia and RelatedIntolerance  which coincides with the fifty-thirdanniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights  is a cause for satisfaction for my Government.This is reflected in the creation of a inter-ministerialcommittee on human rights tasked with overseeingrespect for human rights in our country and promotingeducation and awareness programmes on human rightsissues.Since his landslide election to the presidency ofthe nation  the President of the Republic  Mr. KumbaYalá  has increased his contacts at various levels  withfriendship visits to Guinea  the Gambia  Senegal Nigeria  Morocco  Sierra Leone and other countrieswith the aim of strengthening cooperation and11contributing to peaceful solutions within thesubregional framework.It is in that same spirit that the authorities of mycountry have maintained vigilance in the area of theborder with Senegal  with the objective of guaranteeingthe security and tranquillity of our populations in thatnorthern zone.In this first year of the new millennium and of thetwenty-first century  despite certain echoes ofoptimism  poverty and underdevelopment unfortunatelypersist and have been aggravated in many areas of theworld  particularly in the least developed countries among which is Guinea-Bissau. The developingcountries  in particular the least developed amongthem  continue to be marginalized in the worldeconomy and to be victims of extreme poverty  duemainly to decreased official development assistance  tothe lack of productive human resources  to theweakness of domestic and foreign investments  to theslump in commodity prices  to the problems of debt  toHIV/AIDS and also  obviously  to armed conflicts.To overcome this situation it is imperative toensure the integration of developing countries into theworld economy and to oppose the marginalization ofthose countries  ensuring sustainable  accelerated anddurable economic development as well as theelimination of poverty  inequality and misery. In thatcontext  we are pleased at the results of the ThirdUnited Nations Conference on the Least DevelopedCountries  which took place in May this year atBrussels. We are certain that the results of theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment  to take place at Monterrey  Mexico  inMarch 2002  will be translated into concrete action thatcan reverse those negative trends.Cooperation frameworks include the LoméConvention of the European Union and the African Caribbean and Pacific countries; the TokyoInternational Conference on African Development; theUnited States African Growth and Opportunity Act;and the Genoa decision of the Group of 8 on thecreation of a fund for the fight against contagiousdiseases and AIDS on the African continent. We lookforward to the latter group’s next summit on Africanproblems.Because of the particularly difficult economicsituation it faces  Africa continues to look for realisticsolutions for the continent and is giving clear proof ofits determination to improve the economies of thecountries of the continent. Beyond the programmes ofstructural adjustment and other developmentprogrammes that have been adopted for the continent the New African Initiative  resulting from the mergerof the plans presented by the heads of State of Senegaland of South Africa  has come at an opportune time. Itis an African plan for Africans that provides developedcountries a historic opportunity to forge a genuinepartnership based on mutually beneficial self-interest.The Initiative  adopted unanimously at the most recentsummit of the Organization of African Unity  held atLusaka  should be implemented with the utmost speed.We appeal to the entire international community  and toour development partners in particular  to support theInitiative  which encompasses the relaunching of oureconomies  debt reduction and the fight against AIDS.It is regrettable that the response of ourdevelopment partners has not always beencommensurate with the degree of sacrifice that hasbeen endured or with the dimensions of the problemsthat have been identified. That is a paradox. It is also aparadox that the decisions of major internationalconferences should not be reflected in practical concrete measures to implement those decisions.The new collective challenge is to bring to lightthe image of a world of equality  dignity  equity andinternational solidarity  all translated into economicand social cooperation and genuine social adjustmentwith the human being as its central point of reference."
"67",2778,"GNQ",56,2001,"﻿Allow me at the outset to express our deepsatisfaction at seeing Mr. Han Seung-soo presidingover the work of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixthsession. For my delegation  the peaceable nature andspirit of dialogue that identify and distinguish hiscountry  the Republic of Korea  together with hisoutstanding qualities as a diplomat and tirelessnegotiator — all of which he has demonstrated sincethe beginning of this session — are guarantees for thesuccess of our work. He can rely on the support andcooperation of Equatorial Guinea.To the Secretary-General  His ExcellencyMr. Kofi Annan  we wish to express our sincerecongratulations on his re-election for a second term tolead the United Nations and the distinction conferredon him and the United Nations as recipients of theNobel Peace Prize. We also commend the clear-sightedness and resolve that he has shown in exercisinghis responsibilities to revitalize this Organization andconfirm its role at a time in which peace  security stability  development and understanding areincreasingly precarious. We wish the Secretary-Generalevery success in his endeavours to carry out thepurposes enshrined in the Charter. To this end  he mayrely on our full trust and support.I would not wish to proceed any further with mystatement without first expressing our most sincere andprofound condolences to the Government and fraternalpeople of the Dominican Republic and to all thefamilies that have been affected by the tragic andappalling plane crash that occurred on 12 November2001. May God receive all the victims into hiskingdom.This regular session of the General Assembly hasbeen one of mourning  because it is taking place at atime when the international community  withoutexception  feels that it is being dragged back towards apast that it thought had receded into oblivion. Now more than ever  since 11 September 2001  the need forsecurity  stability  justice  equity and balance hasbecome a vital imperative and the highest of priorities.The General Assembly is faced with a dilemma:to evaluate the level of implementation of thecommitments undertaken in the framework of theDeclaration of the Millennium Summit and at thespecial sessions of the General Assembly  before andafter the Summit  and other international conferences with a view to adopting the new strategies required  inthe light of the failures that have been registered invarious fields of activity  while at the same time  tuningup and activating all the mechanisms required for thestruggle against and eradication of terrorism  since thisis a common enemy  with no identifiable face orlocation.Peoples and their Governments constantly facethe arduous  complex and inescapable obligation andduty to adapt to new realities and demands that loomahead in the immediate or remote future. For thisreason  Equatorial Guinea concurs with and maintainsthe opinion that this task cannot and should not rest onthe shoulders of one people or one Government or anyindividual country in an isolated fashion. It should beborne within a collective body such as the UnitedNations.We believe and maintain that the United Nationscontinues to be the best option and best centre forindispensable agreements  with all the wealth that itsdiversity brings  for the purposes of conflictprevention  crisis management  rapprochement amongpeoples and enhancement of cooperation among Stateson the bilateral  subregional  regional andintercontinental levels. For this reason  theOrganization must be endowed with the means itrequires to organize international society  working tocombat intolerance  persistent tension and conflict andthe worsening economic situation of poor countries.In this regard  in the light of recent positiveexperiences  we advocate greater  closer and moreeffective cooperation between the United Nations andregional integration groupings  in general  and with theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and theEconomic Community of Central African States(ECCAS)  in particular.Together with the need to give the United Nationsthe means to enhance its capacity  we believe that thetime is likewise ripe for both States and internationalorganizations  including the financial agencies  to take29specific and positive steps  without delay  aimed atdemocratizing international relations  promoting andreaffirming respect for human rights and consolidatingthe disarmament regime and directing the investmentof military expenditures to international action topromote development. Equatorial Guinea is continuingto work towards these objectives through aninstitutionalized national dialogue involving thepolitical forces of the country.Equatorial Guinea shares in and insists on thevital need to democratize the Security Council  settingup the greatest possible interlocking and coordinationbetween the work and tasks of that body and theresponsibilities of the General Assembly.In spite of the success that has been achieved insome countries and regions in the area of peacekeepingand peace-building  it is still disquieting to note thatthese successes have served as culture media that haveencouraged areas of tension to persist indefinitely orallowed other threats to peace to erupt. In fact  as theUnited Nations is redoubling and improving the effortsof peacekeeping and peace-building missions  theSecretary-General has noted in his report on the workof the Organization: “Global military expenditureshave continued to rise … Although officialdevelopment assistance levels have continued to fall …military budgets have risen persistently.” (A/56/1 para. 76)The same concern about the absence of peaceapplies to the sorry and disheartening aspect ofcooperation to eradicate poverty. For the UnitedNations and its Development Group and certain non-governmental organizations are striving to translateinto reality the decision taken at the MillenniumSummit to combat poverty and make globalization aninclusive and not exclusive phenomenon.Equatorial Guinea associates itself with theprinciple of shared responsibility  taking the standpointthat the problems that continue to face the leastdeveloped countries are indeed the cause of the lack ofprogress achieved in working towards internationalobjectives of human and social development. We hopeand trust that the Brussels Declaration and Programmeof Action for the Least Developed Countries for theDecade 2001-2010 and the outcome of theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment  scheduled to be held in Monterrey Mexico in May 2002  and other pertinent instrumentswill lay the best possible bases for effectivecooperation for development.As I noted earlier  Equatorial Guinea expresses itssatisfaction at the reduction of tensions in somecountries and regions. At the same time  it calls on andencourages the parties involved in areas whereconflicts and disputes are born and persist to redoubletheir efforts and to use their capabilities and potentialto seek peaceful solutions through peacefulnegotiations.In this context  Equatorial Guinea reaffirms thatthe People’s Republic of China is the sole State entitythat is representative of the Chinese people.We also welcome the recent initiative to resumethe North-South dialogue for the peaceful reunificationof the Korean peninsula  and we support the principlesendorsed and the responsibilities assumed by theGovernments of the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea and the Republic of Korea.At a time when the United Nations is fullyengaged in the search for solutions to alleviate themany evils besetting peoples in all corners of theworld  through the adoption of strategies andprogrammes of action to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemicto mention just one example  the illegal traffic inweapons and drugs  drug addiction  the mortgaging ofthe lives of children through their traffic and easyrecruitment into the armed forces  discriminationagainst women  and so forth  the internationalcommunity’s attention has been diverted by unusualevents such as the unprecedented terrorist act of 11September 2001.The acts carried out against the United States ofAmerica on 11 September were undoubtedly attacksagainst the United Nations. The prevailing atmosphereof the current session of the General Assembly  a yearafter the adoption of the Millennium Declaration by anunprecedented attendance of 147 heads of State andGovernment and a total of 189 Member States  and thetemporary postponement until next year of the GeneralAssembly’s special session on children are eloquentexamples  among others  of the challenge and thedilemma faced by the United Nations.In that context  we reiterate the most vigorouscondemnation of terrorism in all its forms and facets and we reaffirm the Republic of Equatorial Guinea’sfull support for and solidarity with the people and30Government of the United States of America at thispainful and worrisome time  which will be difficult toforget.The country’s competent constitutional organs arecurrently adopting measures for the integration of theRepublic of Equatorial Guinea into existing relevantinternational conventions on the prevention andsuppression of international terrorism  as part of itsresponse to the Joint Declaration on Terrorism  adoptedin Brussels on 11 October  and the Dakar Declarationagainst Terrorism  signed on 17 October 2001  as wellas relevant resolutions of the Security Council.As the Secretary-General’s report forcefullypoints out  the Millennium Declaration insists on theneed to promote and intensify institutional cooperationbetween the United Nations and regional andsubregional organizations:“In an increasing globalized world  none ofthe critical issues we are dealing with can beresolved within a solely national framework. Allof them require cooperation  partnership andburden-sharing among Governments  the UnitedNations  regional organizations  non-governmental organizations  the private sectorand civil society.” (A/56/1  para. 11)In this context  and on behalf of the memberStates of the Economic Community of Central AfricanStates (ECCAS)  over which Equatorial Guinea ispresiding  we reiterate our deepest recognition of thegreat support offered by United Nations Member Stateswith respect to resolutions 55/22 and 55/161  oncooperation between the Organization of the UnitedNations and ECCAS and the observer status conferredon the latter organization.Given the prevalence of the informed politicalwill of ECCAS States to put an end to conflicts  theloss of innocent lives  the destruction of economic andsocial infrastructures and extreme poverty in ruralareas  we hope and are convinced that the GeneralAssembly will once again pronounce itself in favour ofthe implementation and improvement of cooperationbetween the United Nations and ECCAS in order thatthe latter may direct its potential — individual andcollective — towards alleviating the new challengesstemming from globalization and liberalization  for theeconomies of the subregion. This would enhance thepath to democracy  respect for human rights and therule of law in the subregion  within the context of theexcellent and tireless work being carried out by theUnited Nations Standing Advisory Committee onSecurity Questions in Central Africa.I would be remiss if I did not  on behalf of thePresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  HisExcellency Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo  convey tothe Assembly his greetings and sincere wishes forsuccess and prosperity to each and every participant.His Excellency had expressed his wish to attend  andregrets not being able to be present at thesedeliberations."
"68",2824,"GRC",56,2001,"﻿Allow me tocongratulate the President  Mr. Han Seung-soo  on hiselection and also to express my deep appreciation tohis predecessor  Mr. Holkeri  for his excellent workduring the past year.The nations that constitute this Organization aretoday attempting to draft a comprehensive conventionagainst terrorism  a difficult but absolutely necessarytask. We may not yet agree on how to define terrorism however the world  with a near unanimous voice condemned the 11 September events. The worldshowed solidarity with the American people  theUnited States Government  and President Bush. Thathighlights a simple truth and a profound consensus  aconsensus that this was an act against humanity  aconsensus that this was a crime against the values wehold dear as human beings and as societies  and aconsensus that justice must be done.From the ruins of this tragedy there rises anewborn moral strength  a clarion call to change thisworld  a call to create a moral order  a worldcommunity of values where a genuine sense of justicecan prevail. It is in our hands today — in fact it is ourresponsibility to rise to this occasion  take a bold stepbeyond our traditional rivalries and consolidate a newspirit of cooperation. Let us make this a common fightfor humanity. To do so we need not abandon ournational interests. We do  however  need to place themin a wider context  a world order based on commonpractices  shared principles and global values. We mustgo beyond rhetoric. That also means that ourresponsibilities must reach beyond our borders.Whether it be a child who is suffering from AIDS inAfrica  an Afghan refugee facing starvation  or ahuman being discriminated against because of race  sexor religion — these are today our sharedresponsibilities. Whether it be our threatenedenvironment  the need for sustainable development  theneed for equal educational opportunities  access to theInternet  or the inclusion of the poor in the fruits ofdevelopment — these are today our sharedresponsibilities. Nuclear weapons proliferation weapons of mass destruction and the protection ofchildren in conflict situations — these also are todayour shared responsibilities. No events could have madeit clearer than did those we witnessed with horror on 11September. We live in one world and no problem isonly our neighbour’s problem  it is also our problem.That underlines the need for a universal responseto the challenges that the citizens of this global villageface. It underlines the need for standards concerningprinciples and practices that guarantee justice — fromthe Middle East to Cyprus  to Afghanistan and toKosovo. The need for these principles underlines thepivotal role of the United Nations. I should like toexpress our warm support  respect and gratitude for thetireless efforts of Kofi Annan. Heartfelt congratulationsto him and to the Organization he represents  theUnited Nations  on the award of this year’s NobelPeace Prize. It is a well-deserved accolade  an accoladethat carries with it a heightened sense of responsibilityto provide global governance in this globalizedworld — a world of global problems and globalopportunities. Greece very much agrees with the wordsof Louis Michel  speaking in his capacity as Presidentof the European Union  in support of the InternationalCriminal Court and the continued reform of the UnitedNations.Today in our search for justice on a global scale our challenge is to seek moral clarity. We must be ableto unite around what is right. The words “freedom” “democracy”  “human and minority rights”  “equality” “peaceful resolution of conflict”  “solidarity” “inclusion”  “open society”  “multiculturalism” “tolerance” and “biodiversity” must all become thecore of our common values. Yet there are differentinterpretations and different practices in our worldconcerning these concepts. In our search for a commonmoral code we must not allow a clash of cultures. Wemust seek a dialogue of cultures  and from thisdialogue of nations  cultures and religions  a commonmoral code and order can and will emerge. The Charterof the United Nations embodies these values. Our5challenge today is collectively to give practicalmeaning to them. I should like to mention an importantstep in recognizing and respecting the dignity anddiversity of our cultures in the world. Greece has tableda resolution on the return of cultural property.Greece has always stood at a crossroads ofcultures. Our best moments have been when we usedthat richness to learn. Today we are doing so again.Greece is a member of the European Union and of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization  yet its roots in theEast enrich us in equal measure. We are proud to beEuropean and Balkan and Mediterranean. We oncewere a nation of emigrants and our diaspora has linkedus to all corners of the earth. Today we are a countrythat welcomes immigrants. They make up more than 10per cent of our population.Ours is an open  multicultural society in the truestsense of the word. We see and we understand the worldthrough many eyes. We understand that there aredifferent truths and different histories. Yet we approachour traditions not as a wall that isolates us from eachother  but as depositories of knowledge and sources ofunderstanding and communication between cultures.We believe that our histories cannot enslave us  theymust become our way of learning for the future.This commitment to dialogue is also acommitment to reach specific  practical results that willenhance our region’s ability and the worldcommunity’s capacity to establish well-respectedvalues and principles in dealing with world problemssuch as terrorism. But in our fight against terrorism wemust uphold these principles  as they differentiate usfrom those who use violence as their means. We mustalso heed what the Secretary-General in his addressstressed. The problems we all shared prior to 11September have not disappeared. However  I amencouraged to report that we have made significantstrides in our own region of South-Eastern Europe. Wedid so by committing ourselves to serve these values:human and minority rights  democratic institutions good-neighbourly relations and the inviolability ofborders. We remain committed to the principle thatshould differences and disagreements emerge  we willseek to resolve them peacefully with respect tointernational law. We have managed to establish theframework of common values  one that will help us tocooperate to solve our problems. Emerging from a stateof despair  the Balkans today represents a ray of hopefor all regions in conflict.Of course there is much to do. Let me list thepriorities. We must turn provisional peace intopermanent peace. We can do so by resolvingoutstanding bilateral issues. We must turn new-founddemocracies into permanent and active democracies.We can do so by building civic capacity and strongtransparent institutions that will guarantee the rule oflaw. We must contain and eradicate organized crime  apoison that runs through new-found democracies and isoften linked to terrorist networks. We must turnopportunistic capital investment into entrepreneurialinitiatives and permanent business propositions thatprovide youth with the prospect of a better and moresecure future. We must turn segregated communitiesinto multicultural societies  and we can do so byinvesting in education. Greece has committedresources  and of course its political will  to the above.We cannot stop now. As a world community we mustcontinue and we must strengthen our investment inpeople and in financial resources until our work iscomplete.Two years ago I stood before you here with myTurkish colleague Ismail Cem  expressing the hope fora new beginning in our relations  relations whichhistory seems to have frozen into constant rivalry andconflict. Today I need not express only hope; I canreport that we have made significant progress. I havejust come from a meeting with my Turkish counterpartwhere we signed a series of new agreements. Ourmeetings have become frequent and regular. We worktogether. We learn together. We help each other out intimes of difficulty and crisis. We have discovered theimportance of being good neighbours. We have startedto develop a common architecture of trust. Theproducts of our efforts are significant. We areconstantly adding confidence-building measures toassure peace in the Aegean.We have made a commitment to jointly becomeparties to the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition ofthe Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction  and wehave taken steps to cooperate against natural disasters.We are cooperating in the fight against crime  drugtrafficking  illegal migration and terrorism. We arecooperating in tourism. Our trade has doubled. Energyand agriculture have emerged as new fields of furthercooperation. Our two societies have taken the initiativeto commence and develop common economic  cultural educational and athletic activities.6These achievements stand as a reminder of theresponse of our people after the earthquakes  when theysent us a message saying:“We have more in common than what separatesus; we are all equally vulnerable to pain andsuffering; equally capable of sympathy andcompassion; equally responsible for the life weoffer to the generations that are to follow.”Again this year Greece and Turkey will jointly submita draft resolution on emergency disaster relief. Ourneighbour’s path towards the European Union  a pathwe wholeheartedly support  has set a new frameworkwithin which many of our remaining differences can beresolved. Step by step we are building a solidfoundation.Of course our work in the region is far fromcomplete. The architecture of trust we are building inSouth-Eastern Europe is significantly hindered by thesituation in Cyprus  for the question of Cyprus remainsunresolved. The island remains divided in a shamefulcondition. Cyprus is a tragic example of where ourshared sense of justice  our code of values  has goneastray. Yet here is a new opportunity. Both the GreekCypriot and the Turkish Cypriot communities couldbenefit from the island’s membership in the EuropeanUnion. It is a win-win situation. I sincerely believe thatevery Greek aspires to a solution on Cyprus that willsatisfy both communities  a solution imposed by no oneparty and accepted by all. I believe that that is whatevery citizen in neighbouring Turkey aspires to as well.Our constant reference to United Nationsresolutions that clearly call for the creation of abizonal  bicommunal federation cannot be interpretedas a desire for outside imposition — both communitieshave suffered terribly from outside intervention. On thecontrary  this call expresses our deep belief in justicefor Cyprus  a sense of justice for both communities.That is what the United Nations framework canguarantee.I therefore appeal to the Turkish leadership to usethat framework for a just solution. Let us not expandthe wall that divides the two communities in Cyprus todivide Turkey from Europe. Let us instead break downthis last Berlin Wall in Europe and help to create acommon future for the citizens of a free Cyprus. To allof us in the region  a region seeking to eliminatedivision  the prospect of the island’s entrance into theunited European family should be a source of euphoria not fear.If we do share a common moral order  a commonunderstanding of what is right and wrong  then theMiddle East peace process had come close toarticulating the principles we share. For the good of thepeople in the region and its stability  that process mustcontinue until a Palestinian State lives peacefully nextto a secure Israel. That peace process must begin anew without preconditions  based on secure initial stepsthrough the implementation of the Mitchell reportrecommendations. Greece  as both a member of theEuropean Union and a neighbour to the Middle East will commit its efforts in this crucial situation towardsthe support of peace  rapprochement and reconciliation.We also hope that the hardships of the people ofIraq will cease and that the country will be fullyintegrated into the world community under a leadershipthat cooperates with the international community andcomplies with United Nations resolutions. That is alsoour stand with regard to Afghanistan. We look forwardto the day that its Government represents its people andleads them closer to the world community. Here Greece has already committed substantial resourcestowards alleviating the humanitarian problem of theAfghanis.At times when it is easy to succumb to fear wemust have the strength to build confidence within andamong our societies. We must be able to celebratehumanity in this global village  to go beyond ourdifferences and conflicts. One such occasion is theOlympic Games. They are an ancient tradition thatgrew out of the need for peace in the ancient world ofHellenism. Today the five rings of the Olympic Games which represent five continents  are the mostrecognized symbol on this planet  surpassing anycommercial logo. Let us use this global celebration tofurther strengthen our community of common values.Let us again pledge our commitment to the OlympicTruce which the Secretary-General has so stronglysupported and the Millennium Summit has called for.Ismail Cem and I have only recently signed adeclaration to this effect. Many ministers of theBalkans  Europe and the Mediterranean have followed.I invite all to become co-signatories.We see that Truce as a moment in time powerfulenough to change the world. During the ceasefire inBosnia the Olympic Truce helped the Red Cross to7vaccinate hundreds of children. The two Koreasparading under the same flag at the Sydney Games wasa powerful moment  witnessed by millions around theworld. We see truce as a time to reflect. We see truce asa moment of silence. We see truce as a time toquestion  to examine what we believe. We see truce asa time to heal our wounds. We can use this pause fromviolence to celebrate and to rejoice  and we can use itto mourn and to remember. In Salt Lake City we canuse it to honour all those unjustly lost. If our globalquest for peace is a journey of 1 000 miles  then truceis but the small first step. But imagine how glorious therest of our journey can be if we celebrate humanity  ifwe give peace a chance and commit ourselves to thatfirst step."
"69",2865,"GRD",56,2001,"﻿At the outset  mydelegation extends profound sympathy to the familiesof the victims who lost their lives on the flight to theDominican Republic.The rescheduled general debate now convened well into the work of the fifty-sixth session of theGeneral Assembly  only serves to reconfirm ourawareness of Mr. Han’s great diplomatic andcommunicative skills. For this  my delegation thanksand congratulates him once again. Under his competentleadership we hope this will be a fruitful and decisivesession of the Assembly.This being my first opportunity  may I take thestand  on behalf of the Government and people ofGrenada  to heartily congratulate the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  and theUnited Nations on the designation as recipient of theNobel Peace Prize.Just as the fifty-fifth session was the MillenniumAssembly of joy  hope and optimism  this fifty-sixthsession  by contrast  can be called the unpredictableAssembly of challenge and adversity  from which theinternational community can nevertheless derivestrength and unity in the pursuit of a common enemywho will eventually be found and brought to justice.The challenge and uncertainty have come aboutbecause terrorism now threatens the entire civilizedworld. The catastrophic and traumatic events of 11September have changed not only the lives ofindividuals  for whom we grieve so painfully  but it hasalso changed the modus vivendi and the modusoperandi of our present-day civilization in manyrespects. If this cloud of hatred and revenge is allowedto prevail  history will long remember that eviltriumphed due to inaction.Thus  the broad international coalition broughttogether by the United States of America and supportedby Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) andGeneral Assembly resolution 56/1 stands as a bulwarkready to break the immoral and physical backbone ofterrorism. Grenada fully supports and endorsesresolution 1373 (2001)  which sets out importantmeasures that countries — large and small  rich andpoor — must all take together to prevent and combatterrorists in our jurisdictions or wherever they may befound.The newly formed Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee  under the chairmanship of thePermanent Representative of the United Kingdom  is awelcome and laudable effort in the struggle thatdeserves the backing and support of all Member Statesmorally  strategically and financially. In addition  it issoliciting assistance from persons with particular skillsin the performance of special functions.The Government of Grenada has already begun totake steps within its jurisdiction to implement measureswithin our capacity that prevent and suppress thefinancing of terrorists acts. Our priority to preventthose who finance  plan  facilitate or commit terroristacts from using Grenada for those purposes againstother States or their citizens  as well as to find ways tointensify and accelerate the exchange and sharing ofinformation. Grenada is examining its administrativeand other processes with a view to improvingefficiency in this regard.We are active in the global fight againstterrorism. Grenada is cooperating with the UnitedStates authorities to ensure that there are no terroristfunds in any of our offshore institutions. Further Grenada has thoroughly examined its economiccitizenship programme to ensure that no knownterrorists had inadvertently been granted citizenship.We are now confident that no such person is an16economic citizen of Grenada. In light of the changedglobal environment and our commitment to assist in thefight against terrorism in any way we can  theGovernment of Grenada has taken the decision tosuspend indefinitely the economic citizenshipprogramme.Moreover  Grenada continues to intensify itsparticipation in regional and international cooperationefforts as we seek to ensure that there are no gaps inthe global framework for the fight against this heinouscrime. Grenada will reinforce and extend itsinternational cooperation arrangements in the field ofjustice  policing and law enforcement.The Government of Grenada fully supports thedevelopment of a comprehensive and effective legalframework to combat terrorism. My country has beguna review of international conventions already in place with a view to signing  ratifying and fullyimplementing them. Those not yet in effect will beimplemented. Some of these conventions are within theUnited Nations system  while others are of a regionalor hemispheric nature. Priority is being given to theexisting 12 United Nations international conventionsagainst terrorism — in particular  the InternationalConvention for the Suppression of the Financing ofTerrorism.It is necessary for the international community tosend a clear and unambiguous signal to terrorists thattheir philosophy is fundamentally wrong and totallyunacceptable. We must stand united in our efforts tocombat and eliminate activities aimed at killinginnocent people and destroying communities. TheGovernment of Grenada joins the CaribbeanCommunity in pledging our full support of efforts toconfront terrorism and restore the rights and freedomof people the world over. My delegation would like tofocus for a few moments on the impact that thisdastardly act has had nationally  regionally andinternationally.In my country  as elsewhere in the Caribbean  theeffect of the global economic turbulence has hit thetourism and aviation sectors hardest. Tourism  the hotelindustry and aviation play a synergistic role that iscrucial to the economies of most small States in termsof foreign exchange and employment.The subregion had already begun to feel theeffects of the international economic downturn  whichcaused the deterioration of our fortunes. But it is clearthat since the terrorist attacks on the United States ofAmerica  Grenada and the other members of theOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) aresuffering from further reduction in economic activities.We are now severely challenged.We are experiencing shortfalls in revenuecollection. Our tourism sector is experiencing a drasticreduction in visitor arrivals. Indeed  the InternationalMonetary Fund predicts that arrivals in the Caribbeanregion could fall short by as much as 50 per cent. Ourair and marine transport are also experiencing severereductions. Regional air carriers have registered asmuch as a 45 per cent fall in passenger load since 11September.The picture looks bleak  but we are determinedthat our response must prevent the devastationenvisioned by the perpetrators of terror. Soon after 11September  the Prime Minister of Grenada andChairman of the OECS  The Honourable Dr. KeithMitchell  convened a meeting of OECS to discuss theimpact on tourism and related activities — hotels banks  agriculture  manufacturing and transportation.The subregional meeting of OECS took a number ofdecisions that will respond to our economic challenges.One such measure is the formation of the GrenadaNational Economic Council. This will give effect to therevival of sustainable tourism. It will address fiscal andeconomic performance  and it will give impetus toproductivity. In addition  only recently in the Bahamas the Caribbean Community heads of Government metand approved an $18 million joint public/private sectoremergency tourism promotion programme demonstrating self-help at its best in the region.The events of 11 September  with the ensuingeconomic and geopolitical instability  have propelled usto reorder our priorities. We need to focus on restoringconfidence in international economic and multilateralcooperation. As we all know  the member States of theWorld Trade Organization do not participate on a levelplaying field. The developing world is still strugglingto bridge the economic and social divide in our globalcommunity. Some were not in favour of the secondround of negotiations. Yet some States were willing toput their differences aside and endeavour to marchtowards the next stage of economic and multilateralcooperation. This is clearly what we aspire to in thisaugust body.17While concerns about terrorism have dominatedthe general debate  and rightly so  mention must bemade of the unfinished agenda of the last decade of thetwentieth century with respect to social and economicdevelopment  central to which is the human person.The following United Nations summit-levelconferences  which have been held in the past 10 years have all stressed sustainable development and thecentrality of the human person in the process: theUnited Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro in 1992; the WorldConference on Human Rights in Vienna in 1993; theInternational Conference on Population andDevelopment in Cairo in 1994; the World Summit forSocial Development in Copenhagen in 1995; theSecond United Nations Conference on HumanSettlements (Habitat II) in Istanbul in 1996; the WorldFood Summit in Rome in 1996; the MillenniumSummit in 2000; and the special session of the GeneralAssembly on HIV/AIDS in 2001.The question is: How much of the outcome ofthese conferences has been implemented with respectto poverty alleviation  the empowerment of women health  education  children and the elderly  tradeliberalization  economic cooperation  and the sharingand transfer of technology? Could it be that theseconferences and special sessions promised more thanthey could deliver? Promising too much is as bad asdoing too little.The fight against poverty underpins all of thosethings. To feed the hungry is both a divine and a socialimperative. Thus  the international community isparticularly concerned that the InternationalConference on Financing for Development to be heldnext year in Mexico and the World Summit forSustainable Development to be held in South Africa both so important for small States  should yieldpositive results. The Barbados Programme of Actionfor the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States is still a major and unfulfilledcomponent of the process of the United NationsConference on Environment and Development  and itshould be high on the implementation agenda this timearound.For more than 40 years an embargo has existedagainst a small country in the Caribbean. What this hasdone is to ostracize the Cuban people and cause themundue hardship. What it has achieved is to make theCuban people more innovative. The old wounds havehealed  the pain has dulled and the cause hasdiminished. I wish to register Grenada’s support for theremoval of the United States of America’s economicembargo on Cuba. Members will recall that last year167 Member States voted in favour of the removal ofthat embargo. Only three voted against and fourabstained. That shows the overwhelming position ofthe international community against those sanctions.Trade  as we know  is important for the development ofany people  and with the embargo there is no freedomof trade between Cuba and the United States.In the wake of the devastation caused in Cuba byhurricane Michelle  it is now critical that steps be takento remove the embargo and to give the Cuban people achance to recover from that unstoppable force ofnature. The easing of the economic embargo againstCuba could assist in the overall development of thatcountry  a small nation seeking against all odds tomaintain a modern  dynamic society in the Caribbeanand in Latin America. The lifting of the embargo wouldaugur well for friendly cooperative relations among allthe countries of this hemisphere.Now  I turn to the issue of the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan. Grenada believes that a country thatexhibits fortitude and that has moved its economy frompoor and underdeveloped to affluent and prosperousdeserves recognition. A country that consistently showsinternational responsibility surely deserves to beadmitted to this community of nations. The time hascome to reconsider the exclusion of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan from membership of the UnitedNations. The Republic of China is home to 23 millionpeople. It is a free and democratic country  and apeace-loving member of the international community.In economic terms  the Republic of China on Taiwan isthe seventeenth largest economy in the world  theeighth largest investor in and fourth largest exporter ofinformation technology products  and the third largestholder of foreign reserves. It is preposterous tocontinue to keep such a country outside the worldbody.The Government of Grenada appeals for thatwrong to be corrected. We are therefore requesting thatthe United Nations recognize the natural right of thepeople of Taiwan to become active participants in thisOrganization. We believe that the Government and thepeople of Taiwan are seeking to participate in theUnited Nations and to contribute constructively to the18international community. Grenada urges that they begiven that opportunity and that right.Grenada  however  notes with satisfaction theadmission of the Republic of China on Taiwan into theWorld Trade Organisation. It is the hope of mydelegation that the past  present and future performanceof Taiwan as a major democratic and internationaleconomic player  although Taiwan is not now amember of the United Nations  will in the not-too-distant future enable it to regain its rightful place in thefamily of nations.The United Nations membership must makeArticle 3 of the Charter a major priority in the next fewyears. Our founding fathers called for the Organization“To achieve international cooperation insolving international problems of an economic social  cultural  or humanitarian character  and inpromoting and encouraging respect for humanrights and for fundamental freedoms for allwithout distinction as to race  sex  language  orreligion.”We must do all in our power to provide addedeconomic opportunities for the developing world. Webelieve that trade is one avenue to achieve this. Itherefore call on the Economic and Social Councilactively to pursue undertakings that could create anencouraging atmosphere in which Member States couldhave the opportunity to raise the standard of living oftheir peoples. In the current global environment  wemust be conscious that inclusion in the processes of theglobal economy is vital.Finally  I must recall Article 1 of the UnitedNations Charter  which calls for the Organization“To maintain international peace andsecurity  and to that end: to take effectivecollective measures for the prevention andremoval of threats to the peace.”We must be relentless in our pursuit of thepurposes of the Organization. Our challenge is to worktowards the elimination of terrorist activities. Our questmust be for economic opportunities for all States. Andour goal should be the peaceful coexistence of allpeoples of the international community."
"70",2912,"GTM",56,2001,"﻿Let me first condemn the monstrous attack on thepeople and the Government of our host country. Incondemning it in the strongest possible terms  wedeclare ourselves in full solidarity with the people andthe Government of the United States  the families ofeach and every one of the victims  whatever his or hernationality  and the residents of this great city of NewYork. We also associate ourselves unreservedly withthe resolutions adopted last month by the Assemblyand the Security Council. We will carry on in ourcommitment to the elimination of terrorism in all itsforms and manifestations.Before taking up our Government programme andthe fulfilment of the Peace Agreements  and ourposition on certain of the items on the agenda for thissession  I wish to warmly congratulate you  Sir  onyour election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly. I have no doubt that your well-provencapabilities and your recognized wisdom will enableyou to bring our deliberations to a fully successfuloutcome.I wish further to join the representatives whohave taken the floor before me in commending theSecretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Kofi Annanfor his wise leadership. We hail his well-deserved re-election and rejoice at the recognition that both he andthe Organization have received  through the award ofthe Nobel Peace Prize.I come  like many of those gathered here  from asmall country that mirrors the grave problems facingtoday’s world. Today we still do not enjoy the majorbenefits of the great scientific and technologicaladvances  and we still suffer from great socialinequalities. Ours is a small country that is doing itsbest to attain peace and democracy — a country thatbelieves in the rewards of economic freedom  but alsoin social justice. It is a country that has opened itselfup to the world  although the world has perhaps notopened itself up reciprocally in the same way. It is acountry that works and produces by making greatefforts but that  in the present circumstances  isreceiving less and less for those efforts.In this context  our contribution to world peaceand democracy is diminished to the same extent thatinequality  social injustice and poverty imperil ourpeace and our democracy.2Today the struggle against terrorism is thestruggle against inequality in international economicrelations; it is the struggle against ignorance  injustice discrimination  intolerance  exclusion and poverty.There will be no peace if we do not eradicate thesescourges. A peace that goes hand in hand withinequality  poverty and injustice is a bad peace. And letus not forget that a bad peace is worse than war.We are making strenuous efforts to advance inimplementing our own Peace Agreements  whichcoincide with our Government programme. The timethat has elapsed since I addressed the MillenniumSummit has witnessed intensive activities. I can pointto significant progress  but I must also admit to somesetbacks  which are due primarily to an unfavourableinternational environment  which has affected theeconomy in an extremely adverse way. I draw attentionto this situation  because full compliance with thecommitments contained in the Peace Agreementswould be far easier in a context of economic growththan in the framework of serious fiscal restrictions andincreasing demands on the Government.On a different matter  I would like to commentbriefly on the United Nations presence in Guatemala. Iwish to reiterate how much we appreciate the UnitedNations Verification Mission in Guatemala(MINUGUA). We trust that its mandate will beextended until the end of 2003 so that we can in aprogressive and orderly way transfer its functions bothto national institutions and  wherever possible  to theUnited Nations programmes and agencies.As far as our international relations areconcerned  I would like to mention the significantprogress made in the process of finding a peacefulresolution to the historical dispute between ourselvesand Belize. In keeping with the principles of peacefulsettlement of disputes between States  we haveconfirmed with deeds our commitment to dialogue asthe way of settling disputes. The commission offacilitators appointed last year  within the frameworkof the regional organization to which both Statesbelong  the Organization of American States  will soonsubmit its report. Its fundamental aim is to work outand prepare courses of action to make progress inresolving the dispute.We reiterate our firm support for CentralAmerican integration and our commitment to the restof Latin America and the Caribbean. Our Governmenthas supported major initiatives in the area of regionaland subregional integration  and is working hard toovercome problems left over from age-old borderdisputes in Central America.As to our position on other international conflicts we voice the hope that the differences or divisions thatpersist between fraternal peoples in the Middle East Asia and Africa will yield to resolution peacefullythrough dialogue. I also wish to take this opportunity toreiterate before this Assembly our concern over thesituation of the 23 million citizens of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan  whose aspiration to be represented ininternational organizations has not yet been fullysatisfied. The Central American countries in general and Guatemala in particular  believe they could indeedmake a positive contribution to peace and democracy inthe world.I would now like to comment briefly on ourviews regarding the principal issues with which thisAssembly will have to deal at the current session. First I reiterate our full support for the United Nations as thesupreme expression of multilateralism. We areconvinced that the United Nations will have a crucialrole to play in the twenty-first century. It is our viewthat the Millennium Declaration that our heads of Stateand Government issued a year ago offers the rightagenda for our priorities and for the steps to be taken toattain the goals set.Second  we agree that it is necessary to adapt theOrganization to the exigencies of globalization and tothis post-cold-war era. It is up to us  the MemberGovernments  to further this process of adaptation invarious areas  such as intergovernmental forums  theefficiency and efficacy of the Secretariat  the setting ofpriorities in shaping the programme of activities andthe financial strengthening of the Organization.Third  of the pending reforms  the one that hasreceived the most attention is that concerning theSecurity Council. One cannot but be frustrated at thelimited progress made in this area at previous sessionsof the General Assembly. Now more than ever beforewe must redouble our efforts to endow that body withgreater efficacy  broader representativity and moretransparency in its working procedures. To achievethese objectives  we advocate  inter alia  an increase inthe number of Council members  as well as a verysparse use of the veto power. We also believe that now3more than ever before it is necessary that the SecurityCouncil’s work be monitored by the General Assembly.Fourth  deeply shocked by the events thatoccurred in this country on 11 September  we reiterateour full and complete opposition to terrorism  and wewill support any collective action by the internationalcommunity to combat this scourge. As a matter of fact we are already working to comply with the spirit andthe letter of the undertakings embodied in SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001)  within the parametersof a democratic society that aspires to guarantee thehuman rights of its members.Fifth  we advocate the strengthening of theGeneral Assembly  and we congratulate the Presidentof its fifty-fifth session on his initiative to revitalize itsworking methods and procedures. We trust that thisaction will continue under the current presidency andthat it will extend to the wider task of reforming theAssembly  in pursuance of the aims of the MillenniumDeclaration.Sixth  we are convinced of the need to strengthenour collective capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts both between States and at the national level. Webelieve that the report of the Panel on United NationsPeace Operations provides an adequate basis forachieving this purpose.Seventh  as regards general disarmament  weinsist on the need for progress towards the totalelimination of nuclear  chemical and bacteriologicalweapons  the illicit trade in small arms and lightweapons  and the use of anti-personnel mines and otherexplosive devices. In this connection  we support allconcrete actions by the United Nations to accomplishthese aims  including those that look to theestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in allregions of the world. As regards the control of illicittrade in small arms and light weapons  we are of theview that the results of the Conference held last July todeal with this problem  while positive if allowance ismade for this being the first step taken at the globallevel to deal with the matter  are neverthelessinadequate.Eighth  we offer our full support for and activeparticipation in the principal meetings scheduled forthe years ahead  among which I wish to highlight theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment  to be held in Monterrey  Mexico  nextMarch  as well as the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  to be held in Johannesburg.Ninth  in a world characterized by ever greaterinterdependence  multilateral diplomacy plays a crucialrole in the fight against environmental degradation.Guatemala  as a party to the main international treatiesrelating to the environment  reiterates its commitmentto the maintenance of ecological balance.Finally  we consider that the United Nationsshould continue devoting itself to what we call thegreat unfinished business of the twentieth century —namely  the elimination of world poverty. Togetherwith the multilateral financial agencies  ourOrganization should play a crucial role in ensuring thatthe benefits of globalization are widely shared amongall countries  not only among a few of them; thisrequires action at the level of each country and at theinternational level.Given the globalization process the world isgoing through  we must recognize  as stated by thegreat Mexican thinker Carlos Fuentes  that unregulatedglobalization leads to more profound economic andsocial imbalance. We cannot turn economic policy intoa mere balancing of accounts in which human beingsand populations are not taken into consideration. Howcan we make demands on some countries when thosedemands are not made of others in similar conditions?Civilization is being put to the test. The questionis how to eliminate the universal threat posed byterrorism and at the same time maintain and renew theethical  political  legal and social bases for ensuringcoexistence in a globalized world. The only solution isto focus on fighting for more freedom  moredemocracy  more tolerance and more justice. In thisrespect  I would like to share with the Assembly thewords of a distinguished Guatemalan poet  Otto RenéCastillo:“We have suffered in so many places the blows ofthe executioner and written his name so manytimes on so little skin  that we cannot die  forliberty has no death”.May God bless and protect us."
"71",2955,"GUY",56,2001,"﻿Although the embersfrom the towering infernos which resulted from theattacks on 11 September have not fully died  it maynevertheless be possible to analyse the impact whichthat horrific disaster has had on international relationsand  more particularly  the political  economic  andsocial consequences which it is likely to have for theworld. Such an analysis  it is to be hoped  will instructus on how we may best respond to these newchallenges and pursue the twin goals of global peaceand development in this new  twenty-first century.Mr. President  it augurs well that this examinationwill be conducted under your guidance  since  comingas you do from the land of the morning calm  you willno doubt bring to bear on our debate not only a freshand dispassionate view  but also a ray of hope after thelong dark night through which we have just passed. Mydelegation offers you our warmest congratulations andgood wishes as you continue to preside over the workof this historic General Assembly  which  thoughinaugurated in the depths of despair  may yet hold outthe promise of salvation for mankind.It would be remiss of me were I not also toextend our gratitude to your distinguished predecessor Mr. Harri Holkeri  who presided with great verve andvigour over the Assembly through very difficult andinteresting times. He has contributed much to therevitalization of the General Assembly.To the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  Iconvey our greetings and commendation for his sureand steady leadership of our Organization. The recentaward of the Nobel Peace Prize to him and the UnitedNations is a source of great satisfaction and pride forGuyana and  indeed  for the entire membership of thisbody.As was so aptly stated by the Economist of 15September  the terrorist attack on the United Statesaltered the geopolitical landscape as indelibly as it didthe Manhattan skyline. The world is a changed placesince that horrendous event  changed in that wesuddenly find  under threat  by unorthodox and hithertounimaginable means  the values by which ourOrganization is driven  values the attainment of whichhave been the object of our onerous and protractedlabours for a period extending over many decades. Wecannot help but feel a sense of sorrow and shame thatsuch a barbaric act — as the destruction of the WorldTrade Center and a part of the Pentagon most certainlywas — could have occurred in this day and age only ashort distance from this house of our commonhumanity.Like most leaders of the civilized world  thePresident of Guyana was swift to condemn thisegregious crime. As a small and vulnerable State  withlimited ability to defend itself in the event ofencroachment on its territorial integrity  Guyana cannotaccept the threat or the use of violence to resolveconflicts and disputes  whether inter-State or intra-State. All differences must be settled  as called for inthe Charter of the United Nations  by peaceful means such as those prescribed in Article 33.The violence which was visited two months agoupon some 5 000 human beings — including many of15our own nationals — in this our host city and  indeed before that  upon so many other peoples and places inthe world  must be not only roundly condemned butalso condignly punished. The international communitymust now develop an arsenal of appropriate legalinstruments  including a comprehensive conventionagainst terrorism  to combat this new enemy of ourtimes. The message must be clearly sent to all whowould use terrorism to pursue their objectives that theiractions will not be tolerated by the Members of thisOrganization but  instead  will be dealt with firmlywith the full force of the law.At home and in our various regions  we mustbuild defences that are strong enough to keep outterrorism and its concomitants  such as arms and drugtrafficking and other forms of transnational crime.Within the Caribbean Community  of which Guyana isa member  we have agreed to set up mechanisms forinformation sharing and coordinated action to denythese criminal elements access to our territories. Aregional task force has been established to identifymeasures necessary to creating a cordon sanitaire tohelp insulate us from their onslaught. This is not aneasy mandate since  as the immigration doors in thedeveloped countries become more tightly closed hundreds of criminals who have grown up in thesesocieties are being deported now to our countrieswhich  because of severe financial and humanconstraints  are ill-equipped to handle this influx.Although perhaps not as immediate or striking asthese political and security consequences  the economicand social impact of the 11 September disaster hasbeen no less powerful and pervasive. All countrieshave undoubtedly been affected by the disaster  butsmall and vulnerable States such as my own will find itespecially difficult to cope with the resulting hardship.Our countries  with far fewer alternatives available tothem than to the more developed  because of anunfavourable international economic system  highlevels of external debt and unequal terms of trade  willsuffer disproportionately. The exporters of primaryproducts  now as in the past  are the first to suffer adownturn in the world economy and the last torecover — a process that occurs with a frequency thatis altogether too depressing.These imbalances and asymmetries whichseriously affect the progress of developing countriesare now likely to become even more pronounced in therapid process of globalization. Still  as is often said “It’s an ill wind that does not blow some good”. Wewould therefore wish to believe that out of the calamitywill come an improvement in our lot. We should not beso foolish  however  as to think that this will happenautomatically. Salvation will depend on our willingnessto learn from our experience and to do better in thefuture. From the ashes of the Second World War arosethe phoenix of the United Nations  giving hope to newgenerations that they could live in peace  prosperityand larger freedom. Sadly  the end of the cold war didnot generate a similarly bold enterprise  leavinghumanity to wander aimlessly in search of peacefulcoexistence. We must therefore  before it is too late honour our commitment to the United Nations Charterand create a new vision and strategy with which wemay face the challenges of this new era.In keeping with the spirit and substance of ourhistoric compromise  we must act responsibly toremove from our midst all threats to global peace andsecurity. Foremost among these is the situation in theMiddle East  at the core of which is the Palestinianproblem  stemming from the persistent denial to anentire people of the enjoyment of their basic andinalienable rights. The peace process must beimmediately re-engaged with seriousness of purposeand determination to put an end  once and for all  to thesenseless violence and bloodshed which has been theunhappy fate of the Palestinian people and others.They  as well as all other peoples in the region  must beallowed to live in a State of their own  free from fear orwant  within safe and secure borders. However  it is notonly the Middle East which suffers from the ravages ofconflict. In far too many places — in Africa  Asia Latin America and the Caribbean and Europe  the riskof violence is ever present  fuelled by a variety offactors and made more dangerous by the possibility offurther conflagration. To avert these threats  we mustfully utilize the machinery provided in the Charter forthe peaceful settlement of disputes.Yet  it is important in all of this that the Agendafor Peace not be allowed to diminish or to displace theAgenda for Development since  were this to happen the prospects for any durable peace anywhere would bevirtually non-existent. Peace and development areinextricably intertwined  and any attempt to separatethem would not only be artificial but totally dangerous.We would do well to bear this in mind should recentevents prompt a reordering of global priorities and leadto a diversion of attention from economic and social16issues to purely political and security concerns.Already  in the immediate aftermath of the attack  thePresident of the World Bank was reported to have saidthat the 2015 target for halving global poverty couldnot now be reached and that  in fact  poverty wouldincrease over the next year or two. This deterioration isnot easily contemplated by small economies like ourown and those of the Caribbean region.In our view  it is imperative that the UnitedNations now actively pursue the Agenda forDevelopment to enable developing countries especially the small and the vulnerable  to ride out thecurrent political and economic storms. The upcomingInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment  which will take place in Monterrey Mexico  next March  represents a unique opportunity toexamine both the internal and external constraints thatsignificantly affect the mobilization of financialresources for development  as well as to collectivelyaddress the inefficiencies and inequities of existingfinancial markets. The high concentration of thesemarkets on existing financial assets aimed at short-termprofit  rather than on new assets linked to the creationof wealth and employment for longer-termdevelopment  remains a source of great concern andmust be remedied.I think that we all must now acknowledge that theprevailing international system of developmentcooperation is seriously flawed and has failed toachieve its primary objective of increasing growth andimproving the quality of life in poor countries. Inherentin this system are many debt and poverty traps thatcontinue to ensnare millions of the world’s poorestpeople  many of whom now have to face diseases suchas AIDS. Not only is the experience painful  but itoften also deprives the poor of their basic humanrights  there being an undoubted nexus  nowuniversally recognized  between the actualization ofhuman rights and economic development. It is out ofthis recognition that my delegation  last November brought resolution 55/48 before the General Assemblyon the role of the United Nations in promoting a newglobal human order.The proposal for such an order acknowledges thatthe major constraints affecting economic and socialprogress in developing countries reside in the capacitylimitation in the critical areas of markets administrative and institutional infrastructures in boththe public and private sectors  the leveraging ofresources and the ability of developing countries tonegotiate as equal partners in a number of forumsoutside the United Nations. This proposal thereforeseeks to improve the effectiveness of developmentcooperation programmes  to optimize scarce financialresources and to reduce the spread of poverty. It alsoaddresses new ways of managing developmentcooperation that would significantly overcomeproblems of aid dependence  current imbalances andasymmetries in international trade  and the highindebtedness that continues to plague developingcountries.These objectives  in the view of the Governmentof Guyana  can be achieved through a comprehensivedialogue among Governments  based not only onpolitical and economic considerations  but also onethical and moral principles that are necessary to thecreation of a more humane and just order in the world.This dialogue  which began at the last session of theGeneral Assembly  will be renewed at the fifty-seventhsession  when  we hope  the concept will be furtherembedded in the international consciousness andultimately accepted as the way forward to a moreenlightened system of international relations.It is entirely appropriate that this dialogue shouldbe held within the United Nations  since themultifaceted and transnational nature of today’schallenges requires a multilateral  rather than aunilateral  approach. There is no doubt that the UnitedNations is ideally suited to promote this globalpartnership in an environment that today requires firm focused and inclusive governance. Given theuniversality of the Organization’s membership  theprinciples and values that it has long upheld and thegrowing interest of civil society in its activities  theUnited Nations has a singular opportunity now toexercise a leadership role in international political social and economic policy-making.At this time of great uncertainty and trepidation therefore  we must recognize  now more than everbefore  the continuing need for the United NationsOrganization which  despite its many achievements inits 56 years of existence  has yet to fulfil its fullpotential with regard to international cooperation. Wemust therefore not allow complacency  self-interest orunilateralism to compromise that global vision of thefounding Members."
"72",3001,"HND",56,2001,"﻿At this juncture  when humanity is faced withvarious challenges  it is essential that the UnitedNations receive the broadest and most firm support asit plays the role of coordinator of our collective efforts.The 2001 Nobel Peace Prize  awarded to theSecretary-General and to the United Nations as awhole  is a further reaffirmation of trust in thisuniversal Organization  which was created to banishviolence and to further human development. Wewarmly congratulate the Secretary-General and theofficials and employees of the Organization.The international turmoil brought about by theterrorist attack of 11 September against the people andthe Government of the United States of America  aswell as against the highest values of the civilizedworld  has radically altered the way in which we thinkabout international security. Our own people are notimmune from this new reality. Buried under the rubbleof the World Trade Center are the remains ofHondurans who had come to this country to turn theirhopes into reality. The President of the United States in his statement this morning  referred to the manycountries whose nationals perished in the twin towers.It is  indeed  an international phenomenon.The Presidents of the Central American countries at the invitation of the President of Honduras  Mr.Carlos Flores  met in Honduras on 19 September andadopted specific joint steps to be taken at thesubregional level to combat terrorism. The purpose isto contribute  within our modest capacities  to that end which is synonymous with the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. Those steps includecontrols on migration and financial flows andintelligence sharing in the framework of theOrganization of American States and the UnitedNations.The Government of Honduras notes with deepconcern the escalating violence in the Middle East. Inthe light of the circumstances at the time  we supportedthe establishment of the State of Israel. Today  we wantto use this international forum  which plays a criticalrole in the search for a solution in the region  toreaffirm the right of Israel to exist as a sovereign  freeand secure States. We also support recognition of theinalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of a PalestinianState. We are convinced that that constitutes a suitableformula for real peace in the Middle East.In his introductory remarks today  the Secretary-General expressed his grief and revulsion at thecowardly acts of international terrorism. He also wiselynoted that none of the other problems before us hasbecome any less urgent. In addition to terrorism  othergrave dangers threaten peace and the well-being ofindividuals. Among them is HIV/AIDS  which was thefocus of a special session of the General Assembly held from 25 to 27 June 2001. That collectiveendeavour led to the establishment of a globalHIV/AIDS and health fund to support joint measuresagainst the pandemic. The special session raised thelevel of understanding of the scope of the pandemic which goes beyond health  because it also has a socialand economic impact.The June session forged links of cooperationamong nations with a view to sharing experience andsolutions in the fight against HIV/AIDS. In particular it is essential to reduce the cost of drugs: in Honduras as in many other countries  most of the infected andtheir families cannot afford the necessary treatment.Brazil’s agreements with pharmaceutical companies inthis field are worthy of emulation. This should be agoal in dealing with diseases that hit the developingcountries hardest.38In Honduras  we are encouraged by the fact thatthe rate at which the virus is spreading has slowed.Forecasts two years ago overestimated today’s levels ofinfection – although these continue to be high. TheUnited Nations Educational  Cultural and ScientificOrganization is helping us to set up a regional AIDSprevention centre at San Pedro Sula to serve the entireCentral American region.Extreme poverty is another major threat to thepeace and welfare of individuals. Here too  the UnitedNations deserves the support of the entire internationalcommunity in helping overcome the causes of extremepoverty through strategic measures aimed at offeringopportunities to sectors that are now excluded so thatthey can enjoy a decent life and be a productive part oftheir societies. That does not mean only vocational andtechnological training; ignoring the hardship caused bywidespread illiteracy would amount to condemning 70per cent of the world’s population to wretchedness. TheUnited Nations has come forward with valuableinternational initiatives.For its part  Honduras has adopted a povertyreduction strategy in which education plays afundamental role. This grew out of a nationalconsensus which in turn holds the key to country’srecovery and transformation in the aftermath ofhurricane Mitch.The United Nations must promote fundamentaldemocratic freedoms  including participation andlegitimate representation in decision-making processes.Here the Organization has played an ever-growing rolein facilitating dialogue and promoting consensus. Inrecent years  Honduras has held a national dialogue ina variety of fields of vital importance for the nation’sfuture. The results have been promising. In addition toformulating a national-reconstruction plan to overcomethe unprecedented damage caused by hurricane Mitchthree years ago  the Government of President CarlosFlores  in one of the broadest consultative processes inour history as a republic  has  together with our people adopted a 15-year strategy for poverty reduction. Thatis the first plan of its kind  arrived at through a nationalconsensus  to be adopted by my country.Alleviating poverty  overcoming educationalbackwardness  responding to epidemics and reducingour vulnerability to natural phenomena: all are linkedto economic output and to its intelligent distribution.We are thus aware that it is not only underpinnings inthe form of programmes that are needed; fairness andjustice in international trade are also required. To beconsistent with the rhetoric of international trade  weneed better access to major markets. Agriculturalproducts of developed countries must no longer be soheavily subsidized  so that the products of those of uswho are handicapped by our level of development canbe more competitive in line with the principles of thatrhetoric. What is good for some should be good for all.We need a level playing field that takes into accountasymmetries and conditions on all sides.Political maturity in Member States is intimatelybound up with how well those States meet theirinternational obligations. Peace  tranquillity  the abilityto cooperate and interdependence are all intertwinedwith how seriously international relations areconducted. The much-quoted third paragraph of thepreamble of the Charter of the United Nations says thatwe  the peoples of the United Nations  are determined“to establish conditions under which justice andrespect for the obligations arising from treatiesand other sources of international law can bemaintained”.Indeed  adherence to the principle of pacta suntservanda and other sources of international obligationsis a factor for building trust among States. Its absenceposes a threat to the Organization’s guiding spirit andto the principles that are its pillars.The President of Mexico  His Excellency Mr.Vicente Fox  has invited the States of the Caribbean toattend a conference to promote the implementation oftheir commitments on maritime limits under the UnitedNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. As a Stateparty to that Convention  my country supports theMexican Government’s initiative. Moreover  on abilateral level  we are pursuing in good faith and inconformity with international law the early conclusionof treaties on maritime limits with our Caribbean Seaneighbours. We applaud the efforts now under wayunder a special process  sponsored by the Organizationof American States  by our neighbours Belize andGuatemala towards a final solution to the century-longterritorial dispute. Such a solution should include  tothe extent possible and with the participation of thethree States directly concerned — Belize  Guatemalaand Honduras — the adoption of stable legalagreements on cooperation in the Gulf of Honduras.39Honduras believes that disputes are an integralpart of inter-State relations. What is alarming is notthat there should be differences between States; rather it is the attitude with which they are approached.Similarly  we note that domestic political concernsshould not be allowed to interfere with shared interestsin subregional integration. To allow our domesticpolitical goals to affect our integration process wouldmean endangering the future of integration itself  andthus the future of the shared interests of the CentralAmerican countries.We have a united Organization  all of whosevarious bodies and specialized agencies are workingever more closely together in pursuit of specificobjectives. This is a time of extraordinary importancefor the international community and hence for theUnited Nations and all of its Member States.Accordingly  we must work ever harder to promote thevalues of peace and human development that we allshare. In this endeavour  all countries  small and large must abide by the guidelines which we  the majority have agreed upon in order to save our planet fromclimate change  whose damaging effects are makingthemselves felt everywhere.At this juncture the Organization should continueand expand its leadership and allow all peacefulinternational players  including the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan  to participate in the joint combat against therenewed threats to peace  security and the welfare of allnations. All of this applies to the international arena.At the national level  organization at the localcommunity level is essential in order to dispeluncertainty  overcome indifference and strengthenhuman solidarity based on reason. This was the caseduring the recent floods along the Atlantic coast ofHonduras. As a result of the preparation and preventionprogrammes promoted by the Administration ofPresident Flores  the loss of life was minimal  andemergency support services operated effectively and ina timely manner. This was because the localcommunities had learned how to prevent most of thedamage caused by such natural phenomena.The lesson is clear: at the national andinternational levels  we must try to organize our workas individuals and as countries and to coordinate thoseefforts in order to reduce our vulnerability in all areas be they environmental  economic  political or security-related  on the basis of the principles of a culture ofpeace  which we have agreed upon together.In a few months’ time  President Flores willconclude his term of office. He will leave behind astable country with transparency restored  the rule oflaw strengthened and a macroeconomic administrationrecognized by the international community — acountry that has recorded positive economic growthdespite having suffered the greatest natural disaster inour history.I conclude this address — the last to be deliveredby the present Government of Honduras in the GeneralAssembly’s general debate — by conveying thegreetings and appreciation of the people of Hondurasand of the Government of President Flores to theinternational community and to all of the peoples whohave stood by us during the most difficult moments ofour history. Those have included  as we will all recall the terrible hurricane of 1998 and its negativeconsequences  which have affected us ever since. WeHondurans have renewed our faith in internationalsolidarity and have grown stronger in our convictionthat the destiny of our nation and of our planet hingeson what we are doing today to build a future for ournations."
"73",3025,"HRV",56,2001,"﻿I wanted to come here and I had to come here. I thought it was necessary toshow that I will not allow those fanatic killers  who4may be secretly lurking right now  to prevent me frompresenting the general views of my country  theRepublic of Croatia  about the current situation in theworld in front of this audience in the United Nations.This year  the general debate is taking place laterthan usual. The terrorist attacks on New York andWashington postponed the scheduled autumn session. Iemphasize the word “postponed”. The terrorists did notmanage to paralyse the United States of America. Theydid not manage to stop the work of the United Nations;nor will the world’s statesmen cancel their visits toNew York and their participation in the work of theGeneral Assembly.Since 11 September  when as if in a nightmare wewere faced with the horror of global terrorism  it hasbeen repeatedly said by many people  including myself that the world is no longer the same. I am here today torepeat this  and also to add a few more words. It is true or at least it seems to be true  that the terrorist attacks which left thousands of deaths behind  have changedeverything. However  the truth is slightly different:much has changed as a result of the attacks  butnothing has changed in the area that made it possiblefor the attacks to be committed.I would therefore like to stress the followingpoints. In order to make sure that the terror experiencedby New York and Washington will not happen again we — I repeat  we — have to change the worldcompletely.Today we live with the threat of global terrorism and the global response to it. With regard to the natureof this first big war of the twenty-first century  I canonly repeat what I recently mentioned in my speech inthe Israeli parliament  the Knesset. This is not a clashof civilizations; this is not a clash of cultures; this isnot a conflict of religions. This is just a confrontationof civilization and non-civilization.I would also like to be very clear about somethingelse. There is no such thing as “our” or “their”terrorism. There is no justified or unjustified terrorism.It is in the nature of terrorism  regardless of whether itis masked by an ideology  religion or war of liberation to kill innocent people — the more  the better.Terrorism is therefore absolutely unacceptable  and thisis why we are fighting against it today.We have created a broad anti-terrorist coalition an alliance of countries not previously known inhistory  which can only be compared to the anti-fascistcoalition at the time of the Second World War. Thisanti-terrorist coalition is almost an alliance of thecivilized world  a defence response of that world to thechallenge and threat of destruction and anarchy. Iwould like to stress two things with respect to theresponse and the circumstances in which it is takingplace.First  today we are not faced with the dilemma ofchoosing between anarchy imposed upon us by theterrorists  on the one hand  and autocracy  which somecould perhaps see as the only efficient response toglobal terrorism on the other. To accept that dilemmawould be fatal for our civilization. The response is  andcan only be  democracy and the rule of law. Thedefence of democracy must not turn it into its veryopposite  even under the conditions of war imposedupon us by the terrorists.Secondly  the establishment of the anti-terroristcoalition represents the beginning of profound and far-reaching changes on the world political scene. I amspeaking about changes in relations between countriesor groups of countries. I am also speaking aboutchanges in the nature and way of functioning ofinternational alliances  such as the North AtlanticTreaty Organization  as well as existing internationalorganizations like the United Nations and thoseorganizations that are just emerging  of which theInternational Criminal Court is one example.However  while we are still combating globalterrorism using our military  political and economicforce and intelligence organizations  we must startlooking for answers to the following questions: What isglobal terrorism and what makes it possible? It is notenough to defeat the terrorists we are faced with today.We have to do everything we can to make sure that weshall not be dealing with new terrorists tomorrow. Thisis the second level of change that needs to be carriedout  but that is not yet being made. I view the situationas follows.It will not be difficult to encourage fanaticbehaviour in both individuals and large groups ofpeople — thus turning them into ruthless killers orterrorists — as long as famine  poverty and non-development are present in large parts of the world and as long as people anywhere suffer from inequalityand the absence of freedom as a result of unresolvedregional crises. I therefore think that we have to change5the world completely  if we do not want our presentfight against global terrorism and our victory over it  ofwhich I have no doubt  to be mere episodes.That might sound too ambitious or even a bitutopian  but I believe it is neither of the two. I am surethat  in addition to the fight against terrorism  there isanother task ahead of us that is no less difficult orresponsible  namely  creating and implementing aglobal strategy for solving accumulated problems oftoday’s world  problems that did not appear onlyyesterday. Many of them have been discussed under thedome of the General Assembly. Many beautiful wordshave been said. It is now time to turn those words intoactions. It is now time for those actions to stop ugly abominable words full of hatred and hostility fromturning into new acts of madness such as the ones wesaw in this city. We have a common interest: life inpeace and safety for all. Let us have a common goal too: a life of dignity for all. Neither can be achievedtomorrow everywhere  but both can be achievedeverywhere.I would like this session of the United NationsGeneral Assembly to reaffirm this world Organizationas an irreplaceable instrument in the struggle for adifferent and better world. I would like this session toshow the political will of all Member States to startseeking together — and finding — in a sincere andcoordinated way  solutions to problems that  in thecontext of the threat of global terrorism  prove to beliterally unavoidable.Let us not forget that in September the terroristsused planes full of passengers in order to kill thousandsof people. The next time they may use chemical biological or  perhaps  even nuclear weapons to killhundreds of thousands of people. Let us also not forgetthat this Organization was founded to “save succeedinggenerations from the scourge of war”. There is no timeto lose. Let us change the world we live in so as to beable to continue to live."
"74",3070,"HTI",56,2001,"﻿On behalfof the President of the Republic of Haiti and of theHaitian delegation  I should like at the outset tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixthsession. You may rest assured of the full support of theHaitian delegation as you carry out your functions.I should also like to pay tribute to yourpredecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri  on the efficacy andtalent he displayed in conducting the work of theMillennium Assembly.Allow me furthermore to offer my warmestcongratulations to Secretary-General Kofi Annan andto the Organization on their receiving the Nobel PeacePrize. Above and beyond any other consideration  thisreflects recognition of the efforts of the Secretary-General and the Organization to promote peace anddevelopment.I also take this opportunity to convey  on behalfof the people and Government of Haiti  our sincerecondolences to the bereaved families  and in particularto the Government and brotherly people of theDominican Republic  following the tragic aeroplaneaccident in Queens  New York  on 12 November.2The Government of the Republic of Haiti firmlycondemns the hateful acts carried out on 11 Septemberin Manhattan  New York  Washington  D.C.  andPennsylvania  which claimed thousands of victims. Onthis occasion  the Government offers its solidarity tothe American people and Government and its supportin the fight against terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations  wherever it may occur and whomeverits perpetrators  victims and promoters may be. Theseinhuman and blind acts  while eliciting grief anddespair  attack the very underpinnings of thedemocratic system and do violence to internationalpeace and security  freedom  human rights and thesearch for well-being and prosperity.The international community already has at itsdisposal 10 conventions  complemented by twoprotocols  addressing terrorism in its variousmanifestations  not to mention two additionalinitiatives under consideration on the issue. Theinternational legal instruments were recentlystrengthened by Security Council resolution 1373(2001)  which provides the major guidelines for ourcommon struggle. We all stand to gain by adhering tointernational legality. In that vein  the HaitianGovernment  notwithstanding its meagre resources  iscommitted to taking the measures necessary to ratifyand implement these relevant legal instruments.These legal instruments are indispensable to ourcommon struggle against this scourge  to be sure  but itis also of the utmost importance that we begin toconsider the social  economic  political and otherfactors that might spawn terrorism. The internationalcommunity  under the auspices of the United Nationsand the banner of tolerance and solidarity  must build agrand coalition against poverty  ignorance  want hunger  social exclusion and marginalization. That taskis more urgent now than ever.It is time for the members of the internationalcommunity to reach a consensus on Security Councilreform. It is necessary to increase the number of theCouncil’s permanent members on the basis of bettergeographic distribution. We must undertake an in-depthre-evaluation of the right of veto  the current form ofwhich is barely relevant to international relations andthe exigencies of the democratic imperative. We mustalso institutionalize transparency in the Council’sworking methods and procedures. The achievement ofthese goals will make the Organization more effectiveand strengthen its legitimacy and authority.The Republic of Haiti urges States and peoples inconflict  especially in the Middle East  to embracedialogue in order to find lasting peace.Today  in a world led by financial markets  tradeexchanges and investments of unprecedented scope  anumber of developing countries are being marginalizedfrom world economic developments. We mustrefashion cooperation for development if we wish toreverse their slide into marginalization and extremepoverty. We must  in partnership with the internationalcommunity and all the actors concerned  revise ourstrategies and propose a common approach that willtackle the problem of inequality during the newmillennium.Thus  we are afforded the opportunity toimplement all the commitments undertaken by ourheads of State and Government during the MillenniumSummit. More than 147 heads of State and Governmentsolemnly committed themselves to deliver humanityfrom want  and to make the right to development areality for all. It is incumbent on us to translate thesecommitments into concrete deeds.The benefits of trade for development arerecognized  but it is perhaps still necessary to askourselves if in the context of globalization the leastdeveloped countries do not find themselves in adilemma. How can we seriously speak of free tradewith countries that  for the most part  have little totrade. It is also necessary to increase their productionand export capacities.It is essential that these countries have access tomarkets where they can sell their products. There is the“Everything but arms” initiative of the EuropeanCommission  which we welcome  and we invite ourdeveloping country partners to do the same.The Haitian Government welcomes the holding ofthe Conference on Financing for Development  whichwill take place during the first quarter of 2002 inMonterrey  Mexico. That Conference gives us theopportunity to formulate recommendations on thereorientation of cooperation for development  inparticular concrete measures in the area of debtmanagement  technological cooperation  trade investment and the international financial system. TheHaitian Government also welcomes the organizing ofthe World Summit on Sustainable Development  whichwill take place next September in Johannesburg  andinvites its partners to accept this concept of3partnership  in which the interlocutors hold dialoguesas equals in a framework of mutual respect.My Government reaffirms its faith in ademocratic future for Haiti  and  out of conviction  willdo everything necessary to consolidate and strengthenthe rule of law. Democracy will thus remain one of thepillars of the Haitian Government’s policies.Haiti is now undergoing a crisis situation  whichis the result of an electoral controversy. In fact  afterthe elections of 21 May 2000 for the reconstitution ofthe Chamber of Deputies  more than two thirds of theSenate and all of our local offices  the electoralobserver mission of the Organization of AmericanStates (OAS)  while acknowledging in a report that theelections took place in an acceptable and credible way still uncovered certain irregularities in the way that theabsolute majority required for the election of the eightcandidates to the Senate had been calculated. Whatfollowed was the suspension of internationalassistance  the resumption of which is still conditionalon resolving the post-electoral crisis.As soon as he was elected  and even before hisinauguration  Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristidecommitted himself to the path of dialogue  convincedthat opposition is necessary for the proper functioningof institutions. It was in this context that PresidentAristide’s eight-point letter of December 2000 was sentto the then President of the United States  Mr. WilliamJefferson Clinton. In fact  in his search for a negotiatedsolution  President Aristide encouraged initiatives onthe part of sectors of civil society.In addition  during the participation of the Haitiandelegation at the Quebec Summit  where the memberStates of the OAS took note of the efforts made by theGovernment  our head of State reiterated once again hisdetermination to find a negotiated solution to the crisisin Haiti.Once again  in Costa Rica  during the twenty-firstsession of the OAS General Assembly in June 2001 President Aristide  in a letter to the President of theAssembly made proposals that were incorporated into aresolution adopted by the 34 members of theorganization as recommendations for crisis resolution.Since then  the head of State and the Government ofHaiti have done everything possible to effectivelyimplement these recommendations.The Haitian Government and the politicalorganization Fanmi Lavalas  with a mediation roleplayed the OAS general secretariat  have begunnegotiations with Democratic Convergence  a politicalopposition group  with a view to reaching an agreementin the framework of the commitments made in CostaRica.During those negotiations  various proposals havebeen put forward  particularly: the resignation of theseven senators concerned in the OAS report; theshortening by two years of the term of office of alldeputies; the shortening of the term of office of thesenators elected on 21 May 2000; the putting togetherof a future provisional electoral council; the holding inNovember 2002 of early elections for all of themembers of parliament involved in the points that Ihave just mentioned; and the holding of electionsduring the first quarter of 2003 for the local officeswhose terms will expire in November 2003.President Aristide  the Government and theFanmi Lavalas party have demonstrated muchflexibility in the framework of negotiations.Unfortunately  the Convergence remains intransigentand challenges the wording of the two last points  onthe holding of elections. The Convergence is frozen inits position  called “option zero”  which consists insimply annulling the elections of 21 May 2000. Thus the impasse still exists; international assistance is stillsuspended.Meanwhile  poverty rages in Haiti. The AIDSpandemic  having claimed 260 000 victims  means aloss in terms of the life expectancy of our population which had been painstakingly increased. Maternal andinfant mortality is clearly progressing. The figure of500 out of 100 000 dying in childbirth and the infantmortality rate  which has risen to 61 out of every 1 000births  remain very alarming. Given that children women and men — an entire population — are dyingfor lack of means  of financial resources  would it be anexaggeration to speak of another form of economicterrorism that none dare reveal?Can one justify the link between a contestedmethod of tallying votes and the freeze on financinggiven to my country in the form of loans — loans onwhich we continue  despite everything  to payinterest — especially since we know that the legislativeand local elections of 21 May 2000 were held to fill7 500 vacant posts  that 29 000 candidates took part in4these elections  and that voter participation of 60 percent was the highest since 1990?The Republic of Haiti remains confident of itsdestiny. It appeals to the international community sothat its members will understand that the survival ofthe people cannot be tied only to political manoeuvres.The Haitian Government is committed to a process ofstrengthening institutions and remains open to dialogueand all proposals that do not undermine the dignity ofthe Haitian people. Against this background  wewelcome with satisfaction the letter of the BlackCaucus of the United States Congress  of 9 November2001  addressed to the current President of the UnitedStates  Mr. George W. Bush  which denounces theinflexible policies vis-à-vis Haiti that make economiccooperation dependent on unblocking the politicalprocess.The Government is ready to do everything in itspower to resolve the post-election crisis and put thecountry back on the path of development  but thiscannot be done without the cooperation of theinternational community. To this end  it invites thiscommunity to join it in its daily struggle for survival reconciliation and peace."
"75",3116,"HUN",56,2001,"﻿First  may I congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on hiselection to preside over the fifty-sixth session of theGeneral Assembly. I assure him that he has theHungarian delegation’s full support in the effectivefulfilment of his tasks and high responsibility. At thesame time  I wish to thank Mr. Harri Holkeri for themuch appreciated work that he carried out in hiscapacity as President of the preceding session of theGeneral Assembly.Sixty-three days have elapsed since 11September. More than 80 nations are in mourningtoday  mourning the absurd deaths of their compatriots men and women from all over the world andrepresenting different and various traditions  cultures beliefs and ethnic origins. Approximately 6 000 peopleperished as a result of heinous terrorist attacks in NewYork  Washington  D.C.  and Pennsylvania  and weremember the victims in our prayers and extend ourdeep sympathy and compassion to their families andfriends.These attacks were committed against the entirecivilized world and against fundamental human values.The Security Council and the General Assembly veryquickly took firm and clear measures in order to defendthe universal interests of the international community.To this end  an effective global coalition was created inwhich Hungary  side by side with many other countries is proudly participating. Those who perpetrated andsupported these terrorist attacks are trying to depicttheir acts  as well as the reaction of legitimate self-defence to those acts  as a war of religion. Clearly it isnothing of the sort. There can be no justification forthese acts  nor for any other terrorist activitiesanywhere else. In fact  international terrorism pursuespolitical objectives and is trying to undermine ourmulti-ethnic and multi-concessional world  toexacerbate regional conflict  to pit various cultures oneagainst another and to impose on us by force its ownorder of hatred and fanaticism. The nature of thechallenge with which we are confronted is eminentlystrategic: first  because it calls into question the raisond’être and endangers the very existence of ourcivilization; secondly  because the terrorist network which is organizing against us  has managed to developglobal capacities; and  lastly  because in the war that isdeclared against us  terrorism abides by no legal orderand follows no rules.We can welcome the fact that  on the basis of aconvergence of interests  cooperation among States hasacquired  in the two months following the terribleevent  a dimension that is very promising and entirelynew. But major combat against international terrorismwill certainly not be short. Of course the militaryaction launched against the Taliban regime and theterrorist Al Qaeda organization represent an importantelement  but not the only one  within the framework ofinternational action. Within this struggle  the tasks thatwe have to carry out are complex and multifaceted. Wehave to do our utmost in the political  diplomatic educational  legal  and also financial  humanitarian economic and social areas to make sure that we  in thefinal analysis  emerge victorious from this struggle. Wemust recognize that in this struggle we have toredouble our efforts to promote the rule of law  toreject extremism  intolerance  discrimination andnationalistic tendencies and to intensify the globalwork that has to be accomplished in order to eradicatepoverty and ensure sustainable development. The fightagainst terrorism is part and parcel of the general18framework of this global endeavour within which weare trying to build a better world.The terrorist attacks against the United States willprobably be remembered as a turning point in ourhistory  and also an opening to a new era. What iscertain is that from now on humanity will not be ableto continue in the same way as before. Governmentshave to shoulder major responsibility vis-à-vis thischallenge  which now touches directly upon oureveryday existence. The international communitymanaged to find the most appropriate response bybringing together a coalition unprecedented in inter-State relations  the historic importance of which willcertainly go far beyond our own era. Hungary standsready  within the limit of its capacity  to take an activepart in that coalition.In the present situation  the United Nations iscalled upon to play a role of primary importance  tostrengthen the effectiveness of international action.Through the development of 12 anti-terroristconventions  the United Nations has alreadycontributed very significantly towards the developmentof a common framework of international law in thefight against terrorism. Through the adoption of otherconventions  which are now being prepared  the legalframework will become even more comprehensive andgeneral. However  in order to do that  we must makenew efforts and  given the importance of what is atstake  and the fact that we have common goals  thegroups of countries concerned should display a greaterdegree of flexibility. The United Nations should be ablefully to play its role of enhancing the practicalimplementation of international anti-terroristcooperation.In the wake of the terrorist attacks  a series ofspecific measures were implemented by my country’sGovernment. At the international level we havestrengthened our cooperation  both political and legal in the anti-terrorist area with our allies at NATO andour partners within the European Union (EU). Wedecided also to implement Security Council resolution1373 (2001)  and we will forward to the Committeethat was established under the terms of that resolution adetailed report on the national measures undertaken byHungary to fight terrorism. I should like to recall atthis stage that Hungary is a party to most of theinternational  multilateral conventions againstterrorism.As regards the two most recently passed UnitedNations conventions in this area  let me state that mycountry has just deposited today with the Secretary-General the instrument of ratification for theInternational Convention for the Suppression ofTerrorist Bombings. I should like to announce thatHungary will sign the International Convention for theSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism in theupcoming weeks. We are determined to become a partyto that Convention as quickly as possible  so as tocomplement the Hungarian participation ininternational conventions that are universal in natureand deal with the fight against terrorism. Furthermore my Government recently submitted to Parliament adraft law to strengthen national regulations in the areasof money-laundering and fighting terrorism.Hungary attaches very special importance to thesuccess of the international humanitarian action inAfghanistan. Through the two Hungarian humanitarianorganizations  which traditionally have played a role inthe region  my Government has started to forwardhumanitarian assistance to the refugees and the Afghanpopulation. Such assistance consists of foodstuffs andblankets for about 15 000 people.My Government is very deeply concerned at thedanger represented by the proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction and their means of delivery. Ourcommitment in favour of multilateral control over suchweapons remains unchanged and we participate ininternational efforts aimed at limiting and eliminatingweapons of mass destruction. The tragic events of 11September and the recent anthrax-related incidentsmake us realize the possible dramatic consequences ofthe absence of a reaction by the community of nationsto the challenge presented by weapons of massdestruction  including biological weapons. We thinkthat the strengthening of the Convention on theProhibition of the Development  Production andStockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and ToxinWeapons and on Their Destruction will enable theinternational community to act even more effectivelyagainst the intent to use biological agents for militaryobjectives. The ad hoc group asked to work outmeasures for implementation managed to make notableprogress in the almost seven years of its history  and isvery near agreement. We regret that it could notfinalize its work before the date of the Fifth ReviewConference of the Convention. It is important that theConference should leave aside the divergence of views19with regard to the approach to the modalities of thelong-term strengthening of the Convention  and thatinstead it should underscore the commitmentundertaken by Member States to promote the integrityof the system of the prohibition of biological weapons.In its capacity as Chair of the Fifth ReviewConference  Hungary would like to do its utmost inorder to justify the hopes expressed by Member Statesand public opinion that specific results will emergefrom the Conference. We would like actively tocontribute to making sure that efforts aimed atstrengthening the system of prohibition of biologicalweapons will also continue without interruption afterthe Conference.The Statute of the International Criminal Court isa political and legal document of capital importance. Ittranslates into fact the historic aspiration we have hadthat those who commit the crimes of genocide  warcrimes and crimes against humanity will not be allowedin future to act with impunity. Therefore  we warmlywelcome the ratification of the Rome Statute by arapidly growing number of countries  to datenumbering more than 40. Within this context I wish toannounce here that the Hungarian Parliament  by aresolution that was adopted almost unanimously ratified the Statute on 6 November. The deposition ofthe instrument of ratification will take place in thecourse of this month of November.Hungary is working actively so as to ensure thatthe Court  this very important institution of our era  canstart working in the near future. We should also makeefforts to ensure that it will be universally accepted assoon as possible because only in that way will it beable to be successful in its work and effective in thearea of maintaining peace and international securityand effectively protecting international humanitarianlaw and human rights.Our world has changed and we all have to changewith it. Unfortunately  when I say that I am not sayingthat earlier challenges have disappeared but rather that in addition to the difficulties we already have  we arefacing a new crisis that compels us to thinkstrategically and at the same time be very resolute inour action. The work that we have to carry out istherefore wider and broader and the only choice wehave is to act on the basis of our human values in theinterests of our civilization and future security. TheUnited Nations is part and parcel of that endeavour.The Millennium Declaration speaks of it with greateloquence and the events of 11 September onlystrengthen the message contained therein byunderscoring the crucial nature of the times we live in a crossroads between two centuries and two millennia.We are asked to provide answers to the globalquestions that haunt us and that have been continuouslyplaguing this world. The success or failure of ourefforts to provide such answers will  without anydoubt  affect the quality of life of the whole of thetwenty-first century. It is in this spirit that mydelegation wishes to provide its contribution to thesuccess of the deliberations  held under the very specialcircumstances of the present session of the GeneralAssembly."
"76",3163,"IDN",56,2001,"﻿On behalf of theIndonesian delegation  I am pleased to congratulateyou  Sir  on your election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at the fifty-sixth session. We arepleased that the stewardship of this session has beenentrusted to so capable a diplomat from a fraternalAsian country  with which Indonesia has alwaysenjoyed the most cordial of relations.I wish to preface my statement by expressingonce again  on behalf of the Government and people ofIndonesia  our deepest condolences and sympathy tothe Government and people of the United States withregard to the massive tragedy that they sufferedrecently  and have borne so admirably.Indeed  international terrorism today looms onthe horizon as one of the major threats to human lifeand civilization. The truth  of course  is that multiplethreats and challenges are an inherent and coexistingfeature of inter-State relations. We cannot grapple withthis threat and leave other threats to wreak havoc onthe world. It is the urgent and compelling task of thisworld Organization to address them all  for each ofthem has the potential to destroy a large part  if not all of the human race.The threat of nuclear annihilation is still there. Ithas by no means faded with the demise of the cold war as the campaign for nuclear disarmament remainsstalled. With conventional weapons  mostly small arms wars and other forms of mass violence are beingcarried out in various parts of the world. Thus  wholepopulations — involving millions — are beingdisplaced  maimed or killed  90 percent of whom arecivilians  and the majority of them women  childrenand the elderly.In the Middle East  the killing of innocentPalestinians continues even while Israeli forcespartially withdraw from occupied Palestinian towns.For as long as the inalienable right of the Palestiniansto self-determination is being violated with impunity there can be no lasting peace in that part of the world.In the economic sphere  we have not been able tosolve the basic problem of poverty in spite of the fact4that we have the resources and the technical capabilityto at least wage an effective war against this scourge ofhumankind.The economies of South-East Asia have justbegun to recover from the devastation of a globalfinancial crisis that erupted just a few years ago andalready we are facing the unwelcome prospect of itspossible recurrence. New international architecturesthat would shield vulnerable economies from such acrisis remain a distant dream. The global economicenvironment is simply getting less hospitable to theaspirations of the developing world for growth.Without the resources and technology for sustainabledevelopment  developing countries are rapidly losingtheir natural resources  while the physical environmentof the world continues to deteriorate.To us Indonesians  these global problems becomeeven more poignant as they are replicated in ourcountry and as they impact on the lives of our people.In the financial crisis of 1997-1998  as the rupiaplummeted in value and factories and businesses closeddown  millions lost their jobs and were reduced toabject poverty. Since then  our economy has begun torecover. Last year  Indonesia enjoyed an economicgrowth of some 5 per cent  in contrast to the 13.5 percent contraction that followed the onset of the financialcrisis in 1997. Also  in the year 2000  Indonesiaattained a level of trade that surpassed those achievedbefore the crisis. However  the current global economicdownturn  compounded by the events of 11 September has lowered the expected target for economic growth to3 per cent in 2001.In the face of these realities  we need massivedirect investment flows in order to consolidate ourrecovery and march steadily on the road ofdevelopment. We feel that the situation in Indonesiatoday already merits the confidence of investors  butwe can barely make a good case for this in the light oflingering threats to the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of our Republic.Like many other developing countries — and indeed  some developed countries — Indonesia needsto overcome the problem of graft and corruption in itsbureaucracies and in the corporate sector. Thedeficiencies of our legal system and judiciary and thepast human rights record of our police and militaryestablishment have produced less than optimumconditions for Indonesia’s economic recovery. Theseare daunting challenges  as daunting as the globalproblems that they replicate and reflect.Yet  in confronting these national problems  I donot despair  just as I do not despair in contemplatingthe global challenges and problems of our time. Ibelieve that all these problems  global and national  canbe traced to a single common root — a deficiency inhuman relationships — for wherever there is inequalityand it is not acceptable to the weaker party  there canonly be tension and conflict. Wherever the powerfulcan get away with exploiting the weak  a sense ofoutrage smoulders and there can be neither stability norpeace. Wherever there is injustice and it is notredressed  there arises a culture of vengeance.If the problem is basically an imbalance in humanrelationships  then the solution lies in the rectificationof that imbalance — in the recognition that all humanbeings are of equal worth and have basically equalrights before the law of God and human law. As theyare all equals  each is accountable for what he does toany other and everyone’s common sense of justice issatisfied.This solution is not something I discovered on myway to this forum. It is something that we all haveknown for a very long time now  and we have beencalling it democracy. Against the expectations of manyoutside — and  indeed  within —our own nation overthe past three years  and especially the last six months and in the midst of our financial crisis  Indonesia hasrelentlessly pursued the difficult process of reform anddemocratization. We have been able to managesuccessive transitions of power in a democratic peaceful and constitutional manner.Thus  Indonesia today stands proud as one of thelargest democracies in the world. As a nation with anoverwhelmingly Muslim population  we are the livingrefutation of the erroneous notion that Islam anddemocracy are incompatible. Islam has always stoodfor the equality and fraternity of all human beings andfor the optimum exercise of the human will. If only inthat  we Indonesians have a natural affinity fordemocracy.The challenge for all of us is to ensure thatdemocracy works and that it does actually deliver abetter life for the people. In the case of Indonesia pivotal to this outcome is the recent introduction ofbold and far-reaching measures on the relationshipbetween the central Government and regional5authorities in order to address the legitimate aspirationsof the societies in the region. Likewise  myGovernment has made a democratic response to thechallenge of separatism in Aceh and Irian Jaya.We will sincerely bring redress for theirgrievances. We will meet their legitimate demands byintroducing special autonomy and a greater sharing ofresources  and guarantee respect for their culture andethnic identities. We will not  however  tolerate anyacts of terror or violence for separatist ends against theterritorial integrity and national unity of our Republic.In this regard  Members of this Organization haveextended overwhelming support for Indonesia’sterritorial integrity and national unity  consistent withthe principle of the territorial integrity of Statesenshrined in the United Nations Charter.Through the strict and impartial enforcement ofrecently passed anti-graft laws  we are cleansing ourbureaucracy and corporate sector of the taint of graftand corruption. Through strict and equal application oflaws on economic reform  we assure everyentrepreneur an equal chance in his businessundertakings.We are reforming the legal system and thejudiciary so that every individual stands equal beforethe law  whoever his adversary in litigation may be.Both the police and the military have undergone reformand have proven themselves to be faithful to theConstitution and to the democratic process. They havethe encouragement of my Government and theIndonesian people as they continue reformingthemselves.We will see to it  however  that those who haveperpetrated human rights violations  including thosewho carried out the gross human rights violations inEast Timor in the wake of the popular consultation  arebrought to justice. Thus  immediately after assumingoffice  President Megawati Soekarnoputri signed anamending presidential decree that would enable starting next month  an ad hoc human rights court toadjudicate cases of human rights abuses prior to andfollowing the popular consultation.These are the main lines of our democraticresponse to the many and formidable challenges thatIndonesia must contend with. I have no illusions thatthey will be met without difficulty and occasionalsetbacks  but I have faith in the rightness of workingfor human relationships that are based on the equalityof individual human worth. It is the decent  enlightenedthing to do. I therefore have no doubt that  ultimately these measures will yield sufficiently positive results tomove us forward on the road of development.I am no less confident that the democraticresponse will be just as effective in addressing theglobal challenges of our time. Consider the problem ofarmed conflicts in various parts of the world. The useof violence against other human beings  whethercarried out through nuclear weapons or through smallarms  is an assertion of a view that those others have noequal right to life. That is why violence is escalatingeverywhere and that is why there are terrorists —madmen who regard the lives of innocent people asworthless compared to their political agenda. In ademocratic setting  where everyone is committed toequality and every human life is as precious as anyother  violence cannot thrive  certainly not on amassive scale.If the nuclear disarmament agenda has not beenmoving forward  it is because the nuclear Powers enjoya real advantage over everybody else and those that arenuclear-capable strive to become nuclear Powersthemselves. Inequality thus becomes an incentive fornuclear proliferation. In a democratic setting  thatincentive is not available.The same is true with respect to the endeavours toreform the United Nations  particularly the SecurityCouncil. So long as the present permanent memberssee others as not equal to themselves and act on thatbasis  there will never be equitable representation onthe Council. To say that we are reforming the worldOrganization in order to make it more democratic is toput the cart before the horse. First  let us all embracedemocracy and then it will not be difficult to reformthe United Nations.In the economic sphere  the fundamentalchallenge is simply to create a level playing field forall nations  whether it be in trade or internationalfinancial flows. We may all be paying lip service to thesovereign equality of all nations  but if a reality checkshows that multilateralism is on the wane  that in factmeans that a good number of developed nations do notreally believe that the developing countries thusdeprived are their equals.International financial flows for development willresume  the debt burden of poor countries will be easedand barriers to the exports of developing countries will6be lifted if and when the entire developed worldsincerely regards the developing countries as trueequals  and not as recipients of charity. Since people indeveloping countries  particularly those that are mostvulnerable  are down today  they need a helping handto raise them to a position commensurate with theirdignity as equal human beings. In this regard  a specialcase could be made for the teeming millions in thecountries of Africa  a continent that has already givenso much of itself to the rest of the world.The principle of equality among all human beingsmust be applied as well in the use of natural resourcesand its profound impact on the environment. It wouldbe the cruellest form of inequality if the presentimbalances in the use of resources among nations wereleft unaddressed and if the present generation were touse the earth’s resources and leave nothing to sustainfuture generations of humanity.This yearning for democracy has been with us fora long time. It is the spirit behind every reformmovement  the French and American revolutions andthe struggle of colonized countries for independence Indonesia among them.This is the spirit to which the first generation ofleaders of Asia and Africa gave voice in Bandung in1955. It guided the founding and the growth of theNon-Aligned Movement and brought about the demiseof apartheid.In my region  South-East Asia it gave rise to thebirth and growth of the Association of South-EastAsian Nations (ASEAN)  just as it earlier ushered inthe founding and enlargement of the United Nations. Itis what we need today to reform the United Nations  tomake it a more effective instrument of global peace anddevelopment. It is what we need to translate intoconcrete reality the provisions of the MillenniumDeclaration. And  indeed  the democratic spirit is whatwe need in order to wage an effective struggle againstthe dark forces of international terrorism. Without thatspirit  we can only fail.The best course  therefore  would be to launchcollective action on the basis of the United NationsCharter. For this war against international terrorism tobe able to cover all fronts and to be sustainable andimbued with long-term legitimacy  it is imperative thatthe United Nations play an active and primary role.The global campaign should be complemented at theregional level by coordinated efforts such as thoselaunched by ASEAN just over a week ago. In that way we will ensure that our response to terrorism is ademocratic one.Indonesia has consistently emphasized the role ofthe United Nations in addressing the unfoldingdevelopments in Afghanistan. It therefore welcomesthe adoption yesterday by the Security Council ofresolution 1378 (2001)  for this development representsmanifest recognition of the need to enhance politicaland diplomatic efforts to find a comprehensive solutionto the Afghan crisis. At the same time  however  it isimportant to underline that the role of the UnitedNations can only be to support the efforts of theAfghan people themselves  most notably in theestablishment of a new and transitional administrationthat is broad-based  multi-ethnic and representative ofall the Afghan people. For its part  Indonesia iscommitted to supporting the United Nations in thesenoble endeavours. Indonesia stands ready to contributeto any future peacekeeping operations needed tosupport peace-building in Afghanistan.To my mind there is no question of whether thedemocratic response will work as a way of resolvingthis problem and all the other global problems of ourtime. Nothing else will work. The question is whetherwe are courageous  sincere and enlightened enough toapply it.History  it has been said  is a race betweenenlightenment and catastrophe. Let us becomeenlightened now  before catastrophe overtakes us."
"77",3210,"IND",56,2001,"﻿I congratulate the President on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixthsession. I also take this opportunity to warmlycongratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan and the United Nations on being honoured with theNobel Peace Prize.This session of the General Assembly is beingheld in the shadow of the barbaric terrorist acts of 11September  which dramatically reminded us thatneither distance nor power insulates a State fromterrorism. Such acts represent an arrogant rejection ofthe values of freedom and tolerance  which democraticand pluralistic societies cherish.Even while uniting the nations of the world intheir grief  this terrible tragedy has created theopportunity to fashion a determined global response toterrorism in all its forms and manifestations  whereverit exists and under whatever name.We in India know from our own bitter experiencethat terrorists develop global networks driven byreligious extremism. Their operations are supported bydrug trafficking  money laundering and armssmuggling. Some States follow a policy of sponsoringand sheltering them. Terrorists can only be counteredthrough closely coordinated efforts of the internationalcommunity.Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and1373 (2001) are steps in the right direction  but itrequires the firm political will of the freedom-lovingworld to implement them rigorously. The two crucialelements in this would be strict curbs on sources offinancing for terrorists and denying them safe havensfor training  arming and operation.We must firmly rebuff any ideological  politicalor religious justification for terrorism. We should rejectself-serving arguments seeking to classify terrorismaccording to its root causes  and therefore justifying32terrorist action somewhere while condemning itelsewhere. Those that advance these arguments shouldexplain what the root causes of the brutal acts of 11September were.India supports the current campaign against theterrorist networks in Afghanistan. We hope that itreaches an early and successful conclusion. Thatcountry’s current travails can only end with theestablishment of a broad-based  representative andneutral Government  which would stop the export ofterrorism and extremism. The international communityshould work towards this goal  even while the militarycampaign continues  so that we avoid a politicalvacuum at the end of the campaign.We must recognize that current structures tofacilitate a post-Taliban political settlement areunrepresentative and therefore ineffective. Located asit is in Afghanistan’s neighbourhood  India’s vitalnational interests are affected by developments in it.We also have traditionally close links withAfghanistan. This is the basis for our belief that Indiacan play a useful role in this process.The task of reconstruction in post-conflictAfghanistan also merits the urgent attention of theinternational community. It would require massiveexternal assistance to create an economic situationconducive to the speedy return and rehabilitation of themillions of Afghans who have taken refuge in othercountries of this region. Again India stands ready tojoin international efforts for this.We have already announced relief assistance of amillion tons of wheat  medicines and medicalassistance for needy Afghans within  and outside  thecountry. We have also pledged $100 million to post-conflict Afghanistan for reconstruction. We areprepared to do more.Nearly 6 000 lives were lost on 11 September  butthe global economic downturn in its aftermath will takea far larger human toll  mainly in the developing world.The World Bank has estimated that tens of thousandsmore children will die worldwide and some 10 millionmore people are likely to go below the poverty line of$1 a day. It is pertinent to reflect on these chillingstatistics even as the Ministerial Conference gets underway in Doha to consider World Trade Organization(WTO) issues. Before we embark on any newinitiatives for globalization and sustainabledevelopment  we should recognize that politicalsupport for them will be determined primarily by theimpact of these regimes on poverty.For most developing countries  the UruguayRound has done little for economic growth  whilepoverty levels and income gaps have worsened.Globalization has constrained developing countries inmobilizing public resources for poverty alleviation.That is why public support for the globalization regimehas vanished in developing countries. This is also whywe have argued strongly that implementation issuesshould first be resolved before we try to widen theWTO agenda further. Our public is unwilling to acceptanother post-dated cheque  when an earlier one hasbounced.Similarly  the movement towards sustainabledevelopment has proved a disappointment. Developingcountries are unable to realize fair payments for theirsovereign biodiversity resources and traditionalknowledge. The treaties on climate change andbiodiversity have also failed to activate the anticipatedinvestment and technology transfers to developingcountries. Industrialized countries have not shown thepolitical will to enhance their overseas developmentbudgets. Multilateral development agencies are alsoconstrained in their resources  of which  in any case very little is available on concessional terms.The inevitable conclusion is that for currentregimes of globalization and sustainable developmentto be strengthened  or even to survive  they must be re-engineered to generate large-scale finances for povertyalleviation. The passion for globalization has to betempered by compassion for its victims. Sadly  thisthought has not penetrated into the thinking of thedeveloped economies. Their actions also do not reflectthe realization that there cannot be a sustainable revivalof their own sluggish economies unless theglobalization and sustainable development prioritiesare re-oriented and anchored in the developmentalneeds of two-thirds of the global population.A year ago  I suggested in my speech to theUnited States Congress a comprehensive globaldialogue on development. The aim of such a dialoguewould be to address the highly unstable situation inwhich one-third of the world’s population lives inluxury and condemns the remaining two-thirds topoverty and want. It is a fertile breeding ground forpolitical unrest  economic chaos and social fractures.33India would be happy to coordinate this dialogue with the immediate objective of mobilizing resourcesfor poverty alleviation programmes in developingcountries. A preliminary agenda for the dialogue couldinclude the accelerated liquidation of external debts oflow-income and highly indebted countries; povertyalleviation programmes specifically aimed atdeveloping countries facing financial crises;stabilization of international prices of primarycommodity exports; and  most importantly  welfare anddevelopment programmes for all the world’s needychildren — for their nutrition  health  education andprotection from degrading and hazardous employment.The struggle for equitable development and thewar against poverty are as important as our campaignagainst terrorism and our collective search for security.At a time when an external stimulus has motivated usto unite against terrorism and for security  let ussummon an equally strong inner resolve fordevelopment and poverty alleviation. They are just ascrucial for a global order at peace with itself.This fundamental and seamless linkage betweenpeace  security and development can be recalled in thesage words of the great Indian poet RabindranathTagore:“From now onward  any nation that takes anisolated view of its own interests will runcontrary to the spirit of the New Age  and willknow no peace. From now onward  the anxietythat each country has for its own safety mustembrace the welfare of the whole world.”"
"78",3256,"IRL",56,2001,"﻿I congratulate the Presidenton his election as President of the fifty-sixth session ofthe General Assembly and thank him for his successfulefforts to take forward the work of this Assembly. Mycolleague  Foreign Minister Louis Michel of Belgium has already addressed this General Assembly on behalfof the European Union. Ireland associates itself fullywith his remarks.We meet at a moment of uncertainty. The spectreof war once again casts its shadow across thecontinents. Forty years ago  when addressing theAssembly  President John F. Kennedy warned:Mankind must put an end to war or war will put anend to mankind. Of course  President Kennedy wasaddressing a different world from the one we now livein. The war he feared was a war between two greatpower blocs that would end in assured mutualannihilation.Thankfully  the threat of conflict on such a scaleis now a far more remote prospect  but war and conflictcontinue to cause enormous suffering in many parts ofthe world. This  together with the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction  nuclear  chemical andbiological  means that war and its mutation terrorism  continue to threaten mankind  our lives our liberty and our prosperity.This is simply not acceptable. We  the peoples ofthe United Nations  created  joined and sustained thisOrganization in the determination to save this andsucceeding generations from the scourge of war. Wemust now demonstrate renewed and sustainedcommitment to the realization of this goal.Many speakers in this debate have spoken aboutthe events of 11 September as a defining moment inhistory. During the twentieth century  we faced anumber of such defining moments  the First WorldWar  the Second World War and the fall of the BerlinWall  which heralded the end of the cold war. Thesedefining moments are perhaps best reflected in thepopular phrase found on the lips of men and women ofall races and creeds at such times: Things will neverbe the same again. Out of such defining momentsthere comes the resolve to learn the lessons of history to change the existing order and to make sure thecalamities of the past can never happen again.26In the heat and clarity of the immediate aftermathof such events  expressions of resolve are abundant.And yet  from the examples I have just outlined  it isclear that in the past our resolve has faltered as theimmediate threat receded and that the determinationrequired to tackle the underlying causes and injusticesthat give rise to conflict has proved difficult to sustain.Today the international community is again at acrossroads. If we want a true and lasting victory overinternational terrorism; if we want safety  security andprosperity for our own people and our children  thenwe must act with sustained resolve and sustaineddetermination.Our immediate agenda is clear. Action againstterrorism must be pursued resolutely across a widefront and over a sustained period. In undertaking thisnecessary endeavour  let us be honest and realistic.With retributive justice must come distributive justice.The peace and security which we crave for ourselvesand for future generations will not be secured unlesswe simultaneously tackle the root causes of conflict:injustice  poverty and the abuse of fundamental rightsand freedoms.Too often  multilateral action has beencharacterized as reaction to the outcomes of conflict.Last year's Millennium Declaration confirmed thepublic commitment of the world's leadership toresolving also the root causes of conflict. The UnitedNations was created out of the determination to tackleconflict and its causes. On that basis  let us this weekrecommit and rededicate ourselves to the achievementof the goals and objectives of the United Nations. Asthe Secretary-General pointed out when opening thisgeneral debate  none of the issues that faced us on 10September has become less urgent.We must act more resolutely through the UnitedNations  with sustained commitment and sustaineddetermination  to address this equally urgent agenda.We must implement with determination all SecurityCouncil resolutions. Let us realize and build on thepledges we made at the Millennium Summit. Let usstrive much more effectively to control the spread ofweapons of mass destruction. Let us also improve theworking of this Organization by making it moreefficient  adaptable and coordinated. In the words ofthe Secretary-General this week  let us ensure thatwhen the United Nations acts  only the best is goodenough. Only in this way will the United Nations andits Member States succeed in overcoming the massivechallenges which now confront us.In addressing this comprehensive agenda  wemust not relax our efforts on human rights. ThisOrganization was founded out of a determination toassert human rights  the dignity and worth of thehuman person and the equal rights of men and women.We must not equivocate on any of these principles. Inpursuit of this  Ireland looks forward to the imminentestablishment of the International Criminal Court andappeals for its universal recognition.Violent conflict and internal strife are the realityof daily life in many regions and countries across theworld today  the Middle East  the Great Lakes regionof Africa and many other places  such as Sudan  wherepeople are being killed and maimed. Ireland hasworked hard since joining the Security Council lastJanuary to focus on the need to address these and otherconflicts. We have given particular attention to Africaand to the efforts  frequently African-led  to solve themany conflicts there. We have consistently sought tohighlight the humanitarian aspects of the varioussituations coming before the Council. We wereparticularly gratified during our presidency of theSecurity Council last month to have presided oversubstantial discussions on Somalia and on the UnitedNations support for post-independence East Timor.We remain concerned about the humanitariansituation of the people of Iraq. The Iraqi Governmentcan and must do more within the system set out in theSecurity Council resolutions to meet the humanitarianneeds of its own people. For its part  the SecurityCouncil and its members must redouble their efforts toreach agreement on the outcome of its review of thesanctions regime. But we must not lose sight of thefundamental purpose of the sanctions regime: Iraq mustallow verification that it has met its essentialdisarmament obligations.The Irish Government is grateful to thoseMember States that supported Ireland's membership inthe Security Council. We will continue to strive tovindicate the confidence that you placed in us.The United Nations role in peacekeeping hasbeen at the heart of our collective endeavours now forover 50 years. Ireland has played a proud part inUnited Nations peacekeeping across the continents.This evening  I want to take a moment to thank theIrish soldiers who have served with such distinction27and dedication in Lebanon for the last 23 years. Thelast Irish battalion leaves the United Nations InterimForce in Lebanon tomorrow. The people of Ireland areproud of their service and achievements in the cause ofpeace. I want to pay special tribute to the memory ofthose soldiers who lost their lives in the service ofpeace.Ireland's commitment to United Nationspeacekeeping remains undiminished. We continue toparticipate in about a dozen missions. A newcontingent of our troops will soon begin service withthe United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea.We must equally give priority to achievingsustainable development and meeting the humanitarianchallenges that confront us. The United NationsPopulation Fund's 2001 The State of World Populationreport  published last week  reminds us that half of theworld's 6.1 billion people still exist on less than $2 perday and forecasts that the world population will rise by50 per cent  to 9.3 billion  by the year 2050. Is itacceptable that over 3 billion people are today living intotal and abject poverty  while the developed world isstruggling to come to terms with the problems of over-consumption and environmental pollution? Are weprepared to accept that there could be over 6 billionpeople living in poverty by 2050?Let us see every Government set out itscommitment to reach the target of 0.7 per cent of grossnational product for development assistance within thenext five years. Ireland has already made it clear that itwill deliver on its commitment in this regard and willincrease its overseas development aid budget by over$100 million next year to keep on track towards thistarget. Let us reassess the sustainable debt levels andprovide additional relief to the heavily indebted poorcountries of sub-Saharan Africa  which will suffer themost in the present economic downturn.Let us redouble our efforts to overcome anHIV/AIDS pandemic which is killing over 6.5thousand people every day in Africa and which hasalready orphaned over 9 million children on thatcontinent. The Declaration of Commitment agreed atthe General Assembly special session in June hasestablished the framework and the targets. It now hasto be financed and implemented.Let us work harder together to prevent climatechange from devastating poor and vulnerable countries.We have achieved much already. This isrecognized by the awarding of this year's Nobel PeacePrize jointly to our Organization and to our esteemedSecretary-General  Kofi Annan. I offer my warmestcongratulations and appreciation to Kofi Annan  and toall who serve the United Nations. But the Secretary-General would be the first to emphasize that the awardof the Nobel Peace Prize must be seen not only as arecognition of past achievement  but as an inspirationto renewed commitment and determination.The terrible events of 11 September  which struckmost fiercely at the city of New York  seat of theUnited Nations and melting pot of all races andcreeds  brought home to us all that the collectivesecurity of the international community is only asstrong as its weakest link. As long as a singleGovernment or  in the case of the Taliban  a single defacto administration  is prepared to allow its territory tobe used as a base for terrorist attacks against peopleanywhere on this planet  we can never feel secure.We must confront and defeat the scourge ofinternational terrorism and bring those responsible forthe barbaric acts of 11 September to justice  not out ofa need for revenge  but because the perpetrators ofthese acts are capable of repeating such attacks andmake no secret of their determination to do so. Theycan and must be stopped.Ireland's position has been steadfast and clear: westand with the United States and with the rest of theinternational community in asserting that the barbarismof 11 September cannot be allowed to succeed; that thethreat posed by international terrorism must bepermanently ended; and that there must be a totalcommitment by all Governments to this task  with allthe energy and resources at our disposal.My Government hopes that the military campaignnow under way will achieve its objectives in as short atime frame as possible. Every effort must continue tobe made to avoid civilian casualties  and it is crucialthat the military campaign be accompanied by a visibleand effective humanitarian strategy. The long-sufferingpeople of Afghanistan deserve no less. There must alsobe a concerted international effort  coordinated by theUnited Nations  to assist the people of Afghanistan inestablishing a broad-based Government  representativeof all the ethnic groups which make up the country.This must be accompanied by a comprehensive andgenerous programme of support for the post-military28rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan. Theinternational community must stay engaged once arepresentative Government is established there.In Ireland  we continue to make steady progresswith our own peace process. As representatives will beaware  the British and Irish Governments and thepolitical parties in Northern Ireland successfullynegotiated a comprehensive peace settlement over threeyears ago  known as the Good Friday Agreement. Sincethen  we have worked hard to secure the fullimplementation of this Agreement.Two of the most difficult and sensitive issues wehave had to face were the putting of paramilitaryweapons beyond use and the putting in place of a newbeginning to policing. I am very pleased to be able toinform the Assembly that very considerable progresshas recently been made on both these crucial issues. Asa result  the way is now clear for a sustained committed and enthusiastic implementation of allelements of the Good Friday Agreement.We have learned a lot from our own voyagetowards peace. We have put in place new constitutionaland institutional arrangements  which fully recognizeand respect the legitimacy of both political traditionson the island of Ireland. We have established theprimacy and full relevance of politics in people's livesin Northern Ireland. We do not pretend  of course  thatwe have found a solution that has universalapplication  we know too well how local andindividual conflicts can be. But through our ownprocess of trial and error we have learned lessons andestablished principles that may be useful in resolvingconflicts in other parts of the world. From our ownexperience of peace-building  we enumerate the mostimportant elements of any truly sustainable peaceprocess as follows.There can be no purely military solution. Alasting settlement must always address the root causesof conflict. Compromise is essential. Recognizing thatextremism breeds in the absence of reason  conflictresolution demands that we rehabilitate the concept ofcompromise. In the context of effective politicaldialogue and the peaceful resolution of disputes peacemakers should not regard compromise asrepresenting appeasement or surrender  victory ordefeat. Neither does compromise necessarily requiresplitting the difference between the parties. A lastingagreement must be comprehensive and address allissues of concern  even if the parties might agree todeal with them in different time frames.Those in favour of peace in each community mustwork together  even in the face of hostility from theenemies of the peace process in their own community.They must stick together in adversity. They must avoidexcessive and damaging criticism when mistakes aremade  as they inevitably will be. They must beprepared to face down the enemies of peace together.The international community must support thepeace process in a balanced and objective way. Asuccessful process needs a route map  such as thosealready prepared by Mitchell and Tenet in the contextof the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It also needs amechanism to arbitrate on who is meeting  and who isnot meeting  their commitments under any sucharrangements.Those driving the peace process must rise abovethe politics of the last atrocity. Not doing so  whileunderstandable in terms of domestic opinion  isultimately bereft of vision and hands control overprogress to the enemies of the process. There is aparticularly compelling message here for those chargedwith advancing the peace process in the Middle East. Ifthese elements are present  we believe a peace processcan prosper.As I have already said  there is no one size fitsall solution to conflict. I believe  however  that ifthese principles were to be applied in certain otherconflict situations  they could make a significantcontribution to the achievement of peace and politicalprogress.The world we seek cannot be brought aboutovernight. Building peace  ensuring justice  wideningrespect for fundamental human rights and eliminatingpoverty will take time. We will require stamina determination  inspiration  patience  generosity andcompromise. We have all these qualities in abundanceif only we can find the political will to use them andthe determination  together  to seek new ways forward."
"79",3303,"IRN",56,2001,"﻿At the outset  Sir  I wouldlike to congratulate you on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly. I would also liketo express my appreciation for the wise and persistentefforts of the Secretary-General during the currentcrucial world situation.Human society stepped into the third millenniumwith hopes and expectations. The United Nationsdesignated the last year of the twentieth century as theInternational Year for the Culture of Peace and the firstyear of the twenty-first century as the United NationsYear of Dialogue among Civilizations. Today  however the world faces immense tragedies and grave concerns.One of the most brutal and savage manifestations ofthis was the terrorist attack against the Americanpeople.The decisive  immediate and unequivocal globalcondemnation of the terrorist attacks of 11 Septemberrepresents the emergence of a public attitude andcommon political will all over the world to counterterrorism in all its manifestations  irrespective ofmotives  perpetrators or victims. The Leader of theIslamic Revolution of Iran spoke of the “jihad againstthis evil phenomenon” so as to highlight the genuineview of Islam and the Islamic Revolution vis-à-visterrorism and violence.Immediately after the carnage of 11 September and in the name of the people and Government of theIslamic Republic of Iran  I expressed sympathy with29the American nation and all the victims of that criminalact. And in the first days of the tragedy  in a letter tothe Secretary-General  I underlined that “Terrorism is the common problem of today’sworld. It threatens peace  liberty  spirituality knowledge  culture and global coexistence. Asustainable solution to this hideous and dangerousphenomenon requires vision  serious political willand active participation and cooperation of allmembers of the human society.”The threat of terrorism should not beunderestimated  nor should its devastatingconsequences be measured only in the visible realm ofpolitics. Terrorism is the chronic menace of our era rooted in the mentality of violence  the logic of mightand the practice of injustice and discrimination. Whenspirituality  ethics and justice find no room in therealms of politics  economics and culture  and whendiscrimination  marginalization  exclusion and theapplication of double standards push justice aside  theworld is bound to face alienation  despair  extremismand lawlessness. In such a climate  terrorism findsfertile ground for growth.The disaster in the United States is so tragic andgrave that thinkers are urgently called on to engage indeep reflection and dialogue on its real causes. Formany years  our great thinkers have cautioned us toavoid submission to instrumental reasoning  warning ofthe threats and tragedies that it could generate.On the other hand  some of the great thinkers ofour time have ascribed atrocities such as fascism to thereign of mythological speculation. They have attributedthe emergence of fascism not to the expansion ofrationality but to evading rationality and succumbing tothe reign of myth.This does not mean that we will succumb tomythical speculation if we do not want to. We have thechoice not to negate rationality. But at the same time we must also combine rationality with empathy  themind with the heart. Neither one can be without theother. Neither one can be neglected. If it is  it will leadto tragedy  no matter under what pretext  religion  race nationalism or any other nation. The same mythicalspeculation is seen in modern cult ideology  which is aform of rationality that is reduced to instrumentalreasoning and thereby stripped of all its moral andhuman aspects. Religion  tradition  philosophy and artdescend to achieving only one goal  that of politicalends.One of the most common features of theseideologies  which is regrettably prevalent  is theglorification of the self and the demonization ofopposing groups and ideas. The advocates of thisideology in the West attribute to Islam  the religion ofhumanity  compassion and justice  such labels asterrorism. In the same manner  in parts of the Islamicworld  the West is equated with suppression. Suchpolarization of the world and human beings would leadto horrifying political and security consequences forthe whole world.The world has yet to overcome the horror anddisbelief caused by the malicious terrorist attacks of 11September against thousands of innocent people. At thesame time  the most destructive modern weapons arebeing used in one of the most deprived parts of theworld against an oppressed and dispossessed people.Once again  history repeats its sad experience that wartriggers war.The time is ripe for us to analyse the history andconsequences of exclusionary ways of acting  toinitiate ways to engage intellectuals from differentcultures in dialogue and to encourage the public toembark upon learning for the sake of dialogue anddialogue for the sake of learning and to reinforce theart of listening as sacred and invaluable.Angry politicians should be prevented fromtaking the initiative in ongoing developments. Theyshould be made to yield to the judgement of wisdomand fairness.The American nation has experienced one of themost brutal forms of terrorism  in which the blindhatred of terrorists has prevented the recovery of thebodies of the victims of the 11 September tragedy.Today  other nations walk hand in hand with theAmerican nation.Today  beyond mere rhetoric  one can see theconvergence of the ideas of the peoples of the UnitedStates and Iran  who have also experienced  in earliertimes  the mute but brutal massacre resulting from theuse of chemical weapons. This convergence of ideascan also be discerned among all those refugees anddisplaced persons who are victims of war  suppressionand terrorism — including State and non-Stateterrorism — in Afghanistan and Palestine.30We must have empathy for the suffering of peopleeverywhere: in occupied Palestine  oppressedAfghanistan  New York  Washington or any corner ofthe globe.We shall rise to the challenge of promoting peace security and development among all nations on thebasis of justice  and we believe that in today’sinterconnected world  we cannot live in islands ofprosperity and progress while the rest of the worldsuffers from increasing poverty  illiteracy  disease andinsecurity. Acquiescing to any act of terrorism anywhere in the world  is inconsistent with anyreligious or ethical principle. Likewise  resorting toviolence and revenge to counter such acts could hardlybe justified because of ethical and humaneconsiderations. Lacing the sacred realm of religionwith violence and terror is a grave disservice to allreligions and their followers. The divine religions callfor peace  tolerance and compassion. Theyunequivocally repudiate — in essence and appearance— any thought or act of violence. I would like to quotethe late leader of the Islamic revolution  ImamKhomeini  who said that “as followers of Islam  wealways oppose war and desire peace and tranquillityamong all States.”Let us accept that no country in the world isimmune to terrorism. We should therefore seeksolutions at the highest possible level.Today there is unprecedented momentum in theworld for combating terrorism  which should not belost. To this end  the United Nations can arrange andguide a genuine and legitimate endeavour in theinternational fight against terrorism. The IslamicRepublic of Iran is an active partner in this globalcoalition and spares no effort for the success of theinternational community in uprooting terrorism throughviable  just and non-discriminatory measures. Byarticulating a comprehensive definition of terrorism the United Nations can overcome one of the majorhistorical hurdles to avoiding further misuse of thatterm. The adoption of Security Council resolution 1373(2001) and its effective implementation by all Statescan be considered a first step for a coordinatedinternational campaign against terrorism. Moreover negotiations on the draft comprehensive convention onterrorism  based on internationally accepted definitionsand principles  would provide an effective basis forcollective measures in this respect.The 11 September attack indicated that thedivision between centre and periphery can no longerdefine the security order of the world today  for eventhe most marginalized sectors might be able to inflictblows on the biggest Powers. This development hastaken on all the more threatening dimensions in thelight of the emergence of the dangerous phenomenonof bioterrorism.The conflict-stricken regions of the world requireurgent and comprehensive attention. After decades ofwar  insecurity and destruction  Afghanistan needsorder  law  security and stability. The ongoing militaryoperation in Afghanistan cannot  while inflictingdestruction and casualties  address the root causes ofthe kind of terrorism that has been forced on thedefenceless people of that country. On the contrary: itis more likely that the continuation of the currentmilitary approach could incite sentiments that intensifyintolerance and violence in the region and the wholeworld.In the midst of the global terrorism crisis  theworld faces an intensive and severe kind of terrorism inthe Middle East. The occupation of the Palestinianterritories  the expulsion of the Palestinian people fromtheir homeland  the Judaization of Palestine — inparticular Al-Quds Al-Sharif — the building of illegalsettlements  the killing and terrorizing of defencelessPalestinian civilians in their homeland  and thedestruction of historical sites  civil institutions andresidential areas are all examples of this phenomenon.I would also like to underscore  on behalf of theGroup of 77  the significance of poverty alleviationworldwide and the need for the support of the UnitedNations. Poverty breeds violence and intolerance. Therecent slowdown in world economic growth anddevelopment caused by the terrorist attacks furtheraggravates the economic hardships of the developingcountries.For a secure and hopeful life  the world thereforeneeds innovative approaches and collective measures.Let us therefore build a coalition for peace instead ofwar and hostility. The initiative of dialogue amongcivilizations is a step in this direction  and it offers anew paradigm of interaction among nations andcultures in a world that longs for peace and security.Can the United Nations take the lead in devisinga programme to implement this fair and reasonableapproach and become the focus of a global coalition for31peace based on justice? I have every confidence in thewisdom and the will of the Secretary-General —illustrated  inter alia  by the publication of a book entitled Crossing the Divide — to define a newparadigm of dialogue among civilizations. Worldpublic opinion is supportive of this proposal. Theadoption of the Global Agenda for Dialogue amongCivilizations yesterday represents a beginning for thecrystallization of this common desire and will of theglobal community.The achievements of the thirty-first UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization (UNESCO) General Conference inestablishing dialogue among civilizations as one of itsstrategic objectives and in adopting the UniversalDeclaration on Cultural Diversity represent yet anotherserious indication of this global trend  and I wish topay tribute to UNESCO and its Director-General. Willpoliticians and statesmen also submit to this approach to prevent the transformation of the clash among Statesinto a clash among civilizations? I am hopeful; thefuture will be the judge."
"80",3350,"IRQ",56,2001,"﻿I am glad toextend to you  Sir  my congratulations on your electionto the presidency of the General Assembly at thisimportant session. We are fully confident that you willguide its work to complete success. I am also pleasedto congratulate the Secretary General  Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-election to a second term of office.This session of the General Assembly acquiresspecial importance given that it is being held at a timewhen the international family is facing increasinglyserious problems. The deterioration of the internationalpolitical and economic environment has reached analarming point  threatening the very core of theindividual and collective security of the Member Statesand the future of humanity as a whole.Instability in international relations has increasedas a result of the unilateral management ofinternational affairs on the basis of the law of bruteforce. There has been a proliferation of suchphenomena as the unilateral use of force  infringementof international law and the Charter  politicalblackmail  blockades and violation of peoples’ rights todetermine their own political  economic and socialchoices. The suffering of the peoples of developingcountries has increased as a result of the lack ofeconomic and social development and the widespreadtendencies among wealthy nations to impose theireconomic hegemony and technical and scientificblockades under the guise of globalization. Attemptsare increasing to impose certain cultures on the peoplesof the world  heaping scorn on their religious beliefs creeds and political and social choices and preachingthe clash of civilizations and the launching of newcrusades.It was in these circumstances that the events of 11September took place in the United States  with all theensuing suffering and victims. While we have offeredour sincere condolences to the American people andthe families of the innocent victims of these events Iraq has expressed its hope that the United States willdeal with these events in a spirit of wisdom andresponsibility by undertaking a comprehensive reviewof its policies towards other peoples and States with aview to finding ways to ensure security  stability andpeace for the people of the United States and for all thepeoples of the world.The United States  however  has once againresorted to the logic of brute force; hence its aggressionagainst Afghanistan. Then came the use of biologicalmaterials in subversive operations  whose source according to American authorities  is most likely to befound in the United States. All this was accompaniedby Western media campaigns intended to kindlefeelings of rancour  hatred and chauvinism and to stokethe fires of war and aggression in the world. Thisconfirms that the present world order is extremelyfragile and that the fires of any conflagration anywherecould spread to the whole world. Indeed  wide as it is the world could be set on fire by a spark coming fromthe West. The world needs to save itself from fallinginto an abyss  to which it is being pushed by policiesthat have their roots in hubris  arrogance  injustice and20aggression. The world needs justice based on fairness;it should not use force on the basis of power andadvantage. Perceiving the dangers to which the worldis being exposed  our leader President Saddam Husseinof the Republic of Iraq has called for acting wisely andreasonably to spare humanity the scourges ofvengeance  war  rancour and hatred. On 29 October2001  he launched an initiative calling for the world tocooperate  on the basis of a global agreement  to riditself of the burden and dangers of weapons of massdestruction  beginning with the huge arsenal of suchweapons stockpiled primarily in the United States andsecondarily in the Zionist entity. In his initiative President Saddam Hussein emphasized that “When the United States begins to divest itself ofits weapons of mass destruction with the rest ofthe world following suit  the United States willfind its way to the paths of wisdom. The worldwill treat it with respect and love after sensing therespect and love coming from it. The world including the United States  will then have peace rather than stand at the brink of the abyss.”From this rostrum we call for reason  wisdom andthe rule of law to prevail over impetuosity  recklessnessand the law of brute force. We stress the importance ofproceeding with a comprehensive objective effort to ridthe world of all weapons of mass destruction and to setup a just and equitable international order in which allcan enjoy peace  security and prosperity. It is now clearthat the current discriminatory theories of non-proliferation and the mindset of drawing a distinctionbetween safe and unsafe possession of weapons ofmass destruction will not lead to a lessening of thedangers to the world  but instead to the exact opposite.Iraq has suffered and continues to sufferaggression and terrorism. Its leaders  officials andnationals have been subjected to numerous terroristattempts on their lives. Its towns and villages havebeen the targets of many acts of terrorism at the handsof terrorist infiltrators coming from across the border who are sponsored  trained  financed and armed withinthe framework of State terrorism.The Iraqi nuclear reactor devoted to peacefulpurposes was the target of a terrorist attack bywarplanes of the Zionist entity in 1981. Iraq’s townsand villages and economic  scientific and culturalfacilities were also systematically targeted anddestroyed in the course of the aggression launched bythe United States and the United Kingdom and theirallies in 1991 and in the five large-scale attacks thatfollowed in 1993  1996  1998 and 2001. Furthermore for 11 years now Iraq has suffered comprehensivesanctions that have deprived its people and that have sofar claimed the lives of 1.6 million civilians  themajority of whom are children and the elderly. Both theaggression and the comprehensive sanctions constitutesystematic State terrorism directed against an entirepeople.The daily aggression launched by aircraft of theUnited States and the United Kingdom against Iraqitowns and villages within the so-called no-fly zonesimposed by these two States on the basis of a unilateraland illegal decision taken in flagrant violation of theCharter of the United Nations and international law isalso State terrorism. We must also mention theexplosions carried out in certain Iraqi border areas byelements of mercenary infiltrators  who are financed armed and harboured by certain States  including theUnited States  which openly spends tens of millions ofdollars on mercenary bands for the purpose of carryingout terrorist operations in Iraq under the so-called IraqLiberation Act. The term “terrorism” also applies to theuse by the United States and the United Kingdom ofmore than 300 tons of depleted uranium ammunitionagainst the people of Iraq in 1991. Through the ensuingtoxic radiological effects  this has led to an increase inthe number of embryonic deformities  a tenfoldincrease in cancer cases and pollution of theenvironment of the region for many generations tocome.All these and other acts that violate the principlesof international law are acts of terrorism. In the face ofthese acts of terrorism and aggression  Iraq has mademany sacrifices in defence of its sovereignty independence  dignity and national choices. The bravepeople of Iraq are more determined today than at anytime in the past. They take pride in and cherish theirnational leadership  holding fast to their sovereignty dignity and national and regional interests  defendingtheir independence and political choices and defyingall the evil intentions that stand behind the aggressionand acts of terrorism directed against them.The fact that Iraq is a victim of internationalterrorism has made it one of the first countries to callfor combating terrorism. Iraqi national legislationprovides for harsher punishment for terrorist acts. Iraqhas signed and ratified most international conventions21in force against terrorism. Iraq believes that  in order toconfront international terrorism  including Stateterrorism  it is necessary to initiate  under the umbrellaof the United Nations  an international effort to reachagreement on a definition of terrorism and on ways tocombat it  in accordance with international law and theCharter of the United Nations.Iraq is prepared to participate actively in such aninternational effort to combat terrorism in all its forms whether perpetrated by individuals  groups or States.Here  it is necessary to emphasize the natural inalienable right of all peoples to defend theirsovereignty  independence and territorial integrity  aswell as to struggle against all forms of terrorism including foreign occupation  colonialist control andaggression in all its military and economic forms intervention in the internal affairs of States and theinstigation and financing of ethnic and religiousconflicts among peoples of the world. All these rightsare embodied in the Charter of the United Nations andinternational law.In discussing the question of reforming thecurrent unsound state of international relations  wemust point out the need to reform internationalmechanisms  foremost among which is the SecurityCouncil  to which the Member States of the UnitedNations have entrusted the primary responsibility ofmaintaining international peace and security.The practices of the Security Council  especiallyin the last 11 years  have made it clear that the Councilis no longer true to its role as specified by the Charter;that it has become a tool for implementing the policiesof one single State; and that it now stands as a glaringmodel practitioner of double standards. Suffice it tocite  as just one example among many  the fact that thecomprehensive sanctions imposed by the Council onIraq constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter andthe mandate of the Council. This was admitted by theUnited Nations itself  as stated in the report entitled“The right to food”  submitted under cover of theSecretary-General’s note of 23 July 2001  in which theSpecial Rapporteur of the Commission on HumanRights on the right to food said:“There can be little doubt that subjecting the Iraqipeople to a harsh economic embargo since 1991has placed the United Nations in a clear violationof the obligation to respect the right to food ofpeople in Iraq.” (A/56/210  para. 56)Likewise  the expert of the Subcommission on thePromotion and Protection of Human Rights had this tosay on the subject in a report dated 21 June 2000:“The sanctions regime against Iraq isunequivocally illegal under existing internationalhumanitarian law and human rights law. Somewould go as far as making a charge of genocide.”(E/CN.4/Sub.2/2000/33  para. 71)We therefore call for a comprehensive reform ofthe Security Council that would lead to the expansionof its membership and to the reform of its methods ofwork  with specific reference to its decision-makingprocess  so as to ensure full respect by the Council forthe purposes and principles of the Charter and theprinciple of democracy in international relations.It has also become necessary to establish amechanism for judicial review that would rule on thelegality and constitutionality of Security Councilresolutions in order to ensure that they are consistentwith the purposes and principles of the Charter of theUnited Nations and with international law. We believethat Member States should be able to resort to theInternational Court of Justice to appeal resolutions ofthe Security Council which these States consider asinvolving infringement on the principles of the Charterand international law.Thus we will be able to remedy this flagrantdeviation from all democratic  judicial and legal normsand principles in the work and mandate of the SecurityCouncil.Pending the completion of the process ofreforming the Security Council and of ensuring that itplays its role in conformity with the Charter  StatesMembers of the United Nations should reconsider theirauthorization to the Council to act on their behalf in themaintenance of international peace and security  sincethe Council has abused that authorization. There is nomore obvious case in this regard than that of thecomprehensive sanctions imposed on Iraq. No just-thinking State can afford to remain a spectator when itsees the authorization it granted to the Security Councilbeing used to annihilate the people of Iraq.It is the legal and moral obligation of all Statesthat respect international law and the Charter of theUnited Nations to declare that they are not parties tothis crime and that they did not authorize the SecurityCouncil to kill the children of Iraq in their name. The22comprehensive sanctions imposed on Iraq haveinflicted enormous damage on the interests of aconsiderable number of the countries of the world  andthese countries are called upon to put a stop to theseillegal acts and to restore their trade relations with Iraq in implementation of Article 50 of the Charter.The organized terrorism to which the people ofPalestine are being subjected by the Zionist entity  thefounder and primary source of terrorism  can be seen inthe bombing of towns  villages  camps and Islamic andChristian houses of worship  as well as in politicalassassinations  imposition of collective punishments occupation of Muslim holy sites  use of depleteduranium ammunitions and poison gases  bulldozing offarms and confiscation of lands.This organized terrorism calls for a reaction onthe part of the international community that iscommensurate with the gravity of these genocidalpractices against a whole people. Similarly  thesystematic destruction to which the Afghan people arebeing subjected at the hands of the American militarymachine is an illegal unilateral use of force and shouldcome to an end. I should like to refer here to theSecretary-General’s 1999 annual report on the work ofthe Organization  in which he stated that“enforcement actions without Security Councilauthorization threaten the very core of theinternational security system founded on theCharter of the United Nations” (A/54/1  para. 66).We demand an end to this interference in theinternal affairs of Afghanistan. The Afghan peopleshould be able to make their own political choices  inconformity with their national interests and withoutany external interference  under whatever pretext.The United Nations was founded for the purposeof achieving security  peace and stability  so that socialand economic progress for all peoples might bepromoted by a number of means  including avoidanceof wars and conflicts. But today two thirds of thepopulation of the world suffer from underdevelopmentand live in misery  while the few live in prosperity.What is required is to reactivate the role of the UnitedNations in the search for a balanced internationaleconomic policy that will lead to greater equalityamong peoples and States  lessen the intensity ofpolitical conflicts and feelings of frustration  engage allas partners in building the world economy  promotehuman rights and fundamental freedoms  and bringabout a better life for peoples.Efforts to reform the international politicalenvironment will not meet with success if they are notaccompanied by efforts to reform the economicenvironment with a view to extending prosperity to allhumankind. We must remember that the vast resourceswith which God Almighty has favoured our planetEarth are sufficient to enable us to achieve prosperity security and stability for all. What we need is theconviction that all human beings are equal in terms oftheir worth  and we must work hard to avert  and put anend to  all policies and actions that violate this truthand cause upheavals in international relations."
"81",3397,"ISL",56,2001,"﻿Once again  we havewitnessed a terrible incident in the neighbourhood ofthe United Nations here in New York. Although we donot know the circumstances  we are shocked  and it isclear that many have lost their lives. I express mysincere condolences to all those who have lost theirloved ones in this tragic incident.20Allow me to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo onhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly.I am confident that he will guide us wisely through thecomplex tasks ahead of us in this session.The ability of the United Nations to act swiftly inresponse to acute crisis was seriously tested followingthe terrorist attacks on the United States. During thesetrying times  it has been valuable to have at the helm aSecretary-General who enjoys such wide support.Let me congratulate the Secretary-General andthe United Nations on being awarded the Nobel PeacePrize — in my view  a well-deserved recognition ofKofi Annan’s leadership and of the dedication he andhis staff have put into upholding the purposes andprinciples of the United Nations Charter. Hopefully  theaward will serve as an inspiration as well as strengthenworldwide support for the United Nations and what itstands for.The tragic events of 11 September have radicallychallenged and changed our security environment.Fighting terrorism should therefore become a priorityof the United Nations. We recognize that the UnitedNations has long been active in the fight againstinternational terrorism  but we now need to go beyondpolitical statements and become truly operational. Thismeans developing new methods and  at the same time making full use of all the means at the disposal of theUnited Nations system  the truly global character of theOrganization and the numerous international legalinstruments available to us.Iceland strongly supports the creation of acomprehensive convention on international terrorismand hopes that an agreement can be reached on such aninstrument during the fifty-sixth session. Otherwise  wewill lose the opportunity to develop the coherentstrategy lacking today. We cannot fail to react.The key role the United Nations should play infighting international terrorism must be an impetus tous to intensify our efforts to achieve a comprehensivereform of the Security Council in all its aspects.Iceland is seriously concerned about the slow progressmade towards reaching this goal. It is essential andtimely that the membership of the Council becomesmore representative  and thus more likely to sustain thepresent international coalition in the fight againstterrorism. It goes without saying that the efficiency ofthe Council must be secured. Enhancing transparencyin the decision-making process is also of importance especially for non-member States.One of the main purposes of the United Nations isto promote and encourage respect for human rights andfundamental freedoms for all without distinction as torace  sex  language or religion. This continues to be ofthe utmost importance. Let me therefore make itabsolutely clear that the fight against terrorism is not and must not become  a fight against any religious orethnic group. We must avoid all forms ofdiscrimination  xenophobia and intolerance. Mostimportantly  we must at all times adhere to the basicvalues of human rights  freedom and democracy.Turning to the actions at the national level Iceland is taking the necessary steps to ratify allrelevant United Nations conventions against terrorismthat we have not already ratified. Furthermore  Icelandhas implemented all relevant Security Councilresolutions  including resolution 1373 (2001). But infighting the menace of international terrorism — afight that we all agree needs to be both wide-rangingand forceful — we must  at the end of the day  not inany way undermine the basic values of our societies —those of human rights  the rule of law  and democracy.We need to strike a balance between freedom and thesecurity measures we opt for.Uprooting terrorism in the world must go hand inhand with solving regional conflicts that threateninternational peace and security. This is particularlytrue for the Middle East. By prolonging the violenceand refusing to negotiate  both sides play into thehands of extremist elements that want neither acontinuation of the peace process nor a politicalsolution to the Middle East conflict. Both parties haveto resume negotiations unconditionally. That is the onlyway to secure lasting peace in the region  which shouldbe based upon the establishment of a viable anddemocratic Palestinian State and on the right of theIsraelis to live in peace and security withininternationally recognized borders. A continuation ofthe present dire conditions cannot be tolerated anylonger.I said earlier that the events of 11 September havemade United Nations reforms even more urgent. Thesame is true for the ongoing work to strengthen thepeacekeeping capabilities of the United Nations. Untilnow  Iceland’s participation in United Nationspeacekeeping operations has been modest. My country21has participated in peacekeeping by providing civilianpersonnel such as gender experts and police and healthprofessionals. With the changing and more complexnature of peacekeeping  the need for civilian personnelhas been increased. The Icelandic Government decidedlast year systematically to increase its contribution topeacekeeping. Our aim is to provide more personnel tothe United Nations  as well as to the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the EuropeanUnion.By adopting resolution 1325 (2000) last year  onwomen  peace and security  the Security Councilrecognized the importance of incorporating a genderperspective into peacekeeping operations. When theUnited Nations becomes involved in peace-buildingand reconstruction in Afghanistan we have to makesure that resolution 1325 (2000) is honoured in theprocess  for the benefit of Afghan women and  as aresult  for the Afghan population as a whole. TheUnited Nations must play a key role in the nation-building process in Afghanistan. Iceland stands readyto contribute civilian experts should the United Nationsbecome involved in a post-conflict operation.Next year  10 years will have passed since worldleaders met at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Weare asked  what has been accomplished in this pastdecade to secure the prosperity of future generations inharmony with nature? The truth is that there has beenrather little progress and that we face enormous tasks.The world community will look towards the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development  in Johannesburg for further commitments by all nations.In that context  I would like to quote Secretary-General Kofi Annan  who in his opening remarks at the44th meeting  last Saturday  said“We must put the issue of sustainability where itbelongs  in the centre of the policy-makingprocess.”It is therefore imperative that we renew our strongcommitment to sustainable development at theJohannesburg Summit. We are faced with newchallenges  but also with new opportunities  namely  tobuild a global partnership to harness the forces ofglobalization in favour of sustainable development.The world community has just achieved  inMarrakech  a milestone agreement on theimplementation of the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyotonegotiations have been especially difficult. Now wehave reached the moment when we can bring theProtocol into force. But more needs to be done toinclude other key emitters of greenhouse gases in thebattle against climate change.In the area of oceans — the foundation of humanlife — we have made some progress. We have adoptedsignificant agreements  and we are looking at ways toimprove the assessment of the state of the oceans inorder to further enhance marine protection andmanagement. New knowledge and new approaches arealso evolving  thus providing the world communitywith opportunities to improve protection of the oceansand the sustainable use of their living resources.Last October  Iceland  in cooperation with theFood and Agriculture Organization of the UnitedNations and Norway  hosted the Reykjavik Conferenceon Responsible Fisheries in the Marine Ecosystem. In adocument adopted by the Conference  States declaredthat they would incorporate ecosystem considerationsinto fisheries management with the aim of reinforcingresponsible and sustainable fisheries in the marineecosystem. This Reykjavik Declaration is a landmarkcontribution of the fisheries nations to the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development. We trust that wewill see the spirit of the Declaration reflected in theresults of the World Summit in Johannesburg.The time has come for a unified effort by politicalleaders  as well as by civil society and the privatesector  to reverse the trend of marginalization andunderdevelopment. That is why the InternationalConference on Financing for Development  to be heldin Mexico next year  offers an unprecedentedopportunity to make a real difference in the lives ofmillions of people throughout the developing world.The outcome of the Conference should focus on thegreat challenge of poverty eradication  as well as onhow responsibilities between the developed anddeveloping countries should be shared. We should however  never lose sight of each State’s primaryresponsibility for its own development. The importanceof responsible national governance and respect forhuman rights cannot be overstated.My focus  like that of many speakers before me has been on the fight against international terrorism.Fighting international terrorism involves all States andinternational as well as regional organizations. We22must concentrate on the available instruments of eachorganization and find ways to adjust them as necessary.Furthermore  we need to ensure consistency andcomplementarity of international efforts.The malicious acts of 11 September and the latestshocking news of the suspicion of biological terrorismdemonstrate that all of our concerted efforts are notonly necessary but also crucial to fulfilling our duty toprotect the lives of our citizens.The United Nations was founded to preservepeace and to work for a better world. Terrorists arefighting against everything the United Nations standsfor. Fighting against them means fighting for theUnited Nations  for the future of our civilization andfor all humankind."
"82",3444,"ISR",56,2001,"﻿First of all  I would really liketo congratulate you  Sir  on your election as Presidentof the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Iknow that you bring with you a wealth of experience  abreadth of understanding and hope for many people. Iwould also like to express my highest regard for9Secretary-General Kofi Annan on his well-deservedrecognition as Nobel Prize Laureate for his fresh ideasand great vision on how to meet a new world with anopen mind  a sense of unity and hope.There is hidden light and needed hope in thisgathering to overturn the darkness that has descendedupon us. There is enough strength and resolve in themidst of civilized nations to deflect evil.Humanity woke up happy to welcome the twenty-first century. We turned around and looked  and therewas brightness and freshness in the air. We haddeparted from a traditional history that was writtenwith red ink — wars  skirmishes  conflicts andmurders — many of which arose because humanexistence was dependent upon land and naturalresources. We have had to protect our own lands.Modern science emerged to supersede land opening new horizons of limitless opportunities.Science rendered borders marginal  and old prejudicesand distances began to dissipate from our minds.Technology created a new interdependence. No longerwere our connections dependent upon land or sea —upon distance. Air became the new means ofcommunication for nations  peoples  businesses anddevelopment. High technology introduced newpromises and recalled the importance of old values.The perception was that every person irrespective of location  race  religion or sex  couldreach new heights. And then we learned that hightechnology is not just a technical matter. We cannotseparate technology from values; it is impossible.For example  you cannot combine lies andscience. You cannot lie scientifically. To have ascience-based economy  you have to pursue peaceuncompromisingly and openness uninterruptedly.Science requires an open society; it demands constantdialogue. You cannot have new innovations withoutunrestricted research. You cannot have unrestrictedresearch without being a free society. You cannotdevelop a scientific economy without makingeducation a top priority  available and accessible to allpeople. You cannot attract investment unless you havetransparency.In a competitive world  to keep young scientistsyour land and water should be free from pollution  yourfinancial system free from corruption  your governmentwithout arbitrariness. Truth  freedom and opennessbecame conditions for science and high technologyand  consequently  for the advancement of any society.It is true that the world is still divided betweenthe haves and the have nots. But for the have nots  anew option is that of becoming connected to the newage and the more developed aspects of our times.There had been a new beginning  but like manybeginnings  one mixed with shadows and revolt. Theshadows were not yet heavy; at the beginning theylooked pale and distant. So we felt like one promisedworld  like one assembly. The economy was no longernational; it became global — open to every nation. Andsince we could not form a global government  thenational Governments agreed that the global economywould be managed by private enterprises — hence privatization. Globalization decreased the importanceof traditional States and increased the importance ofnon-governmental organizations and worldwideconnections. It looked as if borderless progress wasevolving. And then ambushing clouds  global in nature moved in as a new horror.The horrific events of 11 September — thesavage attack on innocent American people —signalled a new warning to world history. On 11September  we learned that the very same technology Imentioned earlier — openness and a frontier-less connected world — could also spread viciousness. Thisattack was brutal  because it was directed at everythingwe stand for  against everything for which nations  andthe United Nations  have toiled.The emerging terror  like the emerging economy is no longer national or delineated by boundaries.Rather  it is borderless  and it contains unlimited awesome potential. It can begin with knives  and it maywind up with germs. Terror does not have a visibleaddress  a merciful lord in heaven  a court or an electedgovernment. Nor does it need the approval of the many.It is built on the fanaticism of a small group ofmurderers  lacking the checks and balances of anaccountable society. It may arrive unexpectedly uninvited  spreading fear in every corner of the globe paralysing us at work and home  grounding flights impeding movement  disrupting commerce andproduction. Eventually  it can endanger the freshness ofair  the purity of water.Global economy arrived as an historic surprise;global terrorism also arrived without prior warning.But  whereas a solution was found to regulate the10global economy  through privatization  there is noprivate answer to meet global terrorism. Many nationshave armies  without necessarily having enemies. Yet for the time being  global dangers remain withoutglobal answers or global armies.The United States played the pivotal role inintroducing the new economy. Now again  it falls uponthe United States  as the first target of global terrorism to offer a strategy  to take the lead and to bring backthe promise of freedom and security to many of us.We pay tribute to the United States  a nation thathad the capacity to welcome new modes of creativity planning  production and innovation at home andabroad. And while becoming mighty  it did not stopcaring for the rest of the world. The United States hashelped nations in Europe and Asia and elsewhereregain freedom and security in times of danger.American boys fought  and many of them losttheir lives  in European and Asian wars. They wonwars and gained land  but they did not keep thoseassets for themselves. They returned to Japan animproved Japan. They returned to Germany animproved Germany. The Marshall Plan helped torebuild Europe. Needy countries were offered food andassistance  industries were restored  economies wererehabilitated. There was generosity in their victory.Indeed  America has emerged as the “indispensablenation”.Now America has become a target for reasonswhich are not necessarily its own. Terrorism wasdirected at America to frustrate its democracy  weakenits respect for human rights  reduce its enterprise andthreaten its individualism so that it would not be ableto help others. This was an assault on the veryexistence of humanity.The bin Laden group are afraid of progress. Theyare proponents of backwardness. They want us toreturn to living in caves. They represent the darkestages in the annals of human history. They are self-appointed killers of any persons who think differentlyfrom them. They are not just evil — they are an agencyof death.America is not just a new world or continent — itis a great constitution  a shining city on the hill offreedom. It is not just a concrete structure — it is asolid idea. You can attack America  hurt it  butAmerica cannot be destroyed.America’s war on terrorism is the war of all of us.By “us”  I mean every country in this Assembly andevery human being on this planet. Bin Laden claimsthat he fights crusaders  who no longer exist. BinLaden claims that he wants to help the Palestinians  butin the eyes of the Palestinians  he is an obstacle  not anaid.Israel made peace with Egypt and returned all theland and water without bin Ladens  without terror. Wedid likewise with the Jordanians — not because ofterror  but because terror came to an end. At CampDavid in July 2000  we offered the Palestinianspractically all the land without bin Ladens  withoutterror. And if there remained a difference of 1 or 2 percent  that does not justify the killing of thousands ofmen and women in America. Political differences donot justify murdering even a single child  no matter ofwhich nation.Bin Laden and his abhorrent ideas can nevercontribute to peace. They offer no solution and no hopeto any nation  religion or person. They spread hatred disseminate fear and plant mines. They are acatastrophe at large.The new world economy enabled two of the mostpopulous countries — China and India — to moveforward and offer new life and opportunity to hundredsof millions of people. It has changed the face ofEurope. It has reversed the fortunes of Latin America.It has extended an open invitation to every country toacquire computers  widen education  open its gates andjoin a new age without giving up its old values andtraditions. The new world economy called for anassembly of responsible nations to build a dam againstterror  knowing perfectly well that the fight againstterror cannot be postponed  cannot be forgiven  cannotbe compromised. It is a matter of life and death forhumanity in the new chapter of our existence.All of us  nations and individuals  will eithercontribute to safety and freedom or become targets ofdeath and backwardness. Every country must choose itsplace in the new world  either in the realm of scienceand technology or in the wastebasket of the old landeconomy  dependent on the whims of nature condemned to the poverty of hopelessness. It is theresponsibility of affluent nations to share the wealth ofknowledge so that others can join them. Rich countriesshould become a locomotive for the deprived  not aluxury liner for the privileged.11We pray wholeheartedly from the great and unitedcity of Jerusalem  as we did in the early days of ourexistence  that we shall know again how to distinguishbetween good and evil  between tohu va’vo-hu —chaos — and a new tomorrow. Our region gave birth tothe greatest prophets  their moral dictums setting themoral fabric of our society. They have guided us totrust and follow reason and realism. But we wereforced to follow funerals more than reason. This hasexacted a heavy price from Jews  Muslims  Christians Druze. It is time that we rediscovered the TenCommandments  holy to all of us.Right now it looks as if we are again sinking intothe past. The emotional conflict is greater than theterritorial gap. It is more difficult to muster the strengthand summon the spirit than to divide the land. In spiteof these difficulties  I daresay there is a hiddenopportunity in the vast divide. I feel strongly that whilewe cannot recover lost time  we can introduce a newvista in the Middle East.Until now  the world related to the Middle East.Now the Middle East has to relate to the new world.Our neighbours — Palestinians and Arabs — know thatIsrael is committed to contribute whatever it can torenew a real peace process — not by force  not byimposition  not by unilateral action  but through anegotiated agreement  an agreed peace. There is nopeace but an agreed peace. Just as one cannot applaudwith one hand  there cannot be a one-handed peace.Problems  naturally  have a date of birth.Solutions must reach their maturity. It may not happenat once  but it will happen. Yesterday  you wouldhardly find  for example  support for a Palestinian Stateand  although this is not yet a formal policy of theGovernment of Israel  there is now support forPalestinian independence and for a Palestinian State.We do not want to dominate the Palestinians; we wantthem to breathe freedom  to create a new economy  tomaintain their traditions  to enjoy the highest level ofeducation and to provide real security to all parties.As far as Israel is concerned  we are convincedthat good neighbours are better than good guns. Inmodern times  you cannot have real security dependentonly on fences  walls  fortifications or trenches; noteven on tanks and guns and missiles. All thesemeasures have already become anti-measures  makingthem incomplete and temporary. The only strategy thatcannot be ignored is neighbourly relations  such as thecommon market in Europe  the Rio Group in LatinAmerica  the North American Free Trade Agreement inNorth America  the Association of South-East AsianNations in Asia and the New Partnership for AfricanDevelopment in Africa. All these frameworks haveshown that answers to old historical  military andpolitical conflicts may reside in the economic domain.What endangers the new solution is terror. Terroris again endangering the world. The division is nolonger between East and West  North and South  butbetween the union to stop terror and those who refuseto recognize its menace. The assembly against terrorcomprises most of humanity: the United States Europe  China  Russia  India  South America  manycountries in Africa and many countries in the Muslimworld.Democracies must have a non-democraticinstitution to defend themselves. Armies are non-democratic  but without them democracy would notprevail. You may have many views in a democraticsociety  but only one authority that controls the militaryand its arms. Armies must be subordinate to the electedpolitical body  but if you have one political authorityand several armed groups  you can have neitherdemocracy nor security.The Palestinian Authority  which is a State inbeing  must establish one authority over all arms  allarmies and all use of arms  not for the sake of Israel but for the sake of peace and for the sake of its owndestiny  so that bullets will not negate ballots.As long as terror persists  Israel has no choice butto defend its people. The word “terror” does notdescribe an abstract dilemma for us. It refers to areality of between 30 to 40 violent incidents everyday — shootings  bombings  ambushes and killings. Itis perpetrated by suicide bombers who have no respectfor life  either their own or that of others. The onlyplace they can be intercepted is at the point from whichthey depart.Israel is  by definition  an experienced member ofthe anti-terror camp. We know that terror can never winif people protect and preserve their fundamentalsecurity. Terror is strong as long as anti-terror is weakand terror is frightening as long as people are afraid ofit. Terror basically represents cowardliness and doesnot serve any real purpose. Terror neither followsjustice nor serves goals. It is not a remedy; it is amalady.12We are at a juncture. The world is pursuing newopportunities and frontiers. No longer will it be a worlddivided between developed and underdevelopednations  black and white or men and women. It willbecome a world where every person will have access toknowledge and opportunity to participate in the newgenesis. States have become weaker economically andstrategically because economy and strategy havethemselves become global. Yet we do not haveorganized world institutions to secure the globe anddistribute wealth more justly.Two courses are open to every State: either tojoin the new economy or to submit to old terror; thecreation of wealth or the threat of death. Each mustmake its own choice between the promise of economyor protest by terror. The Global Compact initiated bythe Secretary-General offers us a road map to theformer. It defines the functions and contributions of theUnited Nations and imposes responsibilities on all ofus — nation States  the private sector and civil society.It provides us with hope that  even as crises exist obscuring the opportunities just visible from the cornerof our eyes  the path to progress is clear to all with thecourage to embrace it.We woke up to the twenty-first century with suchoptimism. We must overcome the dangers so that ourchildren will again be raised in a world of almostlimitless opportunities. It can be done. We have learnedin Jerusalem that we can make a promised land into aland of promise for all of us."
"83",3491,"ITA",56,2001,"﻿I wish to congratulate thePresident on his election to head the first session of theGeneral Assembly of the new millennium. I am certainthat his experience and commitment will enable us toachieve the high goals that we all share. I also renewthe Italian Government’s warmest congratulations toSecretary-General Kofi Annan on his receipt of theNobel Peace Prize. His appointment to a second term tothe leadership of the United Nations is both welcomeand unanimously appreciated.The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belgiumaddressed the General Assembly yesterday  speakingon behalf of the European Union. Italy fully shares hisviews and supports his statement.Like our Belgian colleague and previousspeakers  I would like to express once more  on thissolemn occasion  to the Government and people of theUnited States our deep solidarity following theappalling terrorist acts perpetrated against them. Weshare their suffering over the shocking loss of humanlife and the sorrow of thousands of families.25These acts defy the most basic values of civilcoexistence. We condemn them and reaffirm our fullcommitment to the fight against international terrorism a struggle on which the United Nations has conferredfull legitimacy. We believe that the United Nationsremains the central forum to which we must turn indrafting a comprehensive response to terrorism.This is why we need strict application of the fullrange of measures adopted by the General Assemblyand the Security Council during the days immediatelyfollowing the 11 September attacks. Resolution 1373(2001)  in particular  must be implemented  urgentlyand vigorously. I also hope that everyone shows thenecessary flexibility to allow a swift conclusion of thenegotiations on a comprehensive convention againstinternational terrorism.On 7 November  by a majority of more than 90per cent  the Italian Parliament approved theGovernment’s decision to contribute ground troops naval forces and air units to operations againstinternational terrorism. This confirms my country’sawareness that the stakes are high and proves therobustness of our national consensus in facing thischallenge. The fight must be conducted in a targetedmanner  avoiding the loss of innocent lives  until theobjective has been fully achieved  without  however neglecting humanitarian assistance to the Afghanpeople  both within the country and in the refugeecamps. But the problem of the political future ofAfghanistan  a problem to be solved only by theAfghan people  must  of course  remain a high priorityin the agenda of the United Nations  together with theobjective of regional stability.But in crafting a credible  diversified globalstrategy to eradicate international terrorism  we mustalso search for solutions to the most delicate regionalcrises and to the global problems that loom over ourlives. These include hunger  poverty  ignorance inequality  underdevelopment  violation of humanrights and fundamental freedoms and threats to theenvironment and health.At the top of the list of regional crises is theMiddle East  an area physically close to Italy  and oneto which we pay close attention. Here  we are workingboth in a national capacity and within the EuropeanUnion to create  as soon as possible  the conditions foran end to the violence and a true return to negotiationsfor a comprehensive  lasting peace in the region basedon the establishment of a viable and democratic Statefor the Palestinians and an end to the occupation oftheir territories and on Israel’s right to live in peaceand security within internationally recognized borders.This framework should also include an ambitiousplan  like the one adopted to rebuild a devastatedEurope in the wake of World War II  for public andprivate investments and inter-regional assistancetowards fostering solidarity among the region’s Statesand peoples — in other words  a new Marshall Plan.Special attention should be paid to the economic andsocial growth and development of the Palestinianpopulation  to which Italy is fully committed and forwhich it remains prepared to do more in the future.In the Balkans  we have noted encouragingprogress despite persisting tensions. Our goal there isto prevent destabilizing tendencies and to fosterregional cooperation and economic development including closer ties with the European Union.As for the challenges of globalization  we shouldfirst of all make the success of the World TradeOrganization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Doha aprimary objective. In fact  many of the global problemsI have listed can be alleviated by ensuring that theinternational market economy and multilateral freetrade operate fairly and continue to fosterinclusiveness  integration and more equitable andsustainable growth of all countries through agreedrules. This latest WTO round should be one of growthand development  focusing in particular on theproblems of the developing and least developedcountries.But in order to assure a better response toglobalization’s most problematic aspects  other majorobjectives must be pursued. And the universalorganization with the moral authority to meet thischallenge is the United Nations.The first objective is the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. Italy’s commitment isstrong and long-standing. In fact  we are one of the topthree contributors of men and resources to peaceoperations led and authorized by the United Nations. Inthis light  we appreciate the reports that the Secretariathas issued in the past two years  which suggest a visionof peace activity as a single  three-sided concept encompassing conflict prevention  peacekeeping andpost-conflict peace-building.26Italy also values the document that the Secretary-General submitted to Member States on the preventionof armed conflicts  emphasizing the direct connectionbetween safeguarding peace and fightingunderdevelopment. In fact  no peacekeeping action canachieve lasting results unless it is coupled withmeasures to strengthen government institutions safeguard the human  civil and cultural rights of allcommunities and rebuild the economic and social fibreof affected areas.The second objective is to foster development anderadicate poverty. We must ensure that all the countriesof the world benefit from the opportunities created byinterdependencies and progress  in particular in theareas of information and communication technology.The global United Nations conferences of the 1990slaid the groundwork for the definition of poverty as amultidimensional phenomenon. It is not onlycharacterized by low income and consumption  but alsoa lack of food  health care  schooling andenvironmental stability. This is a vicious cycle that wemust break  through coordinated and integratedinitiatives. To reverse the downward spiral  we mustenhance both the material and the human dimensions ofdevelopment.The Millennium Declaration spells out theobjectives to be attained by 2015. Italy has shown itscommitment to these goals through the shaping of itsinternational actions and the shouldering of itsresponsibilities during the year of its G-8 presidency.One example was the substantive outreach initiative atthe Genoa Summit  involving a meeting with fiveAfrican Heads of State and the Secretary-General todiscuss the New African Initiative and launch a globalfund to combat HIV/AIDS and other infectiousdiseases.Finally  we must continue to nurture andstrengthen development assistance and reach the goalof having the most developed countries dedicate 0.7per cent of their gross national product to this pursuit.In this context  debt relief is another essential tool tofree up the necessary resources in developing countriesin order to stimulate their economies  for instance bypromoting public investment in health care andschooling. Italy is a leader in this field by virtue ofrecent laws that allow it to gradually cancel the debt ofthe poorest countries.As I said before  the United Nations has the moralauthority to take on today’s new challenges. This factwas highlighted by the awarding of the Nobel PeacePrize to the Secretary-General and to the Organizationas a whole. However  its structure and procedures mustkeep pace with the times. Italy believes in the reformof the United Nations  a reform that should affect all ofits bodies  including the Security Council. Let mereiterate the need for a comprehensive reform thataddresses the relevant issues in all their aspects. Such areform should be designed to produce greaterefficiency  legitimacy and transparency. It should alsomeet the general expectations of democracy universality and inclusiveness.In addition  to create the conditions for stablegrowth of prosperity and security for all humankind we need more effective governance of globalization.The documents prepared by the Secretariat make greatstrides in this direction. Now is the time to translate thecommitments of the Millennium Declaration intoaction. Italy will support every initiative undertaken forthis purpose.Never have we had a better opportunity to solveour problems  yet never have we faced greater risks.The answer does not lie in denying the reality ofinterdependence and growing globalization. It is withinour ability to promote better governance of theinternational system. Never before has the world had somany human  financial and technological resources atits disposal. The answer lies in our hands  in ourcollective will."
"84",3537,"JAM",56,2001,"﻿I am delighted to joinin the chorus of warm congratulations alreadyexpressed before this Assembly to the Secretary-General of our Organization  His Excellency Mr. KofiAnnan  and to the United Nations itself  on the jointaward of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize.We also include in this proud salute those whohave fallen in the line of duty  while recognizing thosewho continue to serve in areas of danger  all for thecause of peace. It is a fitting tribute that that Prize dedicated to the cause of peace and so richly earned byour Secretary-General in his own right and by theUnited Nations Organization collectively  has beenconferred on them this year. No one doubts that theaccolades are truly deserved. They are most fitting at atime when the entire world is in upheaval.The catastrophic attacks  cynically perpetrated onthe International Day of Peace in the city that is host tothe United Nations  as well as elsewhere  have  in theirwanton slaughter of innocents and awesomedestructiveness  sent shock waves around the world.The messiahs of terror have  by the sheer magnitudeand horror of their unprecedented crime againsthumanity  unified nations and people in thedetermination to remove the spectre of terrorism in allits many forms  wherever it is manifested.Jamaica stands firmly with the internationalcommunity on Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)against terrorism. As a member of the Council  weassert  with particular emphasis and deliberation  ourunwavering commitment to the cause of ending thispernicious evil.To defeat the forces of terror  our collectiveaction must be firm  decisive and broad-based.International law must become a binding frameworkfor the total defeat of terrorism. Jamaica welcomes theongoing efforts to elaborate a draft comprehensiveconvention against terrorism. We hope that during thissession of the General Assembly the momentum willbe seized to achieve measurable progress in this criticalarea. At the same time  the international communityneeds to take action aimed at achieving the universalityof the existing conventions and other instrumentsagainst terrorism.Jamaica is accelerating its domestic action toachieve those objectives  and this morning I waspleased to sign the International Convention for theSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism.For the past two years  Jamaica has worked withother members of the Council to make peacekeepingoperations more efficient; to create strategies forsustained peace-building; to bring warring factions tothe peace table and  beyond that  to promotecompliance with resulting accords; and to put in placemechanisms for protecting those most affected bysituations of conflict  especially the women andchildren.We are pleased with the work already undertakenin respect of the Brahimi report on peacekeepingoperations. Through a number of tribunals  we havedemonstrated that the United Nations will act to endimpunity. Despite sustained international efforts however  several flashpoints still remain.Jamaica is deeply concerned about the continuingcycle of violence and reprisal in the Middle East.Efforts to achieve a durable ceasefire have beenthwarted at every turn. Numerous resolutions of theSecurity Council have been ignored. We recognize thepositive efforts of some permanent members toinfluence a return to the peace process  but the SecurityCouncil should not be marginalized in these initiatives.Jamaica again urges the Government of Israel and thePalestinian Authority to spare no effort in complyingwith agreements already reached. We call on bothparties to remain engaged in the quest for a durablepeace.We dare not neglect the millions of childrenworldwide who suffer from hunger  disease andignorance. In situations of conflict  children are themost vulnerable victims. We have all been horrified bytheir exploitation as child soldiers and by thetrafficking and sexual abuse that numerous childrenhave suffered. We have to remember that theyconstitute the generation of tomorrow  in whose handswill rest the future of international peace and security.21Nor must we forget the importance ofhumanitarian assistance to the innocent people inconflict-torn areas of the world and to refugees anddisplaced persons  as well as to those who are victimsof natural and man-made disasters. For them  theUnited Nations must become a beacon of hope for thepeace and stability that will enable them to lead normaland productive lives.Military strikes cannot by themselves eradicateterrorism. In our response  we need to be mindful thatthe time has come for us to inaugurate a new era ofpeace — not simply through preventing war  but byeliminating the causes that give rise to strife andviolence. And so I stand at this rostrum today to callfor a United Nations renaissance  for a rebirth of thisOrganization  which will not just permit it to be theharbinger of peace  but which will empower it to fostera climate that will usher in a new age of globaldevelopment and a dynamic partnership for humanprosperity.We are living in a time of fear  not just in thiscountry or here in this city  but worldwide: fear for thelives of people; fear for the state of economies national and global; fear that our propensity for wantondestruction may impair the capacity of the planet itselfto sustain life. These fears are compounded by otherblights — the blights of disease  ignorance and bigotrytowards people on the basis of ethnicity  religion andgender; the blight of cruel and autocratic governance insome places; and  most pervasive of all  the blight ofpoverty.The expansion of the global economy in the lastfour decades has not eliminated gross poverty or evenreduced its prevalence. A sophisticated  globalized increasingly affluent world currently co-exists  globallyand within countries  with a marginalized underclass.The hungry  the homeless and the destitute areless impassioned about the physical insecurities ofterrorist repression or the damaging consequences ofmilitary warfare. The unemployed  those who are illbut have no health care  those who are cold but have noproper heating  those who are old but have no socialsupport — for these victims  “security” means a meal a roof  a job  medicine  warmth and relief from povertyin general. But those needs are just as real andinsistent  and they represent for them the mostimmediate denial of their rights as human beings.During the last decade  the process ofglobalization  deregulation and privatization has sweptthe world. It is incontrovertible that it has not been agolden age for a large proportion of the world’s people:not just for the 1.3 billion absolute poor in developingcountries whom the benefits of globalization seem tohave bypassed  but for many millions in industrialcountries also. We delude ourselves if we believe thatall those engaged in street protests  whether in Seattle Washington  Prague  Quebec city or Rome  are simplyanarchists.International institutions must not only beaccountable; they must be subject to democraticgovernance as well. It is becoming more widelyrecognized that a new global institutional architectureis needed to establish representative superintendence ofthe global economy  directed towards enlargement ofsocial and economic justice worldwide and targeted toa sharp redirection of the numbers mired in grosspoverty and deprivation.Some of the desired progress may be possiblethrough existing institutions  but more radical reformmay also be required. Democratic superintendence ofthe global economy has to be a central feature of thefresh global architecture we seek to fashion during thisdecade. That new global architecture must incorporateappropriate arrangements for a start to be made inraising global resources for global purposes in waysthat do not generate alarm. The persistence of grosspoverty  the long list of environmental abuses  thedisturbing reduction in development aid and thevagaries of foreign private investment make acompelling case for global revenues.The world faces crucial choices. We have toidentify and follow a guiding principle if humanity isto make an enlightened response to the challenges weface. We can hardly return to the principles of a feudalworld in which military and economic strength areconcentrated in the hands of a few  while we indulge inan illusion of order through the marginalization of themany. In our interdependent  interconnected world  thatis no longer a credible option.Our only way forward lies here in the UnitedNations. If this institution did not exist before 11September  we would have to create it now. We have tobe inspired by the vision that propelled the generationof 1945 to pursue the path of collective responsibilityfor peace and human progress through a regime of22multilateral action anchored by the United Nations. Itwas coterie of Governments  in a rare moment ofcollective wisdom and creativity  that settled the UnitedNations Charter. It was not without flaws in itsinception  and some flaws have remained to hobble itscapacity to initiate the renaissance of which I speak.It is within that context that the demand for thereform of the Security Council becomes even moreurgent  since the Council’s present design andfunctioning weaken its capacity to fulfil its mandate.We must remove all existing constraints on the capacityof the United Nations. Even as we work to improve itand to reform it  we must proclaim the United Nationsto be the temple in which we can all worship. “We  thepeople” must be made a reality to fulfil thecommitment made in their name by the Charter of1945.Today  our greatest hope lies in people: in peopleof all races  of all genders  of all faiths; people of allcontinents and oceans; people of all ages; the“ordinary” people of the world and those who holdthemselves to be of higher station. All the world’speople are affected by the calamities that loom; allmust be involved in turning humanity away fromgloom and in finding the light.The Charter does not set out the principal organsof the United Nations in a hierarchical order  but theGeneral Assembly is the only principal organ under theCharter that embraces all the Members on a onemember  one vote basis. It is the symbol of the UnitedNations as a universal organization in the bestdemocratic tradition. And so  I believe that it is withinthe General Assembly that the true renaissance of theUnited Nations must begin. The special value of theGeneral Assembly is its universality  its capacity to bea forum in which the voice of every Member State canbe raised. It provides the opportunity for countries toventilate issues  to bring complaints to the floor in thegeneral debate and to suggest new ideas in committees.But the assumption surely must be valid thatdeliberation should inform action.High among the changes that should mark therenaissance of the United Nations is the revitalizationof the General Assembly as a universal forum of theworld’s States. Even with a reformed and somewhatenlarged Security Council  many Member States with acapacity to contribute significantly to the policies andprogrammes of the United Nations and to globalgovernance will have to remain on the sidelines. AGeneral Assembly that occupies more of the stage andreorders its work to make it more focused and moreresult-oriented  will allow each of us a meaningful rolein world governance through our work in theAssembly. It is in the interest of the world communityto have a more vigorous and effective GeneralAssembly which can and should play a vitallegitimating role in the United Nations  consonant withthe universality of its membership.Here in the General Assembly  we are thepractitioners of international affairs. At the heart of theconduct of those affairs must lie a sense of realism. Itoo am conscious that the accumulated baggage ofdecades cannot be shed in a single heave. That is why Ido not call for reform but advocate instead arenaissance: a rebirth which offers the chance of facingthe twenty-first century with sound values no longerpredicated on a world of adversarial States but on aninteractive world of people that has espousedneighbourhood values of respect for life and liberty  forjustice and equity  for tolerance and caring; values thatbalance rights with responsibilities  that elevate thedemocratic ethic at both the national and the globallevels.We are a long way from that consummation however devoutly we may wish it. But we aresufficiently frightened by the prospects that confront usto recognize the need for humanity to take “the pathless travelled by”. There are enough good people in allour societies — who together are the silent majority ofthe world’s people — to ensure that by choosing thisnew path we can indeed make a real difference. Wehave to find a better way than the one a divided worldhas been pursuing. That way has to lie through theUnited Nations as an organization — but a UnitedNations revitalized  its agencies repaired  reformed andresponsive to a culture of new values appropriate to ourtime.This new era of global relations demands bolderand more ingenious approaches to confidence-buildingand to development as a prerequisite for internationalpeace and security. An equitable framework to financenational and global development  to fuel expansion ofinternational trade and to foster sustainabledevelopment must be placed on the front burner whether we gather in Qatar  in Mexico or in SouthAfrica.23If the global conferences to be held in those threeplaces are to succeed  Member States must be guidedby full recognition that this new era of global relationsdemands  as I said  more ingenious approaches toconfidence-building and to development as aprecondition for international peace and security.In closing  I wish to take this opportunity tocongratulate Mr. Han on his assumption of thepresidency of this session of the General Assembly andto commit Jamaica’s total support for the attainment ofour common goals in the service of all humankind.Whatever may be our colour  culture or creed  webelong to a single race — that is  the human race. Weoccupy a single planet  which has more than enough toenable each person and every nation to enjoy theabundance which Mother Earth has to offer and for allits people to dwell together in harmony.Now more than at any time in its history  theUnited Nations is the best vehicle to procure globalpeace and to foster international cooperation. Let this the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly  loudlyand clearly proclaim that the renaissance of the UnitedNations has indeed begun."
"85",3583,"JOR",56,2001,"﻿Letme express our deep sadness at the human lossresulting from the crash this morning of an Americanaircraft in a Queens neighbourhood and ourcondolences to the families of the victims.I wish to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo and hisfriendly country on his election as President of thefifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Let mealso pay tribute to his predecessor for his ablestewardship of the last session.Furthermore  I extend warm congratulations tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  on his re-26election for a second term of office  as well as on hiswell-deserved award  jointly with the United Nations of the Nobel Peace Prize. That was anacknowledgement of Mr. Annan’s remarkable trackrecord in serving the purposes and principles of theCharter and a symbolic token of recognition of thecentrality and relevance of the vital role of the UnitedNations in the world community.This great city which hosts our worldOrganization and the United States of America and itspeople have been struck by a cowardly terrorist attackthat targeted innocent civilians. In truth  this act ofaggression was committed not just against the UnitedStates but  in fact  against the entire internationalcommunity and humanity. For it seems that the largerobjective of the evil and dark forces that planned andexecuted those atrocities was the terrorization andintimidation of all of us and the precipitation of aworldwide cultural and religious confrontation. Theiraim was to undermine and shatter our sense of commonconfidence and the bonds that unite us by stripping usof our own sense of security and driving us to deal witheach other in an atmosphere of mistrust  fear andhatred.One of the many painful impacts of those terroristattacks is the demonstration of the depth ofinterdependence in our modern life. The repercussionswent beyond the United States. The victims belongedto dozens of nations  including Jordan  and all of usalmost instantly felt the negative economic effects.Thus the fight against terrorism should becomprehensive. This means forging a unity of purposeand determination to win this war on all fronts. It alsomeans exercising care and caution so that we do notfall into the trap set by the terrorists. Indeed  our waragainst terrorism is neither a religious war nor a clashbetween one civilization and another — or evenbetween one nation and another.Last 11 September  Jordan reaffirmed its long-standing and clear position  which is anchored in itsfirm policy of rejecting the use of terrorism ininternational relations  irrespective of any argumentadvanced  pretext invoked or label given. Thus  HisMajesty King Abdullah II declared Jordan’s categoricalcondemnation of the terrorist attacks perpetratedagainst the United States and Jordan’s support for theinternational effort against terrorism. In the same vein His Majesty expressed resolve to safeguard the sanctityof the Islamic faith from any abuse or distortion causedby terrorism or terrorists  insisting that terrorists mustbe deprived of any opportunity to hijack religion and tomisuse it to serve their purposes or advance theiragenda. In particular  terrorists must be barred fromprovoking a confrontation between Islam and the restof the world.The suppression and defeat of those perniciousschemes require  among other things  the enhancementof understanding among peoples and cultures. Theyalso demand a genuine respect for cultural diversity.Human pluralism should  ideally  be a force ofenrichment and inspiration for the community ofnations. The world is perhaps pressed now more thanever to launch a meaningful dialogue amongcivilizations that highlights common denominatorswith a view to promoting tolerance and reinforcing ourability to coexist and interact in peace and harmony.The United Nations system remains the appropriateframework and venue for such a dialogue.Islam and Muslims throughout history haveenriched human civilization. The contributions ofMuslim scholars in science  literature and culture ingeneral reached the heights they did due to a climate ofopen-mindedness  tolerance and pluralism establishedby Islam.We in Jordan take pride in the true coexistenceand integration of our community life  which has beenfashioned over the past 14 centuries. Muslims andChristians live side by side in national unity  wherereligious pluralism is an enriching factor  makingJordanian society a good example of social harmonyand interaction.Terrorism will exploit political  economic andsocial imbalances and the absence of justice to advanceits goals. Therefore  addressing the main causes ofdespair  frustration and sense of injustice in a seriousmanner is perhaps the most effective way to confrontterrorism and pre-empt its potential appeal and support.We recognize that a truly effective internationaleffort to eradicate terrorism primarily requires  as far asthe Middle East region is concerned  a just andacceptable resolution of the question of Palestine whose long-running implications on the ground remainthe chief source of pain and suffering across the region.The current situation of constant killings anddestruction as a result of Israel’s practices of using27force against the Palestinian people and the siege oftheir towns and communities constitute a constantincitement that feeds escalation in a way that endangerssecurity and stability throughout the whole region.Jordan firmly believes that the resolution of thisconflict will not be possible by the use of force or bysecurity and coercive measures. There is really noalternative before the two sides but to return to thenegotiating table as equal partners and to seek asettlement that ensures their legitimate rights and theirfuture. This option will remain elusive until parallelmutual steps are adopted on the basis of the accordsand obligations agreed upon by both the Palestinianand Israeli sides.His Majesty King Abdullah II has been engagedin enormous efforts to help the region break out of thevicious circle engulfing it because of the ongoingconfrontations between the two sides. King Abdullahhas contributed positively to the intense internationalcontacts and efforts to achieve that goal. Thoseendeavours have indeed led to the building of a fullinternational consensus on the requirements needed tobreak the current deadlock. Those requirementsinclude  in the first place  ending the use of the Israelimilitary machine against the Palestinian people  liftingthe blockade imposed on them and abandoning thepolicy of assassinations and incursions into areas underthe control of the Palestinian National Authority.Implementing those steps would set out anappropriate entry to start the implementation of therecommendations of the Mitchell Commission  thethrust of which is to create favourable conditions thatallow return to the negotiating table.Ten years after the Madrid Peace Conference  theregion is seething with frustration over the failure toreach the long-awaited peace. People there are nolonger satisfied by the mere existence of a peaceprocess. Therefore  the revival of the peace process initself is no longer tenable in the absence of a genuinelymeaningful effort that translates into concrete progresson the road to peace.Prolonged confrontations have resulted not onlyin the failure to carry out several obligations agreedupon  but also in retreating from undertakings thatwere already in place. This demonstrates that phasedand interim agreements are inadequate and ineffectiveto address the status quo. Therefore  starting the finalstatus negotiations has become now a pressing priorityin order to achieve the principal objective of the peaceprocess  namely  the fulfilment of the national rights ofthe Palestinian people and the establishment of theirviable independent State in their homeland  as well asthe guaranteeing of the security of Israel.Peace that can be acceptable to the peoples of theregion must be comprehensive in terms of resolving  onthe one hand  the whole array of major issues: theoccupied territories  Jerusalem  the refugees  securityand weapons of mass destruction  and economiccooperation; and including on the other  all tracks andthe States concerned.Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973) remain the basis of the peace process. Theirimplementation requires putting in place the truecomponents of peace: primarily  the renunciation of thesettlement policy which contradicts the “land forpeace” principle and which is in itself a flagrant breachof international law. Peace and settlements aremutually exclusive.Holy Jerusalem is key to peace. It is an occupiedPalestinian territory subject to the application ofresolution 242 (1967)  which aims at achieving Israeliwithdrawal therefrom and from the rest of thePalestinian territories — occupied in 1967 — so thatJerusalem will become the capital of the State ofPalestine. In addition  an appropriate formula will haveto be worked out to ensure that the entire city ofJerusalem will be open  freedom of worship for all willbe safeguarded and the city will be a factor of unityand reconciliation among all believers in God.The issue of refugees represents the worst form ofinjustice and frustration in the conflict. Justice must besecured for the Palestinian refugees in order toeliminate the greatest source of frustration andsuffering in the region. Jordan  time and again  hasmade clear its firm position in relation to the questionof refugees here in the Assembly. Let me emphasizethat Jordan will accept only a solution to the questionof refugees that takes fully into account its rights andinterests as a State  as well as the rights and interests ofits citizens  on the basis of international law and allrelevant United Nations resolutions.Lack of trust between the two sides precludestheir ability to achieve any progress without an activeinvolvement by a third party. Jordan welcomesPresident George W. Bush’s announcement endorsing asolution that ensures the existence of two States 28including the establishment of a Palestinian State onthe Palestinian territory currently occupied by Israel  inaccordance with relevant Security Council resolutions.This announcement completes the internationalconsensus on the fundamental requirement forachieving peace in the region. It is our hope that theUnited States efforts will continue with support fromthe countries of the European Union  the RussianFederation and the international community as a wholein order to reach that goal.A comprehensive peace must include Israeliwithdrawal from the occupied Syrian territories to theborder of 4 June 1967 and the completion of itswithdrawal from the remaining occupied Lebaneseterritories on the basis of relevant Security Councilresolutions.The suffering of Iraq and its people  due to theinternational sanctions imposed against them for morethan 11 years  is yet another source of frustration andtension in the region. Jordan once again stresses theneed to lift those sanctions and the importance ofcreating conditions that will allow Iraq to reclaim itsactive regional and international role. Jordan alsoemphasizes the importance of completing theimplementation of relevant Security Councilresolutions  including those relating to Kuwaitiprisoners and other missing persons.We hope to see an end soon to the plight of thepeople of Afghanistan so that that nation and itspolitical forces can agree on a form of government torepresent it. We also hope that the world communitywill mount a genuine effort to assist the people ofAfghanistan in facing the tragic economic conditionsthat have been afflicting them for many years.At this juncture in human history  when we areseeing a surge in global challenges  it becomes evenmore imperative to rally around the United Nations andto comply more faithfully with the purposes andprinciples of its Charter  especially those relating to thepeaceful resolution of disputes on the basis ofinternational law.It is also important not to abandon our collectivegoals in terms of promoting peace  economicdevelopment and respect for human rights. Thistrilateral platform of action represents Jordan’sdomestic and foreign agenda.Our relentless pursuit of a just peace in our regionhas not disrupted our determined efforts to seekeconomic  social and political development. To thecontrary  Jordan is now poised to embark on a new integrated enterprise that seeks more economic growthin order to improve the living conditions of itspopulation and to open up new vistas of hope andpromise for our future generations. Indeed  the dignityand welfare of the individual must always remain thenoblest goal of our national and internationalendeavours."
"86",3630,"JPN",56,2001,"﻿I would like tocongratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo  Minister for ForeignAffairs and Trade of the Republic of Korea  on hisassumption of the presidency of the General Assemblyat its fifty-sixth session  and to pay high tribute to himfor the efficient manner in which he has been guidingthis session under unprecedented circumstances. Japanis determined to continue to extend its full support tothe President.I would also like on this occasion to extend mysincere congratulations to the Secretary-General  Mr.Kofi Annan  and to the United Nations on being namedthe recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize this year. Ibelieve it is indeed a reflection of the internationalcommunity's appreciation for the efforts of the UnitedNations  under the leadership of Secretary-GeneralAnnan  for world peace and prosperity. The challengesfacing the international community  however  arebecoming increasingly diverse and difficult  and Japanwill cooperate fully with the activities of the UnitedNations in responding to these situations.I deeply mourn the deaths of the victims of theseries of heinous terrorist attacks against the UnitedStates on 11 September  who have left behind lovingfamilies and friends in the United States and in manyother countries. I extend my sincere condolences to thebereaved families and to all the people and theGovernment of the United States.It is no exaggeration to say that the terroristattacks are threats against all humankind and arechallenges to democracy and freedom throughout theworld. The international community must establish aworld-wide circle of cooperation for the elimination ofterrorism. In this context  I am encouraged that  inresponse to the recent attacks  the internationalcommunity is taking prompt actions at the UnitedNations and in many other international and regionalorganizations and forums to prevent and eliminateterrorism. Considering the response to terrorism to beits own responsibility  Japan is determined to make theutmost efforts to prevent and eliminate such acts.Japan has made it clear that the terrorist attackson the United States must not be linked to Islamicdoctrine. It is extremely important that the internationalcommunity  transcending religious and ethnicdifferences  take unified actions to eliminate terrorism.There are many things which the United Nationshas to do in order to eliminate terrorism. It isimperative that we faithfully and immediatelyimplement Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001)and 1373 (2001). Japan is actively contributing to thework of the Security Council in implementingresolution 1373 (2001). It is also important that allMember States accede to and fully observe the 12international conventions relating to terrorism andaccelerate the work toward the adoption of acomprehensive convention on international terrorismand an international convention for the suppression ofacts of nuclear terrorism.Moreover  certain biological weapons  such asanthrax  can be produced with more limited funds andless advanced technologies than nuclear and chemicalweapons. It is important to strengthen the Biological14Weapons Convention in order to effectively prevent theproduction of such weapons.Japan is itself making various efforts to eliminateterrorism. First  with regard to treaties  there are twotreaties concerning terrorism which Japan has eithernot yet signed or not yet ratified. The InternationalConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombingshas recently been approved by the Diet  and Japan willimmediately begin the ratification process. Japansigned the International Convention for theSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism on 30October and would like to ratify it as soon as possible.In addition  Japan is ready to cooperate withdeveloping countries in the fields of controlling thefinancing of terrorism  immigration control  aviationand maritime safety  measures against terrorismthrough biological and chemical weapons  and so forth.Moreover  Japan will take more active measuresagainst terrorism by enacting a new law to support theoperations of other countries that are trying toeliminate the threat posed by the recent terrorist attacksand to extend assistance to affected people.In view of the importance of ensuring the stabilityof Afghanistan’s neighbours  Japan is extendingemergency economic assistance  which includesassistance to Afghan refugees  Pakistan and otherneighbouring countries. Japan also decided to provideup to $120 million for Afghan refugee assistanceefforts undertaken by United Nations agencies andother humanitarian organizations.With winter approaching  there is an urgenthumanitarian need for the international community todeliver food and other vital goods to the people inAfghanistan. I would like to take this opportunity tocall upon the international community to join forces insupport of the humanitarian activities of UnitedNations organizations.As we look ahead to the future  the achievementof peace and stability in Afghanistan is extremelyimportant not only to eliminate a hotbed of globalterrorism but also to lay the foundation for the long-term stability and development of the country and theneighbouring region. Based on this recognition  it isnecessary for the international community to tackle thisissue from a long-term and broad perspective.Towards that end  it goes without saying that first of all  a Government must be established that hasthe broad support of the Afghan people  representsevery ethnic group  adheres to international law andestablishes friendly relations with the internationalcommunity  including with neighbouring countries.However  the realities in Afghanistan do not offer aclear perspective and thus entail many unpredictableelements. Japan fully supports the activities ofSecretary-General Annan and his SpecialRepresentative for Afghanistan  Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi to promote political stability in Afghanistan and willactively cooperate with them.Japan intends to play an active role both in thepeace process and in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.We have been calling for holding a conference forpeace and reconstruction in Afghanistan since 1996 and I would like on this occasion to reaffirm that Japanis ready to hold such a conference to contribute to thatcountry’s peace and reconstruction at as early a time aspossible  in cooperation with relevant countries andorganizations.The United Nations has serious responsibilitiesfor addressing relating to terrorism. Japan will spare noeffort in order that this session of the GeneralAssembly can be as fruitful as possible for thispurpose."
"87",3655,"KAZ",56,2001,"﻿This sessionthat is taking place under extraordinary circumstances when the whole world is still reeling in shock from theworld’s most terrible terrorist attacks  carried out inNew York and Washington. This unprecedented action aimed against the civilian population  has provided yetone more confirmation that terrorism poses a threat tothe whole world and has highlighted the relevance ofthe proposals to join the international community’sefforts in its common fight against terrorism  drugtrafficking and organized crime.Our country calls for international legal norms tobe strengthened and for further mobilization of States’efforts to counter international terrorism. Taking intoconsideration the developments in the world that areidentified with this growing threat  we support theinitiative regarding the early adoption of acomprehensive convention against internationalterrorism.Afghanistan’s transformation into one of the sorespots of our planet was a matter of concern forKazakhstan well before the events of 11 September.During the Millennium Summit  the President of theRepublic of Kazakhstan  Nursultan Nazarbaev  takinginto account the potential danger of a spillover of theintra-Afghan conflict  proposed to convene a specialmeeting of the Security Council devoted to theconsideration of the situation in Afghanistan andCentral Asia in order to devise comprehensivemeasures to settle the situation in the Islamic State ofAfghanistan.Welcoming Security Council resolution 1378(2001)  unanimously adopted on 14 November  weshare the Secretary-General’s view that the SecurityCouncil should adopt a comprehensive approach tosettling the situation in the Islamic State ofAfghanistan and its political  military  economic humanitarian and human rights dimensions. Such anapproach  in his opinion  ought to be based on a carefuldiagnosis of the current situation in Afghanistan  basedon the premise that no military solution to the Afghanconflict is possible  or indeed acceptable  sinceterritorial gains achieved on the battlefield do notconstitute a basis for the legitimatization of power.The issue of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation is of special significance to our country.This year we mark the tenth anniversary of ourindependence  as well as the tenth anniversary of theshutdown of the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground which represented an important step towards a nuclear-free  stable and safe world and its deliverance from thespectre of global Armageddon. The harm that was donefirst and foremost to the people of Kazakhstan wasacknowledged by the participants of the conferenceentitled “The Twenty-First Century: Towards aNuclear-Weapon-Free World”  which was held from 29to 30 August 2001 in Almaty.Nuclear-weapon tests have caused the destructionof the landscape  ecosystem  economic structure andtraditional way of life of the people in the affectedareas  which happen to be the historical centres ofKazakh statehood and culture. We are grateful to ourpartners who  in line with the three resolutions adoptedby the General Assembly  are helping to rehabilitate thearea of the testing ground  including the conversion ofinfrastructure. Yet  much remains to be done. Webelieve that the financial aid  experience and expertiseof international organizations  donor countries and non-governmental entities play an important role inaddressing the problems of the affected region. Theoutcome of the Almaty Conference has demonstratedthat the well-being of the planet  which is so cherished should be achieved not through threats and the use ofweapons  but exclusively through peaceful means suchas negotiation and dialogue.Acknowledging the necessity of strengtheningstability and security at both the regional and globallevels  the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Mr. Nursultan Nazarbaev  addressing the forty-seventhsession of the General Assembly  put forward aninitiative to convene a conference on interaction andconfidence-building measures in Asia. Leaders of 16Asian countries are to meet for the first time in Almatyin the first half of the year 2002 to discuss threats toregional peace and security  to arrive at a shared visionof forms and modalities of addressing such threats andto agree on confidence-building measures and theestablishment of the structures and institutions of theConference. The work carried out so far shows thatcompromise solutions are quite possible  even withrespect to differences that seem irreconcilable. In thatcontext  the Conference represents a forum based onprinciples that are conceptually new for Asia  namely 37trust and cooperation as a means to ensure security andstability.Globalization  which has become a dominantfactor in international life  opens up vast opportunitiesfor social and economic development. At the same timethe United Nations should actively help to solvecurrent global trends associated with serious problems.We call for an increased contribution on the part of theOrganization to improving the global environment forsustainable development and to bridging the gapbetween developed and developing countries. Thedevelopment of a globalization model for the modernworld — beginning with its economic component —that would fully take into account the interests of allcountries could become a priority objective of theOrganization within the framework of the currentreforms at the United Nations. More active efforts bythe United Nations to promote the integration ofeconomies in transition into the world economy arebecoming especially important for Kazakhstan.Against the background of irreversible growth inglobal interrelationship  regional integration  which isactively supported by our country  is gainingmomentum. Kazakhstan attaches great importance tocooperation within the framework of the EconomicCooperation Organization  the Shanghai CooperationOrganization  the Eurasian Economic Community  theCentral Asian Economic Community and other regionaleconomic organizations  and will contribute as much asit can to building up their capacity and theirinternational standing. We consider it a priority todevelop cooperation with the United Nations in suchareas as strengthening the social security systemthrough efforts to fight poverty and unemployment;developing transportation infrastructure by maintainingand improving highways and railroads; solving theproblems of rivers in border areas; and supplyingdrinking water in a number of regions.We intend to take full advantage of thegeographical position of our country and of thefavourable location of continental transit routes. Thatendeavour will be helped by an internationalministerial conference of land-locked countries devotedto transit and transportation issues  which will beconvened in Kazakhstan in 2003 with the assistance ofthe United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment.A transition to environmentally sound andsustainable development is a priority goal of thestrategy to ensure the economic growth of Kazakhstan.Stabilizing and improving the quality of theenvironment in the Aral Sea basin are of overridingimportance to our country. Kazakhstan has called  andwill continue to call  for an integrated approach tosolving the problems of the Aral Sea and for widerparticipation in the effort being made by theprogrammes of the United Nations system.The participation of the United Nations is alsoimportant in solving the host of problems related to thedevelopment of the Caspian Sea region. The problemof the Caspian Sea has outgrown its regionalboundaries and has become global. As an effective toolof regional and global economic partnership  theUnited Nations has a role to play to implement a policyof preventive diplomacy in the region in order to workout an agreed programme for the development of theCaspian Sea.The process of globalization  which ischaracterized by growing interdependence amongStates in all spheres of life  presents new challenges forthe international community. In those circumstances multilateral efforts by the community of nations to findadequate answers to new challenges and threats play anexceptionally important role. Kazakhstan supportsstrengthening the central role and authority of theUnited Nations in efforts to ensure global stability andto build equitable relations between States and peoplesbased on mutual respect and universal values. We callfor increased efficiency of the United Nations systemas a whole  including the Security Council  its principalorgan responsible for the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. In that regard  Kazakhstan fullysupports the need for adequate implementation of thedecisions taken at the Millennium Summit and fullyshares the development goals and objectives set out bythe international community in the MillenniumDeclaration.The recent decision to award the Nobel PeacePrize to the United Nations and its Secretary-General isa sign of recognition of the Organization’s contributionto strengthening international cooperation —cooperation aimed at the maintenance of peace andsecurity for the sake of succeeding generations and inthe interests of the prosperity of the peoples of allcountries. That award has demonstrated that the United38Nations plays a special role in efforts to strengthenglobal partnerships for international purposes."
"88",3702,"KEN",56,2001,"﻿I congratulate you Sir  on your unanimous election as President of thefifty-sixth session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly. I would also like to extend my sincerecongratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General  for his re-election to a second term in officeand for the richly deserved Nobel Peace Prize awardedto him and the United Nations Organization. This is anacknowledgement of his tireless efforts in the serviceof mankind and  as the Secretary-General has said  of achallenge to do better and  I hope  faster. I would liketo assure the Secretary-General of my Government’scooperation and firm commitment in that regard.The achievements of the United NationsOrganization are many and varied  while its increasingrelevance in an ever more complex internationalenvironment is clear to us. Its objectives are still asvalid and noble today as they were 56 years ago and  Ibelieve  can only be achieved by our continuedcommitment  careful vigilance and firm action.I would now like to turn my attention to an issuethat is uppermost in my mind and that has changed theway we live and do business  maybe forever. I amreferring to the terrorist attacks on the United States ofAmerica  an important  worthy and respected Memberof the United Nations Organization and a long-standingand trusted friend of Kenya.Terrorism poses a real threat to internationalpeace and security and must be condemned by peopleof good will throughout the world. Terrorism cannot bejustified in any form whatsoever. No philosophy religion or creed can allow the taking away of innocentlives and the destruction of valuable property. Thepeople of Kenya experienced first-hand the devastatingeffects of terrorism in August 1998. The attack onKenya  a country faced with challenges of poverty andunderdevelopment  was especially severe and continuesto affect us. Kenya understands well the pain of those4affected by the recent attacks in the United States ofAmerica and fully supports the efforts being led by thePresident of the United States of America  Mr. GeorgeW. Bush  and his administration to fight terrorism in allits forms.In order to carry out one of its fundamentalobjectives  that of the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  the United Nations  and inparticular its membership  must intensify efforts toresolve all outstanding and persistent conflicts ragingin many parts of the world. We the Member States ofthe United Nations must work very closely to ensurethat we completely disable the terrorist machinery. Wemust particularly support the coalition againstterrorism.As an Organization  we must address the issue ofconflicts seriously. Conflict situations impededevelopment  provide an atmosphere for the illegalexploitation of resources  the abuse of children  theinflux of refugees  the spread of dangerous weaponsand the deepening of poverty  to mention just a fewaspects. Conflicts steal the dreams  hopes  aspirationsand opportunities of many  many people  especiallychildren. We must intensify our efforts in the search forthe peaceful and speedy resolution of conflicts.The conflicts in Africa continue to destabilize ourcontinent. The United Nations and its membershipmust intensify efforts to find solutions to the conflicts.The peaceful resolution of conflicts is afundamental tenet of Kenya’s foreign policy. It is amatter of record that I have spared no effort throughoutmy political career in search of peaceful solutions toconflicts in our region and elsewhere. Currently  Kenyais involved in peace negotiations in southern Sudan Somalia  Burundi and the Democratic Republic of theCongo. We would like more international involvementin peace efforts in Africa.The biggest challenge facing the Africancontinent today is the increasing level of poverty.Poverty has become an obstacle  a roadblock to everyeffort we are making at improving the overall welfareof our people.Poverty is a fertile breeding ground for conflictand instability  and even terrorism. It is thereforeregrettable that very little progress  if any  has beenmade since the World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen in 1995. I remind members that themain outcome of that Summit was the resolve toeradicate poverty as an obstacle to humandevelopment.We cannot succeed in improving the lives of ourpeople without the wholehearted engagement of theinternational community. The global target of reducingpoverty by half by the year 2015 cannot be achievedwithout tangible availability of resources.Our efforts at attacking poverty are furtherundermined by the scourge of HIV/AIDS and othertreatable diseases like malaria and tuberculosis  whichhave the potential of reversing all the socio-economicgains we have worked so hard to achieve.I applaud the Secretary-General for organizing aspecial session on HIV/AIDS earlier this year. Theestablishment of the Global AIDS Fund is a verywelcome development. I look forward to itscontribution and active participation in our dailystruggle against HIV/AIDS. Kenya calls on theinternational community to lend its full support to thefund.The effect of marginalization on developingcountries posed by the accelerated process ofglobalization must be addressed as a matter of priority.It is my hope that the Fourth World Trade OrganizationMinisterial Conference in Doha  Qatar  will address theissue of the imbalance in international trade moreeffectively. The issue of meaningful market access particularly for agricultural products  must be resolvedquickly. Protectionist policies are in no country'sinterest and definitely contradict the principles of freetrade and the process of liberalization. In addition resources must be made available to the World TradeOrganization by our partners to enable it to providetechnical assistance and capacity-building todeveloping countries.Solutions in the form of better terms of trade andmarket access must go hand-in-hand with the flow offoreign direct investment to developing countries.Many African countries have taken bold initiatives toprovide a conducive environment for investors. Theseefforts need to be supported by clear policies ofdeveloped countries to encourage private sectorinvestment in Africa.We urgently need to be freed from the burdensthat are diverting vital resources from our economicdevelopment. Debt relief is necessary. It is in our5common interest that our economies be restored tohealth in a meaningful time frame.My concluding remarks relate to the desire forequity  fair play and justice for all. This is one of thecardinal objectives of the United Nations. I welcomethe efforts that the Organization has made in the pursuitof these objectives.We welcome these efforts. Yet it is a matter ofconcern that commitments in the programmes of actionagreed upon have not been fully complied with. Thissituation must be reversed. My challenge to theOrganization is that these commitments be honoured sothat humanity can feel that the United Nations is trulyan organization of hope for many nations and peoplesthroughout the world. We cannot continue doing whathas so far failed. We need to work on new ways ofaddressing our common problems. My Governmentstands ready to do its part  and I challenge otherGovernments to do theirs. Together we shall succeed inmeeting our commitments to have poverty reduced byhalf by 2015."
"89",3726,"KGZ",56,2001,"﻿Osmonakun IbraimovIwould like at the outset to join in all thecongratulations that have been extended to thePresident on his election as President of the fifty-sixthsession of the General Assembly. I would like to assurehim that our delegation is ready to cooperate fully withhim and also to wish him  on behalf of the Kyrgyzdelegation  success in carrying out his duties.Our delegation would also like to take thisopportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  on his re-election to a second term ofoffice and also on his winning the Nobel Peace Prize together with the United Nations  this year. Weconsider that this award was well deserved.The work of this session is taking place at anextremely complex time for the internationalcommunity. Today  from this lofty rostrum  on behalfof the people of Kyrgyzstan  I convey our deepestcondolences to the people and the Government of theUnited States in connection with the tragic events of 11September this year  which claimed many victims.Terrorism has laid down an extremely dangerouschallenge to all of civilized humanity  democracy andfreedom. In this context  the efforts of the internationalcommunity aimed at combating terrorism  first andforemost within the framework of the United Nations are fully supported by Kyrgyzstan  and ourGovernment is taking all necessary measures toimplement Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001)and 1373 (2001). From the very outset  we havesupported and will continue to support the activities ofthe United States and other countries within the anti-terrorist coalition  and consider the military operationsto be inevitable and justified actions.Our position of principle with respect to terrorismstems from Kyrgyzstan’s position at the epicentre ofthe struggle against international terrorism and againstthe illegal trafficking in drugs and weapons  which area threat to the stability and security not only of theCentral Asian region but of the entire civilized world.Our country has for three years been defending itselfagainst incursions by terrorist bands that have resultedin the deaths of entirely innocent people. If it had notbeen for our firm determination to take a stand againstterrorism and keep a firm lock on our borders  thenserious destabilization of the entire region would havebeen inevitable. We do not wish to exaggerate our role but it is we who have prevented the terrorists from5crossing our borders into other countries. I would alsolike to note that Kyrgyzstan has also made its territoryavailable and the necessary transport vehicles for thetransit of international humanitarian assistance toAfghanistan on the Osh-Ishkashim-Faizabad road.A serious problem for us is that of refugees whohave come to the territory of our Republic from theregion of the conflict. Kyrgyzstan already hostsapproximately 2 000 Afghan refugees. Their numberscould increase very rapidly. All of this is a very seriousproblem  and finding a solution will require activeassistance from the relevant internationalorganizations.Over the last few years we have all seenAfghanistan become a sanctuary for variousinternational terrorist organizations. After the fall ofKabul yesterday  the inter-Afghan conflict has entereda completely new phase. Moreover  it is now moreurgent than ever to deal with the question of a mutuallyacceptable solution to untie the Afghan knot.Kyrgyzstan proceeds from a deep understanding of theneed for rapidly winding up the military confrontationin Afghanistan  with the subsequent formation in thatlong-suffering country of a broadly representative multi-ethnic Government  that  first and foremost meets the interests and aspirations of the Afghanpeople.In this connection  Kyrgyzstan welcomesconstructive ideas and proposals aimed at establishinga long-awaited peace in Afghanistan. For our part  weconsistently express our readiness to cooperate with allthe countries involved in order to settle the Afghanconflict. We consider that it is precisely the UnitedNations  with its experience  capabilities andinstitutional potential  that should play a key role inbringing together the efforts of the internationalcommunity to combat terrorism. In this regard Kyrgyzstan proposes the creation of a specialcommittee of the United Nations to restore peace andstability in Afghanistan  which could be a coordinatingbody for all the practical measures to this end.Today we would like to recall one of the well-known initiatives of the President of Kyrgyzstan  AskarAkayev  to hold a forum for dialogue on securityquestions between the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Organization ofthe Islamic Conference. It seems to us that there is nowan urgent need for such a dialogue between these twoauthoritative organizations. In this connection Kyrgyzstan took the very important initiative to holdon 13-14 December of this year  under the aegis of theOSCE in Bishkek  the capital of Kyrgyzstan  aninternational conference on enhancing security andstability in Central Asia and strengtheningcomprehensive efforts to counter terrorism. We arenow making active preparations  together with thesecretariat of the OSCE  for this important measure. Inour view  the participation of the United Nations in thatevent would facilitate a consolidated solution forworking out joint approaches to combating terrorism.This would be an important step in strengthening theinternational community’s capacity to avert the threatto security in Central Asia  including by expanding theassistance to countries in that region in the face of thegrowing threat. It is encouraging to note that manyStates  including participants in the anti-terroristcoalition  are showing serious interest in the Bishkekinternational conference to combat terrorism.Kyrgyzstan attaches great importance toquestions of sustainable development. In this regard my delegation greatly appreciates the decision of thefifty-fifth session of the General Assembly to hold aWorld Summit on Sustainable Development inJohannesburg  South Africa. It is a pleasure to note thatKyrgyzstan made a very significant contribution to thepreparation of the Rio + 10 summit on problems ofsustainable development  having organized  togetherwith the United Nations Secretariat  in Bishkek  aregional round table. The results of the round table willcertainly be reflected in the key documents of theWorld Summit in Johannesburg.As we well know  the United Nations hasproclaimed next year the International Year ofMountains. This is certainly a very important andproductive initiative on a global level. We  themembers of the delegation of Kyrgyz Republic  canindeed be proud that one of the most importantinitiatives of the International Year of Mountains wastaken by our President  Askar Akayev.It is indeed true that the mountains of the worldare a symbol of the lofty ideals of humankind  butmountains also pose related ecological  economic andsocial problems for the people living in those areas.High mountains should not cause these problems fortheir inhabitants. I fully agree fully with Mrs. BenitaFerrero-Waldner  the Foreign Minister of Austria  thatthe International Year of Mountains should be a year6for new initiatives for exchanging experience anddrafting new programmes of cooperation.The acuity of the ecological problems ofmountainous areas and their connection to economicproblems led our specialists to examine internationalexperience in order to see how to restructure our debtsby seeking debt-relief in exchange for ecologicalinitiatives. We feel that this approach provides a uniqueopportunity for financing national ecological andenvironmental projects and economic investmentprogrammes. We should also like to express the hopethat at the upcoming International Conference onFinancing for Development in Mexico  sufficientattention will be given to the specific problems ofmountainous countries.We wish to take this opportunity to welcome thedecision of Member States to hold an official openingceremony for the International Year of Mountains inNew York in December of next year. We also note withgreat satisfaction that in October 2002  the capital ofKyrgyzstan  Bishkek  will welcome representativesfrom all over the world for the Bishkek GlobalMountain Summit. We are already preparing for thisvery important event  which will take place during theInternational Year of Mountains. We wish to expressour hope that the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  Mr. Kofi Annan  will be able participate in theSummit.In conclusion  I should like to express our deepconviction that the efforts of United Nations MemberStates and the entire world community are aimed atimplementing the ideals and principles enshrined in theMillennium Declaration and the United NationsCharter  and that they will lead to the triumph of peace freedom and democracy."
"90",3769,"KHM",56,2001,"﻿I wish to joinother representatives in congratulating you  Sir  onyour unanimous election as President of the fifty-sixthsession of the General Assembly. We are confident that27under your able guidance the work of this GeneralAssembly session will be another milestone on the newinternational scene  particularly in confronting the newchallenges facing our world  especially after theextremely tragic terrorist attacks of 11 September onthe World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagonin Washington  D.C.I believe that the world has completely changedsince the attacks against the United States of America the deadliest terrorist attacks ever committed  in whichso many innocent lives were lost. These acts ofterrorism shook the world as the images of destructionwere broadcast live. They were undoubtedly crimesagainst humanity. We must strongly condemn theseterrorist acts. We cannot forget those who lost theirlives and the families of the victims. In this regard  Iwish to extend  on behalf of the people and the RoyalGovernment of Cambodia  our most sincerecondolences to the families of the innocent victims andthe Government of the United States of America.Cambodia fully supports the United Nationsresolutions condemning the acts of terrorism againstthe United States. Cambodia also fully endorses theinternational efforts in combating terrorism in all itsforms and manifestations. Cambodia is disturbed however  over the loss of innocent civilian lives as aresult of the bombings in Afghanistan. We must doeverything possible to avoid civilian casualties and lossof life.In order to find solutions to the current problemsfacing our world  I believe that we need to look intonot only the root causes of terrorism but also the othercontributing factors that are confronting the worldtoday. First  we need to look for a just and lastingpeace in the Middle East  in particular a solution to thePalestine problem. We need to respect the fundamentalright of self-determination of the Palestinian people. Inthis regard  Cambodia supports the creation of aPalestinian State as early as possible. One may arguethat the present situation in the world may have openeda window of opportunity for finding solutions to theongoing conflict in the Middle East. I believe that allparties concerned should  and I hope that they will give peace in the region a chance  which is the way toovercome the lingering conflict in the region.Secondly  the increase in poverty in the world isanother crucial problem that must be addressed withsome sense of urgency and collective responsibility.Poverty is unquestionably one of the major causes ofthe problems in the world today. I think that all nationsmust join hands to fight poverty throughout the world.At the same time  we must work to reduce thewidening gap between the developed and developingcountries.In this regard  it is important for us to recall lastyear’s Millennium Declaration  whose main thrust wasa war on poverty in the most comprehensive and mostinclusive manner possible. For the developingcountries  one of the main challenges in the war onpoverty is managing the negative side of an irreversibleprocess of globalization. The key question is how tobest integrate ourselves into an ever-acceleratingprocess of globalization so that the developingcountries will not be left out or continue to be furthermarginalized. The process of globalization is a realitywithout precedent  and no country in this world isimmune to  or able to opt out of  the process.At the same time  we should work collectivelytowards minimizing the negative impact ofglobalization  which would enable the developingcountries to pursue sustainable development andpoverty reduction and provide the necessary tools forthe people to improve their standards of living.Moreover  we think that if there is no mechanism orprinciple which is universally accepted in order tomanage globalization  the gap between the developedand developing countries will further widen in thefuture. This is a problem of human security  which theinternational community must consider findingappropriate ways and means of addressing.Thirdly  another side effect of poverty is thegrowing epidemic of HIV/AIDS worldwide  acrossregions and continents  affecting mostly the poor andthe developing countries. Therefore  we believe thatthe rich  developed countries should do more to help inthe fight against the global HIV/AIDS epidemic.Fourthly  as a contributing factor for combatingterrorism  we should attempt to find practical solutionsto the growing threat of the proliferation of nuclearweapons and the illegal trade of small arms and lightweapons around the globe. In this context  Cambodiafully agrees with the Secretary-General’s statement atthe Millennium Summit that the issues of nuclearweapons and illicit trade in small arms and lightweapons should be given the highest priority on theUnited Nations agenda in the area of arms control and28disarmament. In this context  Cambodia wishes to callupon all countries to respect all the nuclear-weapons-related treaties  including the Anti-Ballistic Missile(ABM) Treaty. Cambodia strongly believes that theinternational community should work towards agradual reduction of nuclear stockpiles to a minimallevel  and non-proliferation and non-production of suchweapons in the future  which should be the basis forbuilding and maintaining a peaceful  safe and nuclear-free world.(spoke in French)As a country that has suffered considerably fromthe proliferation of small arms  Cambodia welcomesthe adoption of the Programme of Action at theconclusion of the United Nations Conference on theIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in AllIts Aspects. In this regard  I congratulate the UnitedNations on taking bold steps in addressing this vitallyimportant issue. Since 1998  the Royal Government ofCambodia has carried out a nationwide campaign toaddress the problems regarding such arms. So far morethat 120 000 small arms and light weapons have beenconfiscated  and more than 50 percent of them havebeen destroyed in the framework of an operationnamed “Flames for Peace.”Fifthly  for the United Nations to play a greaterrole in addressing the increasing number of complexproblems that are now arising  the Kingdom ofCambodia is of the view that the General Assemblyand the Security Council must be reformed so that theybecome more effective and more efficient. As we mayrecall  one of the most important pledges contained inlast year’s Millennium Declaration was therevitalization of the General Assembly. While progressin the structural and procedural aspects of the GeneralAssembly are vitally important  we must not lose sightof the primary objective of this exercise  which is toreturn to the General Assembly its original function asthe chief deliberative and representative body of theUnited Nations. In other words  the internationalcommunity  especially the United Nations as a whole must play a constructive and proactive role  withoutexclusivity  including in the struggle against terrorism.I also believe that the current global situationjustifies a call for a constructive and timely reform ofthe Security Council  which must reflect the realitiesand needs of the world today. The Security Councilmust be reformed to be made more representative more democratic and more effective in its decision-making processes. Its membership and structure passed down since 1945  are inarguably outdated andno longer reflect the political  economic  social anddemographic realities of our time or  apparently  thegrowing issues of human security.As the United Nations Charter mandates theSecurity Council’s responsibility in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  it is important for usto ensure that the interests of all nations are sufficientlyreflected in the Council’s composition and votingprocedures. It is unacceptable  however  that the twothirds of the world’s population residing in thedeveloping countries are not equitably represented inthe Council. Such practices could jeopardize theCouncil’s credibility in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. In this regard Cambodia supports the decision of the non-alignedcountries in favour of an additional increase in thenumber of permanent and non-permanent members andin particular reiterates its strong support for Japan Germany and India as candidates for permanentmembership of the Security Council.In conclusion  it is clear that we are living in afast-changing world in which the rapid pace ofglobalization and growing interdependence are theorder of the day. Peace  stability and prosperity areinterrelated and affect all nations and peoples on thisplanet  especially following the extremely tragicterrorist attacks in September. It is therefore essentialthat we work together to build a genuine community ofnations in which the gap between the developed andthe developing countries is reduced; in which the threatof terrorism and nuclear annihilation are eliminated; inwhich the danger of a global HIV/AIDS epidemic ismitigated; and in which poverty is alleviated. This cancome about only through the development of a moregenuine cooperation  the fostering of enhanced mutualrespect  the cultivation of greater tolerance  thepromotion of better understanding and the emergenceof a broader spirit of true union among nations in aworld that works on behalf of all.I strongly believe that we can achieve all thisthrough collective will and actions that will help us tousher in a new and brighter future for our world — aworld free of terrorism  a world of stability  peace 29security  development and prosperity for all peoples inthe twenty-first century.Finally  I am pleased to express  on behalf of theRoyal Government of Cambodia  our very warmcongratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-election toa second term in the noble post of Secretary-General. Ido believe that  with his dedication and long-standingexperience in dealing with the many challenges facedby the United Nations  the Secretary-General willcertainly achieve more success for the sake of peaceand stability for all nations Members of the UnitedNations."
"91",3814,"KNA",56,2001,"﻿It gives megreat pleasure to convey to Mr. Han Seung-sooheartfelt congratulations  on behalf of my delegationand the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis  on hisaccession to the honourable post of President of thefifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.I would also like to congratulate his predecessoron a job well done  especially during such anexhausting period for the United Nations. The successof the United Nations is built on the hard work of itsMembers  and both the President and his predecessorhave shown dedication to the positive functioning ofthis esteemed institution.In the last decade  world leaders have beenworking tirelessly in different forums to redefine andaddress the myriad challenges that characterize the so-called new order. This has placed a great premium onthe United Nations  which has provided an ableplatform for exchanges of ideas  practical dialogue andconflict resolution. My delegation is satisfied thatmarked progress has been made in identifying many ofthe critical issues. The United Nations deserves highpraise  and we commend Member States for theirwillingness to use the diplomatic and politicalresources of the Organization in the conduct of theirinternational relations.The involvement of the United Nations in recenttimes is a fitting backdrop for the decision that thecoming year will be designated the Year of Dialogueamong Civilizations. This is most timely  and it servesas a revalidation of our belief that dialogue is a criticalingredient in promoting partnership and improvedunderstanding among Governments and peoples.Dialogue is the foundation of solid democracies strong people-centred institutions  civil societies andsustainable human development. Dialogue is still thatvery important catalyst which often staves off war andconflict  enabling consensus and confidence-buildingin an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust. Thus  it isquite obvious why the Government of Saint Kitts andNevis supports this idea.In a certain sense  a new world order dawned on11 September 2001  when terrorism  in a mostoutrageous form  reared its ugly head in the cities ofWashington and New York  in the United States ofAmerica  with the loss of thousands of innocent lives.Dialogue among members of the internationalcommunity rapidly spawned an anti-terrorism coalitionof countries  thereby defining the protagonists in thisunfolding new order. My country stands solidly withthis coalition  especially in pursuing the generallyagreed strategies to contain terrorism. Despite thehorrendous act of 11 September and subsequentbioterrorism  life goes on  adjusted to a new reality.Another opportunity where dialogue may proveuseful in advancing human security will come whenGovernments meet at the International Conference onFinancing for Development in Monterrey  Mexico nextyear. Saint Kitts and Nevis regards this as an importantoccasion to promote the interests of all nations. But  weare especially hopeful that this Conference willembrace the aspirations and promote betterappreciation for the needs  vulnerabilities and specialcircumstances of small economies in small islanddeveloping States.23My Prime Minister has repeatedly urged theinternational community to take a more unbiased lookat the peculiar situation of small  vulnerableeconomies. This is not an appeal for internationalcharity  but a signal to promote the kind of realismthrough which a Marshall Plan of commitment can bedevised to energize small  vulnerable economies so thatthey can effectively participate in a globalizedeconomy.Dialogue is important in building realparticipatory democracies. But democracy amongnations is as crucial as democracy within nations.When the people we serve feel that our actions asleaders do not reflect their dreams  goals andaspirations  they may use their democratic right toeffect change. We have a duty  therefore  to give loudvoices to their silent legitimate hopes. We must placeadded value on the hopes and expectations of ourpeople in order to legitimize the concepts ofrepresentative democracy.It is within this context that I urge this body toredouble its efforts in finding a solution to theunfortunate stalemate that beleaguers relations betweenthe Chinese people across the Taiwan Straits. MyGovernment remains convinced that both sides of theTaiwan Straits should become fully engaged in thispeaceful and non-coercive process without thedistraction of preconditions. It would lead to thesuccessful resolution of what appears to be a verycontentious issue. At the same time  we encourage theUnited Nations to be vigilant and ready to assist wherepossible or when required. Prior to the peacefulsettlement of their dispute  it is imperative that weestablish a mechanism by which the internationalcommunity can benefit more appropriately from theproven expertise  technical know-how and skills of the23 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan.We call on the United Nations to assist in theresolution of the question of full inclusion of Cuba intothe affairs of the western hemisphere. Also  we urgethe people of Cuba  as we celebrate the Year ofDialogue among Civilizations  to embrace thechallenge of ensuring that they can participate fully inthe community of nations.Participatory democracy among nations must beerected on the twin pillars of mutual respect and trust.But trust wanes in the face of unilateral actions such asthreats made by the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD) countries toblacklist and impose sanctions on sovereign CaribbeanGovernments  consequent upon the OECD countries’misunderstanding of fiscal initiatives taken bysovereign Caribbean Governments as a way tounderpin sustainable economic development.As we celebrate the Year of Dialogue amongCivilizations  we urge Member States to resist the lureof national paternalism and unilateral action as a meansof problem-solving. In a matter so crucial to theeconomic future of Caribbean countries  it isinconceivable that conclusions could have beenreached and decisions arrived at without the courtesyof dialogue with the very countries against whom suchscathing indictments had been made. However  mostrecently  wiser counsel has prevailed and  in a spirit ofdialogue and partnership  significant progress has beenmade by means of a compromise agreement. TheCaribbean Community hails this agreement on offshorefiscal initiatives as a step in the right direction. Such isthe power of dialogue among civilizations.We imagine that the mechanisms of globalization if timely and equitably applied  can be productive inclusive  and improve lives. It must be emphasizedthat  although small States may justifiably harboursome apprehension about globalization  we do notoppose it. On the contrary  we welcome theopportunities to empower our citizens so that they maycompete successfully in a global marketplace  mindfulthat empowerment and the ability to competesuccessfully  however  require appropriate skill-sets academic resources and material tools. In order forsmall States to benefit fully from the new economicorder  the global agenda must become a humaneagenda  sufficiently responsive to facilitate equitableand affordable access to modern technology — that isto say  technology that is appropriate and responsive tothe basic needs of poor communities and small States.Without realism and a holistic approach inexamining the social and economic conditions withinsmall States  there is a potential for serious dislocationwhen these States attempt to operate within the globalmarketplace. As responsible Member States  we have agenuine obligation to work towards improving the livesof the disenfranchised. This  I am sure  is the mainreason we are here today. Therefore  we must continueto right this important chapter in the development ofhuman security. We must also remain cognizant that  asmembers of the global village  we have to discard old24suspicions and embrace new partnerships  dialogue anddiversity as necessary components of ourinterdependence.Partnership and understanding will proveessential in our efforts to tackle common problemssuch as drug trafficking and the pandemic ofHIV/AIDS. The special session on HIV/AIDS came atan important juncture  and we urge Member States tosupport the decisions that were taken. In small States like Saint Kitts and Nevis  the pandemic of HIV/AIDSpresents one of the most devastating challenges to thedevelopment of human security  because such a diseasethreatens to unravel the delicately woven balance ofsocial growth and economic potential.Our people are at great risk  and the prospect oflosing decades of development and talented people tothis illness is amazingly real. On top of losing theiryoung and most productive people  Governments areexpected in turn to reallocate significant amounts ofalready meagre resources from critical developmentprograms to provide costly care and treatment. Wesalute the United States Government  the World Bank and others for their recent and important initiatives tohelp fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the Caribbeanand we urge others to adopt similar initiatives.We see what an important role dialogue is playingin the hemispheric approach at the Organization ofAmerican States (OAS) through the MultilateralEvaluation Mechanism. This allows memberGovernments to collaborate in the fight against drugtrafficking  in supply and demand initiatives and in theimplementation of national or shared strategies. Webelieve this approach is useful  because it makescommon approaches more frequent  discouragesunilateral actions and allows member States to shareexperiences on interdiction  the epidemiology of drugabuse and other trends. The fight against drugtrafficking  you will agree  is a transnational one. Wecannot point fingers or apportion blame. We need totake action.Saint Kitts and Nevis welcomes the approach ofthe OAS  which permits us in the Caribbean to work ina multilateral framework to find common solutions.Equally  such a mechanism focuses attention on theroot problems and encourages hemispheric partnership.We hope that these kinds of approaches will becomeintegral components of problem solving at the UnitedNations.In closing  the past year was particularly eventful.We began with the Millennium Summit and concludedwith the HIV/AIDS special session. In between  weinteracted on many contentious issues. It is my hopethat during the new year we can move forward withrenewed vigour  building on the hard work that ourpredecessors left in our charge  and paving the way fora brighter future for those to whom we will pass thebaton. Once again  we salute the President on behalf ofthe people of Saint Kitts and Nevis."
"92",3840,"KOR",56,2001,"﻿Before all else  on behalf of the Government andpeople of the Republic of Korea  I wish to convey ourdeepest condolences and sympathy to the bereavedfamilies and friends of those who lost lives in thehorrendous terrorist attacks of 11 September. Thisunprecedented criminal act has posed a grave threat tointernational peace and security  as well as a seriouschallenge to human dignity. Such terrorist actsconstitute a crime against humanity and civilizationthat cannot be justified by any cause.To forestall the recurrence of such incidents andto eradicate international terrorism  comprehensive andcommon efforts at the international level are urgentlyneeded. The United Nations is expected to play animportant role in these efforts. Immediately after theterrorist attacks in September  the Security Council andthe General Assembly adopted resolutions denouncingterrorism and calling for measures for its elimination.This prompt action  as well as the ensuing debates atthe United Nations  attest to the major role to be playedby the Organization in the anti-terrorism effort.The Government of the Republic of Korea willcontinue to actively take part in the measures taken bythe United Nations  including the implementation ofSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001)  and will jointhe effort to free the international community from thescourge of terrorism. At the same time  we will spareno effort in rendering humanitarian assistance to therefugees who have been displaced as a result of the waragainst terrorism.Furthermore  in preparing to co-host the 2002Korea/Japan FIFA World Cup  we will do our utmost toensure that the event is held in a secure atmospherefree from the threat of terrorism.I stand here with much reminiscence. TheRepublic of Korea  once one of the major recipients ofUnited Nations assistance  is now an active contributorto the effort to realize the ideals and goals of this body.It is also the country whose Minister for ForeignAffairs had the honour of presiding over the firstsession of the General Assembly in the new century.The birth of the Republic and its developmentthereafter owe a great deal to United Nations34assistance. Indeed  the Government of the Republic ofKorea was born from the United Nations-supervisedelections held pursuant to the United Nationsresolution calling for an independent Government inKorea. During the Korean war  in the early 1950s  wewere able to defend our country  thanks to theparticipation and noble sacrifice of the United Nationsforces.After the war  as the Korean people strove toovercome the war’s devastation  rebuild the country achieve economic development and emerge ademocracy  upholding human rights  we foundenormous strength and encouragement in the supportand cooperation rendered by the United Nations. TheKorean people will never forget this. We will redoubleour efforts to do our share for the cause of global peaceand prosperity  as enshrined in the Charter.Looking back on the Republic of Korea’s arduousand eventful process of development over the past halfcentury  we see that it is an exemplary case of all thegood that can be achieved when the internationalcommunity works closely with a people determined toovercome poverty and the legacy of conflict in order tobuild a better future for themselves.Ten years have passed since the simultaneousadmission of the Republic of Korea and the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea to the United Nations. Inthe intervening decade  particularly during recentyears  much progress has been made in inter-Koreanrelations. Taking this opportunity  I would like tobriefly touch upon the peace process that is unfoldingon the Korean peninsula — an effort for which we seekmembers’ continuing support.The first inter-Korean summit  held in June 2000 was truly a historic event for peace  not only on theKorean peninsula  but also in East Asia and indeed theworld. Before the summit  the Korean peninsula hadremained a lone island where the cold war maintainedits foothold. The summit initiated the process ofmelting away that foothold — the icy wall of hostilityand confrontation that had thickened between Southand North Korea over the past half century. The wholeworld welcomed the breakthrough  expressing highhopes for peace on the Korean peninsula  asexemplified here by the joint statement of the co-chairpersons of the Millennium Summit and theGeneral Assembly resolution.Since then positive changes have taken place onthe Korean peninsula. There have been three rounds ofreunions by members of separated families. At theopening of the Sydney Olympic Games  the world wasmoved to see South and North Korean athletes marchin together. The project to relink a railway and roadbetween the two Koreas is now under way. The firstSouth-North Defence Ministers’ meeting was held witha view to reducing tension and furthering peace.Meanwhile  North Korea has steadily expandedits diplomatic horizon  establishing diplomatic ties withmost countries of the European Union and manyothers. Such endeavours have been strongly welcomedand supported by the Republic of Korea  which hasstriven to shore up global support for the Korean peaceprocess.The goal of our sunshine policy of promotingengagement between South and North Korea is for thetwo sides to live together in peace and cooperation  inpreparation for peaceful unification. The engagementpolicy is actively supported by the whole world  not tomention the Korean people and key neighbourssurrounding the Korean peninsula. North Korea  too embraced the spirit of peace  reconciliation andcooperation Joint Declaration of 15 June 2000 issued atthe inter-Korean summit.The Government of the Republic of Korea willcontinue to do its utmost so that a lasting peace maytake root on the Korean peninsula and global peacemay be strengthened. We sincerely thank the UnitedNations and the leaders of the world for theencouragement they have given us so far. We shallcontinue to count on their steadfast support andcooperation.The work required of the United Nations in thetwenty-first century is no less than daunting. Numeroustasks lie ahead of us  such as fostering internationalpeace and security  promoting the common prosperityof the global village  advancing democracy and humanrights  eradicating poverty  combating transnationalcrime  protecting the environment and enhancinghuman well-being.Rising to these challenges  world leaders gatheredlast year at the Millennium Summit to reconfirm theirresponsibilities and to chart a new course for theinternational community in the twenty-first century.The Millennium Declaration aims at materializing a35new United Nations that can effectively meet the manychallenges faced by the international community.It should be appreciated in particular that theDeclaration sets concrete policy goals to free humanityfrom fear and poverty. Now the task before all StatesMembers of the United Nations is to muster the best oftheir wisdom and strength in devising andimplementing measures to fulfil the commitmentsoutlined in the Millennium Declaration. The Republicof Korea will actively cooperate with all otherMembers  so that these commitments may be carriedout faithfully.With the end of the cold war and the passing ofthe twentieth century  reconciliation and cooperationhave come to define the tenor of the evolving globalorder. However  genuine global peace has yet to beobtained. In many corners of the globe  the threat ofterrorism looms large  and conflicts and confrontationscaused by ethnic  religious and economic factors stillpersist. Far worse  the greatest victims are often themost vulnerable groups  such as children  women andethnic minorities. In this regard  I fully support theefforts of the United Nations to strengthen itscapability to prevent and resolve conflicts and to dealwith their aftermath. The conflict prevention andpeacekeeping function of the United Nations isessential for global peace  and the role of the UnitedNations in post-conflict peace-building should also beexpanded.Humanity in the twenty-first century is at themercy of rapid and sweeping changes that areunprecedented in the history of human civilization. Atthe core of the vortex lie the information technologyrevolution and globalization. If we fail to meet thechallenges posed by these trends  the promises of peaceand prosperity in the twenty-first century will not befulfilled. Member States of the United Nations mustgather their collective wisdom and will so that allmembers of the international community can enjoy thebenefits of globalization and the revolutionaryadvances in information and communicationtechnology.Against this backdrop  President Kim Dae-jungproposed building a trans-Eurasia information networkat the Asia-Europe Summit last year  with a view togalvanizing information exchange and cooperationbetween Asia and Europe to an unprecedented level. Inorder to narrow the information gap between nations international assistance is required  particularly inbuilding the information infrastructures and humanresources of developing countries. In this regard greater cooperation and attention on the part of thedeveloped countries are essential.Furthermore  the effective management of theglobal economy and poverty eradication in theunderdeveloped countries should be placed high on theagenda of global consultations. The visibility andtransparency of global financial markets should beenhanced by reinforcing the functions of theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)  the InternationalBank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) andother international financial organizations.The next round of World Trade Organization(WTO) talks should be launched as soon as possible inorder to strengthen free trade and the multilateraltrading system. In this regard  I hope the InternationalConference on Financing for Development  to be heldin March of next year  will succeed in devising acomprehensive plan to deal with issues related topoverty and development. We have to bear in mind thelesson drawn from history that fostering the middle-class through poverty eradication can lay a solidfoundation for democracy.As far as the environment is concerned international efforts to protect “Mother Nature” shouldbe carried out in a more effective and substantialmanner.In some advanced countries  the development ofbio-technology has reached such astonishing levels asto arouse fear of infringing upon the realm of God.While acknowledging the positive role such scientificadvancements may have in prolonging human life andimproving the quality of life  we need to prevent themfrom being misused and from becoming an affront tohuman dignity.Democracy and human rights are universal valuesthat must continue to be sought and upheld in thetwenty-first century. In recent decades  democracy andhuman rights have claimed many victories around theworld  but they have also suffered setbacks. Humanrights continue to be abused in many parts of the worldin the form of kidnapping and torture  illegalexecutions  discrimination and other violations. It isparticularly distressing that large-scale and systematicviolations of human rights persist in some regions ofconflict. Such deplorable acts cannot be tolerated. I36sincerely hope that the second conference of theCommunity of Democracies  to be held in Seoul inOctober of next year  will prove to be a milestone inthis regard.Humanity places great expectations upon theUnited Nations to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century and to make the most of the opportunitiesit brings  because this global body provides a uniqueforum for all the countries of the world together to seeksolutions to common problems in the spirit of mutualrespect and cooperation. To rise to the task  the UnitedNations requires ongoing reform. Its financial andorganizational foundations must be strengthened inaccordance with its expanding roles. In particular  thereform of the Security Council  given its importance toall Member States  must be achieved through generalagreement  with a view to making the Council morerepresentative  democratic and efficient.The United Nations must stand firmly at thecentre of efforts to further spread and consolidatemultilateralism around the world  based on the spirit ofmutual understanding and compromise. Tolerance anddialogue must be upheld in international relations if weare to make the twenty-first century an era of sharedprosperity and peaceful coexistence among diversecivilizations.The Republic of Korea will strive to contribute tothe further development of the United Nations in thespirit of repaying the generosity it has received fromthe international community. Befitting the country’sgrowing capabilities  the Republic of Korea’scontribution to the United Nations budget is to increasesignificantly in the coming years  in accordance withthe new scale of assessments adopted last year. Nextyear  it will become the tenth largest contributor to theregular budget of the United Nations. With its troopsnow taking part in the Organization’s peacekeepingmissions in East Timor and three other places  theRepublic of Korea will also continue to activelyparticipate in the United Nations endeavours for peaceand security.Furthermore  we will share our experiences ineconomic development and democratization with ourneighbours in the global village and do what we can tobridge the gap between the developing and developedcountries.I am convinced that the United Nations  on thestrength of the concerted efforts of all countriesrepresented here  will continue to be a beacon of hope lighting the road ahead for humanity in the twenty-firstcentury."
"93",3886,"KWT",56,2001,"﻿On behalf of the State of Kuwait  itgives me pleasure to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo and his friendly country  the Republic of Korea  on hiselection as President of the fifty-sixth session of theGeneral Assembly. The office he holds undoubtedlycarries enormous responsibility. My delegation offershim all the support and cooperation he needs to fulfilhis mandate. I wish here to pay tribute to hispredecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri  for his efficientstewardship of the last session of the Assembly.Let me take this opportunity to warmlycongratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan  jointlywith the United Nations  on the well-deserved award ofthe Nobel Peace Prize  and on his unprecedented earlyre-election to a second term. The renewal of Mr.Annan’s mandate by the international communityreflects deep confidence in his character andcapabilities  in addition to recognition of his pastrecord. We look forward to continuing to see him bringinto play his creative perspective in addressing a wholearray of complete and interrelated issues facing ourworld.Many of the questions and challenges facing ourcountries nowadays involve implications and risks thatcut across national borders of sovereign countries. It islittle wonder that our world has become a smallerplanet where geographical boundaries  culturaldiversity  economic status and ethnic multiplicity havebecome lesser factors in shielding communities againstglobal influences and  by the same token  haveprovided larger platforms for interaction with others.The fact that the world community is now seized withfighting terrorism is perhaps yet further compelling andclear evidence of the deep interaction among andcomplexity of States’ interests and concerns. Thestrong condemnation of the heinous terrorist actscommitted against the United States of America on 11September 2001 reflects the international community’srecognition that the real target of that assault is thepolitical  economic and social stability of the worldorder. Indeed  those attacks affected  withoutdiscrimination  virtually all nation States  allcontinents  all civilizations  all religions and all races.Kuwait  for its part  has had a long-standing andfirm position of total and unequivocal condemnation ofterrorism  irrespective of its form or manifestation.Thus  only hours after the commission of thosecriminal acts  which contravene and violate everyreligious concept and every cultural and humanitarianvalue system  the Government and people of Kuwaitcondemned them. I wish to reiterate here our deepsympathies and condolences to the bereaved familiesand to the friendly people of the United States ofAmerica. Let me reaffirm our full backing and supportfor all the efforts and measures adopted by theinternational coalition to destroy the dens and bases ofterrorism with a view to stamping out its roots  toapprehend the perpetrators of these criminal acts and tobring them to justice. In this regard  we call for thecompletion of work on the development of a rigorousinternational legal system with which all countries ofthe world would comply in good faith to eradicate thisevil.In compliance with Security Council resolution1373 (2001)  Kuwait has enacted specific measures toplug any loopholes that might be abused in charitablefund-raising activities and to ensure that any charityasset is used solely and exclusively for its original5legitimate purposes. Our competent authorities are nowin the process of taking further enforcement measuresto ensure universal and strict compliance.At a time when we condemn all acts of terrorism we have been truly surprised to hear some voices thathave started to mount intense and relentless campaignslinking terrorism with Islam. Those allegationsrepresent an obvious mistreatment of and injustice to adivine faith revealed by God Almighty to humankind toensure mercy and compassion on this planet. Islam is afaith that advocates peace  calls for tolerance  promotesamity and renounces bigotry and extremism. Suffice itto cite one verse from The Holy Koran:“Invite (all) to the WayOf thy Lord with wisdomAnd beautiful preaching” (The Holy Koran XVI:125)Therefore  we really cannot accept these tendencies inthe domestic or international mass media  regardless ofany excuse or pretext. Indeed  it is our commonresponsibility to challenge such pernicious campaignsin the interest of global social harmony.An effective fight against terrorism requiresmaximum international cooperation and coordination.It also demands a soul-searching review of ourpolitical  economic and social policies and practices indealing with current global challenges. The aim is todeny evil-doers any reason to carry out their terrorschemes to advance their own agendas.While we stress the importance and relevance ofall United Nations resolutions and instruments relatingto the suppression of terrorism  Kuwait endorses thecall to convene an international conference onterrorism. A key purpose of that proposed meetingwould be to set out a clear definition of terrorism thatdraws a line between terrorism as a phenomenon thatstrikes at international peace and security and the rightof peoples to struggle against occupation with a viewto achieving self-determination  in line with the Charterof the United Nations and the norms of internationallaw.Kuwait is in full sympathy with the friendlypeople of Afghanistan  who have endured a great andsteady decline in their living conditions for over 20years. The relentless conflicts and wars that haveafflicted Afghanistan for too long have destroyed theinfrastructure and resources of that country. In responseto the appeal of the Secretary-General seekingresources to meet the severe humanitarian crisis of theAfghan people  the Government of Kuwait hasannounced a donation of $3 million in support ofinternational humanitarian relief efforts. Threeshipments of relief aid have also been sent to theAfghan refugees. These supplies are distributed incoordination with the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees. Furthermore  backin Kuwait  we are organizing a public fund-raisingcampaign to solicit donations from individuals andprivate companies to alleviate the suffering of theAfghan people. The total yield of that effort now standsat over $8 million.With regard to the overall situation inAfghanistan  Kuwait maintains that internationalefforts should be maximized to bring about the long-awaited peace and security. National reconciliation anda national coalition Government  elected by the peopleof Afghanistan  that represent all factions and ethnicgroups are perhaps the most viable means to ensure thesustainability of the country and eventually its recoveryof normal status within the region and the world. Onlythen will the nation of Afghanistan be able to channelits energy and resources towards reconstruction anddevelopment.In the meantime  while we express our deepregret for the civilian casualties among the Afghanpopulation  we sincerely hope that the ongoing militaryoperations against the bastions of terrorism and theterrorists will cause no injuries to innocent  unarmedpeople who are totally powerless and helpless.Kuwait views the environment as a key commonheritage and destiny that must be preserved for futuregenerations. The bitter recent experience of the Gulfregion  where two devastating wars took place  has leftwide-scale environmental damage. Against thisbackground  Kuwait sponsored a draft resolutionsubmitted to the General Assembly to designate6 November of each year as the International Day forPreventing the Exploitation of the Environment in Warand Armed Conflict. Kuwait is grateful that theresolution was adopted by consensus. It is our hopethat this initiative will help to further promote a deeperuniversal awareness of the need to safeguard ourenvironment  which is the source of human life nowand in the future.6The eyes of the world have been fixed for overone year now on the valiant uprising of the Palestinianpeople  which arose as a natural and legitimateresponse to the continued Israeli occupation of thePalestinian territories and to the backtracking of theIsraeli Government from the accords it signed with thePalestinian side.The obvious policy of the Government of Israel isto reject any Palestinian  regional or internationalinitiative. Instead  it counts as a matter of policy on theuse of force; state terrorism and the creation of faitsaccomplis on the ground. It slams every door that isopened  designs new oppressive measures and triggersone crisis after another. Its overriding goal is to abortthe peace promise born in Madrid in 1991. Israel’sbarbaric practices  its blatant challenge to all UnitedNations resolutions and its excessive and unwarranteduse of lethal force in response to stone-throwingPalestinians have all combined to create anoverwhelming sense of despair  frustration and gloomin the Palestinian ranks.Here one must ponder the hard lessons we haveall learned from similar situations of unalloyed gloomand doom. It is precisely against this backdrop that theUnited Nations  the international community and theUnited States in particular  as a co-sponsor of theMiddle East peace process  must assume a specialinternational responsibility to mount an effective andmeaningful drive to force Israel to fulfil itsundertakings and commitments set forth in its bilateralagreements with the Palestinian Authority  as well as toimplement Security Council and General Assemblyresolutions  including those relating to the city ofJerusalem  with a view to preserving its Arab andIslamic character and its holy religious identity. Kuwaittherefore welcomes the indications of support by theUnited States for the establishment of an independentPalestinian State. We hope that this declared positionwill now be translated into concrete steps that willmove the whole peace process forward towards itslong-awaited outcome.In this context  let me stress that Kuwait willcontinue to support our Palestinian brothers and toprovide all possible political and material assistance tothem until they attain all their legitimate politicalrights  including the establishment of an independentPalestinian State on their own territory  with Jerusalemas its capital. In the same vein  Israel mustunconditionally withdraw from the Syrian Arab Golanand the Lebanese Shab’a farms.The main objective of Kuwait’s foreign policy isto consolidate security and stability throughout theArabian Gulf region. This goal will remain unmetunless and until Iraq implements all relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions. It is  indeed  regrettable that theGovernment of Iraq persists in its allegations that it hascarried out all its obligations under those resolutions.In addition  that Government continues to pursue itslong-standing hostile practices and policies towardsKuwait in order to heighten regional tension and todestabilize security and peace. Kuwait has repeatedlydrawn the attention of the Security Council and theSecretary-General to the non-peaceful intentions ofIraq  as exemplified by the recurrent threats made toKuwait’s security and sovereignty by many high-levelIraqi Government officials. Kuwait has also called onthe Security Council to bring pressure to bear on theIraqi Government so that it will honour all itsobligations and thereby make it possible to lift thesanctions affecting the brotherly people of Iraq and topermit that country to reclaim its normal status as anactive member regionally and internationally.When we discuss here the suffering of children women and the elderly  Kuwait cannot but recall itsown excruciating experience  endured over the pastdecade  relating to the question of Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners and hostages. In fact  this is a keyobligation that Iraq has so far failed to fulfil. This issueremains a top national priority for the Government andpeople of Kuwait.The humanitarian nature of this long-runningissue — the anguish that it is causing to the immediatefamilies of the prisoners and to our entirepopulation — means that resolution of the problemcannot be delayed any longer. The Government of Iraqalone bears responsibility for the lack of anymeaningful progress in implementing the relevantSecurity Council resolutions. Those resolutionsdemand  inter alia  that Iraq cooperate with theInternational Committee of the Red Cross and the high-level Coordinator  Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov  whowas appointed by the Secretary-General to facilitate thereturn of those prisoners and hostages. It is clear thatthe Government of Iraq is insensitive to thehumanitarian dimension of this matter. Thisinsensitivity is borne out by its insistence onboycotting the meetings of the ad hoc Tripartite7Commission and its Technical Subcommittee since itwalked away from those meetings for unjustifiablepolitical reasons in January 1999. Let me also reiterateour call to Iraq to return our stolen property  inparticular the State of Kuwait archives and otherofficial documents.Over the past few years  the world economicscene has undergone remarkable changes. We haveseen the emergence of several new economicphenomena created by the revolution in informationtechnology and the immense scientific progress incommunications and trade. These changes andphenomena have made it imperative for manycountries  especially the developing nations  tointroduce drastic changes to their economic plans andstructures in an attempt to benefit from the globalizedeconomy with a view to ensuring development andprogress for their societies. Despite the promise ofsubstantial benefits as a result of policies to liberalizeworld trade and eliminate customs barriers  we stillhave to make a concerted effort in order to make theglobalization process a positive force that benefits allthe peoples of the world. This will require the drawingup of regional and international guidelines andstandards that protect the nascent economies of thedeveloping nations from economic turbulence andcrises that might otherwise have an adverse impact onthe living conditions of their peoples.In the meantime  the developed countries and theinternational financial institutions should double theirfinancial aid to the developing countries in order toenable them to strengthen the underpinnings of theireconomic structures. In the long term  this will help toestablish more balanced economic relations built onmutual benefit and common interest. With that in mind Kuwait is pursuing a steadfast policy of support fordevelopmental projects in many developing countries.Most recently  Kuwait has contributed $1 million to thefund established by the Secretary-General to combatthe HIV/AIDS epidemic.On a parallel track  Kuwait is contributing to thefunding of many developmental programmes andprojects in the developing countries throughinternational and regional financial institutions  as wellas through many public Kuwaiti charitableorganizations. This philanthropy is motivated by asense of common social responsibility and socialinterdependence — values that are embedded in thetraditions of our Islamic faith.Let me close by saying that we look forward toparticipating actively in the forthcoming celebrationsof the Year of Dialogue among Civilizations.Hopefully  this will turn out to be another event thatunderscores our determination to promote andconsolidate the concepts of civilized tolerance andunderstanding among our nations and peoples  who allyearn to live free of self-inflicted conflicts and to enjoya prosperous life in which good and virtuous humantendencies prevail as a basis for international relations."
"94",3932,"LAO",56,2001,"﻿On behalf of the delegation of the LaoPeople’s Democratic Republic  allow me to joinprevious speakers in congratulating you  Sir  on yourwell-deserved election to preside over the fifty-sixthsession of the General Assembly. It is a tribute to theimportant contributions your country  the Republic ofKorea  has made throughout the past years to the workof our Organization.I should also like to take this opportunity to paytribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  forhis outstanding and effective leadership of ourOrganization. The prestigious Nobel Peace Prizeconferred on him is both a recognition of his personalachievements and an affirmation of the great andlegitimate mission undertaken by the United Nations.We wish him well and much success in his second termas head of the United Nations during the next fiveyears.The general debate of the fifty-sixth session ofthe General Assembly was not able to proceed asplanned  as a result of the terrorist attacks of 11September  which caused thousands of deaths. In thewake of this tragic event  the Government of the LaoPeople’s Democratic Republic condemned the terroristacts while reaffirming its consistent policy ofcooperating with the international community in thefight against terrorism in all its forms. In this respect in late October  the Lao People’s Democratic Republicdecided to become party to five internationalconventions on the fight against terrorism.10This tragedy has generated a set of ensuingevents. The Government of the Lao People’sDemocratic Republic views the current situation withgreat concern and considers that it is high time that ourOrganization played a growing role  in conformity withthe United Nations Charter  in the combat againstterrorism and for the peace and security of the peoplesof the world.Since its inception  the United Nations has madean important contribution to the maintenance of worldpeace and international security  as well as tocooperation and development in all areas of humanendeavour. Last year  at the historic Summit  the worldleaders reaffirmed the relevance and importance of ourOrganization in the new  globalized world. At thatsame Summit  we also pledged our commitment toensuring that the United Nations adapts to new areasand strengthens its capacity to deal with the challengesof maintaining world peace and promoting thedevelopment of all countries.Several issues inherited from the last centuryfailed to be addressed. Although the Open-endedWorking Group on Security Council reform has sparedno effort to fully carry out its mandate  the key issuesof the reform of the Council remain unsettled.Therefore  we reaffirm our position in favour of theexpansion of both the permanent and non-permanentmembership of the Security Council. Equally  wesupport the efforts to address the issue of the right ofveto and to find a solution acceptable to all MemberStates.The situation in the Middle East has recentlyreached levels of increased violence  causing loss oflife  destruction  damage to property and deep sorrowand a desire for revenge among both the Palestinianand Israeli peoples. The Lao People’s DemocraticRepublic reaffirms its support for the establishment ofan independent Palestinian State and for respect forIsrael’s right to existence. That would contribute toguaranteeing long-lasting peace and security in theMiddle East.Almost every year  the General Assembly hasoverwhelmingly adopted a resolution on lifting thecommercial and economic embargo against theRepublic of Cuba. However  those resolutions have notbeen effectively implemented. The Government of theLao People’s Democratic Republic appeals to theUnited States and Cuba to jointly reach a rapid solutionin the interest of the peoples of the two countries which would contribute to promoting peace anddevelopmental cooperation in the region and the world.On the Korean peninsula  several events havemarked the progress made towards the unification ofKorea  such as meetings and exchanges of visits ofleaders at all levels  reunions of families long keptapart and humanitarian assistance. The LaoGovernment has followed these developments closelyand commends the positive results. Nevertheless  weare deeply concerned about the situation prevailing inthe region and hope that under the wise guidance of theleaders of the two countries  the peaceful unification ofan independent Korea will be achieved so as to meetthe fervent aspirations of the Korean people and tocontribute to peace  stability and cooperation in EastAsia and throughout the world.In South-East Asia and the Asia-Pacific region several outstanding activities to promote peace andcooperation have gained prominence in the region andthroughout the world. In Hanoi  the Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forumreaffirmed the importance of preventive diplomacy confidence-building measures and avoiding militaryconfrontation. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation(APEC) meeting in China was a historic rally of unityin the fight against terrorism and in setting goals foreconomic recovery. The Summit of ASEAN membersplus China  Japan and the Republic of Korea  held inBrunei early this month  stressed the need to combatterrorism in all its forms  overcome economic recessionand promote development cooperation.The Lao People’s Democratic Republic noteswith satisfaction that the Third United NationsConference on the Least Developed Countries  held inMay this year  adopted a more realistic plan of actionto enable the least developed countries to emergedecisively from abject poverty and be integrated intothe global economic system. We very much hope thatthe international community will make joint efforts toachieve the development objectives enunciated in thatplan of action.For many years now  the international communityhas recognized that the landlocked developingcountries are one of the three vulnerable anddisadvantaged groups of developing countries. Theirvulnerable and disadvantaged condition is attributed tolack of access to the sea  remoteness from world11markets and prohibitive transport costs  averaging 14per cent of export earnings  compared to only 8.8 percent for other developing countries.The Lao People’s Democratic Republic  in itscapacity as Chairman of the Group of LandlockedDeveloping Countries  would like to appeal the GeneralAssembly to endorse the recommendation made by thefifth Meeting of Governmental Experts fromLandlocked and Transit Developing Countries and thedonor community to convene in 2003 an internationalministerial meeting of landlocked and transitdeveloping countries and the donor community ontransport cooperation  with the objective of addressingthe special problems and needs of the landlockeddeveloping countries. In this connection  we wish towelcome the Government of Kazakhstan’s offer to hostthe meeting.By the end of 2000  there were 36.1 millionpeople worldwide who had tested HIV-positive  ofwhom 90 per cent live in developing countries. It is ourhope that the international community will takenecessary drastic measures  including through theprovision of additional and sustained resources  toimplement the Declaration of Commitment onHIV/AIDS  adopted during the last special session ofthe General Assembly.Another issue of global concern is narcotic drugs.The production and abuse of drugs have increased andhave become a cause of crime affecting many socialdimensions. Realizing their own responsibilities ASEAN Governments and China convened aninternational conference in October 2000 in Thailand where a plan of action to make ASEAN a drug-freezone by 2015 was adopted. Also  a ministerial meetingbetween four countries — China  Laos  Myanmar andThailand — was held in August this year with theobjective of curbing drug production and trade and theimporting of chemical precursors in the subregion.In an effort to achieve the goals established bythe Political Declaration of the General Assemblyspecial session held in 1998 and to fully eradicateopium production  the Government of the Lao People’sDemocratic Republic has mobilized the people and together with donors and international organizations has taken various measures through tailoring projectsinvolving crop substitution  preventive education drug-addiction rehabilitation and law enforcement. Asa result  in the course of just three years  between 1998and 2000  opium-cultivated areas have been reducedfrom 26 000 hectares in 1998 to 17 000 hectares in2000. The aggregate opium production has alsodeclined from 140 tons to 117 tons for the same period.Moreover  on 12 October 2001  the Lao Governmentlaunched a National Anti-Narcotic Campaign  chairedby the Prime Minister  with a view to ensuring thatLaos is a drug-free country with a social order and abright future for the next generation.In general  over the last year  the Lao People’sDemocratic Republic has enjoyed firm politicalstability and progressive development in all sectors especially in food security. All this was reflected in thesolemn celebration of the twenty-fifth foundinganniversary of the Lao People’s Democratic Republicand the successful conclusion of the Seventh Congressof the Lao People’s Revolutionary Party. These historicevents have profoundly enhanced national patriotism  asense of self-reliance  self-resilience and ownership forthe Lao people. In carrying out our mandated task  wehave concentrated all our efforts and untapped strengthto achieve the goals of poverty reduction by halvingthe number of families currently living under thepoverty line  stopping slash-and-burn practices  fullyeradicating opium production by the year 2005  andcreating an environment that will enable the country toquit once and for all the status of least developedcountry by the year 2020.The first year of the twenty-first century haswitnessed new challenges that pose anxiety andconcern for all people worldwide. However  thetwentieth century has created institutional foundationsfor strengthening the legal and cooperative framework modern technology and partial reform of ourOrganization. In addition  dialogue and cooperationbetween countries in the economic  social and culturalfields and in other areas as well continue to be ageneral trend in the world. In this spirit  I believe thatthe United Nations  a unique and truly universalOrganization  reaffirmed by world leaders at theMillennium Summit last year  should play a significantrole in addressing these new challenges so that we canturn our world into a peaceful  happy and prosperousone."
"95",3975,"LBN",56,2001,"﻿Mr. President  allow me first to congratulate you onyour election as President of the fifty-sixth session ofthe General Assembly  which is meeting under criticaland exceptional circumstances. We wish you everysuccess in your arduous endeavours. I also wish tothank your predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri. In addition on this occasion  I would like to pay tribute toSecretary-General Kofi Annan for the efforts he hasmade throughout the year. We hope that he will be ableto enhance the prospects for peace  stability  anddevelopment in the world during his second term ofoffice.The whole world was shocked by the enormity ofthe tragedy that struck the United States of America on11 September — the barbaric terrorist acts against NewYork City and Washington  D.C. These acts exacted ahigh toll among innocent civilians and plunged thepeoples and countries of the world into an atmosphereof gloom and anxiety. We once again extend ourcondolences to the families who lost their loved ones;some of them were Lebanese  or American of Lebanesedescent. We share their deep sense of grief and sorrow.From this rostrum  I would like to reiterateLebanon’s condemnation of these terrorist attacks.Lebanon stands ready to cooperate seriously  positivelyand responsibly with the United States and the UnitedNations in the fight against terrorism  in accordancewith the rules of international law and with theprerogatives of national sovereignty.For a long time  Lebanon has suffered fromIsraeli occupation and Israel’s terrorist practices. Weresisted this occupation until it ultimately ended withIsrael’s withdrawal from most of our nationalterritories. It is perfectly normal in this context tostress the need for distinguishing between terrorism which we strongly condemn  and peoples’ legitimateright to struggle for the liberation of their territoriesfrom foreign occupation on the basis of the UnitedNations Charter and General Assembly resolutions. Asregards Lebanon  we have to refer to the AprilUnderstanding of 1996  an agreement which wasreached under the auspices of the United States andFrance after Israel had carried out the Qana Massacrethat same year  in addition to the Taif Agreement thathad laid down the tenets of our national reconciliation.A series of Security Council presidential statementshave given the Council’s blessing to the Agreement.Both the Taif Agreement and the April Understandingrecognized the legitimacy of resistance against theIsraeli occupation.Let me recall here that had Israel not invadedLebanon on 14 March 1978  there would have been noLebanese Resistance — which  of course  is the subjectof our pride — to counter this invasion.Had Security Council resolution 425 (1978)adopted on 19 March been implemented without delay as stipulated in its provisions  the Resistance would nothave been born.Had it not been for widening the scope of theIsraeli invasion of Lebanese territory and thesubsequent occupation of Beirut in 1982  theResistance would not have escalated.Had it not been for Israel’s persistence inoccupying what it called “the security zone”  no onewould have had to resist it and ultimately force it to14withdraw in May 2000 from most of the territories thatit had occupied.Had Israel not occupied the Palestinian territories there would have been no need for a courageousuprising against occupation.It must be pointed out that Lebanon is determinedto fight terrorism. We have acceded to 10 out of the 12conventions relevant to the question of internationalterrorism. We stand ready to respond positively to anyinternational initiative  including the convening of aninternational conference for this purpose  to arrive at astandard definition of terrorism. It would be wise not tolink terrorism to a particular race or religion particularly to Arabs and Muslims  if we want to avoidsetting world civilizations and religions on a collisioncourse. We can thus avoid falling into the trap designedby those who are pushing the world towards collision conflict and strife.Side by side with its Arab brothers  Lebanon isdetermined to exert additional efforts to combatterrorism and eradicate its various root causes. In 1998 Arab States successfully negotiated and concluded theArab Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism  aConvention with clear-cut purposes and objectives.The events of 11 September have demonstratedthat humanity has not yet reached its ultimateevolutionary stage. They also prove that unbridledglobal rejectionist movements and terrorist groups thatknow no boundaries and accept no restrictions arecapable of undermining our confidence in everythingwe have achieved so far. They are working to establishwhat can be referred to as a “new world disorder” andglobal instability.Under the circumstances  and given prevailingfears  a thorough look at what is happening in theMiddle East conflict zone would clearly reveal thedifficulty of realizing the objectives of peace anddevelopment promoted by the United Nations. In recentmonths  the world has witnessed continued Israelioccupation of Palestinian territories  unjust andarbitrary Israeli practices  desecration of holy sites blockades  killings  assassinations and displacements.Such acts continue with no international deterrence orcontrol.Intransigent Israeli policies  deviation from theMadrid principles and terms of reference  and strippingthe peace process of its political content in favour ofso-called Israeli security considerations indicate thatprojected solutions to the Middle East crisis aredivided among many conflicting rationales. There isthe rationale of a partial solution and that of acomprehensive solution; the rationale of basing asolution on force and that of basing it on what is right just and grounded in United Nations resolutions; therationale of achieving security at the expense of peaceand that of making peace the foundation of security.In the aftermath of 11 September  attention hasfocused on the need to step up the effort to find apolitical solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict  a solutionthat should allow the Palestinian people to establish anindependent Palestinian State on their national soil. Itis our duty to recall that a just and comprehensivepeace necessitates that we simultaneously address allaspects of the Middle East conflict. The Lebanese andSyrian tracks must not be separated from the track ofthe overall settlement. That track is stalled  andreviving it will require the devotion of additionalefforts. The liberation of Lebanese territories fromIsraeli occupation must be completed. Israel mustwithdraw from the entire occupied Syrian GolanHeights to the line of 4 June 1967. The question ofPalestinian refugees  their legitimate right to return and Lebanon’s right to oppose their resettlement on itsterritories must not be ignored. This opposition isgrounded in the principles of fairness  justice andsovereignty.In the light of the above  we believe that acomprehensive peace built on justice and on theresolutions conferring international legitimacy is thesole guarantee of the sustainability of any desirablesolution.There are two fundamental questions in Lebanonthat are of direct concern to the United Nations: one isthe mandate of the international forces in southernLebanon and the other is the destiny of Palestinianrefugees in Lebanon.In paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution1365 (2001)  which was adopted on 31 July  theSecurity Council requested the Secretary-General tosubmit a comprehensive report on the activities of theUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) taking into account its possible reconfiguration into anobserver mission in the light of the developments onthe ground  following appropriate consultations withthe Government of Lebanon.15Due to the gravity of the situation  and inanticipation of the Secretary-General’s report  it isimportant for me to stress from this rostrum that bothlogic and the realities on the ground call formaintaining Unifier’s existing mandate withoutamending it or reconfiguring the mission into anobserver force. On the contrary  we believe thatUNIFIL’s role must be strengthened  particularly as ithas not yet fulfilled the entire mandate entrusted to itby the international community in Security Councilresolution 425 (1978)  which was adopted on 19 March1978. That mandate cannot be implemented by anobserver force due to the following questions that arestill pending.The first pending question is the verification ofthe Israeli withdrawal from all Lebanese territories. Itis a known fact that the United Nations did not verifythe Israeli withdrawal from all Lebanese territories. Itonly verified the withdrawal of Israeli forces to a defacto withdrawal line  which became known as the blueline. That line is not in conformity with Lebanon’sinternationally recognized borders  a fact recognized insubsequent reports of the Secretary-General.Therefore  the Shab’a farms  on the slopes ofMount Hermon  remained under Israeli occupation together with three additional points along the line ofwithdrawal drawn by the United Nations. At the time Lebanon expressed its reservations on these points.These territories are Lebanese lands and Lebanonreserves its natural right to restore them and to extendits sovereignty to them. Lebanon would like to stresshere that it will stand up for every inch of its nationalsoil and for all its rights to its water resources  inaccordance with international law. In that regard  wemust draw attention to the fact that Israel continues toviolate Lebanese sovereignty on a daily basis. In hisreport issued in July of this year  the Secretary-Generaldescribed these violations as provocative. Furthermore Israel continues to increase the frequency of its threatsagainst Lebanon and Syria.The second pending question concerns therestoration of international peace and security. In hisreports to the Security Council between May 2000 andJuly 2001  the Secretary-General recognized thatUNIFIL had not fully implemented the task entrustedto it. He repeatedly said that there is a third task theinternational forces have yet to undertake  and onwhich UNIFIL will have to concentrate. That task isthe restoration of international peace and security inthe region. How can we speak of a third task yet to becompleted by UNIFIL under Security Councilresolution 425 (1978) and at the same time discuss thepossibility of reconfiguring UNIFIL into an observermission?In that respect  we are duty-bound to recall thatthe security of the region is indivisible. We would bedeceiving ourselves if we were to believe that peaceand security can be restored to the region outside thecontext of a comprehensive overall solution to allaspects of the conflict on all its tracks. Such anundertaking requires an all-inclusive effort  not only byUNIFIL but also by the entire United Nations  whichshould be responsible for the enforcement of itsresolutions  particularly resolution 242 (1967)  338(1973) and 425 (1978).From this rostrum  I call on the United NationsSecretariat and the Security Council to preserveUNIFIL’s existing mandate. The timing is of particularimportance  given the serious circumstances prevailingin our region and in the world. We must also recall thatin May of this year the Security Council adopted astatement in which members acknowledged Lebanon’sconcerns and apprehensions  including those relating tothe future.Lebanon is tirelessly seeking to achieve a totalIsraeli withdrawal from its territories. At the sametime  it attaches great importance to the release of theLebanese people kidnapped by Israel during itsoccupation of our land and thereafter detained in Israelijails. They remain incarcerated in Israeli prisons ashostages  in contravention of international laws andinstruments  particularly the Geneva Convention of1949 and the subsequent Protocols thereto.The 130 000 landmines that were left behind bythe Israeli occupation are still killing  maiming andharming scores of civilians in Lebanon. They curtailtheir freedom of movement and obstruct their work. Weconsider this to be a continued — albeit indirect —form of occupation of Lebanese territories by Israel. Inthe light of this situation  the United Nations and theinternational community should make a greater effortto compel Israel to hand over all maps and recordsdisclosing the locations of the mines  which have to becleared as soon a possible.However  with respect to the hundreds ofthousands of Palestinian refugees who have beenprovisionally hosted on Lebanese land ever since their16expulsion from their homes in Palestine — and forwhose final status the United Nations bears essentialresponsibility — we reiterate our demand for a justsolution to their cause  on the basis of theimplementation of their right to return and of ourrefusal to resettle them in Lebanon.In this regard  it behoves us to remember that theresettlement of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanonwould constitute a time bomb that would jeopardize thepeace  security and stability in the Middle East; suchrefugees will relentlessly seek to return to theirhomeland and Lebanon is unable to integrate them given the precariousness of its own internalequilibrium and the fact that provisions of its nationalpact do not allow for any form of resettlement.Furthermore  Lebanon appeals for greaterinternational attention to enable us to provide urgentlyneeded assistance that could help return our liberatedlands to normalcy  restore economic balance andprovide opportunities for growth after long years ofoccupation and destruction.This is an era of responsibility and accountabilityfor the world  but accountability cannot be selective nor can it be based on double standards. During thelong years of occupation of the Lebanese territories Israeli bombardment and the destruction that ensuedkilled thousands and injured and disabled thousandsmore. Our infrastructure  vital facilities  houses schools  farms and bridges were destroyed and ourgrowth and development were hindered. Lebanon musttherefore be adequately compensated. Lebanon willspare no effort in appealing to the relevant internationalpolitical and judicial organs to request that Israel makereparations for the damage resulting from its acts ofaggression.It may be useful to recall here that Israel did notwithdraw from most of the Lebanese territories of itsown accord; neither did it withdraw in compliance withthe decision of an international authority or in responseto a political requirement that remained on the table forover 22 years. Rather  it withdrew under pressure fromthe Lebanese resistance  which was embraced by theLebanese State. It withdrew because of thesteadfastness of the Lebanese people. Its withdrawalwas not a voluntary démarche for peace  as somewould have it. The withdrawal was a measure taken toavoid peace  and instead to seek alleged security at theexpense of the requirements of a just andcomprehensive peace.Lebanon is a democratic Arab country  open tothe world  with a civilization that goes back thousandsof years. Thanks to our diverse social composition  ourexperience is informed by coexistence and consensus.It is a unique experience  rarely paralleled in our worldtoday. We call on the Assembly to mobilize the forcesof peace and justice in order to redress the historicalinjustice inflicted upon the Palestinian people. TheAssembly must bring about a just and comprehensivesolution to one of the most complex and dangerousregional conflicts in the Middle East. It is a conflictthat has depleted the resources of its people  hinderedits progress and stunted its contributions to the world.This solution will unfetter its creative capabilities andenable it to develop a global partnership free from fear injustice and terror.My country is proud to be hosting the next ArabSummit  to be convened in Beirut in March next year.Preparations are already under way to receive the Arabmonarchs and presidents. We will also be hosting theNinth Summit of the International Organization of laFrancophonie in the fall of 2002  under the heading “Dialogue among cultures”. Lebanon is a foundingmember of the League of Arab States  the UnitedNations and the International Organization of laFrancophonie. Lebanon  which participated in draftingthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights  is capableof proving that it can reassert its active presence andagain take a pioneering role at the regional andinternational levels. We come from a time-honouredcivilization  and are blessed by unique anddistinguished experience of coexistence. We will putthis to the service of the noble objectives of the UnitedNations."
"96",4022,"LBR",56,2001,"﻿I am honoured toparticipate in this historic session on behalf of HisExcellency Dr. Charles Ghankay Taylor  President ofthe Republic of Liberia  and to share with theAssembly his contribution to this debate.I am pleased to congratulate the President on hison your election as President of the fifty-sixth GeneralAssembly. We wish to assure His Excellency of the fullcooperation of the Liberian delegation.May I also take this opportunity to acknowledgethe outgoing President  Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland for the very able manner in which he conducted thefifty-fifth session of the General Assembly.By the same token  I would like to congratulateour distinguished Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-election as Secretary-General and for thedistinguished recognition he received in being awardedthe Nobel Peace Prize  which  without a doubt  is aresult of his vision  commitment and the efficientmanner in which he has led and continues to lead ourorganization.On 11 September 2001  not very far from thisplace  which is dedicated to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  the world wasconfronted with a kind of terrorism that now renders allof us vulnerable. This terrorism is not confined to anyone group of people  nor is it confined to any onegeographical location  or to any particular ethnic orreligious group. Because of its transnational nature  theworld must come together and  in a coordinated andcollective manner  construct new models in answer tothis scourge. We must act without delay  and withoutunnecessary debate. We must act with determinationand urgency.25The problem of terrorism today requires that ourOrganization  the United Nations  should take the leadin coordinating and consolidating international effortsto tackle the new challenges that it raises. The UnitedNations should serve as a catalyst for these efforts  andnot another bureaucratic web of inaction and prolongeddebate. The United Nations — the institution thathumanity has charged with the responsibility for globalpeace and security — is today the subject of terroristthreats. We must match our words with deeds; we mustrespond to this scourge.My Government reiterates its condemnation  inthe strongest terms  of the barbaric and heinous acts ofterrorism perpetrated against the United States  leadingto unimaginable and enormous loss of lives andmassive destruction in New York  Washington  D.C. and Pennsylvania. My Government has made concreteoffers to the United States Government and theinternational coalition  and has taken strong measuresin keeping with Security Council resolution 1373(2001).I wish now to proceed to issue of reform of theUnited Nations. I believe  like the rest of you  thatreform implies change towards a more positivecondition. And I presume that when we speak of theUnited Nations  we speak of nations that have cometogether with a common interest to achieve a commonobjective. In essence  when we speak of reform  wemust accept that the conditions under which ournations have come together — with a common interestto achieve a common objective — are no longerpalatable and require change. The questions that manyof us continue to debate regard what changes we want and how to achieve those changes.However  I must interject a fundamental questionas to whether the conditions  practices and traditionsexist for a positive change  assuming we mean positivefor the collective good. In bringing about any positivechange for the collective good  a level playing fieldmust exist  in which the interest of the whole willfreely manifest itself in the change. A level playingfield should show the following characteristics:transparency; freedom; fairness; and democraticpractices.In terms of transparency  we must assume acondition in which the operation of and decision-making process within the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies are open. The Security Councilshould not deliberate in secrecy  as was the case duringthe pre-World War II years  in which secret diplomacyand alliance formations characterized the period.In terms of freedom  we must assume thatMembers of the United Nations can take decisions inthe absence of threats  coercion  fear and retribution.In terms of fairness  we must assume thatdecisions cannot be taken in contradiction to universalmoral imperatives  or to the detriment of the statehoodof a Member. Sanctions with adverse socio-economicand humanitarian consequences should not constitutepolitical tools available to a few Members.In terms of democratic practices  we must assumethat decision-making will be reflective of the will ofthe majority and not of a few; that all Members willhave an equal say and equal participation.Unfortunately  the contrary of these preconditionsconstitutes the status quo today with regard to thefunctioning of the United Nations. How can we assumethe possibility of reform in the absence of a levelplaying field?Reform can be meaningful only in the context ofthe alteration of the spirit of the Charter. That  as Ihave suggested  would assume the presence of a levelplaying field. However  we must all admit that theconcept of reform has gained currency only because ofan attempt to admit emerging Powers into the elitegroup of permanent members of the Security Council.Such an attempt has provoked an outcry against theprivilege of the few  and the challenge is how to admitthese emerging Powers without disrupting the existingallocation of privilege. Privilege is never surrendered.It is shared only when the political structures compelinclusion.Reform will not occur within the United Nationsuntil structural changes take place in the distribution ofpower and more non-traditional Powers emerge. Itwould therefore be an exercise in futility to expectconcrete reforms in the United Nations withoutstructural changes. And what we assume to be reformis essentially an adjustment occasioned by structuralpressures. This adjustment would be limited toaccommodating the newly emerging Powers  whileappeasing the less powerful States throughparticipation without power. The conferral of the right26of veto will mark this distinction. A permanent seatwill no longer be synonymous with the right of veto.For the less powerful  the struggle will not beabout power  but participation by affiliation  a sort ofstatus club. Prestige is a preoccupation of the nationalcharacter  which  despite its superficiality  will bepursued by States seeking to distinguish themselvesfrom the crowd. Hence  the focus of the less powerfulwill be to join the club  and not the pursuit of the moreimportant goal of integration  which is the only answerfor the conversion of the less powerful into emergingPowers that would compel adjustment throughstructural pressures. Debate is not the mechanism ofchange.Individual less powerful States can hope toemerge as powerful States only through a process ofintegration within regional groupings where power inits entire composite is integrated into a common powercapability. This would require integration of economic military  technological  human  political and socialresources into an integrated regional capacity. Onlywhen this objective is achieved will the structure of theinternational political system yield to adjustment.Africa cannot  with all of its potential  continue tostand by and accept being condemned to perpetuallyoccupy the position of the least developed continent.The African culture  heritage and value systems standthe risk of being lost in the sea of normative ethicsbased on Western values. Africa should not miss theopportunity of the new African Union to achievemeaningful integration and cooperation within thecontext of building a powerful African capability thatwill allow Africans a say in our common world. Thiswill require a new pragmatism  commitment  vision cooperation and sacrifice on the part of Africanleaders. The United Nations can work for Africa; weshould learn from the successes of the power brokerswho have made the United Nations an importantinstrument of their foreign policy.Liberia is a small country in West Africa thatsuffered seven years of civil war from 1990 to 1997.During the years of the civil war most institutions weredestroyed  and a major brain drain resulted  as manyLiberian professionals travelled abroad to betterconditions. The war also resulted in the destruction ofbasic infrastructure  including power-generating plants water plants  schools  hospitals  airports  bridges andprivate property. Over 666 000 Liberians ended up asrefugees and over a million as internally displacedpersons. More alarming was the failure of theinternational community to assist in the reintegration ofover 60 000 former combatants who remainedunemployed and idle.In 1997 a constitutionally elected Governmentwas inaugurated facing the challenges of restoring anation that had been destroyed by war. Four years later the infant Government still faces an unsympatheticinternational community; it has received no officialdevelopment assistance  and donor assistance forUnited Nations agencies and the non-governmentalorganizations operating in Liberia has declined over thepast four years. The current unemployment rate is 85per cent  while 80 per cent of the population livesbelow the poverty line. According to the UnitedNations Children’s Fund  the illiteracy rate is estimatedat 80 per cent. Half of all school-age children do notattend school. Infant mortality stands at 134 out of1 000 live births.Disability prevalence in the population is 16.4 percent  of which 12.7 per cent is war-related. The WorldHealth Organization rate for a post-war country isbetween 7 per cent and 10 per cent. The prevailingcauses of disabilities are alarming  with 91.5 per centacquired due to trauma and diseases. About 21 per centof urban dwellers and 80 per cent of rural dwellershave no access to safe drinking water. Access toadequate sanitation is unavailable to approximately 70per cent of the population. An estimated 8 per cent ofthe population is reportedly infected with HIV.Since 1999  dissidents have waged war in LofaCounty against the constitutionally elected Governmentin Liberia  further exacerbating the already vulnerablehumanitarian situation in the country. Death destruction  displacement of populations and anincrease in Liberian refugees have contributed to whatthe United Nations agencies call a humanitarian crisisin Liberia.The Liberian Government’s capacity to defend itsterritorial integrity has been impaired by a UnitedNations arms embargo  despite the right to self-defence  as expressed in Article 51 of the UnitedNations Charter. The Security Council has taken nomeasures to prevent the ongoing killing of innocentLiberians  especially women and children  who are thetargets of atrocities committed in Lofa county by armeddissidents.27This country  a victim of war  poverty anddisease  is today also the victim of a regime of punitivesanctions imposed by the Security Council in itsresolution 1343 (2001). The representative of theUnited Nations Office for the Coordination ofHumanitarian Affairs told the Security Council on 5November 2001 that the humanitarian situation inLiberia today is “abysmal”. (S/PV.4405  p. 32) Sincethe imposition of sanctions by the Security Council and despite the claim by the Council that the sanctionswould not have any adverse effects on ordinary people socio-economic indicators show that the livingconditions of the Liberian people have declineddramatically. Available statistics show a directcorrelation between the imposition of sanctions and thedecline in the living standards of the Liberian people.The Security Council has imposed a global travelban on more than 100 Liberians  without anyrationalization. My Government has requested theSecurity Council to make known its criteria for theinclusion of persons subject to the travel ban. Thisminimal element of transparency and justice has beendenied the Liberian Government. Among thosesubjected to the travel ban are the sick  invalids businessmen  wives and ex-wives. What a frightening alarming and dangerous precedent the Security Councilhas set. Liberia speaks not for itself  as it has alreadybeen victimized  but for the rest of you here  who mayfind similar treatment meted out against yourselvestomorrow.I await impatiently for a tomorrow when therewill be redress from the injustice my country suffers when all of you here will no longer be obliged toenforce unjust sanctions. Today  I am impatient to hearthe General Assembly voice its opposition to thesuffering imposed upon Liberian children  women andelderly persons. I impatiently wait for each and everymember of the Security Council to respect the humanrights of my people. I am impatient for the day whenthe United Nations will no longer be an instrument thatis used to cause the suffering of innocent people. TheGovernment of Liberia calls upon the Security Councilto lift all sanctions imposed upon it and to bring to anend the suffering of the Liberian people.At the twenty-sixth session of the United NationsGeneral Assembly  in 1971  a major decision was takenthat to date has had far reaching implications. On 25October of that year  after two decades of debate  byvirtue of General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI)adopted by a vote of 76 in favour  36 against and 17abstentions) the Republic of China was expelled fromthe world body. By that decision  a founding Memberand its population — at that time of 14 millionpeople — were effectively prevented from associatingwith the rest of the world. Nothing in the Charterjustified such a decision  yet a precedent was set that isstill unsurpassed. Nevertheless  it is the conviction ofthe Liberian Government that the now 23 millionpeace-loving people of the Republic of China should beallowed representation and participation in our worldbody. It is also the hope of the Liberian people that thegreat Chinese people will one day be peacefullyreunited under the principles of democracy and humanrights.In conclusion  permit me to allay the anxieties ofall those who are preoccupied with the existingsituation between the members of the Mano RiverUnion. The leaders of the three Mano River UnionStates have resolved to put all of their differences asideand not to return to the destructive process ofapportioning blame. We are a single people bound byblood  culture and language. We are bound by acommon destiny that links us inextricably to oneanother and is capable of withstanding ephemeraldifferences. I wholly agree with President Conté ofGuinea when he described our quarrel as a familymatter. Our sons and daughters  brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers have commenced the processof reconciliation and confidence-building in Freetown Conakry and Monrovia. So far  a number of significantdecisions have been taken at the level of ministers forforeign affairs and the Joint Security Committee. Weask for the Assembly’s support in that process.I would be remiss if I failed to acknowledge thetrue fraternal solidarity and support of the EconomicCommunity of West African States  which has stoodthe test of all of our challenges and difficulties andremains focused on the objective of peace. We too willremain focused on the objective of peace."
"97",4068,"LBY",56,2001,"﻿At theoutset  I would like to congratulate the President on hisunanimous election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-sixth session. His choice toassume this high post is a reflection of Member States'appreciation of him personally and their confidence inhis ability to conduct the deliberations of this sessionin a manner that would enable it to reach conclusionsthat would contribute to the strengthening of stabilityand the promotion of development all over the world.I would also like to seize this opportunity toexpress our gratitude and appreciation to hispredecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri  President of theprevious session of the Assembly  which witnessedmany activities that have gone a long way towardsresponding to the common concerns of theinternational community.Our great appreciation also goes to Mr. KofiAnnan  Secretary-General of the United Nations  whocontinues to perform his duties with dedication andrenewed vigour  even under very difficult9circumstances. His re-election to a second term at thehelm of the Organization and the fact that he wasawarded the Nobel Peace Prize  together with theUnited Nations  this year is testimony to theappreciation of his work and the confidence in hisability to further enhance the role of the United Nationsand to make it more effective in facing the challengesof the new millennium.On 11 September  several American cities including the City of New York  which hosts ourOrganization  were subjected to terrorist attacks towhich thousands of innocent people fell victim. Onceagain I express to the people of the United States andthe families of the victims  who lost their loved ones my deepest sympathies. We in Libya  having beensubjected to various forms of terrorism  including Stateterrorism  realize better than others the cruelty and thedepth of feelings that the American people suffered andthe psychological impact  particularly on the familiesof the victims. My country has therefore condemnedthose painful events  emphasizing our firm position which denounces terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations and calls for the eradication of thisphenomenon  which endangers the independence ofStates and the lives of peoples.We  in Libya appreciate the measures taken bythe international community to uproot terrorism including the number of agreements made  the mostimportant of which we are already party to  and the restof which we are in the process of acceding to.Nevertheless  it is very evident that there is an urgentneed to take other measures to confront the challengesposed by this phenomenon. This will necessitateseeking and eradicating the roots of terrorism. It is alsoimperative to take effective action to put an end toterrorist practices and to eliminate all the reasons andmotives that stand behind terrorism.Before achieving this  we must agree on auniform definition of terrorism to determine ways ofcombating it. We cannot condemn terrorism and fight itwhen it hits one country and turn a blind eye when ithits other countries and peoples. It is also verydangerous to link terrorism to a certain religion ornationality  as terrorism has no nationality and noreligion. Further  it is unacceptable to label as terrorismthe struggle of peoples to protect themselves or toattain independence while ignoring real terrorism which has several faces and is practised in differentways.Occupation  provocation and aggression againstpeoples  like that against Libya in 1986  is allterrorism. The establishment of military bases on theterritories of others is terrorism. Fleets that roam theseas are stationed off the coasts of other States andviolate their territorial waters are forms of terrorism.The downing of civilian aircraft  like the Libyanaircraft that was hijacked and destroyed over Sinai in1973  is terrorism. Mass massacres are terrorism. Thetraining of extreme elements in certain countries andfacilitating their arrival in other countries to carry outcriminal acts  including assassinations  as happened inmy country in 1984 and 1993  is terrorism. Theacquisition of weapons of mass destruction and thethreat of their use is terrorism. The imposition by oneState of unilateral  coercive measures against othercountries and the enactment by the same State of lawsto punish others who maintain relations with thesecountries is also terrorism. Exploiting the SecurityCouncil to impose sanctions against peoples withoutany justification or evidence is terrorism. Preventingthe Council from adopting measures to protect thosewho are subjected to killing and displacementconstitutes support for and encouragement of terrorism.Due to these considerations  we believe it hasbecome important and necessary to take internationalaction to combat terrorism at all levels. We think thatsuch action could be effective if undertaken under theumbrella of the United Nations  in accordance with thepurposes and principles of its Charter. My country wasamong the first to act in this context when  in 1992  wecalled on the Secretary-General of the United Nationsto request the convening of a special session of theGeneral Assembly devoted to the consideration of themeans of combating terrorism.Today  we renew this call out of a conviction thatthis is the best way to study the question of terrorismwith a view to arriving at an accurate definition ofterrorism far removed from selfish and subjectiveclassifications. We are also convinced that this is thebest way to deal with this phenomenon in all itspolitical  economic and social aspects and consequently  to take the necessary measures to fullyuproot it.Every year  we gather here to review and assessour achievements. Despite the tragic events of 11September  we notice that the previous year witnesseda number of important developments. The GeneralAssembly held more than one special session. Two10high-level conferences were held within the frameworkof the United Nations  one of which was devoted to thesituation of the least developed countries and the other to our common struggle against racism andxenophobia. In the declarations and programmes ofaction resulting from these conferences  there was arededication and commitment to the purposes andprinciples of the United Nations  aimed at maintaininginternational peace and security and developingfriendly relations among States. It was also affirmedthat more efforts would be made to implementpriorities such as the promotion of development  theprovision of shelter for all  the eradication of want anddiseases  the ending of injustice and unfairness and theuprooting of discrimination in all its forms.The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya participated in allthese forums  and we are happy to have contributed totheir successful results. Like other Members of thisOrganization  we have an interest in the establishmentof peace  the realization of justice and the support ofsustainable development. Notwithstanding all theseachievements  it is abundantly clear that there is a needfor further efforts so that we may be able to address theadditional challenges facing all Members of the UnitedNations.One such challenge is the environmentaldegradation that threatens life on Earth  our commonhome. Violence and armed conflicts also rage inseveral regions. Millions suffer from abject poverty inmany places in developing countries. Diseases particularly HIV/AIDS  threaten the lives of entirecommunities.There are still those who challenge the collectivewill and cling to unilaterally enacted laws  applyingthem to all. Old ideological barriers have been replacedwith new barriers  including impeding access of manydeveloping countries to the technology necessary fortheir development and advancement. Moreover  ourworld is still not free of criminal activity  including theillicit trade in small weapons and narcotics andtransnational organized crime.The United Nations is the tool of our commonwork in our efforts to face these challenges.Undoubtedly it has made many efforts  but it couldcertainly be more effective in carrying out its duties ifdrastic structural reforms were made to its organs andif new working methods were developed for its variousmechanisms. Many proposals have been submitted overthe past few years in this regard  but  unfortunately they did not resonate with certain Powers that care onlyfor their narrow selfish interests. This makes itincumbent upon the other Members of thisOrganization that have a real stake in reform to unifytheir efforts and capacities to effect inevitable change if we want our Organization to succeed  consistent withthe spirit of the times  and to meet the needs of thepeople.For our part  we wish once again to reaffirm thatsuch change should be aimed at achieving thefollowing.First  it must enhance and develop cooperationamong the principal organs of the United Nations  andbetween these organs and other bodies and agencies ofthe United Nations system  with a view to resolvinginternational problems in all their aspects.Secondly  it must enhance the role of the GeneralAssembly  making it more effective  so that it can carryout the functions entrusted to it by the Charter including contributing to the adoption of measures tomaintain international peace and security. TheAssembly should have the authority to control and tohold accountable other United Nations organs including the Security Council  which should beaccountable to the Assembly.Thirdly  it must establish a mechanism affiliatedwith the General Assembly to follow up theimplementation of Assembly resolutions. We cannotwait indefinitely for the implementation of resolutions most of which were adopted more than 50 years ago.Fourthly  it must accelerate the introduction ofradical reform to the Security Council membership inorder to apply the principle of equitable geographicdistribution and thus do justice to the disadvantagedregions in Africa  Asia and Latin America that areunder-represented in the Council. Reform should alsoapply to improving the Council's working methods toensure transparency in its work and democracy in itsdecision-making.Fifthly  the privileges emanating from victories ofthe Second World War must be withdrawn  the mostimportant being the right of veto  which has becomeobsolete. Therefore  there is no longer any justificationfor maintaining it  not only because it contravenes theprinciple of the sovereign equality of States  but alsobecause it has been used to protect aggressors from11condemnation. It is also being used to prevent theadoption of measures to protect those subjected toaggression  killing  displacement and other acts ofgenocide.Seeking to establish peace and enhance stabilityis among the major purposes of the United Nations.This Organization certainly cannot perform all thesefunctions alone. Member States can establish effectivemechanisms to resolve the most intractable problems.In this context  we in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya havemade consistent efforts to assist countries sufferingfrom conflicts and disputes. Talks held last June  underthe auspices of the Qadhafi Charitable Organization between the Government of the Philippines and theMoro Front  led to the signature of the Tripoli PeaceAgreement  ending a bitter conflict and meeting theaspirations of both parties for the restoration ofsecurity and stability in southern Philippines.We have participated effectively in variousnegotiations that have resulted in the settlement of theEthiopia-Eritrea dispute and the conclusion of theArusha Agreement  ending the conflict in Burundi.Together with other African countries  we areintensifying our efforts to support reconciliation inSomalia and the restoration of peace to the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo on the basis of the LusakaAgreement  emanating from the agreement signed inthe city of Sirte in September 1999.Currently  intensive efforts are being made toimplement the Libyan-Egyptian initiative  incoordination with the initiative of theIntergovernmental Authority on Development  toachieve broad-based national reconciliation in theSudan so that its people can live in harmony andstability  based on the unity and territorial integrity ofthat sisterly country and equality among its people.We take great pride in our contributions andachievements. But above all  Libyans from all walks oflife  men and women  greatly cherish the historicevent that took place in March of this year  whenAfrican leaders announced the establishment of theAfrican Union at the second Sirte summit. This wasfollowed by the thirty-seventh summit of theOrganization of African Unity  held last July  whichtook progressive practical measures to strengthen thefundamentals of this Union  which is an importanttransformation in the history of Africa  realizing as itdid  the dream of the forefathers of a unified Africa. Itwas the culmination of the efforts of the great Africanleaders whose objective has always been the unity ofthe continent so that it could enhance its security andprogress and build its future. It is a new phase in anAfrican renaissance that will eliminate rifts that dividethe continent and will establish one bloc for allAfricans  capable of confronting various challenges ina world of large groupings.The fact that Africa has taken all these initiativesand steps sends a clear message to other countries ofthe world that Africa fully realizes that resolving itsproblems and developing its abilities is primarily theresponsibility of the Africans. Yet we must emphasizethat there will be no peace  security or stability in theworld as long as Africa suffers from problems anddisturbances. For that  the United Nations and allcountries must assist in the efforts of African countriesto establish peace throughout the continent and toenhance security in all its corners. This requiresprimarily support for Africa's dispute-settlementmechanisms  assistance in eradicating the poverty ofmillions of its people and the elimination of diseases particularly HIV/AIDS  which threatens the lives ofmore than 30 million Africans.Moreover  a solution must be found to theproblem of external debt  which devours most ofAfrica's earnings. Moreover  an end must be put toconsequences of colonialism  the cause of Africa'sunderdevelopment and the obstacle to its progress. Theonly way to do justice to the peoples of Africa is forthose States that conquered their land  looted thecontinent's resources and built their progress at itsexpense to apologize to the peoples of Africa for thesepractices and to pay them full compensation for thelosses and damages caused by colonialism.The international community has thus far failedto resolve the Palestinian problem  which is almost asold as the United Nations itself. This is essentially dueto disregard of the core of the problem  which is that aland was usurped and its people were expelled fromtheir homeland. Thus  Palestine remained occupied.Most of its people became refugees in various parts ofthe world  and those who stayed were made intoprisoners in their own homes  deprived of the mostbasic human rights. The Palestinian people are beingsubjected to the most heinous crimes committedagainst any people in contemporary history. Palestinianchildren and young and elderly people are assassinated their land is confiscated  their farms are burnt and their12houses are demolished to be replaced by houses ofsettlers who came from various parts of the world inpursuit of unbelievable and illogical myths.Old and new developments of the Palestinianquestion are sufficient proof that ending the sufferingof the Palestinians under occupation cannot beachieved through plans that are never implemented. Ithas also been cogently proven that the problem will notbe resolved by the resolutions that the United Nationshas been reiterating for more than five decades.In the light of those irrefutable facts  the solutionthat should be sought  and on which all efforts mustfocus  lies in what my country has said before andreaffirms now: the Palestinian people must return totheir homeland  from which they were expelled  and ademocratic  non-racist State must be established inwhich all citizens are equal irrespective of religion orethnicity  a State similar to the one that has beenestablished in the Republic of South Africa. Any othersolution would be a fantasy that would serve only toperpetuate the Palestinian tragedy.Speaking of the situation in the eastern Arabregion  my country reaffirms its unlimited support forsisterly Syria and Lebanon in their steadfastness in theface of Israeli aggression. We condemn all attempts toprovoke those countries  and we uphold their right torecover all their territories under occupation.Turning to the current situation in Iraq  wecondemn the daily violations of Iraqi sovereignty andthe continuous aggression to which Iraq is subjected.We call on all peace-loving countries to work towardsthe lifting of the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi peopleand towards putting an end to all schemes aimed atdestroying their capacities and at dividing their land.Tireless efforts have been made in the field ofdisarmament. My country is a party to mostinternational disarmament agreements and is in theprocess of acceding to the remaining ones  includingthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weaponsand on Their Destruction and the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. But we firmly believe thatgeneral and complete disarmament cannot come aboutwithout a change in current norms and in the approachto disarmament issues. What we see today is a growingtrend towards the control of small arms and lightweapons rather than of the weapons of massdestruction that pose a greater threat to internationalpeace and security and to human life.That is why we wonder about the sharp focus onthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Use Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnelMines and on Their Destruction  even though itaddresses only simple  limited weapons that small andweak countries need to defend their borders againstpowerful countries that possess aircraft carriers andaeroplanes that can be refueled in the air. Why shouldwe not focus our efforts on the destruction of chemicaland biological weapons and of ballistic missiles? Whyare nuclear-weapon States not serious about practicalmeasures to destroy their nuclear stockpiles? Why arecertain countries falsely accused of acquiring weaponsof mass destruction while there is silence about theIsraelis  who  as everybody knows  possess hundreds ofnuclear warheads and other weapons of massdestruction and conventional weapons? Moreover  Israelcontinues to defy the will of the internationalcommunity  which has called on it to accede to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weaponsand to place its nuclear facilities under the safeguardsof the International Atomic Energy Agency in order tohelp ensure that the region is free of nuclear weapons.We want the important question of disarmamentto be dealt with in a comprehensive and non-selectivemanner. Efforts should be concentrated first andforemost on the adoption of practical measures todestroy nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction.That should apply to all those that possess suchweapons without exception; they should cease insistingon the development of new defensive systems thatcould threaten the world's strategic stability and triggera new arms race. Unless the matter is addressed in thatway  disarmament efforts will be meaningless; theywill remain a great fraud perpetrated on all the peoplesof the world.During the past nine sessions of the GeneralAssembly  we have reviewed developments in thedispute between my country and a number of Westerncountries over the United States aeroplane that crashedover Lockerbie. During the past two sessions  we havefocused on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya's cooperationwith the Scottish court that has been meeting in theNetherlands since the two Libyan suspects decidedvoluntarily to appear before it. On each occasion  wehave reiterated our request that the Security Councillift the sanctions it imposed on the Libyan people 13because Libya has fully responded to the requirementsof Council resolutions 731 (1992)  748 (1992) and1192 (1998). That was confirmed by the report of theSecretary-General to the Security Council  submitted inconformity with paragraph 16 of Security Councilresolution 883 (1993).We are obliged once again to broach thisquestion  and for a valid reason: the developments ofearlier this year. As members know  on 3 May 2000 theScottish court began its trial of the two Libyanssuspected of being linked to the Pan Am aircraftincident. During the trial it became very clear that thejudges were not convinced of the truth of testimonyfrom the three witnesses offered by the other party aswitnesses for the prosecution. The court concluded thatthe principal witness in the case  Mr. Abdul MajidGiaka  was lying  as were Tony Gauci and EdwinBollier. In paragraph 45 of its opinion  the court stated:We have assessed carefully the evidence ofthese three witnesses ... relating to the MST-13timers .... All three  and notably Mr. Bollier  wereshown to be unreliable witnesses. [Their variousstatements were] at times in conflict with eachother ... On some occasions  particularly in thecase of Mr. Bollier  their evidence was self-contradictory.It was thus fully expected that the Scottish courtwould acquit both suspects for lack of evidence. Butthe decision of 31 January 2001 ran counter to thoseexpectations. The court convicted one of the suspects Mr. Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi  and acquittedthe second  Mr. Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah. Thatjudgement came as a surprise to all political analystsand jurists  for whom it raised many questions including why one of the suspects was convicted whenthe two principal prosecution witnesses were proven tohave lied and when the court found the third unreliable.How could the court's decision to convict one man andacquit the other be explained  since they were bothsuspected on the basis of the same assumptions?The only answer to those questions is that  at thelast moment  the court departed from applying the lawand instead took a political decision. The first toindicate this was Robert Black  an architect of theLockerbie court  who said that the elements of the caseagainst Al Megrahi were very weak. And HansKˆchler  a university professor appointed by theSecretary-General as an international observer of thetrial  issued a report dated 3 February 2001  whichincluded many comments  including the following.[The Opinion] is totally incomprehensible forany rational observer when one considers that theindictment in its very essence was based on thejoint action of the two accused in Malta.The Opinion of the Court is exclusivelybased on circumstantial evidence and on a seriesof highly problematic inferences. As to theundersigned's knowledge  there is not one singlepiece of material evidence linking the twoaccused to the crime. In such a context  the guiltyverdict in regard to the first accused appears to bearbitrary  even irrational....This leads ... to the suspicion that politicalconsiderations may have been overriding astrictly judicial evaluation of the case.In placing these facts before the United Nationsmembership  we want to stress that the convictionhanded down by the court on 31 January 2001 was apolitical decision that had nothing to do with the law.The Libyan citizen Mr. Al Megrahi was kidnapped forpolitical reasons  as confirmed in resolutions andstatements adopted by a number of regionalorganizations  including at the Lusaka summit of theOrganization of African Unity  the twenty-eighthministerial session of the Organization of the IslamicConference held at Bamako  and the meeting ofForeign Ministers of the League of Arab States held atCairo earlier this year.Our gratitude goes to the members of thoseorganizations and to others that have shown solidaritywith us from the outset for standing on the side ofright. We call on all Members of the United Nationsthat support right and justice to take the necessaryaction to meet the demands of those organizations. Thefirst is the immediate release of Mr. Al Megrahi  whowas convicted for political reasons that have nothing todo with the law. His continued detention amounts tohostage-taking under all relevant laws and customs.The second element of those demands iscategorical rejection of the stubborn blockage of thelifting of the sanctions imposed on Libya  whichignores the provisions of paragraph 16 of SecurityCouncil 883 (1993) and the findings of the report of theSecretary-General in that regard. The Security Council14should immediately  totally and permanently lift thesanctions imposed on Libya  in view of the fact thatLibya has met all the requirements of the relevantSecurity Council resolutions  including resolution 1192(1998). The third element is support for the legitimateright of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to receive faircompensation for the material and human losses it hasincurred as a result of the sanctions."
"98",4099,"LCA",56,2001,"﻿Allow me first tooffer the congratulations of the delegation of SaintLucia to the President of the General Assembly on hiselection. We wish to assure him of our full support forthe successful outcome of these deliberations.As we meet with the global fraternity of nationsduring this fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly Saint Lucia once more joins its voice with those whohave deplored and condemned the despicable acts ofterror of 11 September 2001  that so brutalized ourgreat host city  New York  and our host country  as theycruelly and callously extinguished thousands ofinnocent and vibrant lives. We are however heartenedby the universal resolve of all peace-loving nations torid the earth of the scourge of terrorism. We havenoted  too  how quickly and steadfastly some of thesenations have come together as a coalition in pursuit ofthat endeavour and have embarked on a war againstterrorism.We should  however  recognize that the defeat ofthis type of terrorism  as laudable and desirable an actas it may be  will not by itself create a greaterhumanity or a better world. For there are billions in theworld today who have not been at war  but who havenot known peace; they suffer from other terrors. Thereare millions  so many of whom are children  whosuccumb daily to the horrors of malnutrition andstarvation. There are still millions of others who arewasting away from disease. Thousands of people seetheir human rights violated on a daily basis. Wetherefore need to remind ourselves that there are manyother issues that have been engendering their ownbrand of fear and conflict in the world today  and thatmore often than not the underlying cause of suchconflict is the lack of economic and humandevelopment.If we are to attain greater humanity  and if we areto create a better world  we must commit ourselves to agreater collective responsibility towards all those otherissues. We must adopt the same rapid global militaristicresponse to solving them as that in the new war onterrorism. Some of these issues have been with us fortoo long and by now should have disappeared from theworld agenda. Our fragile humanity cannot endureanother century of widening disparity between andwithin nations. We can no longer withstand the silentbattle between the haves and the have nots. Humanitycannot tolerate ever increasing disease  deprivation hunger  illiteracy  poverty  economic strife and war.For the ideal of a greater humanity not tocontinue to elude us  we must now found it on this newattitude  this new vision  in which people everywhere nations everywhere  are galvanized into higher levelsof cooperation in pursuit of these common concerns  in39particular concerns such as the guarantee of economicand social security  sustainable development andgovernance of the multilateral trading system. In thisnew philosophy of cooperation  the United Nationsmust play the central role.It is from this perspective that Saint Luciareiterates its call for the adoption of a holistic approachtowards poverty eradication. Saint Lucia is firm in itsview that the United Nations is the only Organizationcapable of pooling the requisite knowledge andfinancial resources for global action against poverty.International cooperation on poverty eradication mustgive due consideration to  among other things  debtforgiveness through concerted support for an improvedHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) DebtInitiative. It must ensure special and differentialtreatment on a contractual basis for developingcountries and sustained financial support for theOrganization’s development programmes.The HIV/AIDS plague  which continues to ravagethe world  also demands this new collective response.Saint Lucia acknowledges that the United Nations hasalready begun spearheading the global fight againstHIV/AIDS. The United Nations special session onHIV/AIDS has done a great deal to raise globalawareness about the magnitude of the pandemic. SaintLucia also welcomes the establishment of the GlobalAIDS and Health Fund  which is intended to increasethe ability of the global community to combat thisscourge. However  if humanity is to win the fightagainst this twentieth century plague  the internationalcommunity must make available new and additionalfinancial resources towards research and thedevelopment of affordable drugs. We stress that thesedrugs must be cheap and widely obtainable. It is timethat corporations cease putting the acquisition of moreand more profit ahead of the health and lives of theunfortunate who have been afflicted by diseases suchas AIDS. Are we not being inhumane when ouroverriding objective is to make as huge a profit aspossible on the sickness of so many  rather thanensuring that the essential drugs that they need to endtheir suffering are easily available?As we survey the multilateral trading system Saint Lucia continues to be concerned that the thrusttowards allowing market forces to totally determine thescope  structure and outcomes of economic activity isnot being counterbalanced by mechanisms to fairlydistribute welfare gains and to protect the morevulnerable  small States like Saint Lucia from theconsequences of market failure.The perilous state of the banana industry in SaintLucia and the other Windward Islands of the EasternCaribbean is the painful outcome of that thrust  an ill-advised policy of globalization and trade liberalizationat all costs. The charge of World Trade Organization(WTO) incompatibility that was made against thepreferential trade regime  justly accorded to SaintLucia and other Agricultural Commodities Committeebanana-producing countries under the LoméAgreement  has brought about the near collapse of thisvital industry. Saint Lucia welcomes the recentinitiative by the United States for a new licensingagreement for the trading of bananas on the Europeanmarket  an initiative that brought an end to thedebilitating banana war with Europe.Saint Lucia once more wishes to place on recordits deep appreciation for the perseverance and fortitudeof the European Union  which stood by its internationalobligations throughout these years of dispute. Weapplaud the news just in from Doha that  after 18months  a WTO waiver has finally been granted to theCotonou Agreement  thus paving the way for theimplementation of the new banana-marketingarrangements. We hope that these recent developmentsare not too late to save our industry. But the case of thegreat banana dispute will always remain as a strikingtestimony to the inequities of the liberalized tradingsystem.Saint Lucia is also concerned about the actions ofseveral organizations  such as the World EconomicCouncil and the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD)  which seem tobe attempting to usurp the traditional roles andfunctions of the United Nations and of nationalGovernments. In the face of the near demise of thevital banana industry  Saint Lucia and the other islandsof the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States(OECS) sought to diversify their economies bybuilding on their competitive advantage in offshorefinancial services. But OECD countries denounced ourefforts as being harmful to them  and resorted tobranding Caribbean offshore financial services ashavens for criminal activity. For us  this is a violationof our territorial integrity  our sovereignty and oureconomic rights. Saint Lucia accepts that it has anobligation to ensure that its financial services are notused by unscrupulous individuals and interests.40However  Saint Lucia cannot  in all good conscience surrender its sovereignty to a governance systemimposed by a few.In the face of these selfish actions by developedcountries and the myopia of globalization  the role ofthe United Nations in bringing order into the systemhas become even more pressing. Saint Lucia thereforerenews its call for a rebirth of the United Nationssystem  not only as an organization concerned withpeacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions but also as an institution that is capable of effectivelygoverning the global economic system in a way thatensures an equitable redistribution of the benefits ofeconomic growth. We need a United Nations that willsafeguard against global economic crises and promotethe adoption of sustainable developmental policies.In that context  and with the emerging spectre ofa global economic recession  the upcoming UnitedNations Conference on Financing for Developmentbecomes even more relevant  even more urgent. ThatConference is of enormous importance to the smallisland developing States of the Caribbean  faced as weare by low aggregate gross domestic product  lowdomestic savings and investment capacity andundeveloped financial markets. The developmentagenda of the Caribbean region cannot proceed withoutthe requisite financing  nor can it be sustained withoutan enabling international environment. We must alltherefore commit ourselves to ensuring the success ofthe Conference.Our renewed call for the rebirth of the Unitednations is further prompted by the observation that it issystematically being displaced as a source of guidanceand as a fount of collective wisdom on global issues.We fear that if the United Nations continues to bemarginalized in determining global developmentpolicies and strategies  then the concerns of developingcountries will be excluded from the global agenda. Arecent example of this is the decision not to includeissues relating to the implementation of the Programmeof Action for the Sustainable Development of SmallIsland Developing States in the preparatory meetingsfor the World Summit on Sustainable Development. Wesee this as undermining the spirit of the United Nationsresolution that convened the United Nations GlobalConference on the Sustainable Development of SmallIsland Developing States  held in Barbados in 1994.Indeed  it was recognized then that the United NationsConference on Environment and Development had notpaid sufficient attention to the special circumstances ofsmall island developing States.There are two other examples of United Nationsinaction that leave us very concerned. Saint Lucialaments the adoption by the United Nations of awatered down instrument on small arms. In smallisland developing States like Saint Lucia  growingeconomic instability has given rise to increased levelsof drug-related crime. In the Caribbean region  smallarms are used in most of the violent crimes that arecommitted against our law-abiding citizens. The globaltrade in small arms must therefore be stemmed in theinterest of peace and stability. A weak small armsdocument was therefore not what we required.We remain deeply concerned that the Plan ofAction for the first International Decade for theEradication of Colonialism did not result in thedecolonization of the remaining 17  mostly smallisland  Non-Self-Governing Territories. Accordingly we request  as a matter of priority  that the necessaryresources and expertise be provided to implement thelong-standing resolutions on decolonization and thecritical analyses called for in the Plan of Action of thepresent International Decade.I close by extending on behalf of the Governmentand the people of Saint Lucia  our warmestcongratulations to Secretary-General Kofi Annan andthe hard-working staff of the United Nations on therecent award of the Nobel Peace Prize. We regard thisaward as an eloquent testimony to the sterling effortsof the Organization to build a peaceful world. At thesame time  we see the award as a challenge to theUnited Nations to remain resolute in its commitment tothe multilateral framework and not to allow itself tobecome incapacitated by inaction  especially where thedefence of human security is concerned.We all recognize that the events of 11 Septemberhave brought about a new era in world affairs and newchallenges for all of us  in particular for the UnitedNations. In the times that lie ahead the United Nationssystem must do more that it has done before. It mustresist the use of force in situations where wisdom isneeded. It must work harder at becoming a source ofhope to the hopeless and a reservoir of power to thepowerless. It must redouble its efforts to restore thepreservation of humanity as the highest of all ideals.The horror of 11 September has shocked some ofus into establishing a coalition against terrorism. It is41time for the tragedy of underdevelopment to shock allof us into forging new coalitions for development. Atthis juncture  let us use this United Nations  energizedby its Nobel award  to create these coalitions. Let usbuild a coalition in defence of the wretched of theearth — to end their hunger  to terminate their poverty to eradicate their diseases and to forever banish theirwretchedness."
"99",4126,"LIE",56,2001,"﻿Let me first joinprevious speakers in expressing our heartfeltsympathies to the host country and to the bereavedfamilies for the loss of their loved ones in yesterday’sdisaster.Ever since 11 September  the fight againstterrorism in all its forms has rightfully been at the topof the agenda of the United Nations and of otherinternational organizations. On behalf of theGovernment of Liechtenstein  I wish to pledge our fullsupport for international cooperation to combatterrorism. A quick understanding has emerged thatmultilateralism and international cooperation are theonly ways to successfully tackle the challenges we arefacing. Once again  the world has looked to the UnitedNations for leadership in our common fight  and onceagain the United Nations has delivered. We wish to paytribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. He hasnavigated this Organization in a most clever  capableand visionary manner through turbulent times andassiduously enhanced its standing in the internationalarena. Right before the beginning of his second term asSecretary-General the United Nations is a stronger andmore credible organization than ever. I wish tocongratulate the Secretary-General  and indeed theentire Organization he heads  on being awarded theNobel Peace Prize. No one could be better placed to bea voice of international legitimacy and to provideleadership during the times ahead — and this is amoment when leadership is most needed.20Both the General Assembly and the SecurityCouncil have reacted with resolve and determination tothe attacks of 11 September. The Council took a boldstep in adopting its ground-breaking resolution 1373(2001). We are indeed facing a new type of crisis andthe Security Council has designed a new type ofresponse. The delegation of Liechtenstein looksforward to working closely with the Counter-TerrorismCommittee to fully implement the provisions of thatresolution. Given the novelty of the task  we appreciatethe difficulties and enormous workload the Committeeis facing. We also express our support for thetransparent manner and the spirit of cooperation anddialogue which the Committee has displayed thus far incarrying out its work. Benchmarking and best practicesare of the utmost importance in this context. Highstandards of enforcement have to be developed and tobe applied uniformly to all actors  be theyGovernments  banks  intermediaries  fiduciaries orattorneys. We are committed to implementingresolution 1373 (2001) as a whole  but will placeparticular emphasis on its central aspects relating to thefinancing of terrorism. We have all the necessaryinstruments in place to make our contribution tosuppress and prevent the financing of terrorism.Consequently  I signed on behalf of Liechtenstein theConvention for the Suppression of the Financing ofTerrorism on 2 October this year. Our common effortcan only be successful if it is focused on our true goalof stopping financial flows to terrorists and theirorganizations. We must not  however  venture intoother areas of international financing under the guise offighting terrorism. In this context I wish to state veryclearly that bank secrecy as practised in Liechtensteinnever has provided and never will provide protection toterrorists or their financial transactions.If the fight against terrorism is to be a genuinelycommon effort  it must include all of us. The GeneralAssembly  as the only all-inclusive organ of the UnitedNations  must therefore play a significant role in ourefforts. We trust that the General Assembly will assertits rightful place as the law-making body of the UnitedNations by adopting a comprehensive conventionagainst terrorism to fill the gaps in the existingframework of international law dealing with specificaspects of terrorism.The fight against terrorism is multifaceted and therole of the United Nations must also cover a widerange of topics  including what is often referred to asthe root causes of terrorism. Indeed  isolating theextremists  exposing the perversity of their agenda  andthus preventing more misguided and disenfranchisedpeople from joining a cause of insanity  is the only wayour fight will be successful in the long term. Poverty social exclusion and marginalization  and the lack ofbasic education are key areas we must address. Theseare  of course  by no means new topics on the agendaof the United Nations  but we need to do more and weneed to do better. Informed and educated policychanges are not concessions to the evil of terrorism.Such thinking would lead to paralysis and inaction. Itis of crucial importance that the spirit of internationalcooperation  rather than being selective and short-lived should prevail in our work on these essential issues.The United Nations is further challenged on thecomplex relationship between terrorism and humanrights. The promotion and protection of human rightsmust not fall victim to the fight against terrorism.Human rights are not a luxury that we can affordduring good times and dispense with in times of crisis.Rather  they are the foundation upon which all ouractivities must be based. Curtailing the existing humanrights standards in the name of the fight againstterrorism would mean giving up our most fundamentalvalues — the very values that those who committerrorist attacks are out to destroy. This we must notallow to happen. The World Conference againstRacism  Racial Discrimination  Xenophobia andRelated Intolerance was concluded on 8 September. Ihad the honour to attend that event in my capacity asChairman of the Committee of Ministers of the Councilof Europe  which served as the regional preparatorybody for the Conference. After a most difficult andcomplex process  the Conference was brought to asuccessful end with probably the best achievableoutcome — the resolution of issues of both the past andthe present  and a global anti-discrimination agendawithin which we all can work.The difficulties of the Durban Conference arereflected in the still ongoing debate on remainingtechnical  but important  details. The necessarypolitical will should be mustered as soon as possible sothat the message from Durban can reach peopleworldwide. The events of 11 September have givenadditional significance to this message  since racismand intolerance can be both cause and consequence ofterrorism. One of our most difficult new challenges inour fight against racism is to prevent discrimination21against people because of their affiliation with certainethnic groups.There are those who interpret the events of 11September as a fulfilment of a predicted clash ofcivilizations. They are wrong. Those who committedthe attacks do not represent a civilization or religion;they believe only in terror  violence and destruction.They are just criminals. Their acts were not an attackon a civilization; they were an attack on  and a crimeagainst  humanity. But  of course  nothing would servetheir intentions better than a clash of civilizations. TheUnited Nations is therefore challenged to prevent sucha clash. The International Year of Dialogue amongCivilizations serves as a useful reminder of what theUnited Nations has always stood for.Terrorism cannot be fought only with militarymeasures and international judicial cooperation. Onlyby going beyond these obvious measures can we besuccessful in the long term. We must change thecollective conscience and awareness of all societiesand teach our children the futility and the dangers ofresorting to violence as a means of dealing withconflicts. Terrorists utilize the most extreme forms ofviolence. Therefore  they must be effectively excludedfrom society. They must be outlawed. It must beunacceptable for terrorists to establish themselves aspolitical players by resorting to violence and byindiscriminately attacking civilians.This unified stance against terrorism must  inturn  be accompanied by our willingness to engage in apeaceful dialogue with those who advocate legitimatepolitical causes  difficult as that may seem. Only byensuring that communities and entities are notoppressed  and that they are given room to voice theirconcerns  can we eventually eradicate terrorism. In thiscontext it is important that the international communitydevelop mechanisms that allow for such a dialogue totake place  based on an agreed framework and existingstandards of international law. We must not acceptterrorism as a fact of life  but believe in our collectiveability to eradicate it. That goal may seem distant oreven unrealistic  but so did the goal of eradicatingslavery in the nineteenth century and fascism in thetwentieth century. It is now up to all of us to freeourselves from terrorism  the scourge of the twenty-first century."
"100",4173,"LKA",56,2001,"﻿Every speakerfrom this podium during the special debate onterrorism  the debate on dialogue among civilizationsand our current general debate has said  suggested orimplied that 11 September has changed the worldirrevocably. Indeed it has. A democracy is an opensociety. Movement is free. Speech is free. All thecitizens of a democratic society are free to lead theirlives in freedom  subject only to the rule of law. Fearand the spirit of democratic freedom are two totallyopposite states of mind. Yet  today  fear stalks theUnited States of America  where democracy hasflourished vigorously for so long  bringing prosperityto its people and taking human achievement tounimagined heights of excellence.There can be no argument that terror in all itsmanifestations must be fought relentlessly andglobally. Gone are the days when a country affected byterror  as my country has been for two decades  can betold by the international community  “We are sorryabout what is happening in your land  but there isnothing we can do to help you because we have nolaws to combat terror.” When our Central Bank wasbombed and destroyed  when the Temple of the SacredTooth Relic  one of the holiest shrines of Buddhism was bombed and saved from destruction only by amiracle  when a commuter train carrying workers homewas attacked with explosives  when thousands ofpeople  including monks  women and children wereslaughtered  when Muslims were massacred in amosque while at prayer  when a President of Sri Lanka Ministers and Members of Parliament and many otherelected leaders were assassinated  let alone a PrimeMinister of India  when a suicide bomber at an electionrally attacked the incumbent President of Sri Lanka killing and wounding scores of innocent bystanders andgrievously wounding her in the right eye  the sight ofwhich was lost — all this and much more has happenedat the hands of a terrorist group in Sri Lanka — wereceived merely sympathies  condolences  expressionsof shock and outrage  while the funding that fuels theterrorism in my country went on apace in the great liberal democracies of the West. When half of theaircraft in our national airline were damaged ordestroyed by those same terrorists on 24 July  we wereadvised by some Governments to negotiate. We werereminded that “violence begets violence”.That approach has changed dramatically in recentdays  or so it seems  because terrorism has assailed thenational interests of many countries. Terrorism is nolonger the curse of the poor. Now  more than everbefore  when a terrorist attack takes place somewherein the world  “never send to know for whom the belltolls”  as John Donne said nearly four centuries ago for surely “it tolls for thee”.The United Nations has focused sharply onbuilding consensus to fight terror. Two importantUnited Nations conventions were adopted withadmirable speed — the International Convention forthe Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and theInternational Convention for the Suppression of the24Financing of Terrorism. Another important conventionis being considered at this session by the Ad HocCommittee on International Terrorism  which is chairedby Sri Lanka. Since we have been so severely affectedby terrorism  it is only natural that we should play aleading role in designing the legislation that theinternational community should adopt and implementto combat terrorism.There is a particularly abhorrent brand ofterrorism that the world can never condone — that is the forcible conscription of young children for battle widely practiced by the terrorists of Sri Lanka and welldocumented by Amnesty International  the UnitedNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Childrenand Armed Conflict. It would be a permanent blot onhumankind’s conscience if these poor children were tobe consigned  unnoticed and uncared for  to theirmiserable fate.While terrorism must continue to be fought relentlessly and by everyone everywhere  sooner ratherthan later the international community will have tofocus its collective attention on the question ofanalysing and diagnosing the causes of terrorism preventing and finally eliminating it before it becomesa problem of such deadly dimensions that it threatensthe whole world. The causes of terrorism cannot beignored. To examine the roots of terrorism and theculture in which it breeds in a systematic  objective well-informed manner is not  by any means  to yield toterrorism. It is not a manifestation of weakness for theinternational community to examine the root causes ofterrorism. It is axiomatic that a contented people do notrise up to destroy the society in which they live. If theworld has become a village  surely we must take careto ensure that the villagers living down one road in thevillage are not given cause to become resentful andangry at the opulence enjoyed by other villagers livingdown another road  only a stone’s throw away.Might I suggest  therefore  that this GeneralAssembly consider the convening of an internationalgroup of eminent persons with the appropriatebackgrounds in all relevant fields  representative of allregions of the world  appointed by the President of theGeneral Assembly  the President of the SecurityCouncil and the Secretary-General  with the requestthat the group report to the General Assembly  theSecurity Council and the Secretary-General within anappropriate time frame on terrorism and its prevention.Thus  inescapably we will have to revisit and re-address the old questions that have haunted the UnitedNations ever since it was born — that is  the questionsof poverty  hunger  disease  ignorance and injustice.These questions have been with us for a long time.They have received answers which are  to a largeextent  no more than faint-hearted attempts to forgesolutions that look grand on paper but are incapable ofimplementation due to the lack of funds and the lack ofpolitical will.The formulation of policy has always been fareasier than its implementation and  when we look tothe future through the ultimate prism — namely  thefunding available — we face once more the bitter truthof which our colleagues from the developed world havebeen warning us year after year: “the funding globallyavailable is far from promising”.We in the developing world have also beenwarning our colleagues for so long  when a developingcountry is unable to generate a sufficient amount ofdomestic capital  public or private  it is to internationalcapital that we  in the developing world  have to turn;and  as international private capital is sensitive to therate and continuance of profitable return  it is onlyofficial development assistance (ODA) that remains.On 8 November  only a few days ago  at theEuropean Union’s (EU) Development Council inBrussels  a common statement was delivered by thefive Ministers for Development Cooperation ofDenmark  Luxembourg  Netherlands  Norway andSweden. Their words convey far more effectively  andwith far greater authority  than my words couldpossibly do  the thoughts of developing countries onthe question of development aid  and  therefore  I takethe liberty of quoting that common statement in itsentirety:“In the Millennium Declaration  theinternational community recognized the fightagainst poverty as the greatest challenge to ourglobal governance system”.“The events of 11 September have made iteven more crucial to deal with these problems.We not only need a global coalition againstterrorism. We need a global coalition againstpoverty as well.“The Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  Mr. Kofi Annan  at the Conference on25the Least Developed Countries in May 2001 remarked that only a few countries have lived upto the goals of devoting 0.7 percent of their grossnational product (GNP) to official developmentassistance (ODA)  and that the least developedcountries suffer disproportionately as a result ofthat.“We need better and more effectivedevelopment assistance: policy coherence  lowertransaction costs by harmonization of procedures.We need sharper focus on the importance ofstrong institutions and sound economic and socialpolicy. But we cannot expect to reach ourcommon goal of halving extreme poverty by 2015without increasing aid volume.”I continue to quote from the common statement:“There is no need for a new set of standards.All United Nations members  with the exceptionof the United States  have accepted a longestablished standard volume of ODA for donorcountries: 0.7 percent of GNP. But theinternational community is still a long way frommaking this standard a reality.“Although the EU has stressed theimportance of the 0.7 percent target in theconclusions of the European Council in Göteborg the EU’s record is no exception: in 2000  memberStates gave an average of only 0.33 per cent ofGNP in ODA. This is better than the OECDaverage of 0.24 per cent  but it is still a long wayfrom the target.”“In fact  the Netherlands  Sweden  Denmarkand Luxembourg are the only EU member Statesthat meet the ODA standard. Norway  a non-EUmember  is also part of this exclusive club.Luxembourg  the newest member of this group has proved that it is possible to raise ODA to 0.7per cent of GNP in a short period of time.Together we make up the G-0.7.“The G-7 is full of promises. If all the richcountries would just implement what they havecommitted themselves to  as the G-0.7 have done we would not encounter these financialconstraints. Having said that  we do realize thatODA is not the only way forward. We also musttake into account fair distribution of resources debt relief  open markets  good governance andthe role of the private sector. A reform of theCommon Agricultural Policy is a great challengeto the EU.“We welcome new and innovative financingoptions  but the main problem is that somecountries are not providing adequate ODAresources. Obviously there is a lack of politicalcommitment in setting budget priorities. Thesecountries need to change their political prioritiesin order to comply with their internationalcommitments.“EU Declarations like the one made inGöteborg do call for that much neededcompliance — that is to say  they call on us tokeep the promises we have already made — butthey do so only in general terms. We now need topick up the pace.“We call on EU members to make a firmcommitment at the International Conference onFinance for Development in Monterrey in 2002and to formulate individual plans and timetablesin order to make concrete progress in reaching thegoal of 0.7 per cent of GNP to ODA.“Today’s EU Development Council inBrussels is a good opportunity to furtherstrengthen the relations in our global world. Itshould send a long awaited signal that we areserious about our commitments to developingcountries.”I wish to place on record the high appreciation ofmy Government to the Governments of Denmark Luxembourg  Netherlands  Norway and Sweden forthose frank and refreshing observations.We in the developing world will certainly lookwith much expectation to the International Conferenceon Financing for Development that will convene inMarch next year. We cannot but hope that notwithstanding the continuing difference in positions a secure foundation for a partnership for the future willbe formed there  within which both the strong interestsof the developing world and the strong concerns of thedeveloped world can be adequately accommodated.And I would think that undoubtedly thedeveloped world too will  after the events of 11September  look to the future with a frame of minddifferent from its frame of mind before that fatefuldate. Development  stability and contentment for all26people are no longer charitable objectives. They are inthe self-interest of all.Most certainly  neither we in the developingworld nor those in the developed world can allowabject  desperate poverty  without any hope of a betterfuture  to become a fertile field for those who wish tofan the flames of discord and hate and make it theirbusiness to wreak death  destruction  terror andmayhem.Fifty-six years ago almost to this day  theConstitution of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization was proclaimed inwords that have a prophetic resonance today:“... since wars begin in the minds of men  it is inthe minds of men that the defences of peace mustbe constructed;“... ignorance of each other’s ways and lives hasbeen a common cause  throughout the history ofmankind  of that suspicion and mistrust betweenthe peoples of the world through which theirdifferences have all too often broken into war;“... the great and terrible war which has nowended was a war made possible by the denial ofthe democratic principles of the dignity  equalityand mutual respect of men  and by thepropagation  in their place  through ignorance andprejudice  of the doctrine of the inequality of menand races;“... a peace based exclusively upon the politicaland economic arrangements of governmentswould not be a peace which could secure theunanimous  lasting and sincere support of thepeoples of the world  and...the peace musttherefore be founded  if it is not to fail  upon theintellectual and moral solidarity of mankind.”These are noble words of timeless quality. Butwords  however noble  which remain untranslated intodeeds become shallow  tawdry  degraded.All nations  all the peoples of the world  mustrealize that we are slipping into a crisis of a kind wehave never encountered before. The spectres of fear doubt  uncertainty  mistrust and suspicion stalk theworld. The hour is late. The hour is grave."
"101",4215,"LSO",56,2001,"﻿On behalf of thedelegation of Lesotho  allow me  through you  Sir  tocongratulate the President and other members of theBureau on their election to office during this fifty-sixthsession of the General Assembly. Allow me also to paya well deserved tribute to Mr. Harri Holkeri  Presidentof the fifty-fifth session  and to commend him forspearheading efforts to reform and revitalize theGeneral Assembly  with a view to strengthening its roleas the chief deliberative policy-making andrepresentative body of the United Nations.We congratulate our Secretary-General forwinning the Nobel Peace Prize and for hisreappointment as head of the Organization. This willno doubt enable him to continue his efforts to make theUnited Nations more relevant in facing today’schallenges. We commend him for continuing to placesuch a high premium on the need for the Organizationto develop better tools for conflict prevention management and resolution and encourage him to6continue developing concepts and strategic frameworksfor the Organization’s activities in the areas of conflictprevention and peace-building.We particularly wish to commend the Secretary-General for his relentless efforts and commitment toreforming and transforming the United Nations into afunctioning Organization with a new managementculture. We reiterate the view shared by many in thisAssembly that the United Nations would be moredemocratic if the Security Council were made morerepresentative of the membership as a whole.Regrettably  while we all agree on the need for reform agreement on the details for such reform continues toelude us.Lesotho reiterates its unequivocal condemnationof the barbaric acts of terror committed againstinnocent civilians on 11 September and extends itscondolences to the relatives of all those who perishedduring the attacks. Ideological or other differences areno excuse for such unspeakable acts; neither can suchevil acts be justified on the grounds of expediency.Those responsible for these acts must be punished.While we support the international coalition againstterrorism and consider ourselves part thereof  wenevertheless stress the need for capacity-building toenable all countries effectively to play their part incombating this menace.One year after the unprecedented MillenniumSummit is now a good time for us to reflect and takestock of how we are responding to the challenges andchanges brought about by our ever growinginterdependence and the ever-increasinginterconnectedness of our economies. In this changingworld in which all forms of economic  social  culturaland political activity have become dependent on accessto telecommunications and information servicesprovided by the global information infrastructure  whatprogress have we made towards making globalizationtruly global and ensuring that people everywhere sharein its benefits?The truth of the matter is that there remains agaping digital chasm between the industrialized and thedeveloping countries  especially in Africa where themajority of the people are yet to reap the benefits ofinformation and communications technology. Muchstill needs to be done to jump-start the introduction ofinformation and communications technology inprimary schools in order to enable the developingcountries to respond to the changing needs of societyand the economy.The United Nations system thus has to redoubleits efforts in assisting developing countries  particularlyin Africa  in building their capacity in curriculumdevelopment to ensure improvements in the quality ofeducation and access to information andcommunications technology  including through thetransfer of technology. We thus call upon allinternational partners to treat information andcommunications technology as a special priority forAfrica’s development.Despite the many difficulties that the developingcountries continue to face in addressing their urgentdevelopment needs  solid progress is being madetowards establishing strong institutional capacities forsustainable development  including a soundmacroeconomic foundation  effective governance peace and stability. Following many years ofundemocratic military dictatorships and coups d’état inAfrica  the continent has begun to take bold steps toclimb out of the rut  and today strong winds ofdemocracy continue to reverberate throughout. Thisdeepening of democratic principles has led Africans toshun all leaders who come to power through extra-constitutional means. There is also a growingawareness within Africa that sustainable developmentcannot take place in the midst of actual or potentialconflict and that armed conflict is retrogressive andinevitably destroys the achievements of many years ofnational development; hence  conflict management isnow assuming greater importance in Africa.Development is also beginning to take firm rootsas many African countries formulate their developmentstrategies and pursue greater cooperative relations withtheir development partners. The key role played by theUnited Nations in helping to re-energize themomentum for international partnership between  inparticular  the least developed countries and theinternational community will remain crucial foraddressing poverty and sustainable development.Africa is not only determined to overcome itsproblems  but it is also determined to ensure that thefuture development of the continent is shaped anddesigned by Africans themselves. Many of the evilsthat have continued to plague Africa  includingeconomic decline  internal unrest and civil wars uncertainty  corruption and disintegration of States 7have been major obstacles to the development andestablishment of viable societies in Africa. All this hasmade us realize that the only way to achievesustainable development for the continent is to ensurethat people live and work in stable conditions under therule of law. Transforming the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) into the African Union should thus beseen as an important step that will pave the way for theestablishment of strong institutions endowed withnecessary powers and resources to enable them todischarge their duties and responsibilities efficientlyand effectively.It is against this background that the launching ofthe New African Initiative in Lusaka in July was also aturning point in Africa’s efforts aimed at ensuring thatappropriate Africa-wide and regional economic andsocial reforms are carried out with a view toeradicating all social injustices. This African-ownedand African-led economy-centred recovery programmeand framework for action is a pragmatic vision of howAfrica wishes to be included as a partner and not as arecipient of the benefits and opportunities offered byglobalization. This initiative by Africans  which setsout the right priorities and focal points for thesustainable development of the African continent deserves not only commendation  but also support fromthis Assembly and the international community as awhole.In embarking on this new path to recovery Africans have no illusions. They are fully aware of themammoth task that they have set for themselves andbelieve that progress towards achieving it will have tobe driven by the people and Governments of Africathemselves. We will have to create the necessaryconditions to allow the poor to become agents ofchange  using their own talents and capacities to raisetheir production and increase their income.For all that to happen  Africa needs resources.The international community must provide support notonly through development cooperation  but alsothrough improved trade access for African countries tothe markets of the developed world. The “Everythingbut Arms” initiative adopted by the European Councilof Ministers in February is a first important steptowards scrapping customs duties on imports fromAfrica and other developing countries  and needs to beemulated. We express our gratitude for the support andcommitment already given to this initiative by the G-8and the European Union and call upon other donorcountries and agencies to join Africa as it embarks onits new path of recovery. In the same vein  weacknowledge the benefits that the African Growth andOpportunity Act holds for sub-Saharan Africancountries.The Millennium Summit reaffirmed theCopenhagen World Summit for Social Developmentgoal of reducing by half the number of people living inextreme poverty by 2015. Despite that  abject poverty a narrow resource base and  hence  broad dependenceon overseas development aid  unsustainable levels ofdebt and the deleterious effects of the HIV/AIDSpandemic continue to be part of everyday reality forthe majority of the people in the world. In someregions of sub-Saharan Africa poverty has actuallyincreased  posing a serious threat to democraticgovernance processes through the erosion of humanrights and human dignity  as well as the deterioration ofthe already narrow natural resource base. In addition the number of least developed countries has more thandoubled since 1971  when the United Nations set upthat category of countries.A more rapid and sustainable exit from debt isthus imperative. This calls for urgent implementationof an enhanced and expanded Heavily Indebted PoorCountries Debt Initiative (HIPC). It further calls formore comprehensive measures  including convertingthe remaining bilateral debts of the least developedcountries into grants  widening HIPC to benefit morecountries  increasing the levels of official developmentassistance  ensuring markets for the products of leastdeveloped countries and encouraging greater volumesof foreign direct investment to Africa.Lesotho therefore looks forward to furtherdiscussion of these measures during the comingInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment  the convening of which we fullysupport. We also believe that the Programme of Actionfor the Least Developed Countries for the Decade2001-2010 is a benchmark framework for acceleratingthe sustained economic growth and sustainabledevelopment of the poorest and weakest segment of theinternational community.Housing remains a critical pillar of sustainableeconomic development. It is the single most importantand obvious indicator of individual aspirations andtheir fulfilment. Testimony to this is the renewal of ourcommitment  earlier this year  to the principles of the8Habitat Agenda  which are encapsulated in the ideas ofadequate shelter for all and sustainable humansettlements for development. Poverty continues to be amajor factor for developing countries’ failure to realizethese twin goals of the Habitat Agenda.In the same vein  a healthy population is anabsolute requirement for social and economicdevelopment. We thus recognize the enormouschallenges posed by HIV/AIDS and other infectiousdiseases. For Africa  which is host to 70 per cent of thepeople infected with HIV/AIDS worldwide  thisscourge is reversing hard-won gains in economic andsocial development. Political commitment andleadership are therefore essential for building nationalcapacities to develop and implement comprehensivenational strategies for HIV/AIDS prevention  care support and treatment  all of which requiremobilization of resources. We therefore welcome theoutcome of the special session on HIV/AIDS heldduring the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly and hope that the Global AIDS and Health Fundannounced by the Secretary-General will soon becomeoperational to provide funding on a grant basis to themost affected countries.Lesotho welcomes the global movement to ensurethat every child enjoys a better beginning  and hence abetter future  and has undertaken to renew itscommitment to ensure the rights of children. Our mostauspicious endeavour to that end was the progressiveintroduction  in the year 2000  of free primaryeducation beginning with standard 1 pupils. We believethat this is a step forward in ensuring sustainedeconomic growth and poverty reduction. The newagreed dates for the postponed children’s summitshould ensure that we do not lose the momentum forcreating a better world for children.Lesotho also remains keenly aware of theimportant role that women play in the advancement ofthe nation’s social and economic developmentprocesses  as well as of the need to sustain theirinvolvement and participation at all levels. To that end we have heeded the call to States parties to theConvention on the Elimination of All Forms ofDiscrimination against Women that have enteredreservations to the Convention to review thosereservations. Our own reservation to the Conventionhas been amended with a view to withdrawing it at alater stage.The events in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda as well as the gruesome images of women and childrenwhose limbs were hacked off by rebel forces in SierraLeone  have shown that accountability for genocide war crimes and crimes against humanity  and universaljurisdiction over those crimes  are key to bringing anend to the cycle of impunity that we have witnessedover the years. Lesotho’s tangible contribution towardsending the culture of impunity is demonstrated by itssupport and assistance to the activities of theInternational Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwandaaimed at bringing those responsible for the mostegregious crimes to justice  as well as its support forthe creation of the Special Court for Sierra Leone  forwhich Lesotho has pledged $100 000 over three years.The first payment of $40 000 in respect of the first yearhas already been deposited. We call on the internationalcommunity to provide adequate funding in order thatthe Special Court for Sierra Leone may come intooperation.While the pace of ratifications for the Statute ofthe International Criminal Court is encouraging  moreneeds to be done if that Court is to become a realitysoon. Adequate time and resources should therefore bemade available for the Preparatory Commission tofulfil its mandate within the first half of 2002.International peace and security continue to be amajor challenge for the United Nations in the twenty-first century. While some positive developments havebeen recorded on various issues that are critical to thesecurity of the international community  much morestill needs to be done in pursuit of a more peacefulworld — a world free from weapons of massdestruction; a world free from the arsenals of illicitsmall arms and light weapons; and a world withstrengthened global norms for nuclear non-proliferationand disarmament.We renew our call to those who remain outsidethe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) to join the Treaty  and urge thenuclear-weapon States to continue full compliance withobligations assumed under the Treaty.The recent spate of biowarfare threats have alsoheightened the urgent need to devise effectivecompliance measures that will make the proliferationof biological weapons much harder and prevent suchweapons from falling into the hands of terrorist groups.9The historic United Nations Conference on theIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in AllIts Aspects has succeeded in highlighting the humansuffering and insecurity engendered by the excessiveaccumulation and illicit transfer of those weapons.Though not fully satisfactory  particularly to those ofus who have suffered most from this scourge  themeasures envisaged in the Programme of Action are ahistoric first step towards curbing this menace. It isnow up to all of us to forge meaningful partnerships toensure effective implementation of the Programme aswe move together to free the world of these weapons.While peace has continued to hold in manyregions of the world  Africa has experienced setbacksin that regard  as violent conflicts have continuedunabated. The sad legacy of our colonial past  whereinState-sponsored activities facilitated the systematicplunder of Africa’s resources  have been replaced byforeign companies and individuals in pursuit of the so-called bottom line  whose sole motive is themaximization of profit. The link between conflicts  theeasy availability of arms  an abundance of naturalresources and the greed of these individuals havetotally devalued African lives. In other words  theworth of African lives in the year 2001 is much thesame as during the time of slavery in the nineteenthcentury. We call upon the same collective conscienceof the international community that condemned andsucceeded in eradicating slavery to speak with equalvehemence against this evil in our time.The volatile and explosive situation in the MiddleEast remains highly regrettable. Lesotho supports thecreation of an independent Palestinian State on thebasis of Security Council resolutions  a State thatshould coexist in peace with its neighbours.We call on all parties to conflicts around theworld to intensify efforts to create conditionsconducive to the implementation of the agreementsreached and relevant Security Council resolutions  aswell as to the effective engagement of the UnitedNations. We are encouraged by the developments in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  Burundi and SierraLeone  and applaud the efforts of all parties to bringpeace to their countries.We are  however  saddened by the lack ofprogress in the implementation of agreements relatingto the settlement  once and for all  of two of the largestrunning conflicts  in Angola and the Saharan ArabDemocratic Republic. We in Lesotho are convincedthat the Houston accords remain the foundation forself-determination in the latter  while  undoubtedly  theLusaka Protocol on Angola remains the only viablebasis for peace in that sisterly country.In conclusion  Lesotho renews its commitment tomultilateral cooperation and the principles enshrined inthe United Nations Charter. The current difficult timescall for the strong support of the United Nations andthe multilateral processes if the Organization is toeffectively address the new global issues andchallenges that confront it."
"102",4241,"LTU",56,2001,"﻿Let me at the outsetexpress our deepest condolences to the families of thevictims of Monday’s tragic accident in Queens  NewYork.I am particularly pleased to see Mr. Han Seung-soo guiding the General Assembly during this session.I wish to assure him of my delegation’s fullest supportin all his endeavours. I would like also to extend my32congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on his election to asecond term of office as Secretary-General.It is also with great satisfaction that we join otherspeakers in congratulating Mr. Kofi Annan on havingbeen awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. We are proud thatthe one hundredth Nobel Prize also honoured theUnited Nations as a whole. As rightly pointed out bythe Secretary-General  this “challenges us to do moreand to do better”. It is our responsibility to ensure thatthe Organization is at the forefront of efforts to achievepeace and security in the world.This year Lithuania is celebrating the tenthanniversary of its membership in the United Nations.On 17 September 1991  our nation proudly watched asthe Lithuanian flag was raised for the first time at theUnited Nations.In the 10 years that have elapsed  we have seen arapid transformation in the world order. The worldaround us has shrunk with incredible speed. Thebenefits accruing from globalization have made usmore dependent upon each other and thus morevulnerable to complex phenomena that affect thestability and security of our societies.Terrorism does not recognize national borders. Itspills over into international terrain  no matter howingenious the defences are that have been put in place.Only through the common efforts of the internationalcommunity will it be possible to create successfuldefence mechanisms. Indeed  on 11 September  theworld grasped the sheer magnitude of the defences thatwill be required.Terrorism is closely linked to extreme poverty marginalization  human rights violations  ethnic strife the proliferation of arms and drug trafficking. Thus  itis essential in the long term to devise and carry out ananti-terrorism policy that is inclusive and spans allregions and continents.I wish to express once again from this rostrum mynation’s strong condemnation of terrorist actions and toreaffirm our solidarity with the people of the UnitedStates. We are determined to stand alongside theinternational community in combating terrorism. In theimmediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks  Lithuaniasupported the actions taken by the European Union andthe North Atlantic Alliance  including the decision ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) toinvoke article 5 of the Washington Treaty. MyGovernment has decided to grant permanent diplomaticclearance for the overflight and landing of UnitedStates Government aircraft.An important step aimed at combating andpreventing terrorism was the adoption of anunprecedented Security Council resolution: resolution1373 (2001). Now it is up to Governments to actwithout delay in following through the detailedrequirements of the resolution.The General Assembly should also make its owncontribution  first of all  by speeding up its work on thedraft comprehensive convention on internationalterrorism.Domestic legal steps to be taken by MemberStates include ratification of the 12 United Nationsmultilateral instruments directly designed for thesuppression of terrorism. Lithuania has already steppedup its efforts to accede to the remaining fiveConventions.In this endeavour  the experience and practice ofother international bodies in the fight against terrorismshould not be forgotten. For instance  the Council ofEurope has successfully elaborated a number oftreaties  such as the European Convention on theSuppression of Terrorism  the European Convention onExtradition and its Protocols  and so on. Theexperience of this regional organization could also beused in the field of crime prevention  money-laundering and corruption. It is noteworthy thatinstruments of the European treaty system are alsoopen to non-member States.Just last week — meeting in Warsaw at aconference of heads of State of Central and EasternEurope on the common fight against terrorism — 17leaders from the region  including from my owncountry  adopted a declaration on cooperation in thecombat against terrorism and a plan of action againstterrorism. It is aimed at improving cooperation amongintelligence  customs and police services and crackingdown on money-laundering and drug trafficking.The challenges posed by a globalized world aremultifarious and interrelated. They require diverse andversatile actions. Therefore  due consideration andresources should be devoted to the problems of armscontrol and disarmament  as well as to povertyeradication and sustainable development.33In this regard  I would like to note the resolutionadopted just a few weeks ago by the First Committeeon multilateral cooperation in the area of disarmamentand non-proliferation and on global efforts againstterrorism. It puts a clear focus on multilateral efforts tocombat international terrorism and fight proliferation.The results of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) article XIV Conference haverekindled the hope that widespread concerns about thedelayed entry into force of the Treaty will be taken intoaccount. We also hope that the implementation of the13 steps agreed upon at the 2000 Review Conferenceof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) will not be put on hold. Likewise intensive bilateral consultations between the UnitedStates and the Russian Federation on a new strategicframework will  it is hoped  foster a commonunderstanding and provide a basis for deep reductionsin all classes of nuclear weapons  consistent with thecommitments under article VI of the NPT.Strengthening the Biological and Toxin WeaponsConvention also remains an urgent priority.The 2001 Conference on the Illicit Trade in SmallArms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects has yieldeda Programme of Action  a strategy and the politicalmomentum to deal with the proliferation and misuse ofsmall arms. There needs to be a follow-up process totackle their brokering  marking and transportation andto build upon the measures agreed thus far. In themeantime  we believe that the strict implementation ofthe Programme of Action will bring about a realchange at the end of the day.History has proved that democratic  prosperousStates provide the most favourable environment forhuman activities. The United Nations should thereforecontinue its efforts to promote democratization andsustainable development. I would also like tounderscore the need to pay even greater attention to thepromotion and protection of human rights.Today we face the challenges of a globalizedworld  which are the result of rapidly developingtechnologies and human negligence. These challenges although not as evident as open military conflicts  areno less threatening. A devastated and deterioratingenvironment could cause conflicts of an unprecedentedscale.No effort should be spared to free people from thedehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty.Assistance  new trade arrangements and debt reliefshould be complemented by firm commitments topoverty reduction  economic equality and measures tosupport education; they should be reflected first andforemost in the national policies of individual Statesand  at the same time  on the agendas of internationalorganizations. In this regard  we commit ourselves toensuring successful preparation for the InternationalConference on Financing for Development and theWorld Summit on Sustainable Development.The Summit  in Johannesburg  should makeconcrete contributions to the eradication of poverty andthe promotion of sustainable modes of production andconsumption. In this regard  the Government ofLithuania  in its domestic policy  aims at economicdevelopment that does not harm the overall quality ofthe environment. Priority is given to promotinginvestment aimed at the prevention of pollution   theuse of clean fuel and energy sources and theintroduction of low-waste and other progressiveenvironmental technologies.The International Conference on Financing forDevelopment should focus on better mobilization andmore effective use of financial resources and find waysfor more efficient cooperation between all developmentactors. The meeting will set strategic goals of policycoherence in order to integrate into the world economycountries with differing levels of economicdevelopment. The Bretton Woods institutions and theprivate sector should play important roles in thedevelopment process.The events of 11 September have proved howfragile international security can be. Moreover  indefence of our common values — freedom  democracyand openness — no nation can idly stand by or actunilaterally. Every nation must pull its own weight incontributing to regional and international stability.Strengthening dialogue and understanding amongnations and civilizations should also remain in theforefront of our thinking. Better understanding andidentified common values will foster trust andtolerance among people  preventing the spread offanaticism  violence and terrorism. Lithuania made itscontribution to these goals by hosting the InternationalConference on Dialogue among Civilizations in Aprilthis year.It is of crucial importance to Lithuania toparticipate actively in international organizations and34to contribute to peacekeeping efforts. We havecontinued to provide our civilian police officers toUnited Nations peacekeeping operations through theUnited Nations Standby Arrangements System. Ourtroops have been serving in the Balkans since the verybeginning of the international engagement in thatregion. Just a few days ago  a Lithuanian medicalsquad  a small  but much-needed contribution to theUnited Nations  was placed under the StandbyArrangements System. Shortly  Lithuania will submitits application for full-fledged membership in theUnited Nations Standby Forces High-ReadinessBrigade.Membership in the European Union and the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization will solidify our region’sinstitutional  economic and security ties. Lithuania issparing no effort in preparing for the challenges of aunified pan-Atlantic family of democracies. The workof the Vilnius 10 group  initiated a few years ago andlaunched in Vilnius  is proof of the ability of theregion’s States to promote transparency  partnershipand common values.At the subregional level  Lithuania stressespractical cooperative efforts to promote democratic andeconomic transformation throughout the region. Overthe last decade  our engagement with Poland hasbecome a close partnership. Dynamic trilateral Balticcooperation has become part of broader Baltic-Nordiccooperation. Excellent cross-border cooperation withthe Kaliningrad region has given rise to many dynamicdevelopments.Just a couple of days ago  on 8 November Lithuania assumed the chairmanship of the Committeeof Ministers of the Council of Europe. The Council ofEurope  based on the common values of pluralistdemocracy  human rights and the rule of law  alreadyhas a history of cooperation with the United Nationsand its agencies  most notably in the field of humanrights. Recent joint efforts by the United Nations  theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europeand the Council of Europe to facilitate recovery ofSouth-Eastern Europe have proved to be of the utmostsignificance for the people of the region  and haveopened a new chapter of cooperation between theseorganizations.During its chairmanship  Lithuania will seek tostimulate dialogue between the Council of Europe andthe United Nations and its specialized agencies. Weencourage a regular exchange of views on issuesrelated to the fight against and prevention of terrorism organized crime and money-laundering. Intensivecoordination with regard to setting standards forpluralist democracy and respect for human rights willalso be promoted.In the work of the Council of Europe  theLithuanian chairmanship will focus mainly on fightingterrorism  supporting the enlargement process of theCouncil of Europe  promoting regional cooperation andensuring the effective functioning of the organization.With the aim of building a modern pan-Europeansociety  we will keep working to establish a widerEuropean identity  sharing the best practices of theCouncil of Europe with other organizations and States and strengthening the impact of the Council of Europe."
"103",4285,"LUX",56,2001,"﻿First  I should like to express our very sincerecondolences and sense of compassion to the families ofthe victims of the tragic accident that occurred thismorning  as well as to the authorities of the City andState of New York  which have been so seriouslyaffected by the terrorist attacks on 11 September.I should  however  like to congratulate ourPresident  Mr. Han Seung-soo. I am convinced thatwith the cooperation of Member States  he will be ableto conduct this Assembly in a way to ensure that itresponds ambitiously and effectively to the challengesbefore it.President Holkeri conducted the MillenniumAssembly deftly  wisely exercising his presidentialauthority and evincing a soothing sense of humour. Wewould like to thank him for that.Our Secretary-General tirelessly continues hiswork to promote international peace and security.Member States wish to thank him for the imaginationand wisdom shown as he discharges his loftyresponsibility  and they have renewed his term ofoffice. International public opinion has expressed itsgratitude for his exceptional commitment by givinghim  together with the United Nations  the Nobel PeacePrize. We would like to associate ourselves with thattribute. We congratulate him and wish him the best inhis difficult work at the head of the Organization.In the course of this first session of the twenty-first century  the General Assembly has begun its workunder the sign of terrorism. The indescribable crimethat was committed on 11 September 2001 against theUnited States of America and its citizens  male andfemale  represents a breakdown in internationalrelations. It was not only America that was targeted bythis infamous attack against the World Trade Centertowers  it was our lifestyle in an open  democratic tolerant and multicultural society to which the broadmajority of countries and peoples represented hereaspire. That is unbearable to terrorists.17Civilian airplanes have become guided missilesthrough blind and murderous terrorism  and as a resultwe all feel attacked. We can't call this a confrontationhere between civilizations  combat between North andSouth  between religions. The perpetrators of therepugnant attack of 11 September wish to deny by theiract the very values that form the basis of theinternational community  which we have endeavouredto build for the past 50 years through the UnitedNations and its multilateral system.The subsequent discussion in public opinion hasshown that our societies do not yet know each otherwell enough. Ignorance leads to distrust and evenhostility  promoting a chilling self-absorption.Dialogue among civilizations  as promoted andpractised by our Organization  must now more thanever be at the forefront of our considerations.Having expressed its compassion for the innocentvictims of those cowardly attacks  the internationalcommunity must now react with determination toensure that the perpetrators receive the punishmentthey deserve and to defend itself in such a way as toprevent such acts in the future. I should like to take thisopportunity to reaffirm our solidarity with the UnitedStates of America in its exercise of its legitimate rightto self-defence.Two days ago  the current President of theEuropean Union  Mr. Louis Michel  gave a detaileddescription of the measures and initiatives taken by the15 member States to combat the scourge of terrorism.Luxembourg is participating unreservedly in this jointeffort.Only through coordinated and interdisciplinarywork will we be able to fight all forms of terrorism.Our response must be commensurate with the threat while respecting the fundamental freedoms of thecitizen  a principle that underlies our civilization.With regard to the situation in Afghanistan  wemust work under the auspices of the United Nationswith a view to promoting the emergence of a stable andlegitimate Government that is representative of theAfghan population as a whole. Such a Governmentmust respect the human rights of the Afghan peopleand develop good-neighbourly relations with all thecountries of the region. In that context  I should like towelcome in particular the activities of the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General forAfghanistan  Mr. Brahimi.As soon as its objective has been achieved  theinternational community  through the concerted effortsof the United Nations  the International Committee ofthe Red Cross and other international organizations should set up an ambitious programme that is bothpolitical and humanitarian  with a view to helping toreconstruct Afghanistan and to ensure its integrationwithin a stabilized region. Such an effort will requireintensified political dialogue with all of the countriesof the region.At this time  the provision of assistance to thecivilian population in Afghanistan and to the refugeesacross its borders is a matter of priority. My countryhas already raised almost 7 million euros for thatpurpose as part of a comprehensive effort within theEuropean Union amounting to more than 320 millioneuros.Although there are no grounds for making adirect connection between the events of 11 Septemberand the situation in the Middle East  the situation thereis becoming increasingly worrying. We note that unfortunately  the fabric that was woven during 10years of mediation efforts and that was almostcompleted at Taba is now unravelling before our eyes.During my recent visit to the region  I noted the extentto which the peace process  which has been deadlockedfor far too long  is suffering from the absence of anyreal prospects and from increasing distrust among theparties.That is why  together with our colleagues fromthe European Union  we are stepping up our efforts toconvince the parties that only the cessation of violenceand the recognition of two States will make it possiblefor negotiations to resume that can lead to a just andlasting peace in the region  on the basis of theestablishment of a Palestinian State and the right ofIsrael to live in peace and security. The EuropeanUnion stands ready to provide a framework for thisprocess  in cooperation with the United States ofAmerica and the Arab States of the region  and to assistthe parties with a view to facilitating the reconciliationthat is necessary.In the meantime  the United Nations willtirelessly pursue its efforts to achieve internationalpeace and stability. In 2001  four reports of theSecretary-General  dealing with peacekeeping humanitarian action  the prevention of conflict and thefollow-up to the Millennium Summit  have shown18the way forward. They show that it is necessary for theinternational community to be steadfast in itscommitment to the prevention and management ofconflict.Any hesitation or fleeting expression ofdisinterest might risk encouraging elements that maywant to aggressively defend their own interests withoutregard for the consequences at the national orinternational level. Europe has witnessed such dramaticchains of events  particularly in the Balkans  and wecan only feel a sense of humility when consideringtheir disastrous effects.If this year the United Nations has not been onthe front line in the Balkans  it has been working hardin the area of peacekeeping. I would like to make twocomments about these operations. First  we note thatthere has been a considerable improvement in thequality of their management  following the conclusionsof the Brahimi report. Secondly  there has been aninternational commitment to deal with hotbeds oftension as diverse and complex as those of Kosovo East Timor  the Democratic Republic of the Congo andSierra Leone.The balance sheet is relatively encouraging.Kosovo will soon be holding elections that will haveimportant consequences for the future of the province.The United Nations operation in East Timor can perhaps  be viewed as a clear success for internationalaction. Attempts to restructure peacekeeping operationshave been promoted through careful consideration inthe Secretariat  the Security Council and the GeneralAssembly  based upon an outstanding follow-up report.The complexity of crisis situations often  ofcourse  demands a prudent response  even when realprogress has been made  as is the case in Sierra Leone.It is even more important to document internationaldetermination through clear mandates that allow for astrong response. We believe that the inclusion of troop-contributing countries in the decision-making processis essential. The increasingly integrated approach thathas been chosen  as illustrated by the United NationsInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo and theUnited Nations Transitional Administration in EastTimor  is designed to ensure a logical successionbetween the phases of prevention  peacekeeping and finally  consolidation  reconstruction and development.One of the most urgent tasks of our Organizationis to provide immediate assistance for civilianpopulations that are the victims of natural disasters orcrises brought about by human intervention.Luxembourg attaches particular importance to suchneeds  and we are endeavouring to support UnitedNations offices in this physically and morallydemanding task. Since the fall of 2000  we have beencoordinating  on an informal basis  the donor countriesin New York  and our delegation takes pleasure innoting the dedication of the competent officials andauthorities who head these services. I would like toassure the Assembly that my country is clearly awareof the need to protect  and ensure the safety of personnel.Humanitarian action  prevention  ceasefireagreements and peace-building activities hardlyconstitute the entire agenda of the internationalcommunity. A functioning democracy is a major assetin progress towards development  as I have alreadyemphasized. I need only reaffirm the importance ofnational efforts to combat corruption and foster theestablishment  within our societies  of the rule of lawbased on an equitable and properly functioning legalsystem.My country welcomes the efforts under waywithin the United Nations to put an end to impunityand to ensure that those responsible for committingcrimes against humanity and other atrocities answer fortheir actions within an international criminaljurisdiction.A special tribunal to judge crimes committedduring the course of the civil war is in the process ofbeing established in Sierra Leone  and Luxembourg hasmade a financial contribution to its establishment. InCambodia  a law to establish a tribunal to consider theatrocities and genocide perpetrated under thedictatorship of the Khmer Rouge is now in force  andwe must assess its compatibility with the memorandumproposed by the United Nations. The Tribunals in TheHague and Arusha have stepped up their work  and  forthe first time  a former head of State is awaiting histrial in prison. We welcome these developments  aswell as those who have joined us in the group ofcountries that have ratified the Rome Statute of thefuture International Criminal Court. The citizens ofLuxembourg would be pleased to see that conventionenter into force as soon as possible and acceded to by abroad majority of States.19In September 2000  heads of State andGovernment met here in New York. Since then  theMillennium Declaration has underpinned the actions ofthe United Nations and of States at the national level.Together with its European partners  Luxembourg hasaffirmed its dedication to the commitments entered intothere.I conclude by citing two facts that illustrate theawareness of my country's Government of theresponsibilities its shares with all here in preparing forthe future of coming generations. First  officialdevelopment assistance from Luxembourg has reached0.71 per cent of our gross national product; theGovernment has decided to raise it to 1 per cent by2005. I have also submitted to my country's Chamberof Deputies Luxembourg's first nomination to serve asa non-permanent member of the Security Council."
"104",4311,"LVA",56,2001,"﻿It is my honour toaddress the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session.Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September  the struggleagainst terrorism has become a clear priority on theinternational agenda. The United Nations is playing akey role in coordinating joint measures to eliminateinternational terrorism. My country reaffirms itscommitment to be vigorous in handling this matter.We must act on all levels — global  regional andnational — if we are to succeed in combatingterrorism. Today  the need for international cooperationhas assumed new dimensions. To achieve sustainableresults in eliminating terrorism  joint internationalaction is mandatory.Latvia strongly welcomes and supports SecurityCouncil resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001).Latvia is convinced that full and unconditionalimplementation of Council resolution 1373 (2001) isimperative for success in the suppression of terrorism.The financing of terrorism has to be prevented andeliminated. All action or inaction by States orindividuals that allows the practice of terrorism has tobe stopped. Cooperation and information exchangeamong States concerning terrorist activities has to bestrengthened. Latvia welcomes the establishment of theSecurity Council Committee to monitor theimplementation of resolution 1373 (2001).Latvia supports efforts undertaken by otherinternational organizations acting on the regional level.As an aspiring member of the Euro-Atlanticcommunity  Latvia plays its part in the commonactivities carried out by the European Union and theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization. In order toharmonize regional measures to prevent acts ofterrorism  an action plan for Central and EasternEuropean countries was adopted at the recent Warsawconference on combating terrorism. Another importantEuropean framework for combating terrorism is theCouncil of Europe  which has already formulated awide range of legal instruments intended to fightterrorism.My country fully shares the position of theEuropean Union that we must redouble our efforts tofight international terrorism. That includes both ourcommitment as members of the internationalcommunity and the “homework” we have to do asindividual States.A high-level task force has been established inLatvia to coordinate national efforts against terrorism including implementation of Security Councilresolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001). Latvia hasinitiated the national legislative process of ratifying theInternational Convention for the Suppression of the2Financing of Terrorism  and it is foreseen that we willsign the Convention by the end of this year.The Latvian Government has approved an actionplan for combating terrorism. This is a set of measuresaimed at strengthening my country’s ability to preventits territory  banking system and other assets frombeing used by terrorists. There should be no placewhere terrorists can hide from justice. Latvia hasalready formulated legislation in the area of preventingmoney laundering. Banks and other operators areobliged to report on suspicious transfers. TheGovernment has submitted to the parliament a packageof further amendments to the banking law and the lawon the prevention of the laundering of proceeds derivedfrom criminal activity.As it defends the world from terrorism  theinternational community has to do its utmost to sparethe innocent people of Afghanistan further suffering.Latvia fully supports the Special Representative of theSecretary-General  Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi  and otherparties in their efforts to bring about a fully inclusivepolitical system in Afghanistan. My country welcomesSecurity Council resolution 1378 (2001). The LatvianGovernment has also taken the decision to providehumanitarian aid to the Afghan people through theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees.We believe that the priorities that existed before11 September are all the more valid today. A year ago heads of State or Government adopted the MillenniumDeclaration  which renewed the spirit of the UnitedNations and which clearly demonstrated that the worldand its peoples need this Organization. Latvia attachesgreat importance to the implementation of theMillennium Declaration  especially in relation to issuesof human rights  fundamental freedoms  the rights ofthe child and conflict prevention. We consider that thefollow-up process to the Millennium Summit should bean integral part of the work of the United Nations.International relations in the twenty-first century haveto be based on values and principles set out in theDeclaration.The fifty-fifth session of the General Assemblydemonstrated that the commitment that was put into theMillennium Declaration was genuine. The results of theGeneral Assembly’s special sessions on humansettlements and on HIV/AIDS  the United NationsConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms andLight Weapons in All Its Aspects and the DurbanWorld Conference against Racism  RacialDiscrimination  Xenophobia and Related Intolerancehave set a number of goals at the State  regional andglobal levels. The process has started  and Latvia isactively participating in pursuit of the common goals.The United Nations is the only globalOrganization charged with the fundamental task ofsaving succeeding generations from the scourge of warand with the maintenance of lasting peace andinternational security. One of its most important tasks therefore  involves peacekeeping operations.My country has actively participated in UnitedNations-mandated peacekeeping operations since 1996.This year Latvia is continuing to provide support tostabilize the situation in the Balkans and isparticipating  with troops and personnel  in all UnitedNations-mandated  NATO-led operations in theBalkans  as well as in other operations and endeavoursof the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope (OSCE).Latvia  which attaches great importance topeacekeeping operations  voluntarily increased itscontribution to the United Nations peacekeepingbudget starting in 2001.The establishment of the International CriminalCourt has been one of the priorities of the UnitedNations for a decade. My country signed the RomeStatute in 1999  and the Government will present toParliament the ratification bill of the Statute and draftsof the necessary amendments to our national legislationas soon as possible. Latvia also hopes to be among thefirst 60 States to ratify the Statute.This is an important session of the GeneralAssembly for Latvia and for its people. This yearmarks a decade since Latvia joined the United Nationsas a free and independent country. The United Nationswas the first international organization that Latviajoined  after 50 years of occupation. The UnitedNations has a special meaning for Latvia. Latvia’sjoining the United Nations demonstrates thecommitment of my country to rejoin the internationalcommunity and to take an active part in internationalevents and processes.In these 10 years  Latvia has made great headwayin its development  and this growth encompasses avariety of realms. Latvia’s foreign policy is rooted in3the observance of international law  the development ofhuman rights and democracy and the protection ofuniversally accepted human values. The top prioritiesof Latvian foreign policy continue to be joining theEuropean Union and the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization. These are not goals in themselves  but rather  means to ensure sustainable development. Ourforeign policy priorities also include good-neighbourlyrelations  bilateral cooperation and active participationin international organizations.I have the honour to announce that Latvia ischanging its status from that of aid recipient to that ofdonor country  in order to provide its support to othersthrough both financial assistance and the sharing ofexperiences. Latvia has begun to elaborate its conceptof a donor country. We are looking forward to theimplementation of this concept and are assisting thosewho are in urgent need of our help.In conclusion  I would like to congratulate theUnited Nations and its Secretary-General  Kofi Annan on having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize inrecognition of the work that has been carried out. I amconvinced that we  as Member States  will continue tospare no effort in safeguarding the principles and idealsfor which the United Nations stands."
"105",4358,"MAR",56,2001,"﻿Atthe outset  I wish to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on behalf of the Kingdom of Morocco  on his electionto preside over the General Assembly at its fifty-sixthsession and to offer him our full support as he carriesout his important task. I also take this opportunity tothank and congratulate his predecessor  Mr. HarriHolkeri  on the effective and decisive manner in whichhe conducted the work of the General Assembly at itsfifty-fifth session.I also pay tribute to our Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for all his efforts in serving theOrganization and the international community as awhole and I congratulate him sincerely on his re-election to his post and on receiving the Nobel PeacePrize for 2001.We have all been struck and shaken by theheinous terrorist acts that took place on 11 Septemberin the United States. They were an attack uponthousands of innocent lives and a clear violation of allthe religious  humanitarian and cultural values that wehold dear. Whatever our attitude towards andevaluation of those events may be  internationalrelations have taken a different turn and a fatefuloutlook since that day. Those events were epic in theirresonance and the extent of their repercussions is notyet clear. One thing is clear  however: we will have toface new challenges and new constraints. Moroccoreaffirms its full condemnation of these actions andcalls on all countries to mobilize their efforts toeradicate terrorism at its very roots. Terrorismrepresents a threat not merely to international peaceand security  but to the human race as a whole.We believe that the United Nations is the mostappropriate institution for investigating the deepestcauses of terrorism  not least because of the resolutionsof the Security Council and the General Assemblyestablishing a unified and comprehensive set ofguidelines on this wide-ranging subject. That is whywe call on all competent bodies to do everythingpossible to fulfil their responsibilities for combating orpreventing terrorism. Morocco is a multi-ethnic Statefounded on tolerance  equality and respect forinternational law. It will contribute fully to the fightagainst the scourge of terrorism and its dangers.It is absolutely clear that the question of theMiddle East is one of the most serious regionalconflicts that the world has experienced in the past 50years. Recently  we have seen a dangerous escalation inthe conflict that has taken hundreds of lives  includingthose of many women and children  and underminedthe infrastructure and services of the occupiedterritories of Palestine. Morocco has thereforecondemned the attacks and called for a lifting of thesiege of Palestinian towns and villages  where homes schools and fields have been bulldozed. The forcedcolonization of Palestinian areas occupied since 1967must come to an end. We must break the vicious cycleof violence and reprisals  and return to the negotiatingtable on the basis of the conclusions of the Mitchellreport and signed agreements between Israel and thePalestinians.Morocco feels that peace between the Arabs andIsraelis will have to entail an Israeli withdrawal fromall the land occupied since 1967 in Palestine and theSyrian Golan Heights and that part of the territory ofLebanon that remains under Israeli occupation. Thismust take place on the basis of full compliance withinternational law  in particular Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and thedecisions of the Madrid Conference  which called foran exchange of land for peace. In this context  weheard with satisfaction the statement made by PresidentBush concerning the establishment of a PalestinianState and the expression of the will of the United StatesAdministration to resume its active role in reviving thepeace process in order to achieve a just  lasting 20comprehensive and genuine peace for all the peoplesand States of the region.Morocco takes this opportunity to reiterate itsconcern over the suffering of the brotherly people ofIraq and the deterioration of the humanitarian situationin that country. These are direct results of the economicsanctions that have been imposed on that nation for thepast 10 years and more. Morocco hopes that the talksunder way between the United Nations and theGovernment of Iraq will help towards the lifting of thesanctions and put an end to the despair  pain andsuffering of the Iraqi people.Morocco welcomes all the efforts to be made bythe United Nations and the Iraqi Government in thedialogue  which will be held in confidence andfrankness  to find a just solution to the problem ofdetainees and people missing since the Gulf War.Morocco supports both the independence andsovereignty of Kuwait and the sovereignty andterritorial integrity of Iraq itself.The settlement of armed conflicts is also ofcrucial importance to Africa  which  unfortunately  isstill being plagued by bloody but entirely contrivedconfrontations. What is happening in Africa requiresour Organization to adopt a new and pragmaticapproach enabling us to maintain and strengthen peacein Africa on the basis of respect for ceasefires and theencouragement of dialogue between the parties  andconfidence-building. We need to provide for preventiveaction  as stated by the Secretary-General at theopening of this session of the General Assembly. Weneed early warning mechanisms for areas of tension. Ifwe have such mechanisms  then we will be able to dealwith the deep causes of conflict  like injustice  poverty epidemics and refugees.Morocco  which is eager to support peace andsecurity in Africa  welcomes all efforts undertaken inthis area by the United Nations and international andregional organizations. Morocco  as always  hasresponded this year to the United Nations request fortroops from the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces toparticipate in the international peacekeeping operationsin the Democratic Republic of the Congo.The Kingdom of Morocco is determined toexpedite the process of constructing the Arab MahgrebUnion as a strong and balanced regional organizationthat will lead to permanent stability in the region andstrengthen economic  social and cultural institutions. Itwould also enter into fruitful partnership with otherregional organizations  including the European Union.Morocco remains convinced that such a Union isinevitable and most useful.The efforts to establish a Mahgreb organization however  depend upon finding an enduring  just andfinal solution to the problem of the Sahara. The conflictthere is a stumbling block preventing the fulfilment ofthe hopes of the peoples of the Mahgreb for goodrelations  complementarity  stability  prosperity andpeace. It is these hopes that have guided us sinceindependence  especially since the historic conferencein Tangiers in 1958. Although some claim otherwise the settlement plan did not come to a halt because ofthe huge number of challenges following theidentification process  but because of the hugedifficulties mentioned by the Secretary-General himselfin his last three reports to the Security Council.Finally  and again contrary to the claims ofsome  the Security Council  in resolution 1359(2001)  requested the four parties concerned in theSahara conflict to begin negotiations on the basis of theframework agreement tabled by the Secretary-Generalin the Security Council and known as the Baker plan.In fact  the initiative of the Secretary-General enshrined in the draft framework agreement  is aimedat a negotiated settlement of the conflict. As theSecretary-General himself put it  this is a last chance toreach a speedy and final settlement in the Saharaconflict. Morocco accepted the draft frameworkagreement as a basis for negotiation  and is ready tocontinue cooperating with the Security Council  theSecretary-General and his personal representative Mr. James Baker  in order to achieve a just  peacefuland final settlement of the Sahara issue.In keeping with international law and the Charter Morocco invites all other parties to provide the samepositive response to the appeal contained in SecurityCouncil resolution 1359 (2001) to start negotiations inorder to achieve a political solution of this totallycontrived conflict.The fact that Spain continues to occupy twoMoroccan cities  Ceuta and Melilla  and the islands offthe coast of Morocco that are near them  is a pureanachronism and totally out of line with the values andprinciples upheld by the international community.Morocco  which would like to see a European-Mediterranean community and dialogue between the21two shores of the Mediterranean  considers that a goodrelationship based on cooperation and goodneighbourliness with Spain is one of our basic strategicgoals. However  if we are to achieve that goal  Spainwill have to show an understanding of and good faithtowards Morocco's rightful claims on Ceuta andMelilla and the islands off the coast of Morocco  sothat Moroccan sovereignty over this territory can beexercised  with full guarantees for the economic  socialand cultural rights of the Spanish residents of these twocities. There have been similar precedents  in placeslike Hong Kong and Macao. Thus  we can refer to suchprevious settlements that will be in the interests of bothMorocco and Spain.Changes in the world economy make it essentialfor Mediterranean countries to give their economicrelationships a strong impetus based on new conceptsand approaches. That is why Morocco has tabled veryambitious projects with some of the other countries inthe eastern and southern Mediterranean regions.There is the initiative of His Majesty KingMohammed VI  known as the Agadir declaration of8 May 2001  which provides for the enlargement of thefree-trade zone that now exists on the basis ofagreements between Morocco  Egypt  Jordan andTunisia. The ideas for this free-trade area to beenlarged with the involvement of other ArabMediterranean States form a solid basis for the Stateson the south and east coasts of the Mediterranean tointegrate in a framework of partnership andcooperation  as under the Barcelona Declaration involving countries on the north shore of theMediterranean and the European Union in general.International peace and security do not dependonly on responses to political challenges. They alsodepend on social and economic problems. Wespecifically cite problems of the environment and lackof natural resources  where there are so manychallenges facing our planet  not least of which isaccess to water and drinking water at a reasonableprice. My country had the honour of contributing tothis cause at the seventh Conference of the Parties tothe Climate Change Convention  which took place inMarrakech between 29 October and 9 November 2001.This Conference resulted in positive steps on the waytowards an international conference on sustainabledevelopment to be held in Johannesburg next year.With regard to the social issues that are ofconcern to international organizations  the Kingdom ofMorocco considers that the United Nations shouldincrease its efforts to benefit children  because they arethe future of the human race. The Kingdom ofMorocco  upon the recommendation and leadership ofits sovereign  His Majesty Mohammed VI and theirRoyal Highnesses Prince Moulay Rachid and PrincessLalla Meriem  has spared no effort at the regional andinternational levels to ensure the success of the GlobalMovement for Children. Morocco has in this regardorganized three important conferences on children thisyear aimed at mobilizing all possible resources regional  Arab and African  in order to make surethat children enjoy their rights to health  education andjustice. Based on such convictions  Morocco isdetermined to effectively contribute to the success ofthe special session on children to be held next year.For the second time in 10 years  our Organizationhas received the Nobel Peace Prize  which is both anhonour and a burden. An honour for its success inpreventing wars and in settling disputes peacefully; anda burden because it leads to rethinking the role of theOrganization so it can become an effective tool inresponding to the new challenges and so it can fulfil itsgoals of building a world in which peace and securityprevail and in which all peoples of the world canharvest the fruits of technological and scientificadvances. Let us therefore rise to the level of suchchallenges and engage in a true partnership and solidvisionary outlook so we can achieve these nobleobjectives."
"106",4382,"MCO",56,2001,"﻿In taking the floor here at theHeadquarters of our Organization — recipient of the2001 Nobel Peace Prize — meeting in New York which has been so tragically attacked  I wish naturally at the outset  to renew to the delegation of the UnitedStates and the great country it represents  our friend and the American people the expression of heartfeltsympathy of the Principality of Monaco. Confrontedwith insane actions that prompt horror and indignation we find ourselves in natural solidarity in this ordeal  aswell as in the task that now faces the internationalcommunity of making decisions and working so thatour States and societies will be spared other appallingviolent acts in the future.I would like once again to extend to you  Mr.President  and to all the members of the Bureau oursincere congratulations on your election to thepresidency of this session of the General Assembly. Iam confident that  under your great leadership  ourwork will be carried out in a way that will best meetthe expectations of the international community. I alsowish to assure you of the spirit of cooperation of thedelegation of Monaco.I also wish to hail the brilliant re-election of theSecretary-General  a clear sign of the confidence thatwe have in his intelligence and humanity  which arelinked to his profound knowledge of the circumstancesin which he must discharge his noble mission regardingworld affairs  of which our Organization is seized. Wealso wish to assure him of the great satisfaction that thePrincipality of Monaco  my country  shares at the11renewal of his mandate and of our full support  whichwe will continue to offer him.We are very gratified that the 2001 Nobel PeacePrize was awarded to him jointly with ourOrganization  a fully deserved and justified reward thatshould motivate us — the States Members of theUnited Nations — to work together even more withhim to champion peace and to fight the many seeds ofconflict that threaten our world  terrorism  humanrights violations  underdevelopment and pandemicssuch as AIDS.The tragic circumstances in which this session ofthe General Assembly is taking place make it our dutyto contribute with even greater determination than inthe past to the struggle against terrorism. Owing totheir enormity and to the defiance that is behind them its manifestations can  as we have seen  pose a gravethreat to international peace and security. ThePrincipality of Monaco firmly supports everything theOrganization has adopted and implemented to stiflethis scourge  which can be so devastating to theprinciples we all hold. The fact that what a lawyerwould call “edged weapons” were enough to bringdown one of the most modern and sophisticatedsymbols of human creativity reminds us of the fragilityof our societies  which densely populated urban centresand interdependence in all vital areas make even morevulnerable in the light of the boundless contempt ofsome for human life and human dignity.Among the most important of the commitmentsour States have undertaken on behalf of their peoplesby signing the Charter of the United Nations are theobligations to maintain international peace andsecurity  to develop friendly relations among nationsand to encourage respect for human rights andfundamental freedoms: commitments that a handful ofterrorists  in their blind facelessness  rejected withappalling arrogance and savage brutality.Two months to the day have elapsed since thattragic event. Although emotions have by no meanssubsided  the healing effects of time are beginning togive us a little of the sense of distance that is sonecessary for more objective consideration of thisastonishing political challenge and this unacceptablehuman tragedy.The General Assembly very quickly undertooksuch consideration through its debate in early Octoberon measures to eliminate international terrorism. Forits part  the Security Council had already correctlymarked out the initial path and the principal guidelines.And the Secretary-General has repeatedly called onMember States to remain more united than ever  and itappears that his words have been heeded.Although the nature of terrorism did not changeon 11 September  its scale did. The General Assemblydecided to respond with a complete cohesiveness thathas been rare in its history. By adopting its resolution1373 (2001)  the Security Council did not shrink fromdrawing on the full scope and range of its powers underChapter VII of the Charter; it took note of the existenceof a threat to peace and an act of aggression and thusdecided on the exceptional measures that thePrincipality of Monaco is proud to be implementing.For us  following up on these initiatives with thenecessary effectiveness means not only implementingthe resolutions that reflect our common determinationand our commitment to fight terrorism and formulatingadditional agreements and conventions  but also  firstand foremost  bringing our expertise to theimplementation of instruments that have already beenconcluded and to which we have acceded or intend toaccede. Improving the Organization’s action in thelegal sphere is both indispensable and of top priority;we know this  as does the Government of thePrincipality. Therefore  yesterday I signed anddeposited  on behalf of my father  the sovereign Prince the instruments of ratification of the InternationalConvention for the Suppression of the Financing ofTerrorism. The Principality of Monaco considers itessential that there be coordinated worldwide actionagainst all forms of financing of terrorism  in order todeprive extremist movements of the resources thatenable them to do such serious harm to theinternational community and to its deep-seatedaspirations to peace and security. Afghanistan  much ofwhose territory is occupied and a portion of whosepeople are today enslaved  is the most telling exampleof this.The visionary Millennium Declaration and theoutcomes of recent world conferences — such as theUnited Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in SmallArms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects and theDurban World Conference Against Racism  RacialDiscrimination  Xenophobia and RelatedIntolerance — also merit special attention. Withoutquestion  these latter can contribute greatly toimproving  respectively  international security and12understanding among peoples. On the fight againstracism  the subject of the Durban World Conference  Iwould note that the Government of the Principality ofMonaco has decided to recognize the competence ofthe Committee on the Elimination of RacialDiscrimination  established under the InternationalConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of RacialDiscrimination  to receive and process communicationsfrom individuals or groups of persons chargingviolations of a right set out in that instrument  to whichMonaco is a party.International economic and financial cooperation with its inevitable human and social consequences must also be included in the reflection prompted bythese events  which is more necessary than ever in thelight of the issues facing us today. Because it is inpart the result of the new interdependence  theglobalization of trade in products  manufactured goodsand services — disparaged by some and hailed byothers — must also be a part of our urgent intellectualand practical endeavours  so that beyond theconstraints and imperatives that guide it  human beingscan regain their just  legitimate role. Above all  theeconomy must serve today’s men and women  withrespect for their legitimate aspirations  their vital needsand the age-old richness of their diversity.Regional and subregional cooperation isparticularly conducive to such a goal. My country isconvinced of that; in the Mediterranean area we areengaged in the trade  culture and technological spheres and are working to promote sustainable developmentand environmental protection. Nor should we neglectactivities which by their nature tend to bring togethermen and women from different backgrounds  such asartistic and cultural events  academic meetings andsporting competitions. In the Assembly’s debate on theagenda item entitled “Building a peaceful and betterworld through sport and the Olympic ideal”  thedelegation of Monaco will recall the irreplaceable rolein that connection of physical education and sport  aswell as of the Olympic games.Another way to bring human communitiestogether is the multilingualism for which the UnitedNations must be a model. That key item is on theAssembly’s agenda this year. The Principality ofMonaco will state its views on that subject and willstress the remarkable and unquestionable advantages ofmultilingualism for genuine understanding and mutualrespect among peoples.Alongside modern science and technology  whichare moving forward and rapidly becoming universal thus fostering exchanges among peoples  moretraditional forms of communication also have animportant role to play. In our view  teaching andinformation  more than ever before  have afundamental role in spreading ideas of peace andunderstanding among men and women in our troubledtimes. Here  the General Conference of the UnitedNations Educational  Cultural and ScientificOrganization has given us excellent regulatory texts working documents and programmes that we mustrevitalize with increased energy in order to providegreater hope to young people  who are often frustratedby the harshness of daily life.We also  and very often  give thought to the seasand the oceans  which made such a contribution inancient times to meetings of civilizations and to thespread of knowledge  thus enriching art and culturewhile developing trade and solidarity. A few days fromnow  the delegation of Monaco will state its viewsduring the consideration of the agenda item on oceansand the law of the sea. My country has always beendevoted to better scientific knowledge and carefulprotection of the marine environment  an indispensablesource for the harmonious flourishing of life.Thus the Principality of Monaco  with otherMember States  requests the Assembly to grantobserver status to the International HydrographicOrganization  for which it is the headquarters  in orderto allow that institution to strengthen its cooperationwith Governments and to advance internationalinitiatives and exchanges in marine cartography —initiatives and exchanges designed to spreadknowledge of seabeds and coastal zones  as well as tomake navigation easier and safer.Respect for the decisions and resolutions taken byour forums and the strengthening of our regulatoryactions  as well as the implementation of thedeclarations and plans of action of our recent globalconferences  are significant commitments to which theauthorities of the Government of the Principality ofMonaco are dedicated. In our difficult times  theyrepresent shared values which prompt us to act togetherin the interest of our international community  which isalso in the interest of each of our countries.To close on an optimistic note  allow me toexpress the hope — a hope that I believe is shared by13many here — that the wisdom of nations united morethan ever before will be able to triumph rapidly overthe evil represented by terrorism in its new global anduniversal form  while extirpating from the world thestubborn roots that fuel it."
"107",4407,"MDA",56,2001,"﻿Allow me at the outset  Sir  to convey to youour warmest congratulations on your election asPresident of the fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly. I am certain that your competence andactive cooperation with United Nations Member Stateswill pave the way for a successful and fruitful session.Allow me also to join previous speakers inexpressing our deep gratitude to your predecessor Mr. Harri Holkeri  for his outstanding work and for theprofessional manner in which he presided over thefifty-fifth session of the Assembly.I should also like once again  on behalf of theGovernment of the Republic of Moldova  to reiterateour warmest congratulations to Secretary-General KofiAnnan on having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize which was so well deserved  and for his re-election toanother term of office. His tireless efforts in redefiningthe role of the United Nations in this changing worldare certainly deeply appreciated and supported by myGovernment.The barbaric terrorist attacks of 11 Septemberhave radically changed the international securityenvironment. Terrorism has become the most seriousand immediate threat to the security and stability of ourStates. A challenge was laid down  not only to theUnited States of America  but to the entire worldcommunity. We fully agree with the statement made bythe President of the United States  Mr. George Bush  inhis statement before this Assembly at the 44th plenarymeeting  that “that threat cannot be ignored” and that“civilization itself — the civilization we share — isthreatened”.The fight against international terrorism hasclearly become a priority for the United Nations. Todaywe see a strong international coalition emerging which in the short term  is determined to bring to justice theperpetrators of terrorist acts and  in the long term  toeliminate this evil from the face of the earth.The Republic of Moldova  which immediatelyaligned itself with the ranks of this coalition  stronglycondemned the indiscriminate large-scale terroristattacks that took place in New York  Washington  D.C. and Pennsylvania. Moldova has also unreservedlysupported the actions undertaken by the United Statesin its legitimate self-defence and in accordance withthe United Nations Charter and Security Councilresolution 1368 (2001). Likewise  we support theglobal and multidimensional approach adopted by theUnited States in its war against terrorism.The Republic of Moldova has demonstrated itspolitical will to combat terrorist activities throughconcerted efforts with other countries in the frameworkof various regional and subregional organizations.11Our Government has strengthened its counter-terrorism legislation in order to comply with relevantregional and United Nations conventions and with theprovisions of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001).Our country is also taking measures in order to speedup accession to most of the remaining specializedUnited Nations counter-terrorism conventions. Thismorning  I signed on behalf of my country theInternational Convention for the Suppression of theFinancing of Terrorism.The tragic events of 11 September have shownthat the international community must take furthersteps to resolve the longstanding internationalproblems on which terrorism and violence feed. Wemust urgently address the conflicts around the worldand eliminate their root causes and factors that cannurture the development of terrorism.I feel obliged to add my voice to those who seethe phenomenon of separatism as a root cause ofconflicts and a threat to international peace andsecurity. In a globalized and interdependent world separatism affects the bases of multicultural societiesand poses grave danger to the sovereignty and integrityof States. Like international terrorism  separatismemphasizes what divides rather than what unites us. Asa country affected by separatism for many years  wehave constantly noted this phenomenon and theconnections it sometimes has with other seriouscriminal activities  including sometimes terrorism. Thisis why  in our opinion  this issue  among others  mustbe taken into account by the United Nations MemberStates in their efforts to elaborate and implement acomprehensive and efficient counter-terrorism strategy.The fact that I am focusing on the issues ofconflict settlement and separatism is not accidental.Over the years  my delegation has informed theAssembly of the efforts being made to resolve theconflict in the Transdniestrian region of the Republicof Moldova. However  I am obliged to note with regretthe lack of any noticeable positive developmentstowards a comprehensive settlement. Despite thereasonable compromises on the part of theconstitutional authorities in my country  the separatistregime continues to completely oppose any proposalsto grant special status to the region as a constituent partof the Republic of Moldova. Moreover  the leaders ofthat region have given a unilateral interpretation topolitical documents worked out with the activemediation of the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE)  Ukraine and theRussian Federation.Another matter of continuing concern is the factthat in recent years the illegal production of differenttypes of armaments has been noted in this region.These armaments have reached other conflict zonesthrough third countries  supporting terrorists  criminalgroups and secessionist movements.We should like to state once again that a completeand unconditional withdrawal of troops  munitions andarmaments  as stipulated in the Istanbul OSCE Summitdocuments  would undoubtedly facilitate the peacefuland lasting settlement of this conflict.In this connection  I would like to emphasize thatmy Government encourages the recent efforts of theRussian Federation to cut back on its weaponsdeployed in the Transdniestrian region of the Republicof Moldova  in accordance with the Treaty onConventional Armed Forces in Europe. Given theconsiderable progress that has been already made  wecertainly hope that the process of destruction andremoval of the weaponry will be completed before theBucharest OSCE ministerial meeting this December. Iwould like also to express our gratitude to thoseMembers of the United Nations that have contributedfinancially to the OSCE voluntary fund established inaccordance with the Istanbul decisions.The role of the United Nations in internationalpeace and security remains an essential part of itsglobal responsibilities. The Republic of Moldovareiterates its conviction that the best strategy formaintaining international peace and security is toeliminate the root causes of conflicts. In this regard  wefully support the Secretary-General’s efforts to moveinto a culture of conflict prevention.The submission of periodic regional reports to theSecurity Council on disputes of various types that maypotentially threaten international peace and security isanother important and necessary measure. The unequalattention given by the international system to differentconflicts is still a matter of great concern. In order tobe successful  preventive strategies must reach allregions in crisis.The credibility of the United Nations is calledinto question whenever decisions mandating action in aparticular crisis are not matched by timely deploymentof peacekeeping forces. Experience in recent years has12shown that the United Nations capacity to meet anexpanding and increasingly complex range ofpeacekeeping demands needs significant improvement.We are pleased to note that action has been taken toimplement a number of practical measures proposed bythe Secretary-General in his second report on theimplementation of the recommendations of the Brahimireport on peace operations.Moldova has already established the legislationand institutional framework for its future participationin the peacekeeping operations. I should also like toexpress the readiness of the Republic of Moldova toparticipate in the stand-by system  for which theinstitutional and technical preparations are currently intheir concluding stage.As we seek to enhance the United Nationscapacity in conflict prevention and peacekeeping  wemust also strengthen international cooperation for thepromotion of sustainable development and theelimination of poverty worldwide. Development andpoverty elimination are issues of tremendousimportance to many Member States  including my own.Our economic development has been gravely affectedby the illegal actions of separatists  as well by thenegative consequences of globalization. These issueshave been considered very important by our leaders atthe Millennium Summit.Since the beginning of this year the worldeconomy has experienced a certain slowdown. In theaftermath of the incidents of 11 September  thistendency has been exacerbated. The MillenniumDeclaration recognized that the problems of bothdeveloping countries and countries with economies intransition have become even more acute  even tragic inrecent months  as a result of globalization. We hopethat developed countries will increase their support forus in dealing with our problems by granting greaterassistance for development. Debt cancellation wouldplay a significant role in allowing us to free upfinancial resources and redirect them towardsstimulating our economies.In meeting the challenges of globalization  theUnited Nations plays an indispensable role ininternational cooperation. We welcome its greaterparticipation in development issues and in facing thetasks set out in the Millennium Declaration. Thesegoals cannot be reached without significant financialsupport. The International Conference on Financing forDevelopment and the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment to be held next year offer a uniqueopportunity to find the resources required to meet thosegoals. We hope that the outcome of these twosignificant international events will be successful inthis regard.The Republic of Moldova remains open to allforms of cooperation and is willing to contribute  asmuch as possible  to reaching the common goals ofsustainable development and economic stability. Weconsider that a comprehensive approach  based on theexperience of other States and on the specific culturalcharacter of a given country or region  will help usidentify and apply the best strategy for sustainabledevelopment.In order for the United Nations to remain relevantand credible  it must maintain a strong commitment tothe continuing programme of reform and renewal. Thereforms that have been undertaken and implemented inrecent years have already done much to strengthen andrevitalize the Organization. However  much remains tobe done and  in particular  we need to intensify ourefforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of theSecurity Council. The Republic of Moldova believesthat this reform should be guided by principles ofequitable geographic representation  democracy effectiveness  efficiency and transparency. It is on thisbasis that we will be able to modernize the SecurityCouncil and bring it into line with the substantialincrease in the general membership of the UnitedNations.In this context I would like once again to reiteratethe position of my country with respect to theenlargement of the Security Council in both permanentand non-permanent categories: the Eastern EuropeanGroup should be given one additional non-permanentmembership seat.Our country welcomes the process ofrevitalization and improvement of the GeneralAssembly and  at the same time  supports efforts torestore the central role of the Assembly as a mainrepresentative body for debate at the United Nations.This year the Republic of Moldova is celebratingthe tenth anniversary of its independence. During these10 years as a Member State of the United Nations  wehave fully shared the common values of theOrganization. We have achieved many significantresults in our internal development; much remains to13be done  however. We have nonetheless laid down thefoundations of a democratic society. This was not aneasy task  but we have made progress. The mostimportant achievement has been that we have laiddown the foundations of a democratic society  withbasic human rights and the rights of national minoritiesbeing respected. The main achievement has been theconsolidation of the Republic of Moldova as a peace-loving independent European country.The dramatic change of the situation in theinternational arena in the aftermath of the tragic eventsof 11 September calls for a new vision and aredefinition of the specific mechanisms for realizingthe fundamental objectives of the Organization  whichspring essentially from the founding philosophy of theCharter of the United Nations. In this respect  theOrganization should draw conclusions from its ownpast and  relying on permanent support from itsMember States  accomplish new tasks in the light ofthe imperatives of the time. I join in expressing thehope that the proceedings of the General Assembly —which are absolutely necessary for the internationalcommunity in the twenty-first century — will alsomake it possible to ensure that this process moves in apositive direction."
"108",4451,"MDG",56,2001,"﻿It is with strong feelings that we returntoday to New York to find it still darkened bymourning yet ever brightened by the aura of freedom.New York is the capital of international diplomacy  acrossroads of cultures and civilizations  a cosmopolitancity in which nations co-exist. New York is a citywhose heart will forever hold the memory of thevictims of the human folly of 11 September 2001.To the people and Government of the UnitedStates  under the enlightened leadership of PresidentGeorge Bush  we reiterate our deepest condolences. Wealso thank them warmly for their welcome and for thefacilities placed at our disposal.On behalf of the delegation of Madagascar  fromthis United Nations rostrum I convey to Mr. HanSeung-soo our sincerest congratulations on his electionto the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. Tohis predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri  we pay well-deserved tribute for the success of the MillenniumAssembly.To Mr. Kofi Annan  Secretary-General of ourOrganization  we express our pride at the importantdistinction he has recently been awarded. The NobelPeace Prize that he has received is both a recognitionof his unassailable competence and dedication as wellas a reflection of the value of the United Nations andthe trust placed in it by the entire world.Our Organization is being confronted with newconcerns every day. It is called on to keep up with thepace of international change in order to better fulfil itsmission as a regulator of inter-State relations  afacilitator of negotiations and a catalyst ofdevelopment. The United Nations remains the supremedecision-making body and the main guarantor of worldpeace and security.Madagascar supports profound reform and astreamlining of the Organization’s institutionalstructure in order to improve its performance.Madagascar remains convinced and confident however  that our Organization is still a privilegedplatform for the exchange and harmonization of views.Creating together a climate of world peace andharmony; struggling in unity against poverty  the AIDSpandemic  transnational crime and environmentaldegradation; building in concert a better future for thecoming generation  our children  who are tomorrow’sdecision-makers — these were the expectations voicedat the Millennium Summit in this very Hall. It was anambitious millennium  given the prospects andprogrammes of action projected up to the year 2015 and one of multiple challenges  given that objectivesremain to be achieved and that we have a long roadahead of us. Above all  it was a millennium for takingstock and moving forward  since the situation of humanand economic development calls on us to rise to itsexpectations and to overcome its hurdles.A world of well-being is what our children needtoday and tomorrow above all. The devotion of mycountry and my people to all questions relating tochildren is seen in our genuine commitment tointernational conventions. On 16 July 2001 Madagascar ratified International Labour OrganizationConvention No. 182 on the Prohibition and ImmediateAction for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of ChildLabour. The Hague Convention on the IntercountryAdoption of Children is currently being considered byour Parliament. The implementation of the law of 1999on paedophilia complements the Optional Protocol thatwe signed in September 2000 regarding the sale ofchildren  child prostitution and child pornography.We welcome enthusiastically the decision to holdin May 2002 the Summit on the future of children. Inview of our intention to participate in that event  anational parliament of children has just beenestablished this year.The family must remain the basic core of society the foundation of the nation  a source of human dignity30and the guarantor of stable social development.Consequently  the family must be protected  as must bethe values associated with it.Madagascar  an island in the Indian Ocean  thusfar little affected by the AIDS pandemic  is nonethelessnot indifferent to this scourge. A strategy and aprogramme to prevent and combat AIDS  within anestablished institutional framework  are being pursuedby all State and non-State institutions in the country.Having participated actively in the United Nationsspecial session on AIDS in June 2001  Madagascarfully supports the resolutions adopted at that meeting.Since Africa has a wealth of medicinal plants  anyresearch in this connection will benefit from consistentsupport.Africa pledges resolutely  and with the fullawareness of its responsibilities  to take its own destinyin hand. Positive development indicators are imminent and are appreciated. Continental integration isunderway within an effective African Union. Regionalmechanisms for African conflict management andprevention are already operational. The New AfricanInitiative  including long-term developmentprogrammes for our continent  has benefited from thesupport of the international community.Nonetheless  in the context of globalization  theeconomic and commercial rules of the game are notalways in the developing countries’ favour. We deplorethe widening gap between the economies of thecountries of the South and those of the countries of theNorth. The World Trade Organization  which ismeeting right now in Qatar  should further encouragethe advanced countries to give greater tradepreferences to the developing countries. Given thenegative impact of a possible complete liberalization oftrade  the economy of the least developed countriesmust be taken into consideration by the internationalcommunity  because any new multilateral contractengenders binding obligations.Integration within regional markets will clearlymake it possible for our countries to adapt steadily tothe demands and constraints of the world market  whilepromoting intra-regional and South-South exchanges.We expect of regional cooperation a concrete transferof technology and know-how and a harmonization ofstandards.Madagascar’s economy has followed thedynamics of growth thanks to steadfast national effortsand an enterprising partnership. Madagascar joined thefree trade zone of the Common Market for Eastern andSouthern Africa (COMESA)  on 31 October 2001. Wehave benefited from the Initiative of the HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and from therescheduling or cancellation of our debts by a numberof our creditors. We are signatories of the CotonouAgreement of July 2001  and are beneficiaries of theAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). All ofthis bears witness to the confidence that theinternational community has in our country.However  out of solidarity with all low-incomecountries  we believe that there is an urgent need toreview international policy regarding officialdevelopment assistance. We welcome the holding inBrussels last May of the United Nations Conference onthe Least Developed Countries. The time has come forconcrete action  so that the objective of reducingpoverty by half by the 2015 can become a reality.Madagascar has always been attentive to andconcerned by situations of international conflict  andmore particularly those that affect the Africancontinent and the Indian Ocean area. In the frameworkof the Organization of African Unity and of theInternational Organization of la Francophonie  we havesupported the Camoros in their process of nationalreconciliation and their return to constitutionalnormalcy. We welcome the draft constitution preparedby the Tripartite Commission  which included differenttrends and factions of the three reunited islands  andthe decision to hold the referendum next December.It goes without saying that the Israeli-Palestinianconflict claims our full attention. We believe it isimperative that a special session be convened on thisquestion by the United Nations and also that aninternational force be deployed to protect the innocentvictims. We support the Palestinian people in itsstruggle for independence and sovereignty. We alsowelcome the continuation of peace negotiationsbetween the Government of Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization. The principle of land forpeace must be respected. This must be done in keepingwith the relevant resolutions of the General Assemblyand the Security Council.Afghanistan  a den of extreme poverty and hotbedof tension  has recently become a site of war. While thefight against terrorism is legitimate and is theresponsibility of all States Member of our31Organization  support for refugees and the civilianvictims of war is a duty that shouts out at all of us.Humanitarian intervention is therefore imperative.Madagascar reiterates its commitment todisarmament efforts  an essential element of the UnitedNations strategy for peace and security  according tothe Secretary-General’s most recent report (A/56/1).My delegation welcomes the holding in July 2001 ofthe United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade inSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Ofcourse  we support the first global Programme ofAction that was adopted. My country reaffirms theurgent need to implement the conventions of the UnitedNations that condemn the production  proliferation andillicit sale of weapons. Madagascar is a party to severalmultilateral treaties regarding disarmament. The Treatyof Pelindaba  which makes Africa a nuclear-weapons-free zone  has just been ratified by our Parliament.Our reunion here in this Hall  in this large UnitedNations family  reminds us that we are survivors  andthat it is only a matter of time before the terroristsword of Damocles dangerously suspended over ourheads  may again perpetrate its odious carnage. Thefact that we have been spared compels us to mobilizeand to coordinate a united and merciless struggleagainst terrorism.Madagascar  my country and its people  comingfrom a mixture of many cultural  religious and ethnicbackgrounds  reiterates its condemnation of theterrorist barbarity that struck a sister nation  withvictims of all nationalities having perished in theattacks of 11 September 2001.Terrorism is the very negation of everything thatwe  as leaders of our different nations and institutionsgathered here  do to make of this world a universe oflaw  humanity and lasting peace.Madagascar has already begun the process ofratifying the 12 conventions against terrorism  and lastOctober signed the International Convention for theSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Likewise we will immediately proceed to sign the Protocolagainst the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking inFirearms. We support the draft comprehensiveconvention against terrorism  submitted by India which is based on existing conventions  with theemphasis placed on concrete measures that membercountries would be able to apply.International cooperation in police and judicialinvestigations must be consolidated  taking intoaccount exchanges of information on major traffickingactivity. This would require harmonization oflegislation and the establishment of multilateraloperational structures for the prevention andsuppression of transnational crimes.The threat of bioterrorism has in recent timescreated a psychosis of collective fear that has spreadthroughout the world. This means that the internationalcommunity must design and urgently put in placeeffective protective measures against this danger. TheConvention on Biological and Toxin Weapons is nowbefore the Parliament of Madagascar for ratification. Itis now imperative that we think deeply and on anongoing basis about the subject of terrorism.Combating terrorism also means identifying andunderstanding the causes of this scourge anderadicating the evil at its very roots. In order to halt itsramifications we must remove all sources of support which involves destroying the many laboratories andbases for logistical backup and cutting off financing weapons acquisition  fund-raising and proselytizing.On the basis of that conviction  we are pleasedthat our Organization has adopted the Programme ofAction for dialogue among civilizations.In accordance with the United Nations resolutionmaking 2001 the International Year of Dialogue amongCivilizations  last October Madagascar organized aworkshop in which all those involved in our country’sdevelopment participated. From the discussionsemerged the notion that traditional cultures could serveas a point of reference for modern nations to design acode of peaceful behaviour. The prevention of terroristacts could also be complemented by educational andtraining programmes and information programmes onthe culture of peace.We have proposed the establishment at thenational level of a non-aggression pact among thecountry’s religious institutions in order to head off anydangers of religious war or other conflicts. Thisinitiative deserves to be expanded to a wider scale inorder to ensure a climate of confidence and calm. Wemust have the courage to denounce the excesses offanaticism and religious extremism  which endangerour common values.The time has now come for dialogue. It is not toolate to become aware of the value of dialogue. Having32a dialogue does not mean tolerating misdeeds  nor doesit mean any complicity with criminals  who must bepunished. Above all  having a dialogue means goingbeyond terrorism through a new understanding of theconcept of enemy. It is now time to hear each other with mutual respect and in a climate of understandingthat takes the other into account. It is now time forshared responsibilities and continued harmonization ofviews for the establishment of a world of trust."
"109",4490,"MDV",56,2001,"﻿It gives me greatpleasure  on behalf of my country  to congratulateMr. Han Seung-soo on his election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly. His election to that high office29demonstrates the international community's respect forand confidence in his ability to guide the work of thissession successfully. It also demonstrates the trust andhigh regard that the international community has forthe Republic of Korea and for the important role thatcountry is playing in the international arena to fosterpeace and security in the world. I would also like totake this opportunity to pay tribute to his predecessor His Excellency Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland  for theexemplary manner in which he guided the work of thefifty-fifth session.Allow me also to congratulate the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  on hisreappointment to head the Organization for a secondterm. His dynamic leadership has earned the UnitedNations the confidence of the international communityand has raised fresh hopes about the Organization'sability to facilitate a world atmosphere more conduciveto peace  justice and human dignity as we enter thetwenty-first century. The award of the Nobel PeacePrize to the Secretary-General and to the UnitedNations is testimony to that confidence.Nearly 13 years ago  the Maldives woke up to thehorrors of terrorism when a band of foreign terroristsattacked Male  our capital island  without the slightestwarning or provocation  killing many innocent peopleand destroying property. By their faceless act ofviolence  they changed the peaceful life we had had inour country for centuries into one full of fear andapprehension.On 11 September this year  the most powerfulcountry  the United States of America  itself became atarget and the victim of a horrendous act of terrorism.The world community was shocked and promptlycondemned the barbaric attacks on the World TradeCenter and the Pentagon  and the murder of thousandsof innocent people. Consistent with its stand againstterrorism  the Maldives found itself among the firstStates to condemn those attacks in the strongestpossible terms.The tragedy of 11 September has reminded usthat terrorism is one of the biggest challenges facingthe world community today. It has emerged as anenemy of nations  be they large or small  and as avicious threat to humanity. In combating such a cruelenemy  it is important that international action againstterrorism be supported and that it be complemented bymeasures at the regional and national levels.At the international level  the legal doctrineagainst all aspects of terrorism must be strengthenedand universalized. Concomitantly  action at theregional and national levels must be brought into linewith international obligations in fighting this globalmenace. The United Nations  as the global organizationresponsible for international peace and security  mustplay the pivotal role in this fight against terrorism. Mycountry fully supports the early convening of a high-level conference  under the auspices of the UnitedNations  to formulate a clear definition of terrorism andto draw up a joint  far-sighted reaction to the ever-growing phenomena of terrorism in its various formsand manifestations. We are also looking forward to theearly conclusion of a comprehensive convention oninternational terrorism and of an internationalconvention for the prevention of acts of terrorism usingnuclear  biological or chemical material or agents.As a people who have devoted themselves to thepractice of Islamic faith and values for nearly amillennium  we are deeply offended by the notion thatterrorism is linked to Islam or to Muslims. On thecontrary  Islam advocates peace  compassion  toleranceand peaceful coexistence. The projection and portrayalof Islam as an enemy of civilization or of the freeworld is an insult to its noble principles. It is aperverted view and a falsification of Islam and itsprinciples. Such perversions are nothing butpropaganda hatched by evil people who wish to breedhatred among human beings; their claims are no lessharmful than terrorism itself.At the Millennium Summit last year  our leaderscharted a course for a better world  a world in whichthe whole of humanity can prosper in mutual respectand dignity. Navigating smoothly along that course willbe a difficult task. We have to be ready to boldlyaddress the challenges in our way.Over the past year  we met in several specialsessions to address some specific important issues. Oneach and every such occasion  we demonstrated ourfirm resolve to uphold the objectives set forth in theMillennium Declaration. The major cross-cuttingtheme that runs deep in all these issues is thedehumanizing scourge of poverty. Poverty remains themajor stumbling block for sustainable social andeconomic development in the developing world.Eradicating poverty  therefore  is core to the attainmentof peace and development. Let us therefore make theelimination of poverty our top priority and pursue30vigorously the target set by our leaders during theMillennium Summit: to halve poverty by 2015.The commitments we have undertaken at suchconferences involve high price tags. Unless new andadditional financial resources are made available in atimely and predictable manner  no action plans orprogrammes can be implemented. It is therefore acollective responsibility of the entire internationalcommunity  including the private-sector stakeholdersand civil society  to muster the necessary political willthat is so vital in this regard. We are eagerly lookingforward to the International Conference on Financingfor Development to be held in Mexico early next year.We hope that that event will provide the internationalcommunity with an opportunity to agree on new innovative and additional sources and strategies tomobilize funds for development.Globalization is now a reality. Many in thedeveloped world are enjoying the unprecedented yieldof globalization  while its powerful forces aredepressing the fragile economies of many developingand least developed countries  including structurallyweak countries. The uneven playing field has indeedcontributed to widening the gap between the rich andthe poor. In fact  the obstacles to the development ofthe least developed countries have grown in numberand magnitude over the years and have marginalizedthose countries in the world economy. My country  theMaldives  is heartened by the goodwill and solidarityextended by the international community to the leastdeveloped countries during the Third United NationsConference on the Least Developed Countries held inBrussels early this year. It is now time for delivery onthe commitments made at the Brussels Conference.Unless those commitments are fulfilled  the plight ofthe least developed countries will continue to worsen.The special circumstances and needs of the smallisland developing States (SIDS) have been recognizedand acknowledged by this Assembly on numerousoccasions. The Barbados Programme of Action veryclearly spells out these special needs of SIDS.Although many SIDS may appear to be relatively moreprosperous on the basis of per capita income level  it isalso a documented fact that  due to the specialcharacteristics of small islands  they are generallyamong the most economically vulnerable andhandicapped countries in the world today.As a country with little more than a quarter of amillion inhabitants spread over more than 200 islands bereft of natural resources and with a fragile economybased on fisheries and tourism  which are sensitive tothe harsh realities of ecology and the environment  theMaldives provides a perfect example of this dilemmaof the small island developing States.The stable political environment that theMaldives has enjoyed for the past two decades combined with the continued flow of assistance fromour development partners  have indeed given us theopportunity to improve the quality of life of ourpeople. Our efforts towards development haveremained relentless  as the structural constraints weface are both persistent and formidable.Given these realities  my country is convincedthat the present criteria for identifying least developedcountries need to be refined to reflect the impedimentsin full. We appeal to the Committee for DevelopmentPolicy and the international community to considerthese realities on the ground and to look beyondabstract indicators into the inherent vulnerabilities ofsmall island developing States in determining thecriteria for graduation.We do not wish to remain indefinitely in thecategory of least developed countries. However  shouldgraduation be thrust upon us prematurely  its negativeconsequences could easily overwhelm us and result inserious erosion of our achievements. We need tostrengthen the capacity of our human resources andinstitutions to cope with existing and emergingchallenges to our development efforts. We need to findways and means to diversify our economic base andstrengthen its sustainability.We welcome the recent resolution adopted by theEconomic and Social Council to extend our transitionperiod until the next triennial review of the list of leastdeveloped countries in 2003. At the same time  wewish to reiterate our belief that ensuring a smoothtransition for graduating countries  in accordance withGeneral Assembly resolution 46/206  is an essentialobligation of the entire international community.Indeed  a decision that affects the future destiny of anation should not be based on hastily compiledinformation that may contain erroneous assumptionsand dubious facts that could mislead the competentauthorities  leading them to reach questionableconclusions.31The state of the global environment remains amajor concern of the international community. Adecade after the adoption of Agenda 21  its effectiveimplementation has proven to be a difficult task. Thepleas of small island developing States for new andadditional resources to implement the BarbadosProgramme of Action remain to be heeded. The KyotoProtocol is yet to come into force. Meanwhile scientific predictions on the future of the globalenvironment remain alarming. Unless swift andconcrete action is forthcoming  global environmentaldegradation will continue to threaten the survival ofhumankind and our planet. The consequences of a mereone-metre rise in the mean sea level on small islanddeveloping States  such as the Maldives  is now a well-documented fact. We  therefore  urge the internationalcommunity to accelerate its efforts to agree on a legallybinding greenhouse gas emissions reduction regimeand to facilitate the Kyoto Protocol's early entry intoforce. In this connection  we are encouraged by thepositive developments achieved in Marrakech lastweek and hope that these developments will facilitatean early entry into force of the Protocol.A year from now  we will gather in Johannesburg South Africa  for the Rio + 10 Summit to take stock ofour labour over the past decade to protect and preservethe global environment. My country believes that thiswould be an excellent opportunity for the internationalcommunity to reinvigorate its efforts and rededicate itscommitments to protect and preserve the globalenvironment.The Maldives attaches great importance to theefforts of the international community to fostersustainable social development. The five-year reviewof the Copenhagen commitments and Beijing Platformfor Action  carried out last year  and the recentlyconcluded review of the implementation of theoutcome of the Second United Nations Conference onHuman Settlements (Habitat Agenda)  as well as theWorld Conference against Racism and RacialDiscrimination  Xenophobia and Related Intolerancehave added renewed impetus to the efforts of theinternational community to achieve social harmony.The HIV/AIDS pandemic has become a majorimpediment to social development. The Maldives  too has not been immune to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.Although the number of cases may be relatively low inour country  we are fully aware of the potential threatthat looms over us. We pledge our full support to theProgramme of Action adopted by the special session ofthe General Assembly on HIV/AIDS early this year and we call on the international community  includingthe private sector stakeholders  to commit the financialresources required to implement the Programme ofAction.My country wholeheartedly supports the juststruggle of the Palestinian people. My countrycommends the efforts of the co-sponsors of the MiddleEast peace process to help put the talks back on track.We strongly believe that the Mitchell report should beimplemented urgently to pave the way for restarting thestalled peace process.Disarmament and arms control measures continueto remain a high priority on the international agenda.While we were encouraged by the positive outcome ofthe NPT Review Conference last year  we would like toreiterate the need for continuing efforts to strengthenand enforce the nuclear non-proliferation regime.Similarly  we look forward to the day when theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) willcome into force.In conclusion  allow me to reaffirm the firmcommitment of the Maldives to the principles andobjectives enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Wewill work with the other members of the internationalcommunity to uphold and promote these loftyobjectives. We remain convinced that the UnitedNations is the only organization that is capable ofcreating a more peaceful and prosperous world forhumanity."
"110",4537,"MEX",56,2001,"﻿Allow me tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election as President ofthe General Assembly. I should also like to extend mycongratulations to all the other members of the Bureau.I am sure that your prestige and acknowledgeddiplomatic skills will contribute to the successful workof the General Assembly at this session.I should also like to extend sincerecongratulations to this Organization and to theSecretary-General  Kofi Annan. Mexico welcomes thefact that they were awarded this year’s Nobel PeacePrize. That is a well-deserved recognition of thededication and clarity of vision that have marked thework of the Secretary-General. It fills us with hoperegarding the efforts that this Organization will have tomake in order to meet the international challenges ofthe twenty-first century.I am addressing the General Assembly on behalfof the women and men of my country  Mexico — acountry that is in the process of a profoundtransformation  determined to strengthen democracyand development  as well as to take on greaterresponsibilities in shaping the new international systemwith a view to fostering the prosperity  peace andsecurity that every inhabitant of the world deserves.Mexican society is firmly committed to makingMexico a country that contributes positively to theworthiest objectives of human well-being. Aware thatthere is a diversity of views on ways to achieve thisend  Mexico favours dialogue and agreement asbenchmarks to guide our endeavours. For Mexico theUnited Nations is the best example of a global forumwhere the voices of all men and women can merge intoa veritable concert of nations.This is a Mexico that today renews its fullcommitment to the United Nations — which not onlydemands full respect for the purposes and principles ofthe Charter of the United Nations and international law but that is also committed to the development of new universally observed rules and standards for theregulation of international relations.This is a Mexico that acts firmly in the defenceand protection of human rights and of democracy  at alltimes and in all places  beginning  of course  within ourown territory  promoting full respect for fundamentalfreedoms on the basis of tolerance  plurality and equity.That is why my Government has initiated formal talkswith the various political parties in Mexico in order tocreate favourable conditions for the promotion of aconstitutional reform that will allow Mexico to ratifythe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court which our country signed last year.My Government has also started a necessaryupdating of Mexico’s international obligations in thefield of human rights and international humanitarianlaw. I have submitted for consideration by the MexicanSenate the ratification  accession or acceptance of 11other legal instruments in areas such as the forcibledisappearance of persons  the rights of the child  theelimination of discrimination against women and theprotection of victims of international armed conflicts.This new commitment on the part of Mexico tothe defence of human rights was also reflected in therecent release  for humanitarian reasons  of RodolfoMontiel and Teodoro Cabrera  two environmentalactivists in Mexico. This effort in the field of humanrights was also reflected in the broad disclosure ofState security agencies files  which will contribute toincreasing transparency regarding both present and pastevents  thus making it a central element of myadministration. Mexico is taking concrete steps todemonstrate that its commitment to the norms of theinternational community is profound  sincere andresolute.17The establishment of the United Nations morethan 50 years ago was the triumph of hope and freedomover the suffering inflicted by the two world wars onhumanity  Today  however  threats to peace andsecurity do not emerge only from acts of aggressionamong States. The new threats also arise from internalconflicts that have cross-border effects  such as themassive movement of displaced peoples  humanitariantragedies  grave violations of human rights andfundamental freedoms  and the exacerbation ofnationalism and religious fanaticism. These threats alsoderive from worldwide phenomena such astransnational organized crime  environmentaldegradation  AIDS  and  of course  terrorism in all itsforms and manifestations.There is no doubt that the magnitude and thecruelty of the 11 September attacks have underscoredthe vulnerability of States and the fragility of worldpeace. It is a matter of concern to us that terroristgroups can gain access to weapons of mass destructionand that they also benefit from the traffic in arms organized crime  money laundering and drugtrafficking.International terrorism not only floutsinternational law  but it also endangers the stability ofthe community of nations and economic developmentprocesses  increasing unemployment and preventingheadway from being made in the alleviation of poverty.For this reason  Mexico categorically rejects anyargument that seeks to justify terrorist activities.Nothing — not the justness of a cause  the inequality offorces with respect to an antagonist  poverty  or anyother grounds — can justify resorting to violence forpolitical ends.Mexico reiterates its commitment to the fightagainst terrorism and its decision to fully implementresolution 1373 (2001) of the Security Council  whichestablishes a series of measures for fightinginternational terrorism and cutting its ties to practicessuch as money laundering and organized crime.We are firmly committed to the fight against newthreats to international peace and security. We believethat the international community should meet thesechallenges on the basis of three principles: first  thesupremacy of the United Nations; secondly  thestrengthening of international cooperation in resolvingglobal problems; and thirdly  the shaping of aninternational order based on universally observed rulesand standards that meet the needs and aspirations of thecommunity of nations.The Government of Mexico is determined toassist in this effort. For that reason  Mexico feelsdeeply honoured to have been elected  after a 20-yearabsence  as a non-permanent member of the SecurityCouncil for 2002-2003. It wishes to express its deepcommitment in this respect. We thank the internationalcommunity for its support and express ourdetermination to work actively and responsibly infavour of the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. Our intention is that Mexico’s participation inthe Security Council will amplify the voices ofcountries that are not usually heard on the internationalscene.In the search for lasting solutions to the newthreats now facing the international system  we mustnot fail to address situations that have contributed totheir emergence  such as the lack of economicdevelopment in many nations  the deepening of povertyand exclusion. The challenges of development not onlyremain with us  but have gradually increased with thegrowing economic and social inequalities.Mexico therefore calls on the internationalcommunity to give priority to the fight against povertyand social exclusion. My country reaffirms its interestin taking a lead in promoting the Agenda forDevelopment  providing it with renewed impetus and amore effective approach  so that the United Nationsand the multilateral institutions can fulfil thecommitments contained in the Millennium Declaration.It is because of the importance we attach to thisissue that Mexico offered to host the InternationalConference on Financing for Development  to be heldnext year in Monterrey. I invite all heads of State orGovernment to contribute  through their activeparticipation in the Conference  to strengthening theinternational community’s efforts to promote worlddevelopment that is more just and more equitable  thuscreatively helping to improve the institutionsresponsible for development financing.We face the complex task of integrating oursocieties  without exclusion  in the process of the jointcreation and equitable distribution of the opportunitiesand benefits of globalization. We must ensure that allcitizens become stakeholders in that process; to do that we need an enabling international environment including sufficient levels of public and private18funding  along with the consolidation of an inclusiveinternational economic system that is conducive tomore equitable human development.It will be impossible to make the world more justif we permit the exclusion of the most vulnerablegroups. That is why my Government has just proposedthe establishment of a special committee to draft abroad  comprehensive international convention topromote and protect the rights and dignity of disabledpersons. The convention’s ultimate goal should be toput in place a binding universal legal instrument for thebenefit of the disabled  guaranteeing the fundamentalrights of millions of men  women and childrenworldwide. Mexico hopes that this importantendeavour will enjoy the support of the States Membersof the United Nations.The history of relations among nations reflectssuccesses  but also sadly missed opportunities. Today our efforts to combat terrorism and to promotedevelopment — the two focuses of my statementtoday — may be the start of a new history of successesfor the United Nations.The brutal events of 11 September make itimperative that we  the international community engage in multilateral negotiations to formulate newrules and standards to guarantee international peaceand security. There is no doubt that the way in whichour nations face the challenge of terrorism will have animpact on the principles and priorities of internationalrelations in coming years.As a country that is a bridge between regions andcultures  Mexico is determined to play an active andleading role in shaping an international system that canmeet the challenges facing us today.This is a defining moment. Our fundamentalvalues and the vitality and viability of the UnitedNations are being put to the test. The community ofnations must show that it can meet this extraordinarychallenge. This can be a new founding stage in thehistory of the Organization  which will yield themandates and competences that are indispensable in aworld that is starkly different from that of 1945 butwhose aspirations to peace  respect for human dignity justice and freedom still remain those of the SanFrancisco Charter."
"111",4562,"MHL",56,2001,"﻿On behalf of theGovernment and the people of the Republic of theMarshall Islands allow me to offer cordialcongratulations to the President on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixthsession  and to offer the Marshall Islands unreservedcooperation in our deliberations at this session.I must also express my sincere gratitude to hispredecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri  whose outstandingleadership was instrumental in making the fifty-fifthsession  coined the Millennium Assembly  highlysuccessful.The Republic of the Marshall Islands also paystribute to Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-election to a secondterm as Secretary-General  as well as on winning theprestigious Nobel Peace Prize  which is a very well-deserved and timely recognition of the Organizationand of the Secretary-General’s wisdom and dedicationto the service of mankind.It is with a heavy heart and deep sorrow that theGovernment of President Kessai Note and the people ofthe Republic of the Marshall Islands reiterate to theGovernment and people of the United States ofAmerica their deepest sympathy and condolences forthe suffering and pain caused by the terrorist attacks of11 September. Similarly  we wish to convey ourheartfelt sympathy and condolences to the other greatnations that were directly affected by that tragic andinhuman act. They were not alone in their daily trialsand tribulations; the Republic of the Marshall Islandswas with them. Furthermore  we extend our solidarityand condolences to the Government and people of theDominican Republic  who suffered losses in the recentcrash of American Airlines flight 587.The Republic of the Marshall Islands condemnsall acts of terrorism. I am pleased to inform theAssembly of the ratification by the Government of theMarshall Islands of six conventions and treaties relatedto terrorism. They are the Convention on the PhysicalProtection of Nuclear Material  the Convention on thePrevention and Punishment of Crimes againstInternationally Protected Persons  including DiplomaticAgents  the International Convention for theSuppression of Terrorist Bombings  the Convention forthe Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism  theConvention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives forthe Purpose of Detection  and the InternationalConvention against the Taking of Hostages.The marked worldwide increase in behavioursabhorrent to human dignity  freedom and basic rights ofinnocent people encouraged the early ratification of theRome Statute by the Marshall Islands  which calls forthe establishment of an International Criminal Court.The Republic of the Marshall Islands welcomes anearly establishment of the Court and theimplementation of its mandate.The Republic of the Marshall Islands remainsfully committed to the principles enshrined in the31human rights bill. The Government is currently in theprocess of ratifying the following conventions: theConvention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhumanor Degrading Treatment or Punishment; theInternational Convention on the Elimination of AllForms of Racial Discrimination; the United NationsInternational Covenant on Economic  Social andCultural Rights; and the International Covenant onCivil and Political Rights. We are committed to accedeto them in a timely manner.Given the unique conditions under which we seekour livelihood  our Government has been readilysupportive of new scientific breakthroughs andinnovations for the betterment of the world. However we feel there are certain scientific initiatives that runcounter to human decency. In this regard  we fullyassociate ourselves with the call by the Governments ofGermany and of France for a universal conventionbanning human cloning for reproductive purposes. Webelieve that such a scientific endeavour would directlyviolate the Universal Declaration on the HumanGenome and Human Rights  drawn up by the UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization and endorsed by the General Assembly inresolution 53/152. Article 11 of that Declarationspecifies that“Practices which are contrary to human dignity such as reproductive cloning of human beings shall not be permitted.”As in the past  the Republic of the MarshallIslands will continue to voice in the strongest termspossible and in the best form at its disposal  itsconcerns and fears over issues relating to climatechange and rising sea levels. The Assembly is awarethat several Pacific island countries are represented inthis Organization. Like other small island countries  theRepublic of the Marshall Islands is plagued by a uniqueset of problems. Our coastal zones have become highlyvulnerable to erosion  our groundwater systems areaffected by high levels of saltwater intrusion  andincreasing salinity is having a direct impact on oursubsistence cropping. Such vulnerabilities  togetherwith prolonged drought  constitute a deadly peril forour health and survival.We welcome the successful outcome of the sixthsession of the Conference of the Parties to the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change which recently concluded in Marrakesh. The KyotoProtocol is the best available solution to address ourenvironmental concerns. We should be able to lookback in the coming days and commend ourselves forthe mission that is to be accomplished. We owe it toour children and to our children’s children.The Millennium Declaration  adopted by heads ofState or Government during the Millennium Assembly should serve as our guiding framework and road mapfor achieving sustainable development  eradicatingpoverty  combating HIV/AIDS  preventing illegaltrafficking in small arms and safeguarding theenvironment.Immediately following the Millennium Assembly President Kessai H. Note convened a broad-basedeconomic and social summit  the outcome of whichwas the development of a national planning vision — aguiding framework for a long-term nationaldevelopment programme. I commend Member Statesfor their generous support and assistance for thisinitiative.The Government of the Republic of the MarshallIslands is of the view that the United Nations mustmove forward proactively in its reform process. Wecommend the Secretary-General for his reformprogramme. However  much more needs to be done.We encourage the Fifth Committee and United Nationsfunds and programmes to support and cooperate in thereform process.The Government of the Republic of the MarshallIslands fully supports the expansion of the SecurityCouncil in both the permanent and non-permanentcategories  based on equity  to include developed anddeveloping countries so as to respond to the realitiesand challenges of our contemporary world. We notethat certain issues need to be agreed on. We shouldmove forward with broad-based agreement and revisitour differences.Now that this Organization has 189 MemberStates  14 of them being from the Pacific region  thereconfiguration of our electoral groupings should be anadditional matter to be placed on the table. It may be acomplex issue  but through our collective efforts andinspiration  the goal can be achieved  and it should beconsidered without further delay.The exclusion from this body and its relatedagencies of the Republic of China on Taiwan is amajor  serious hindrance to the Government of the32Republic of China on Taiwan in its pursuit of itsfundamental rights to participate in internationaldialogue and regional organizations and activities. Thetime has come once again to reconsider the exclusionof the Republic of China on Taiwan from thisprestigious body. There is so much that the Republic ofChina on Taiwan could do  in cooperation with theUnited Nations system  in the areas of sustainabledevelopment  technology  health  peace and prosperity.In conclusion  the Republic of the MarshallIslands pledges its commitment to the principlesenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.God bless the United Nations."
"112",4586,"MKD",56,2001,"﻿At the outset  allow me to convey ourdeepest condolences to the American people andGovernment for today's plane crash and to express ourdeepest sympathies to the families of the victims fortheir tragic loss. Our condolences also extend to thepeople and Government of the Dominican Republic whose nationals comprised most of those on board.Pleading for concerted action against terrorismand for urgent accession by States to all relevantinternational conventions  the Millennium Summitanticipated the need for more effective andcomprehensive joint efforts and cooperation. The tragicevents of 11 September united the world and reaffirmedthe resolve of all of us to fight the battle againstterrorism  gathered around our common values andinterests. That unprecedented terrorist attack took placeduring the United Nations Year of Dialogue amongCivilizations. The fatal message of terrorism is todestroy the very essence of dialogue as a globalresponse to conflict and violence.By adopting several resolutions  the UnitedNations demonstrated powerful solidarity and readinessto combat terrorism. Today that has been reaffirmed bySecurity Council resolution 1377 (2001)  whichadopted a declaration on the global effort to combatterrorism.By expressing its strong condemnation of theattacks and its solidarity with the American people andGovernment  my country  the Republic of Macedonia immediately joined the call to establish a globalinternational anti-terrorist coalition. We undertookconcrete measures as our contribution to the globalefforts and to cooperation to curb terrorist activities.As a response to terrorism and conscious of thefact that terrorism transcends borders  we alsoproposed the establishment of a regional anti-terroristpact  stemming from our terrible experience withterrorism over the last eight months. We called uponthe international community to cut off financial supportfor terrorist activities and  in that context  to strengthenthe fight against organized crime  aware of the stronglink between those evil phenomena. The resolution ofregional conflicts is yet another significant contributionwe can make to the fight against terrorism.With regard to relevant international instruments we believe that the existing United Nationsconventions provide a solid international legalframework for the implementation of many measuresintended to eradicate terrorism. While we stronglysupport the adoption of a comprehensive conventionagainst terrorism and a consensus on a global definitionof terrorism  their lack should not prevent us fromtaking action.Action is needed now  from all of us  allcountries  regions and international organizations.There is no alternative to international cooperation andpartnership  as there is no alternative to the commonfight against organized crime  which feeds terrorism.But there is one matter we have to keep in mind:different approaches towards acts of terrorismundermine our struggle. There is no big or smallterrorism  nor international or domestic  nor one that istolerated and one that is not. No one should be allowedto practice terror; the consequences are equallydevastating. We have to defend more vigorously thanever our shared values of democracy  human rights andthe rule of law. We must not allow ourselves to bemanipulated through the use of social  economic religious and political differences as justification forterrorism.For the past 10 years the Republic of Macedoniahas developed a democratic society  a factor of stabilityin the Balkans. Our model of inter-ethnic relations wasset out as an example and was applauded by the39international community. Then  eight months ago Macedonia was exposed to violent terrorist attacks thatthreatened to undermine all our achievements. Underthe cloak of struggling for minority and human rights the so-called National Liberation Army (NLA) ─whose structure  command and control and logistics areof Kosovo provenance ─ wanted to realize one aim: thedivision of Macedonia and changing the borders in theregion.Our response to those attacks was military political and diplomatic. The Framework Agreement of13 August of this year  which was signed by the leadersof the four main political parties  is a result of ourstrong commitment to finding a political solution to thecrisis as the best way to defend our country andundermine the goals of the terrorists. But let mereiterate that we will also defend our country by othermeans if necessary.The cost of terrorism for Macedonia was high:lost lives  destroyed homes and thousand of refugeesand internally displaced persons. The crisis also causedeconomic downfall and a large budget deficit. It hashad a negative impact on the country's developmentand has increased unemployment and poverty rates. Itherefore urge the international community  financialinstitutions and  in particular  the European Union toaddress our needs at the upcoming donors' conferenceand to consider the possibility of writing off ourforeign debts.At this point  allow me to underline that theinternational community gives strong political supportto the Republic of Macedonia. The European Union the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope (OSCE) and NATO are playing an importantrole in overcoming the crisis  for which we aregrateful.I would also like to commend the prompt reactionby the Security Council. The awareness that theproblems in Macedonia were largely inspired in andimported from neighbouring Kosovo resulted in theadoption of resolution 1345 (2001)  by which theCouncil  inter alia  strongly condemned extremistviolence  including terrorist activities  and supportedthe Macedonian Government in its efforts to end theviolence in a manner consistent with the rule of law.On 26 September the Council adopted resolution 1371(2001)  which supported the full implementation of theFramework Agreement and rejected the use of violencein pursuit of political goals. Even though the UnitedNations was not directly involved in the resolution ofthe crisis in Macedonia  it is present on the groundthrough its agencies  working in cooperation with theGovernment to alleviate the consequences. We aregrateful for their help  too.Despite the efforts of the Republic of Macedoniaand the international community  attempts are stillbeing made to block the work of the parliament and toobstruct the implementation of the FrameworkAgreement. The latest events in the Tetovo area  thedeath of three policemen and the kidnapping ofMacedonian civilians are proof that violence continues.We should all condemn these obstacles to peace andstability. Macedonia is determined to pursue the path ofpeace and will not allow these events to blur our visionand detract us from our main goals of building a strongdemocracy at home and becoming integrated into Euro-Atlantic structures.The recent history of crises has shown more thanever the importance of cooperation and solidarityamong the countries of our region  and we have actedaccordingly. The integration into the European Unionand NATO is a common goal of all the countries in theregion of South-Eastern Europe. We are all aware thatmembership is a solution to lasting stability andprosperity.We are determined to contribute to thestrengthening of international peace and security  toenhancing international cooperation in all areas and tostrengthening the role of the United Nations. This year the Republic of Macedonia submitted  and the FirstCommittee adopted without a vote  a draft resolutionon the maintenance of international security  good-neighbourliness  stability and development in South-Eastern Europe. That resolution was co-sponsored by46 Member States.The struggle against terrorism must not deter usfrom taking up other important parts of the UnitedNations agenda. At last year's Millennium Summit weidentified the direction of future United Nationsactivities to which we committed ourselves: theeradication of poverty  the struggle against AIDS conflict prevention and the protection of theenvironment. On this occasion  however  let me refer tothe matter of the rights and well-being of children  andin that context to reiterate the importance of theupcoming special session on children as a forum to40review the progress achieved and the further steps thatneed to be taken for the benefit of children all over theworld.Furthermore  globalization remains one of themost important issues on the international agenda. It isobvious that there are some essential problems thatneed to be addressed immediately. In the newmillennium  it is crucial for the internationalcommunity to address the development agenda in amore appropriate way. We believe that the UnitedNations has a major role to play in this process. Nextyear's International Conference on Financing forDevelopment and the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment are the most important events in thisrespect  and we should all contribute as best we can totheir successful outcome. Another important issue isthe launching of the new comprehensive tradenegotiations under World Trade Organizationpatronage  with special emphasis on the problems ofmarginalization  sustainable development andimplementation of all multilateral environmentalagreements.After 11 September  the world changed. We haveto adjust to the new realities. There are manychallenges ahead of us  and the United Nations has tobe better prepared to deal with them. That will requireeven greater commitment on our part. The strength andthe success of our Organization depend on the resolveof all its Members to respond to the new realities in amore efficient  relevant and adroit manner. We all haveour part to play in this respect. This is the bestcontribution we can make to building a better world forall of us.Last  but not least  allow me also to extend mysincere congratulations to the United Nations and to itsSecretary-General  Kofi Annan  on the Nobel PeacePrize award. This is yet another proof of the lastingrelevance of the principles and values of ourOrganization as enshrined in the United NationsCharter and of the outstanding leadership of itsSecretary-General."
"113",4632,"MLI",56,2001,"﻿At theoutset  I would like to express our condolences to theGovernments of the United States and the Dominican32Republic  and to the families of the victims of thismorning’s tragic plane crash.I express my warmest congratulations to Mr. HanSeung-soo on his election as President of the fifty-sixthsession of the General Assembly. I wish to assure himof my delegation’s complete support in the exercise ofhis difficult and lofty mission. I am convinced that with his experience and talents as a seasoned diplomat he will guide our discussions to success. To hispredecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri  I would like to expressmy sincerest and warmest congratulations on thecompetence  dedication  effectiveness and authoritythat he displayed throughout his term of office  whichwas so rich in important events for the life of ourOrganization.May I also take this opportunity to congratulateMr. Kofi Annan on his re-election to the post ofSecretary-General of our Organization  and I wouldlike once again to express to him Mali’s deepestappreciation for his steadfast efforts and hisdetermination in the quest for a better world in the faceof the many and complex challenges of the world oftoday. The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to theUnited Nations and to Mr. Annan reflects the workaccomplished by the Secretary-General over the pastfive years and is a source of legitimate pride to me asan African.Our fifty-sixth session is of particular importance being held as it is in the aftermath of the brutal terroristattacks that plunged the American nation intomourning on 11 September 2001. The Government ofMali has firmly condemned these heinous acts andexpressed its solidarity with the American people andits support for the fight against terrorism in all itsforms and manifestations. Mali has already taken themeasures necessary for the implementation of SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001)  inter alia  through theestablishment of an inter-ministerial committee incharge of implementing and coordinating internationalmeasures. We have also undertaken to ratify variousconventions against terrorism in order to complete thevital legal arsenal that we need to make a completecontribution to the collective international efforts underthe auspices of the United Nations  and also to regionalactions. In this respect  in addition to the Organizationof the Islamic Conference Convention on CombatingInternational Terrorism  we appeal for the entry intoforce of the important Organization of African UnityConvention on the Prevention and Combating ofTerrorism  adopted at Algiers in July 1999. We alsocall for an effective partnership with Africa tostrengthen its capacity to combat terrorism.The terrorist acts of 11 September  incompatiblewith the lofty and tolerant message of Islam  haveclearly shown the vulnerability of our currentinternational system and have emphasized the need forincreased international cooperation in order to dealwith this situation. This is why the tragic events of 11September 2001 call for the action now being takenagainst terrorism  but they also mean that we must inthe medium and long term reflect on the further waysof combating terrorism that we must devise. But aboveall  these events mean that we must endeavourvigorously to implement the Millennium Declarationprogramme of action in order to ensure prosperity forthe largest possible number of people.In this context  Mali advocates integrated sustained global action in which the United Nationsshould play the primary role. While reiterating Africa’sappeal for the holding of an international conference onterrorism  under the auspices of the United Nations Mali intends to support the initiatives of the Secretary-General and of his Special Representative  Mr. LakhdarBrahimi  whom we congratulate on his appointment.Deeply concerned by the humanitarian situation inAfghanistan  we call for increased and coordinatedemergency humanitarian assistance for the Afghanpeople.The maintenance of peace and security requiresstrict control of weapons. Mali will actively andresolutely continue to support international andregional efforts in the field of disarmament and thenon-proliferation of nuclear weapons and otherweapons of mass destruction. The question of smallarms  as we see it  is another source of concern. In fact small arms contribute to the breakdown of the socialbalance  fuel conflicts and destabilize States  thusjeopardizing all development efforts.Mali  which hosted the African preparatoryconference  will work towards the success of a follow-up to the conclusions of the United Nations Conferenceon the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weaponsin All Its Aspects and towards the full implementationof the Programme of Action resulting from thatimportant Conference. The West African experience inthis respect constitutes an important initiative to besupported through the declaration of an Economic33Community of West African States (ECOWAS)moratorium on the importation  exportation andmanufacture of small arms and light weapons and theProgramme for Coordination and Assistance forSecurity and Development in Africa.The West African subregion remainscharacterized by the persistence of conflict  a highlevel of poverty  illicit trade in weapons and theproliferation of armed bands. In order to deal withthese conflicts  ECOWAS has given priority to aregional approach for the prevention and managementof conflicts in order to deal with the root causes ofconflict and its humanitarian consequences. TheECOWAS protocol on the Mechanism for ConflictPrevention  Management  Resolution  Peacekeepingand Security  adopted in 1999  is a major tool forregional prevention and management of conflicts. Itsinnovations include its Mediation and SecurityCouncil  its early warning system and the fact that it isrooted in the consolidation and protection ofdemocracy and human rights.Mali welcomes and encourages the positivedevelopments in the peace process in Sierra Leone thathave taken place since the second meeting of theCommittee of Six of the ECOWAS Mediation andSecurity Council with the United Nations  theGovernment of Sierra Leone and the RevolutionaryUnited Front (RUF) on 2 May 2001 in Abuja  Nigeria.Progress  although still fragile  has been made inthe Mano River Union region. As evidence of this wecan cite the ministerial meetings among the threecountries  Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone. ECOWASintends to continue its efforts to help make the ManoRiver Union a pillar of stability and development. Therecent summit of heads of State and Government ofECOWAS on a global and comprehensive approach tosecurity questions stresses once again the will of WestAfrica to shoulder its responsibilities  helped by itsvarious partners.The implementation of these initiatives and WestAfrican approaches to conflict prevention andmanagement will require assistance from theinternational community  in particular the UnitedNations. In this respect  it is gratifying to note that agenuine partnership has been established between theUnited Nations and ECOWAS. We firmly encouragethe establishment of the United Nations Office for WestAfrica  as recommended by the inter-institutionalmission that visited the region from 6 to 27 March2001.The special session of the General Assembly onchildren will be an opportunity to build a progressiveand universalist vision in order to promote a “worldworthy of children”  with the participation of all within the framework of a world movement forchildren. ECOWAS  which has prepared for thatgathering  is continuing its efforts to implement theAccra plan of action on the situation of children inconflict with the opening of a special office entrustedwith this question  the Optional Protocol that will soonbe adopted on the sale of children and the regionalinitiative on joint vaccination days. In the near future  adecade for the culture of children’s rights will beexamined.The creation of the International Criminal Courtwill not only make it possible to bring to trial theperpetrators of the gravest crimes against the dignity ofthe human person  but will also be an instrument ofdeterrence  which can thus contribute to themaintenance of international peace and security. In thisregard  I recall that Mali has already ratified the RomeStatute  thus expressing its support for the struggleagainst impunity and for the full respect of humandignity. We appeal to others to help make the court areality as early as next year.In the field of human security  we must providean appropriate response — a global and urgentresponse — to the scourge of HIV/AIDS following thespecial session of June 2001  while at the same timeincreasing our potential to fight malaria.Our responsibility is great indeed with regard tothe persistence of inequalities and the increase inpoverty. The peoples of the world aspire to education employment  health and nutritional self-sufficiency —in other words  they hope to attain more dignified andhumane living conditions. In this context  Africa which intends to make its union a reality  wants tobecome master of its own destiny. It needs solidarity tohelp it strengthen its capacities and mobilize its owndevelopment resources. We will work hard toward theimplementation of the Programme of Action of theThird United Nations Conference on the LeastDeveloped Countries  held in Brussels in May 2001. Aswas stated by President Konare  that Conference  bythe very fact that it was being convened  signalledprogress34“... and it is also a test of the internationalcommunity following the MillenniumDeclaration. There will be success only if we seea will to move to concrete action  if we envisagestronger and bolder measures to financedevelopment  to increase the effectiveness offoreign aid and to resolve the problems that arehampering the sustainable development of theleast developed countries.”The International Conference on Financing forDevelopment  which will be held in Monterrey inMarch 2002  should be an important event and aninterface for dialogue to find new means ofcontributing to the financing of development and toreaffirm the political will for concrete developmentobjectives. This is why Mali believes that theConference will have to lead to the adoption of aconcise political declaration — a declaration withprecise strategic objectives reflecting the collectivewill to act to resolve the problem of financingdevelopment and to lay the foundations for a real worldpartnership.Africa is pleased that the high-level debate of the2001 substantive session of the Economic and SocialCouncil (ECOSOC)  which was held in Geneva in July had as its theme “The role of the United Nationssystem in supporting the efforts of African countries toachieve sustainable development”  and awaits therealization of the measures envisaged there. This rolemust not be merely a declared one — it must lead toconcrete results. This is why we hope that theMinisterial Meeting of the World Trade Organization(WTO)  which is now under way in Doha  Qatar  willpromote new progress and decisive initiatives to makeit possible for Africa to develop its assets.The entry into force of the African Union  whoseconstituent act was signed in Lomé on 12 July 2000 reflects the commitment of African leaders to theintegration of our continent. In fact  the establishmentof the African Union and the launching of the NewPartnership for African Development  aimed ateliminating poverty through sustainable development can help support the dynamics of regional integration.In this respect  we appeal to the internationalcommunity to assist this African initiative  which is sopromising for the future of the peoples of ourcontinent.Our Organization is  more than ever before called to act to promote international peace andsecurity and to achieve development for all. Here in theUnited Nations  we must act as full-fledged MemberStates  shapers of our shared future. We say this inorder to recall our shared responsibility to bring aboutpeace in the Middle East  the Balkans and the GreatLakes region — to mention just these cases — and todo justice to human nature. We share responsibility tomanifest more solidarity and to provide assistance toresolve the many humanitarian crises that exist.In the Middle East  the situation remains ofconcern because of the persistence of violence in theoccupied Palestinian territories. Mali firmly condemnsthe violence that has been suffered by the Palestinianpeople  and we believe that Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  the principle ofland for peace and the other relevant resolutions of theUnited Nations must serve as a basis for negotiationsand the establishment of a just  global and lastingpeace. We call for the resumption of these negotiationsand reaffirm our unfailing attachment to the legitimaterights of the fraternal Palestinian people  including theright to the establishment of an independent State.My delegation also expresses its hope that therewill be a definitive lifting of sanctions against theLibyan Arab Jamahiriya.On the Korean peninsula  the region from whichyou come  my delegation hopes that the process ofreconciliation now under way will experience furtherprogress  in accordance with General Assemblyresolution 55/11  thanks to autonomous andstrengthened inter-Korean dialogue  and especially theholding of a second summit in the near future. In thisspirit  my country will continue its action for thereconciliation and peaceful reunification of the twoKoreas.Adapting the United Nations to the demands ofour world is an urgent need. Mali remains convinced ofthe vital necessity of democratizing the United Nationsand restructuring its main organs  making them morerepresentative and credible. A democratization of theSecurity Council  whose structure no longercorresponds to the realities of the world  will helpreflect the shared will to make that organ moreeffective  representative and legitimate. Along theselines  we reiterate the demands of Africa for anequitable allocation of the two categories of seats  in35accordance with the Harare Declaration and thedecisions adopted by the heads of State andGovernment of the Organization of African Unity.In conclusion  the peoples of the United Nationsare watching us as we carry out the promises containedin the Millennium Declaration. We must build a newworld — a world that reflects our intelligence  a worldof justice  a world that embodies the essential values ofall humanity."
"114",4673,"MLT",56,2001,"﻿Allow me to begin byexpressing my congratulations to you  Sir  on yourelection as President of the General Assembly. Thefifty-sixth session is clearly going to be a challengingone  and one that I predict will further strengthen theresolve of members to work hand in hand on all thedifferent issues requiring our attention. I would likealso to convey my appreciation to His Excellency Mr.Harri Holkeri for the determined and skilful manner inwhich he presided over the previous session.I would also like to take this opportunity tocongratulate the United Nations and its tirelessSecretary-General on the Nobel Peace Prize that theyhave jointly and so deservedly been awarded.This session started in a markedly differentmanner from those of previous years. The horrendous11 September terrorist attacks brought home the veryreal threat of terrorism to each and every one of us nomatter what corner of the world we inhabit.International terrorism does not limit its actions toindividual countries. In fact  although the attacks werelaunched on United States soil  the specific targetschosen clearly show the intent to destroy symbols ofthe modern world  icons to free people everywhere.Indeed  by attacking this cosmopolitan city andits World Trade Center  the perpetrators targeted us all.Nationals of more than 60 countries met their death inthose dastardly attacks. Even if our own nationals werenot among those who lost their lives  we all felt underattack. We all felt violated. In one way or another  ourlives have been altered forever  and we must respondaccordingly.We must fight the scourge of terrorism withunreserved and unhesitating resolve. We must do thisnot merely as a means to defend all that we hold dear.We must do it to secure a safer world for ourselves  forthose who will follow us and for those who have hadtheir lives irrevocably transformed as a result of theseterrorist attacks. That resolve must be our tribute to theinnocent and the brave who lost their lives in the l1September attacks.The two-month postponement of the generaldebate has provided us with time to reflect and to act.Malta has joined the international community’sabsolute and unreserved condemnation of the terroristacts. We have also stepped up our action in pursuit ofthe effective implementation of anti-terrorism6measures  including comprehensive compliance withSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001).Malta was among the first six countries to signthe International Convention for the Suppression of theFinancing of Terrorism  and yesterday became one ofthe first States to ratify it. On Sunday  Malta alsoacceded to the Convention on the Prevention andPunishment of Crimes against Internationally ProtectedPersons  including Diplomatic Agents; to theInternational Convention against the Taking ofHostages; and to the International Convention for theSuppression of Terrorist Bombings.The new realities of today’s world have certainlybrought to the fore the importance of those conventionson terrorism. At the same time  they have also broughtinto bold relief the wisdom that underpins the efforts ofthe international community in its pursuit of theestablishment of the International Criminal Court. MyGovernment is politically committed to the Court andwill seek ratification of the Rome Statute by theMaltese parliament in the near future. We feel that  inthat way  we are doing all we can to ensure that nostone is left unturned in our fight against terrorism.With each passing day  we witness the dominoeffect that acts of terror may have at a national regional and global level. The impact this has on thelives of millions must be addressed. We feel thereforethat the time is ripe to conclude the debate on anoperational definition of the perpetration of a terroristact. Intensified efforts aimed at the expeditiousconclusion of negotiations on the Indian proposalshould subsequently yield a comprehensive conventionon international terrorism  which will be of benefit tous all. We firmly believe that such an umbrellaagreement will give added value to  and furthercomplement  other existing conventions on terrorism.We also believe that the General Assembly shouldactively consider convening a high-level conference onterrorism under United Nations auspices upon orimmediately after the conclusion of such a convention.That would serve to reinforce ongoing internationalefforts to formulate a collective response to terrorism.The unity of purpose currently prevailing withinthe international community in its fight againstterrorism is perhaps unprecedented. Indeed  thepolitical will displayed over the past two months is aclear manifestation  if any were needed  thatmultilateralism remains a vital tool in the conduct ofrelations among States at a global level. That politicalwill has also been seen in the other work of theOrganization. Allow me therefore to turn to otherissues on the agenda of the General Assembly.I would like first to express my Government’s fullsupport for the initiative of the German and FrenchGovernments to bring the issue of human cloningbefore the United Nations. Aimed at drafting aconvention banning human cloning for the purposes ofreproduction  that initiative has received wide supportfrom all quarters. The concern expressed underlines thefundamental nature of the threat to humanity posed byscientists who are unwilling to accept ethical and morallimits on their work. In responding to the Franco-German initiative  the United Nations will ensure that astrong and meaningful convention can be drafted andadopted within as short a time frame as possible.The United Nations has already had occasion toexhibit its ability to act swiftly and decisively when theconscience of the international community isheightened. The entry into force of the OttawaConvention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines andon Their Destruction  which Malta ratified earlier thisyear  was made possible by the internationalcommunity’s outrage at the devastating impact of thoseindiscriminate weapons  whose horrific effects longoutlast their military purpose.Similarly  the seriousness and urgency of theproblem of human cloning should expedite theconclusion of an internationally binding agreement onthat issue. I have no doubt that the richly diversebeliefs reflected in this room are united in their respectfor human dignity and identity  and their concern withthe fundamental and far-reaching implications ofhuman cloning.Other world events continue to pose a threat tothe fundamental right of peoples to live in a secure stable and prosperous environment. The current state ofaffairs in the Middle East is an example. The dramaticcontrast between the optimism apparent at theMillennium Assembly’s opening and the escalation inviolence over the past few months has made itincreasingly difficult for the parties to return to thepositions they were in just over 12 months ago.Malta is convinced that the Mitchell report andthe Tenet Plan provide a realistic and readilyachievable way out of the spiral of violence that has7engulfed the region. The peace  security and welfare ofall the people concerned require that their fullimplementation be urgently embarked upon. Thisnecessitates the re-establishment of securitycooperation between the parties in the interests of bothIsraelis and Palestinians; the stationing of internationalobservers  preferably from several regions; and an endto all new settlement activity  including so-called“natural growth”. Against this backdrop  Malta hopesthat both parties will be able to return to thenegotiating table with the aim of achieving a just andpermanent peace in the region on the basis of therelevant Security Council resolutions.Also in the Mediterranean  the situation in Cyprushas remained a cause of concern for over 25 years. Weearnestly hope that an early settlement of the Cyprusquestion will be found. In this connection  we reaffirmour full support for efforts to find a solution on thebasis of the relevant Security Council resolutions.Progress towards lasting peace and stability in theMediterranean often appears to unfold very slowly.Events in the Balkans since we met here last year however  bring fresh hope to us all. The end of theMilosevic era was a clear example of the positivechange that can be wrought through the power of thepeople  signalling a fresh beginning for the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia and indeed for all theneighbouring independent republics.In recent months  turmoil and unrest have alsothreatened to engulf the former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia. Yet the unfolding situation now revealsencouraging signs of the power of diplomacy.International assistance extended to republics in theBalkan region is also indicative of the power withineach of us to make our own contribution and to play apart.Malta feels this onus most strongly and activelyseeks to play a role on the international stage that goesbeyond the mere limitations of its geographical size. Infact  in keeping with this consciousness  Malta isproceeding steadily towards its objective of acceding tothe European Union — a union of like-minded Stateswhere we naturally belong  not only politically  butalso economically  culturally and historically. Ourintention is therefore to become an integral part of theEuropean Union at its next enlargement  enabling us toparticipate fully in a decision-making process that alltoo often carries wide-ranging implications for ourcountry.Like other candidate countries  Malta is currentlynegotiating the terms of entry into the European Unionin what will be an unprecedented widening anddeepening of the Union. Already more than halfwaythrough this process  we are working hard to ensurethat Malta is not only well equipped to deal with thechallenges of membership but is also in a position tomake a significant contribution to the Union. Thishistoric project and the enhancement of Mediterraneancooperation are both of immediate concern to Malta.We feel that they go hand in hand.An increase in dialogue between all nations and amove towards securing a safer planet are in everyone’sinterest. However  threats to international security  notleast those posed by weapons of mass destruction continue to lurk in the background. In July this year Malta deposited its instrument of ratification of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Malta hopesthat the remaining 13 countries whose ratification isnecessary for the Treaty to come into force will join the84 countries that have already done this. Thus asignificant collective step will have been taken towardsreducing the risk of nuclear disaster.Not so long ago  the terms “environment” and“international security” in the same sentence wouldhave drawn a perplexed response from most audiences.Today  the link between the two is becomingincreasingly apparent. The urgency in addressing thegreatest threats to our natural environment was madeamply clear in Bonn during the sixth session of theConference of the Parties to the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change. Despitebeing faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles the international community succeeded in forging theEarth’s first major action-oriented response to thephenomenon of global warming.In this respect  allow me to offer myGovernment’s expression of gratitude to the Chairmanof the Conference  Mr. Jan Pronk  as well as to mycompatriot Mr. Michael Zammit Cutajar  ExecutiveSecretary of the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change  for their enormouspersonal efforts to secure a successful outcome. Theirsuccess laid the groundwork for the breakthroughachieved at the seventh session of the Conference inMarrakech last week. The agreement on the modalities8of implementation of the Kyoto Protocol has openedthe door to its ratification by all States signatories.Indeed  Malta deposited its instrument of ratificationyesterday and looks forward to the present momentumbeing sustained  leading to an early entry into force ofthis landmark Protocol.Difficult and complex as it may be to tackleenvironmental global problems  the most challengingenvironmental problems are often those in our ownbackyards. With one of the highest population densitiesin the world  Malta has achieved a high level of humandevelopment without any natural resources at itsdisposal. In seeking to continue to raise our livingstandards  we grapple daily with difficult decisionsaimed at ensuring that economic development on ourislands is environmentally sustainable.There is no simple trade-off between theprotection of the environment and the production ofwealth. The Mediterranean Sea  which provides Maltawith its economic lifeline  is perhaps the most tangibleproof of the fact that economic progress at the expenseof the environment is no progress at all. In reaping itsbountiful fruits  we know that they are not unlimitedand  if not tended to  will dry up altogether. The sameapplies to other seas and oceans.With this in mind  Malta yesterday became thethirtieth State to accede to the Agreement for theImplementation of the Provisions of the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea relating to theConservation and Management of Straddling FishStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks — a movethat will bring the Agreement itself into force on 11December 2001. For Malta  having initiated the processthat led to the United Nations Convention on the Lawof the Sea  it is a source of great satisfaction tocontribute to the further development of this veritablepillar of international law.While there is inevitably still more that can bedone  both at a domestic and an international level  Ihope that this General Assembly session will serve as arenewed impetus for us all to promote everythingnecessary to make the world safer and more secure.This is our fundamental duty  as political leaders  forthe welfare of present and future generations. We mustcontinue to foster social justice  promote equitabledevelopment  nurture confidence among peoples  settleconflicts and take the appropriate measures to ensuresecurity for all. Yet in doing all this  Governments andpeoples must ensure that we continue first andforemost to build peace in the minds of men andwomen. That undertaking  adopted by the generationthat survived the Second World War  retains its nobleauthenticity today as we face the challenges of our owntimes."
"115",4719,"MMR",56,2001,"﻿On behalf of thedelegation of the Union of Myanmar  I wish to extendour warmest congratulations to Mr. Han Seung-soo onhis well-deserved election to the presidency of thefifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Hiselection to this high office reflects the trust andconfidence of all the Member States in his diplomaticskills and leadership qualities and in his ability toguide our deliberations to successful conclusions. It isalso a tribute to his country  the Republic of Korea which is at the forefront in our common efforts toachieve the goals of the Organization. In the dischargeof his heavy responsibilities  may I assure him of ourfull support and cooperation.I also wish to express our deep appreciation to hispredecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland  for his ableleadership and valuable contribution during the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly.May I also take this opportunity to congratulateour Secretary-General on his re-election to lead theOrganization for a second term. I also wish to paytribute to him for his tireless efforts and far-sightedinitiatives to strengthen the United Nations. The awardof the Nobel Peace Prize to our Secretary-General andto the Organization is well-deserved recognition in thisregard.The international community was greatly shockedby the recent horrendous terrorist attacks in the UnitedStates of America. We are profoundly saddened by theenormous loss of lives and property. We join theinternational community in extending our deepcondolences to the people of the United States ingeneral and the bereaved families in particular.Wherever and by whomever committed  terrorism inany form or under any circumstances is unjustifiable.As a nation that has had bitter experiences withterrorism  both on its own soil and against its aircraftand diplomatic service abroad  Myanmar is againstterrorism in all forms and manifestations.The challenges of combating terrorism are bothdifficult and complex. Therefore  it is essential that theinternational community come together under the aegisof the United Nations to overcome the enormouschallenge.In this regard  I commend the Secretary-Generalfor organizing a treaty event at United NationsHeadquarters from 10 to 16 November 2001. Myanmaris already a party to 4 of the 12 conventions onterrorism  and on 12 November we signed theInternational Convention for the Suppression of theFinancing of Terrorism and acceded to the InternationalConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings.In the aftermath of the economic crisis of 1997 Asian countries are still striving to return to a path ofsustained growth. However  the current slowdown inthe major economies of the world is threatening tonegate whatever progress they have made. As theseeconomies continue with structural reforms to sustaintheir economic recovery  they are confronted with an17international economic and trading environment that isnot very encouraging.This situation is creating difficulties  especiallyfor many developing countries and economies intransition. Commodity prices are declining due toweakening world demand. External financingconditions are also worsening. Factors such asindebtedness  declining official development assistanceand low levels of domestic and foreign investmentcontinue to undermine the programmes of the mostvulnerable States. It is against this unfavourablebackdrop that Myanmar is striving to achieve economicdevelopment of the country.There are also hindrances to our efforts topromote the well-being of our people  such as denial ofofficial development assistance and the application ofunilateral and coercive economic measures. However we are resolute in our efforts to achieve our goals byrelying on our domestic resources and internal strengthand by putting our comparative advantages to optimumuse. Our sustained national efforts for developmenthave resulted in 8.4 per cent average annual growthduring the last five-year plan  resulting in a substantialincrease in per capita income and in better livingstandards for the people.In their respective endeavours to bring abouteconomic development and social progress  thedeveloping countries continue to face formidablechallenges. The debt burden  the declining flow ofofficial development assistance  the lack of marketaccess and access to technology  and the decline inforeign direct investment continue to persist. TheUnited Nations must play a central role in helpingthose countries to help themselves.In this regard  we recognize the important role ofUnited Nations funds and programmes in internationalcooperation for development. However  their importantrole should not be undermined by practices that are notin conformity with the principles underpinning theoperation of those funds and programmes. Moreover they should not be used as a platform for exertingpressure on a country that needs and deservesinternational cooperation in its development efforts.While acknowledging the role of various fundsand programmes  we are particularly appreciative ofthe important role of the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP). In United Nations operationalactivities for development  UNDP serves as theprincipal instrument for capacity-building indeveloping countries. Myanmar regrets  however  thatthe United Nations Development Programme is notallowed to have a country programme for Myanmar.While UNDP continues its useful activities inMyanmar  it is  however  prohibited from promotingcapacity-building for reasons other than those forwhich UNDP was created.In the present context of an extremely difficulteconomic and trading environment  the denial of theright of development to a country in need ofinternational cooperation is a matter that deservesappropriate redress.The HIV/AIDS pandemic poses a seriouschallenge to the international community. The responseof the international community and the efforts beingmade at the national  regional and international levelsto counter this global threat are very encouraging.However  the real challenge for us is the high level ofresources needed to combat this disease effectively. Itis therefore most welcome that a global AIDS andhealth fund has been established. With thedetermination and will that has been demonstrated incurrent efforts  and strengthened with adequateresources  we are convinced that we will eventuallywin this war on HIV/AIDS. Myanmar fully recognizesthe nature and gravity of the HIV/AIDS problem  istaking the necessary actions at the national level and isenhancing our cooperation at the regional andinternational levels.Let me take this opportunity to apprise theAssembly of the political situation in our country. Asthe Assembly is aware  Myanmar is in the process ofestablishing a multiparty democracy with a soundeconomy. All of the measures that we have taken aredirected towards that end in a focused manner. This isthe course of action which we will pursue steadfastly toits logical end - that is  until democracy is firmlyestablished. We have learned from bitter experience  aswell as from the lessons of other countries with similarexperiences  and we are taking great care to ensure thatthe transition to a new system is peaceful  smooth andeffective and that the foundations we are striving to layare placed on firm ground.We have also been taking effective measures fornational reconciliation. We have reached arrangementswith 17 out of 18 armed groups  who are now joininghands with the Government in national development18endeavours. In the same vein  we are also makingnational reconciliation efforts with the political parties.Here  let me stress what the Secretary-General has sorightly outlined in his report. Our nationalreconciliation efforts are home-grown  and our goal ofbuilding a peaceful and democratic society can besuccessfully achieved only by the people of Myanmar.Myanmar continues to make relentless efforts tocombat the scourge of narcotic drugs. We have madeconsiderable headway in the suppression of opium andheroin. The latest figures show that opium productionhas declined by 38 per cent. To achieve this  we tackledthe problem in a holistic manner. We have strengthenedour legislation; we have enhanced our enforcementcapacity; and we have combined these measures with adevelopment programme to find alternative livelihoodsfor people in remote areas  so that they do not have toresort to growing opium.While we are taking effective measures againstthe cultivation  production and trafficking of the opiumpoppy  we are also taking action against the danger ofamphetamine-type stimulants  which are relatively newbut equally dangerous narcotic drugs. Due to theiravailability and affordable price  the widespread use ofthese stimulants among young people has led to analarming situation in our subregion. This situation callsfor renewed efforts at the national level and forstepped-up cooperation at the subregional level.To enhance cooperation at the regional level ministers from Myanmar  China  Thailand and Laosmet in Beijing in August and agreed to cooperateclosely to fight the problem. Our efforts have achievedtangible results: the seizure of drugs and the arrest ofthe traffickers involved.Myanmar fully understands how important andurgent it is to combat this scourge afflicting mankind.We have made a firm commitment at the highestpolitical level and are determined to translate thesecommitments into practical and effective measureswithin the set time-frame.I wish to inform the Assembly that we have alsoenhanced our cooperation with the United Nationssystem. We continue our cooperation with Mr. RazaliIsmail  Special Envoy of the Secretary-General  whocompleted his fifth visit to the country in August.Another visit towards the end of this year has also beenagreed to. Mr. Paulo Sergio Pinheiro  SpecialRapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights visited the country twice earlier this year.Determined to resolve the issue of forced labour Myanmar is fully cooperating with the InternationalLabour Organization (ILO). In September 2001  anILO high-level team paid a three-week visit toMyanmar to objectively assess the practicalimplementation and actual impact of the legislative executive and administrative measures adopted by theGovernment to eliminate the practice of forced labour.The Government extended its full cooperation to theteam in arranging its meetings in Myanmar and its fact-finding trips to various parts of the country identifiedby it. What was most important  we gave the teamunfettered freedom and unlimited access to carry out itsmandate successfully.Let me now make a few observations concerningthe work of the Organization. Last year  our heads ofState and Government and leaders gathered in theGeneral Assembly Hall and charted a road-map toguide our future actions. All our work and energy mustbe directed towards effectively using that road-map toachieve a peaceful and developed world. Peace and thedevelopment of nations are the twin objectives of ourOrganization. While globalization has  to aconsiderable degree  reduced our planet to the villagelevel  the issues we face in achieving peace anddevelopment are global in scale and complexity. As weare acutely aware  no one country is capable ofresolving those issues on its own. It is only throughconcerted efforts and genuine partnerships that we willbe able to address those issues of a global scale.We believe that as the only universal forum withthe most comprehensive mandate  the United Nationsmust play a central role and coordinate our actions inthose efforts. At the same time  the United Nationsmust be further strengthened and vitalized to be able tocarry out its global mission effectively andexpeditiously. That will require the furtherstrengthening of its organs and institutions. For ourpart  we must provide the Organization with theresources and the level of support needed to implementits mandate. It is also vitally important to give realeffect to our pledges through concrete actions if ourOrganization is to be successful in building a world ofpeace and development."
"116",4776,"MNG",56,2001,"﻿At the outset  I wishto pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  upon his unanimous re-election. The NobelPeace Prize conferred upon the United Nations and itsSecretary-General testifies to the broad recognition ofthe increasing role played by the world Organization inpromoting peace  security and development and vestsin it  at the same time  greater responsibility and trustin meeting both the existing and evolving globalchallenges.This session of the General Assembly is takingplace at a time when the international community isdrawn together more closely in the face of theunprecedented task of developing an effective responseto the challenge of terrorism. The people andGovernment of Mongolia have resolutely condemnedthe barbaric attacks of 11 September as a deliberate actof terrorism against freedom and democracy — anattack against all humanity and expressed its fullsupport for the collective efforts of the anti-terroristcoalition. From this high rostrum  I wish to reaffirmMongolia’s strong commitment to our common7struggle against the scourge of terrorism. I wish  onbehalf of the Government of Mongolia  to reiterate ourprofound sympathy to the people and Government ofthe United States of America and to all the families thathave been affected by this tragic event. I also expressmy condolences to New Yorkers and to theGovernments of the United States of America and theDominican Republic over the tragic accident that tookplace yesterday here in New York.The response of the international community tothe terrorist attacks has clearly demonstrated its firmresolve to collectively fight this global scourge. In thisrespect  Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) of 28September is a timely measure  unprecedented both inits scope and nature. It has laid the groundwork forpractical measures to be taken by all Member States inthe fight against terrorism and established an effectivemechanism to monitor its implementation. MyGovernment is taking every necessary measure toimplement the provisions of the resolution and therelevant report to that effect was submitted to thecounter-terrorism Committee of the Security Councilon 10 November.I wish also to inform the Assembly that Mongoliasigned yesterday the 1999 International Convention forthe Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. With itsratification in the near future  Mongolia will be party toall the United Nations anti-terrorism conventionsapplicable to it. We also believe that  in light of recentevents  the existing international legal framework onterrorism ought to be further strengthened through thespeedy conclusion of a comprehensive conventionagainst international terrorism and a convention againstnuclear terrorism  preferably at this session of theGeneral Assembly. In the same vein  the pace of settingup the International Criminal Court must beaccelerated.In order to put the anti-terrorist strategy in theright perspective  it would seem important to us to seethe problem in a wider setting  that is  to address issuesthat provide a fertile soil for terrorism  such astransnational organized crime  illicit drugs  moneylaundering  illegal arms trafficking and others. TheUnited Nations  in our view  is uniquely positioned tomeet such a challenge and to develop a comprehensivestrategy to uproot international terrorism throughglobal and concerted action.The events of 11 September have drasticallychanged the world as we see it. It has revealed theheightened vulnerability of the human family. It hasalso revealed  in no uncertain terms  the need forchange in our approach to the way we perceive ourown security. In this regard  the concept of humansecurity  which places the safety  security and well-being of a human being at the heart of the matter deserves our utmost attention. We see the prime meritof the human security concept to be that it addresses ina comprehensive manner the three-tiered freedomoutlined in the Millennium Declaration: freedom fromwant  freedom from fear and freedom to live in ahealthier and cleaner environment.In the emerging era of globalization  it isbecoming increasingly evident that no country canensure its security on its own. This indivisibility ofglobal human security requires a genuine display ofsolidarity and collective responsibility on the part ofevery country of the international community so that itcan effectively address the formidable challenges at theturn of the new millennium.After several decades of development efforts  thenumber of the world’s poor remains at anembarrassingly high level. Exclusion  marginalizationand inequality among and within countries are beingfurther exacerbated by both existing and evolvingtransboundary threats.Looking back  one could describe the decade ofthe 1990s as a decade of commitments fordevelopment  with a series of international conferencesand summits resulting in important declarations andplans of action. Yet today  the world finds itself inmany respects in no better shape. The legitimatequestion arises: Why? Does the internationalcommunity  increasingly seen as a single human familyliving in a shared global village  have the capacity toredress this situation? Technically  the right answerseems to be yes. There are resources — financial human and technological — to ensure a better life. Onthe other hand  one has to admit also that theunderlying reasons could be manifold  as the changesundergone and challenges faced by the world over thelast decade are indeed complex both in nature and inscope.Yet  we cannot but agree with the Secretary-General that8“The widening gap between goals andachievements implies that the internationalcommunity has failed to deliver on crucialcommitments it made during the 1990s”.(A/56/326  para. 81)The real  hard question is then: Do we have thesufficient political will and sense of solidarity to forgethe genuine partnership needed to erase the staggeringdiscrepancy between commitments and action? In thefinal analysis  the answer to this question has to beaffirmative and has to be supported by practical meaningful action. We cannot afford to fail to honourfor yet another decade our commitments if we areserious about ensuring human security. We cannotafford to fail to implement the far-reaching yetachievable targets set by the Millennium Summit lastyear. Our failure could be used as a justification fordeadly acts by those who pose a threat to humanity. Letus therefore make the first decade of this new centuryone of implementation and cooperation for a safer healthier and better world. Additional efforts areurgently required  and affluent countries could exhibittheir solidarity and shared responsibility by furtheropening their markets  providing broader and fasterdebt relief and giving more and better-focuseddevelopment assistance and incentives for foreigndirect investment flows to their less fortunate partners.We must mobilize the political will necessary tomake the upcoming conferences on financing fordevelopment  sustainable development and foodsecurity a success. The lead-up to these importantevents and the conferences themselves are to take intoconsideration the special needs of small  vulnerableand structurally disadvantaged economies so as toenable them to integrate into the multilateral tradingsystem and take advantage of the opportunities offeredby the advance of globalization. We also believe thatthe international ministerial meeting on transittransport cooperation  to be held in 2003  is of crucialimportance in enhancing international cooperation toease the inherent development handicaps of thelandlocked developing countries  as recognized in theMillennium Declaration.My delegation shares the view that a commitmentto human security demands enhanced internationalcooperation in conflict prevention and strengthenedcapacities to assist countries in restoring  building andkeeping the peace. In this respect  Mongolia fullysupports the Secretary-General in his efforts to movethe United Nations from a culture of reaction to aculture of prevention. We believe that mutualunderstanding and dialogue among different peoplesand civilizations are acutely needed to break the patternof mistrust  suspicion and recrimination that either leadto a conflict or serve as a pretext for it. We know thatmutual understanding and dialogue are possible whenthere is cooperation between nations.This session of the General Assembly is ofspecial significance to my country and its people  as wecelebrate the fortieth anniversary of Mongolia’sadmission to the United Nations. On 27 October 1961Mongolia became a full-fledged member of the worldOrganization  an event of historic importance to mypeople. Over the years our cooperation with theorganizations of the United Nations family has beenexpanding both in scope and in substance. TodayMongolia is party to some 140 international treatiesand conventions  and is a member of 33 inter-governmental and 20 regional and other organizations.The United Nations assistance and cooperation hasbeen instrumental in developing human resources capacity-building  education  health and informationtechnology  reducing poverty  protecting theenvironment and developing an adequate response tonatural disasters.Within the framework of the fortieth anniversary we have been undertaking a host of activities to takestock of our past cooperation with the organizations ofthe United Nations system and identify priority areasfor future cooperation. This culminated in the jointconference organized by the Government of Mongoliaand the United Nations on 3 September  in Ulaanbaatar under the theme “Forty Years of Mongolia-UnitedNations Cooperation: Implementation of theMillennium Declaration”. The main thrust of thediscussions and conclusions of that conference hasbeen incorporated into the memorandum of theGovernment of Mongolia on the implementation of theMillennium Declaration  which has been circulated asan official document of this session of the GeneralAssembly.Over the last four decades of our cooperation Mongolia has been endeavouring to contribute  whereit could  to the common efforts of the internationalcommunity to promote peace  cooperation anddevelopment. My delegation is proud to recall that onthe initiative of Mongolia the General Assemblyadopted the Declaration on the Right of Peoples to9Peace  the principles and guidelines for internationalnegotiations  resolutions to observe annually aDisarmament Week and relevant resolutions on theimportance of human resources  cooperatives  ruralwomen and the special needs of the landlockeddeveloping countries. Furthermore  as a strongadvocate of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various partsof the world  in 1992 Mongolia declared its ownterritory a nuclear-weapon-free zone  and has beenworking to further institutionalize this.Recognizing the crucial role of education inensuring sustainable human development and humansecurity  my delegation is pleased to note that thissession of the General Assembly is about to proclaim on Mongolia’s initiative  the 10-year period beginning1 January 2003 the United Nations decade for literacy.Mongolia supports peacekeeping operations asone of the important means of maintaininginternational peace and security. Since the mid-1990s Mongolia has taken deliberate steps and mademeasurable progress in developing its peacekeepingcapability. Showing its willingness to contribute to theUnited Nations peacekeeping missions through directparticipation  in 1999 Mongolia signed a memorandumof understanding with the United Nations on standbyarrangements regarding the provision of staff officers military observers and medical officers. Mongoliastands ready to actively cooperate with the UnitedNations and to make a practical contribution to itspeacekeeping operations.As a member of the Conference on Disarmament Mongolia cannot but fully agree with the Secretary-General  in paragraph 77 of his report on the work ofthe Organization (A/56/1)  that the “level ofinternational cooperation in disarmament remainsdisappointingly low.” In order to bring the Conferenceon Disarmament out of its ongoing stalemate it mayseem advisable to give political impetus to thedisarmament agenda by convening a Security Councilmeeting at the highest level or holding one of the futuresessions of the Conference on Disarmament at the levelof Foreign Ministers.In recent years Mongolia has been an activeparticipant in international activities aimed atstrengthening institutions and processes of democraticgovernance  protecting human rights and promotingdemocratic consolidation. The 1992 Constitution ofMongolia guarantees the Mongolian peoplefundamental freedoms and human rights. Mongolia isparty to all major international human rightsinstruments. Earlier this year Mongolia set up anindependent National Human Rights Commission.Yesterday Mongolia signed the two Optional Protocolsto the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Willingto share its fresh experience of peaceful andsimultaneous transition to democracy and a market-oriented economy over the last decade and to learnmore from the valuable experiences of other countries Mongolia has offered to host the Fifth InternationalConference of New or Restored Democracies in 2003in Ulaanbaatar.The task of ensuring human security andpromoting human-centred development is high on theagenda of my Government  as envisaged in itsprogramme of action. Recognizing the importance ofthe quality of governance in achieving developmentgoals  my Government approved a national programmeon good governance for human security to facilitate thepolicy focus  coherence and sustainability of itsprogramme of action. Mongolia has thus become thefirst country aspiring to ensure human security throughbuilding good governance. As we move along thistrailblazing path  we are aware of the need for theknowledge  expertise  experience and assistance of theorganizations of the United Nations system and ourfellow members of the international community.The Government is resolved to ensure sustainedeconomic growth through reinvigorating andencouraging the development of domestic industry rehabilitating the banking sector  upgrading the livingstandards of the people  reducing poverty andunemployment  and ensuring equitable social andeducational opportunities. We will intensify structuralreforms and encourage an export-oriented  private-sector-led economy. Mining  processing of rawmaterials of animal origin  tourism and other export-oriented sectors are the top priority areas ofdevelopment. Privatization of State assets  includingthe most valuable State enterprises  will continue. Thecreation of a favourable environment for the attractionof foreign investment is also a priority objective.In its endeavours to carry out simultaneouseconomic and political reforms Mongolia faces manychallenges. On behalf of the Government of Mongolia I wish to express our sincere gratitude and highappreciation to our bilateral and multilateral partnersfor their generous support and cooperation pledged at10the eighth meeting of the Mongolia Assistance Group held last May in Paris  demonstrating thus their supportof my Government’s policy and action.Mongolia will continue its active participation inmultilateral processes and international organizationssuch as the United Nations and will spare no effort toensure that the world Organization remains a focalpoint for coordination of the effort of the community ofnations toward peace and development in the years tocome."
"117",4817,"MOZ",56,2001,"﻿I wish to congratulateHis Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo upon his election topreside over the General Assembly at its fifty-sixthsession  and to express my confidence that with hisskilful guidance  his leadership and his outstandingexperience our deliberations will be crowned withsuccess. Allow me also to pay a special tribute to HisExcellency Mr. Harri Holkeri for the excellent mannerin which he conducted the affairs of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. I wish him successin his future endeavours.On behalf of the people and the Government ofMozambique  I would like to extend ourcongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan onhis well-deserved election to the post of Secretary-General for a second term  as well as on having wonthe Nobel Peace Prize this year. We hail his re-electionand the Noble Peace Prize awarded to him and to theUnited Nations as recognition of his and theOrganization’s tireless efforts in the search for viableand lasting solutions to the problems facing humanity.Allow me to express our sympathy to theGovernment and the people of Algeria with regard tothe loss of life and property caused by the recent floodsin that sisterly country. Mozambique  having been thevictim of terrible floods over two consecutive years shares the sorrow of the Algerian people.We also express our condolences to theGovernment and the people of the United States ofAmerica and of the Dominican Republic on the tragedywhich resulted from the plane crash last Monday herein New York.On 11 September  we witnessed the most barbaricterrorist attacks in New York and Washington  D.C. Weare deeply shocked at the loss of thousands of innocentlives.We wish to avail ourselves of this opportunity toreiterate once again the condolences of the Governmentand the people of the Republic of Mozambique to theGovernment and the people of the United States ofAmerica on the tragic and unjustifiable deaths of theircitizens. We express our sympathy and solidarity withall of the victims and the families that have lost theirloved ones.19We reiterate our condemnation of terrorism in allits forms and manifestations  regardless of its origin orplace of occurrence  or of the race or religion of thosewho perpetrate it. Terrorism represents a serious threatto international peace and security as well as tofriendly relations among peoples and nationsworldwide.The struggle against this scourge requiresconcerted action by the whole international community within the framework of the United Nations  for thetarget of this evil is not a single nation or people buthumankind as a whole.It is therefore crucial that all United NationsMember States work together towards signing andratifying all of the conventions and protocols related tothe eradication of this enemy of humanity. Theseconventions represent the legal foundation upon whichwe can build our collective action against internationalterrorism.The work that is under way for the elaboration ofa comprehensive convention on international terrorismconstitutes a further effort to reinforce the internationalcommunity’s resolve to face the challenge ofeliminating the scourge of terrorism.Mozambique came about as the result of theexercise by Mozambicans of their inalienable right toself-determination. Therefore  Mozambicans know wellfrom their own experience what terrorism is all about.But they are also aware of the distinction betweenterrorism and the legitimate struggle of peoples fortheir freedom and independence.Mozambique is ready to participate in a globaldiscussion on this issue  as an important and usefulinitiative to formulate a joint organized response tointernational terrorism  so that the targets of ourcommon struggle against terrorism are clearly defined.Conscious of the need for the effectiveimplementation of national measures to combatterrorism as a way to complement the internationallegal regime  Mozambique has already initiated acomprehensive review of international legalinstruments to combat and eliminate terrorism  with aview to ratifying and adhering to them.In this context  Mozambique signed  on 11November  the International Convention for theSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism. However  itis clear to us that  for an effective implementation ofthis and other legal instruments  Mozambique needssupport from the international community to strengthenits institutions — namely the police  the judiciary  thefinancial system and the State prosecutor’s office.Last year  our heads of State and Government methere during the Millennium Summit to reaffirm theirfaith in the United Nations and in its Charter asindispensable foundations for a just  peaceful and moreprosperous world.The leaders set specific targets to halve theproportion of people who live in extreme poverty  toprovide clean water and basic education for all  toreverse the spread of HIV/AIDS and to achieve otherdevelopment goals. They called for the strengtheningof United Nations peace operations so that vulnerablecommunities can count on them in their hour of need.They committed themselves to fighting injustice andinequality  terror and crime  and to meeting the specialneeds of Africa. In order to achieve these lofty goals all Member States should display political will and thedetermination to turn these commitments into concreteactions at the international  regional and nationallevels.The holding by the United Nations of the specialsessions of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS and onHabitat  the Conference on the Illicit Trade in SmallArms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects and theWorld Conference against Racism  RacialDiscrimination  Xenophobia and Related Intolerancerepresent bold steps towards resolving the variousproblems affecting humanity and constitute concretesteps in the implementation of the provisions of theMillennium Declaration.Mozambique is proud of having played an activerole in contributing to the promising outcome of theUnited Nations Conference on small arms and lightweapons. We are confident that the commitmentsassumed at that Conference will contribute decisivelytowards preventing  combating and eradicating theillicit trade in  and proliferation of  small arms andlight weapons.We should continuously and critically assess theprogress made in each area of commitment  with aview to translating into reality the aspirations andneeds of our peoples. Each subsequent session of theGeneral Assembly should be used to assess the degreeof progress made in the implementation of the declaredcommitment towards specific targets. To this end  we20should ensure that follow-up mechanisms are put inplace and effectively enhanced for the successfulimplementation of the plans of action adopted.As we take on the daunting task of pursuing thegoals of the Millennium Summit  we need to worktogether in a spirit of partnership and cooperation.Today we are living in a world in which a fewcountries are reaping the benefits of globalization while the majority  particularly in Africa  areincreasingly being marginalized by the globaleconomy. Consequently  these increasing inequalitiesand asymmetries aggravate poverty  fuel conflicts andthreaten international security  stability  democracy andpeace.To reverse this negative trend  we call upon alldeveloped countries to fulfil their commitment withregard to official development assistance  increase thelevels of foreign direct investment in poor countries and to cancel the external debt of the heavily indebtedpoor countries.It is disturbing to note that in Africa 340 millionpeople — half of the population of the continent —live on less than $1 per day. The mortality rate forchildren under five years of age is about 140 per 1 000 and life expectancy at birth is only 54 years. Only 58per cent of the population has access to safe water; therate of illiteracy for people over 15 is 41 per cent; andthere are only 18 main telephone lines per 1 000 peoplein Africa  compared with 145 for the world as a wholeand 567 for high-income economies.This appalling situation requires a strong andclear commitment on the part of us all — Africans firstand foremost — the international community and otherrelevant stakeholders.The establishment of the African Union duringthe thirty-seventh Summit of Heads of State andGovernment of the Organization of the African Unity isrecognition that only by pooling our efforts can we findeffective solutions to problems affecting the continent.This effort deserves the support of the internationalcommunity  so that a solid union and strong integrationcan become a reality in Africa.The New Partnership for African Development isan initiative aimed at setting an agenda for the renewalof the continent  based on national and regionalpriorities and on development plans prepared through aparticipatory process. It foresees a new framework ofinteraction with the rest of the world  including theindustrialized countries and multilateral organizations.The encouragement given by the G-8 Summit and othermultilateral institutions in Genoa  Italy  last July ismuch appreciated.We are also encouraged by the commitmentassumed by ministers and heads of delegations at thehigh-level segment of the substantive session of theEconomic and Social Council held in Geneva last July in welcoming the New Partnership for AfricanDevelopment (NEPAD) and calling on the UnitedNations system and the international community tosupport it. The invitation extended by the Council tothe Secretary-General to take the necessary measures toensure an effective and coordinated response of theUnited Nations system is a good course of action aimedat promoting sustainable development and activeparticipation of Africa in the world economy. TheAfrican leadership and ownership of the NEPAD mustbe guaranteed during its implementation.Conflicts are one of the main obstacles todevelopment  particularly in Africa. In order to finddurable solutions to conflicts  we need to focus ouractions on prevention measures and address the rootcauses of conflict. In this regard  prevention should beaimed at addressing  inter alia  poverty  governance human rights abuses  hunger  endemic diseases andunderdevelopment. The success of this action requiresnational ownership based on partnership between theGovernment and civil society.Beyond the preventive measures  we should alsothink how we can effectively implement soundstrategies for conflict resolution and management. Thecomprehensive review of the whole question ofpeacekeeping operations in all their aspects containedin the Brahimi report provides sound recommendationsto improve the effectiveness of peacekeeping. Itemphasizes the need for effective command and controlstructures  enhanced levels of interoperability  as wellas the importance of training troops to understand andoperate with more robust rules of engagement. Webelieve that the recommendations contained in thereport will be effective if more resources are allocatedto peacekeeping activities  particularly in Africa  and ifthe response to actual conflicts are timely  so as toavoid the application of double standards.Initiatives undertaken by regions and subregionsaimed at conflict prevention  management and21resolution should be supported and endowed with theresources they need to build their capacity to acteffectively. The Organization of African UnityMechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management andResolution should be enhanced and consolidated tobetter give appropriate and timely responses toconflicts affecting Africa.The international community should continue toassist Africa in searching for the peaceful resolution ofconflicts  particularly in Sierra Leone and Somalia  aswell as in Western Sahara  when a United Nations planhas been agreed to by all parties to the conflict.It is worth noting that within the SouthernAfrican Development Community (SADC) we arestrongly engaged in activities aimed at tacklingconflicts affecting the region. As the current chair ofthe SADC Organ for Politics  Defence and Security Mozambique  in close cooperation with the othermember States  will spare no efforts to promote peaceand security  through conflict prevention andresolution.SADC will continue to work with the UnitedNations and all cooperating partners to bring aboutlasting peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Angola and in other conflicts on the continent. Thepartnership between SADC and the United Nationsshould be continuously maintained and nurtured in thespirit of the Brahimi report.As the chair of the Community of the Portuguese-Speaking Countries  Mozambique is also engaged inthe current efforts to bring about lasting solutions tothe problems still affecting some of Community’smember States. The Community is happy to welcomeEast Timor  which will proclaim its independence inMay 2002 as a result of our joint  concerted effortswith the East Timorese people.We are committed to the efforts made by SADCmembers to eradicate poverty  combat HIV/AIDS andbetter respond to challenges posed by globalization  asa way to prevent conflicts. We are also supportive ofthe Regional Indicative Strategic Development Planwithin SADC  which aims at boosting the region’sdevelopment agenda for the coming decade.Political dialogue  consensus building partnership and cooperation are a must and should bepursued vigorously. We believe that the World TradeOrganization Ministerial Meeting in Doha  theforthcoming International Conference on Financing forDevelopment and the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment provide unique opportunities tocollectively produce an integrated and effectivemechanism for the eradication of poverty and theoverall implementation of the development goals setout in the Millennium Declaration and in the plan ofaction for the Least Developed Countries.It is our expectation that the MonterreyConference will be instrumental in reshaping the worldeconomic order  giving it more equity and fairness. Tothat end  the Conference must resolutely address thesteady decline of official development assistance andforeign direct investment  untie development aid (asalready done by the United Kingdom  which wesalute)  reform the international financial architectureand provide a sustainable solution to the debt crisisthrough broad  deep and faster debt relief mechanisms including total debt cancellation for least developedcountries.The World Summit on Sustainable Developmentshould allow us to assess the implementation ofAgenda 21  as well as devising appropriate strategies tofurther pursue this daunting challenge. InJohannesburg  we should strive to ensure the rightbalance between environmental protection and socio-economic development  while making povertyeradication our highest priority and fully reinstating theprinciple of common but differentiated responsibility.This is perfectly consistent with the Rio spiritembodied in Agenda 21  a blueprint that should beabsolutely endorsed; we should avoid any renegotiationof Agenda 21.In Mozambique the incidence of poverty reachesabout 70 per cent of the population. To address thisnegative picture  the Government approved an actionplan for the reduction of absolute poverty  commonlyknown as PARPA  for the period 2001-2005. Thestrategic vision of PARPA is founded on twoimperatives: the need to maintain peace and stabilityand the need for rapid  sustained and broad-basedgrowth  where private initiatives play an importantrole. The programme has gained strong support fromthe meeting of the Consultative Group that was heldrecently in Maputo and a boost from Mozambican debtreduction  made within the framework of the HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.Mozambique is greatly thankful to all its cooperatingpartners for the support pledged at the Consultative22Group meeting and for the enhanced HIPC. We hopefor a quick implementation of the commitments made so that our resolve to combat poverty can be a success.Looking at the longer term  the Government ofMozambique launched a national initiative  Agenda2025  a strategy based on a constructive dialogue onthe future of Mozambique. The Agenda aims atcreating  through a participatory and inclusive process a national strategic vision for development  as well asstrengthening the Government’s and civil society’sability to define and implement national policies andprojects.The fight against HIV/AIDS is another priorityfor the Government of Mozambique  for which it hasadopted a national strategic plan that focuses onprevention and reduction of the impact of the disease.The plan places the human being at the centre of actionand is directed at the vulnerable groups of the society including women  orphaned children and youth particularly girls. In this endeavour  the Governmenthas adopted a multisector approach  with the activeinvolvement of all stakeholders  including our civilsociety.Because HIV/AIDS is a global problem combating it calls for a global solution  and wecommend the United Nations for having proposed thecreation of a Global AIDS and Health Fund to combatHIV/AIDS. The Fund will contribute positively to theprevention and combat of this epidemic  which gravelyaffects the region of sub-Saharan Africa.Floods affected Mozambique in the years 2000and 2001 consecutively  which resulted in loss of lifeand production and damage to infrastructure  includingroads  schools  hospitals and houses  and forced peopleto flee from their lands and abandon their belongings.These catastrophes posed a serious setback to thedevelopment of our country.We are encouraged by the outcome of the Post-Flood Reconstruction Conference  held in Maputo inJuly 2001  at which the Government of Mozambiquepresented the reconstruction programme for the centralregion of the country  following the devastation causedby the floods in the early part of 2001. At thatConference  the Government also had the opportunityto report on progress made on the implementation ofthe programme that had been presented at theInternational Reconstruction Conference onMozambique in Rome in May 2000. Once again  wewish to thank all those who extended assistance to ourcountry. The Government of Mozambique alsoappreciates the contribution of the United Nationssystem and the international community at large in ourefforts to consolidate peace  to strengthen democraticinstitutions and to promote development.In conclusion  I would like to reaffirm mycountry’s faith in the United Nations and its Charter for they both remain indispensable foundations for ajust  peaceful and more prosperous world."
"118",4863,"MRT",56,2001,"﻿Iam delighted to be able to congratulate you  Sir  onbehalf of the delegation of the Islamic Republic ofMauritania  on your election to the presidency of thefifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We arecertain that your experience and wisdom will indeedguarantee success at this session.I also avail myself of this opportunity to expressmy gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri for his skilful and distinguished guidance of the workof the past session. This is also an opportunity for meto extend our heartfelt congratulations to the Secretary-General and the entire United Nations staff on theirtireless efforts to achieve the noble objectives of ourOrganization. Those efforts have quite rightly beenrecognized by the Nobel Academy  which decided toaward the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize jointly to theSecretary-General and the United Nations. Thisdistinction reflects the most striking recognition of theefforts undertaken by our Organization to strengtheninternational peace and security. It also constitutedrecognition of the personal merits and contributions ofthe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. Moreover  there-election of the Secretary-General to a second termreflected the satisfaction of the internationalcommunity.This session is taking place in a climate ofsadness in the aftermath of the criminal attacks on NewYork and on Washington  D.C.  with their heavy toll ofthousands of innocent lives. The moment they wereperpetrated  Mauritania voiced its absolutecondemnation of those terrorist acts. My countryreaffirms its condolences to the people and theGovernment of the United States. These tragic eventshave cast light on a new situation: terrorism is nolonger a marginal phenomenon but is rather a keyproblem that knows no boundaries and that can becombated only by means of a global strategy.Mauritania continues to be an active participant in allregional and international activities aimed at aconcerted and comprehensive fight against thatphenomenon. In that context  we reaffirm ourunreserved support for all relevant resolutions  alongwith our determination  specifically  to implementSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) of 28September.It is obvious that the role and internationallegitimacy of the United Nations in bringing aboutinternational peace  security and stability must beenhanced. No one must suggest that fighting terrorismis a campaign by one civilization against another  orthe supposed supremacy of one civilization over anyother. To the contrary  we must act together to showthat the endeavour to eliminate terrorism marks a newphase in humankind’s march forward  building on theheritage of all civilizations and converging in an17expression of our common aspiration to a secure lifeand a better future.In that connection  my country notes withsatisfaction the sustained efforts and the success ofrepeated appeals to bring peace to the Middle East sothat the peoples of that region can live in peace security and prosperity. We hope that the peace processwill be resumed in accordance with the principlesenunciated at the Madrid Conference  in keeping withthe principle of land for peace  and in conformity withSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973)and 425 (1978)  thus bringing about the completewithdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupiedin 1967 and the establishment of an independentPalestinian State with its capital in the holy city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif.We express our hope for a return to stability andconcord in the Gulf region  consistent withinternational legality and with respect for theindependence and territorial integrity of Kuwait  aswell as with respect for the unity and territorialintegrity of Iraq. In that context  we call for the liftingof the embargo that has been imposed for more than 10years on the fraternal Iraqi people  who have sufferedimmensely from that embargo.With respect to Western Sahara  my countrysupports the efforts of the Secretary-General and of hisPersonal Envoy  Mr. James A. Baker III  to guaranteestability in the area through a final solution that wouldenjoy the support of all parties concerned.Turning to developments in the Lockerbie crisis we welcome the success of diplomatic initiatives  butat the same time feel that the Security Council shouldact to lift the embargo imposed on Libya.We hail everything that has been done to resolveconflicts and wars on the African continent  whichhave stymied development efforts there. We welcomethe recent all-Africa development initiative and thesupport it has won from our development partners interms  inter alia  of sources of financing.It has now been proven that phenomena such asviolence and extremism are the outgrowth of povertyand frustration. The international community musttherefore go further to demonstrate its solidarity andhelp achieve social development throughout the world.Developing countries hope for a greater  more reliablespirit of solidarity that is expressed in deeds. Theyneed increased support from the rich countries in theform of greater investment and the opening up ofinternational markets to products from the developingworld.We must recall too that debt continues to beamong the major obstacles to progress in theeconomies of developing countries and a handicap toeconomic development.Notwithstanding the scope of the challenges andthe unfavourable international situation  the IslamicRepublic of Mauritania  under the enlightenedleadership of His Excellency President Maaouya OuldSid’ Ahmed Taya  has made major strides towardssustainable development  with a view to improving thestandard of living of our people  achieving socialadvancement and consolidating democracy and the ruleof law in a climate of peace  security and stability.Pluralistic democracy has been restored in full with theholding some weeks ago of our fifth municipalelections and our third legislative elections. Among thelatest reforms are the introduction of proportionalrepresentation  which has made possible theinvolvement of all parties and which has expanded thevoter base and involvement in political life. Observersand opposition parties praised the conduct and theoutcome of the elections. The broadest possibleparticipation by the people is the best guarantee ofsuccess in the fight against poverty  illiteracy andexclusion. This has strengthened our conviction thattrue enjoyment of human rights and fundamentalfreedoms depends on the ability of the people to takepart in economic  social and cultural decisions.A purpose of the Charter of the United Nations isto realize our common goals. Now more than ever  wemust make an effort to live up to our Chartercommitments in order to bring about a new worldbased on law and justice  guaranteeing peace  securityand solidarity."
"119",4909,"MUS",56,2001,"﻿Mr. President  it givesme great pleasure to address this Assembly under yourable and distinguished leadership. May I  on behalf ofmy delegation  take this opportunity to extend to youour warmest congratulations on your election asPresident of the fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly. You may rest assured  Sir  of the fullestsupport and co-operation of my delegation in thedaunting tasks that you will be called upon to confrontduring your tenure.I also avail myself of this opportunity to thankMr. Harri Holkeri for the excellent manner in which hesteered the work of the last session of the GeneralAssembly.May I also congratulate a distinguished son ofAfrica  our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for hisunopposed election to a second term. The award of theNobel Peace Prize to him and to the United Nationsconfirms the high esteem in which he and ourOrganization are held.As we gather in New York  the atrocities of 11September remain fresh in our collective memory.Allow me to pay a special tribute to the memory of thethousands of innocent victims of the terrorist attacks onthe World Trade Center and the Pentagon and inPennsylvania.We condemn the attempts of the terrorists tojustify their acts as being in conformity with the tenetsof Islam. We do so because neither Islam nor any otherreligion condones the killing of innocent civilians.In order to preserve the lives of our citizens andtheir way of life  we are bound to focus on the sequelsof those heinous terrorist attacks.International terrorism must be fought with all themeans at our disposal. Terrorists know only one thing and that is destruction. While Mauritius is fullycommitted to the global coalition against terrorism  weurge the international community to take a long-termview of international terrorism. Terrorism is thegreatest threat to international peace  security anddevelopment.We also believe that the war on terrorism must befought on the basis of principles and standards whichare accepted by every single State. Terrorism remainsterrorism  and there can be no justification for it at anytime or under any circumstances. We also consider thatcross-border terrorism has caused and is continuing tocause immeasurable damage in many parts of theIndian subcontinent and in Africa. We are convincedthat there must be no double or multiple standards inthe war against terrorism. In this context  we believethat the International Criminal Court must become14operational at the earliest date  and countries whichrejected it in the past must review their stand.We shall work closely with the Security Counciland the international community at large in order tofully implement Security Council resolutions 1368(2001) and 1373 (2001).Together with the war on terrorism  we need towage many other wars  particularly in the light of theMillennium Declaration adopted last year. We need topursue wars against poverty  ignorance  hunger andunderdevelopment. The war against the scourge ofHIV/AIDS is a war that we cannot afford to lose. It isour belief that the international community mustremain focused on these issues  as they are very oftenthe breeding ground for dissent  crises  wars andterrorism.Peace and security will be in danger as long asnuclear arsenals and weapons of mass destructioncontinue to exist and proliferate. Now that terroristsmay get hold of or may already have in theirpossession such weapons  it becomes extremely urgentfor the nuclear States to start meaningful discussionson the elimination of these weapons within a specifiedtime frame.With the conclusion of the recent United NationsConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms andLight Weapons in All Its Aspects  we need to movetowards early implementation of the measurescontained in its Programme of Action. For Africa  thisis a top priority. We are convinced that disarmamentcannot remain a slogan; it must be effectivelyaddressed.Conflicts  wars and crises still persist in manyparts of the African continent and elsewhere particularly in the Balkans. Although we areencouraged by the latest developments in Burundi andthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and by thedirect talks between Rwanda and Uganda to defusesituations before they become explosive  we considerthat peace and security in Africa deserve the closerinvolvement of the international community particularly in making available adequate financialresources. We expect early and full deployment of thethird phase of the United Nations Organization Missionin the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) inkeeping with the Security Council resolutions  and wesupport the inter-Congolese dialogue.We are grateful to African leaders like formerPresident Nelson Mandela  President Moi and formerPresident Masire for their commitment to riddingAfrica of conflicts and to paving the way for anAfrican economic take-off.Mauritius is committed to a major reform of thecomposition of the Security Council. We are convincedthat we should amend the Charter in a way that wouldreflect the emergence of new power structuresjustifying an expansion of the membership. Whatevermay be the criteria for an expanded membership  webelieve that India ought to become a permanentmember at the earliest opportunity. The expansion ofthe Security Council  as well as a reassessment of theabsolutist veto  cannot be delayed any longer.The birth of the African Union coincides with itsrole as the engine to drive forward the process of theNew Partnership for African Development (NEPAD).The New Partnership for African Development is aroad map for Africa to eradicate poverty and to achievethe sustainable growth and development of thecontinent  thereby allowing it to find its place in theworld economy. It is a call for a new relationshipbetween Africa and its partners.We are mindful of the setback which the events of11 September have caused to the major economies  butwe are also hopeful that the G-8 will remain committedto providing to Africa all assistance for the effectiveimplementation of NEPAD.Mauritius supports the liberalization ofinternational trade under the rules of the World TradeOrganization. We are  however  disappointed at thelack of progress with regard to implementation issuesand the undertakings of the major trading countriesunder previous Uruguay Round agreements. The termsof trade as well as non-trade concerns are tilted toomuch in favour of the developed countries  which arestill denying market access. Africa  which todayaccounts for less than two per cent of global trade could  with the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriersin the developed countries  significantly increase itsshare of global trade and thus improve the standard ofliving of its people. An increase in trade for Africa willalso mean a lesser dependence on aid.While globalization throws up opportunities aswell as challenges  we also have to be conscious of itsnegative aspects. We appeal for there to be no doubledealing in trade with poor countries.15The Small Island Developing States experience avariety of inherent disadvantages. In their efforts toachieve sustainable development and the need toenhance their capabilities to function effectively withinthe new globalized trading arrangements  mydelegation calls for the urgent and effectiveimplementation of the Programme of Action forSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates.We welcome the statement by the United Statesthat it supports the creation of a Palestinian State. Weconsider this to be a major step in the right directionfor the resolution of the Middle East crisis. We urge theUnited States to be even-handed in its relations withboth Israel and the Palestinian Authority. We alsobelieve that the unilateral imposition of conditionsprior to the resumption of peace talks is unhelpful.With the support of the international community  weare confident that Israel and Palestine can  within theframework of the Mitchell report and the Tenet plan work out a just and durable peace in which the Statesof Israel and Palestine can live side by side  securewithin their respective boundaries.In our region  the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity  and the Common Market for Eastern andSouthern Africa (COMESA) are emerging as importantinstitutions integrating our economies. These initiativesare helping the member States to better confront thechallenges of globalization. COMESA is the firstregional institution to have set up a free trade area.These regional institutions also address issues of goodgovernance  as well as security and peace. We take aninterest in the domestic situation of our fellowmembers inasmuch as whatever happens in onemember State inevitably impacts  negatively orotherwise  on all member States.We urge all parties to the Framework Agreementfor National Reconciliation to take all measures toexpedite the process towards the referendum in theComoros that will usher in a new constitution. Underthe aegis of the African Union  Mauritius is proposingto host a donors’ meeting as soon as the FrameworkAgreement is implemented.We continue to claim our sovereignty over theChagos archipelago  which was excised by the UnitedKingdom from the then colony of Mauritius inviolation of international law and of General Assemblyresolution 1514 (XV). We are convinced that the timefor the United Kingdom to engage in talks for the earlyretrocession of the archipelago to Mauritiansovereignty is long overdue  inasmuch as problems leftover from colonial days cannot remain unresolved.We are also concerned by the plight of all thoseMauritians  commonly known as the Ilois  who wereforcibly and in outright violation of their fundamentalrights removed from the islands forming thearchipelago by the then colonial Power. We supporttheir legitimate claim for all appropriate remedies.With regard to Tromelin  I reiterate the positionof my delegation  as expressed in the GeneralAssembly last year  and once again call on the FrenchGovernment to enter into constructive negotiations forthe settlement of this issue.As I speak here  bombs are still falling overAfghanistan. We are aware that the living conditions ofthe civilian population are difficult. We deplore theloss of civilian lives. We are confident  however  thatthe international community will rise to the occasion inproviding all humanitarian assistance to the needy inAfghanistan. We are hopeful that the efforts under wayto install a broad-based Government in Afghanistanwill be successful.The Conference of Parties to the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change inMorocco  the World Food Summit in Rome  thediscussions on trade issues in Doha and a host of othermeetings in recent days demonstrate the closedependence that we have on each other. No country canafford to go it alone and the many problems that weface today must be faced by us all in a spirit ofsolidarity  cooperation and mutual accommodation. Weneed to be continually engaged and to collaborate sothat never again does humanity live the extremelypainful moments that it lived after 11 September.The United Nations is the forum to address allour concerns and we are sure that all countries regardless of their might  understand that there can beno substitute for the rule of law  good governance democracy and respect for the dignity and rights of theindividual. We do recognize the threats posed byinternational terrorism and we are all prepared to dowhatever has to be done to combat it. It is our hope thatthis togetherness will not be frittered away when thethreat and the danger have disappeared. The world haswalked away on too many occasions in the past. From16now on  we have to walk together and pave the way fora better world."
"120",4946,"MWI",56,2001,"﻿At the outset  I would like toconvey the condolences of the people and theGovernment of the Republic of Malawi to theGovernment and the people of the United States ofAmerica  as well as to the people and Government ofthe Dominican Republic and other countries whosenationals died in the plane crash that occurred inQueens  here in New York  on 12 November 2001.Similarly  I also wish to convey my condolences to theGovernment and the people of Algeria  following therecent flood disaster in which many lives were lost andmuch property was damaged.On behalf of the Malawi delegation  I feel deeplyhonoured to join my fellow representatives incongratulating Mr. Han Seung-soo on his assumptionof the presidency of the General Assembly. Mydelegation looks forward to working closely with himover the coming months in the pursuit of sustainablesolutions to the major global concerns and challengesthat continue to confront humankind and in thepromotion of international peace  security andunderstanding.Let me also take this opportunity to expressMalawi’s deep appreciation of and thanks to hispredecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland  for hisexceptional skills  expertise and unswervingcommitment. We have noted with appreciation how histireless efforts and tenacity have resulted in progresson most of the items of the agenda during hispresidency.May I also take this opportunity to congratulateour Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  and the UnitedNations as a whole  for being jointly awarded theNobel Peace Prize for the year 2001. This demonstratesthe world’s recognition of the great strides theOrganization and the Secretary-General have made incarrying forward the mandate of the United Nations.This achievement is a rare feat that we should be proudof  and it should serve to encourage all of us to domore for the good of humanity.I would also like to reiterate the congratulationsof the Government of Malawi to Mr. Kofi Annan on hisappointment to the post of Secretary-General for asecond term of office.It is appalling and extremely unfortunate that at atime when we thought we were making progress inhuman development  some people among us conductedheinous and abhorrent acts of terrorism. The terroristattacks in this country on 11 September serve to remindus that the global village we are living in is underthreat from people who do not value human life anddemocratic values. The Government of Malawibelieves that no cause or rationale can justify terrorismas a means of achieving individual or group goals  assuch acts result in indiscriminate destruction of humanlife and property. Clearly  it is evident that no nationwill be spared the far-reaching  devastating impact ofthe attacks of 11 September.The Government of Malawi unreservedlycondemns those acts and pledges its support andcooperation in the fight against such unjustifiablecriminal acts. It is our sincere hope that all thoseresponsible for the terrorist attacks on the United Statesof America and  indeed  elsewhere in the world  willspeedily be brought to justice. As we all sharesympathy with the victims of the recent terroristattacks  let us also demonstrate our unanimous resolveto deal with this problem in a decisive and conclusivemanner by ratifying or acceding to all conventionsaimed at combating terrorism. That will send a strongmessage to all parts of the world about our commonpurpose to remove this evil from our midst.It is common knowledge that terrorist groups andindividuals or entities operate in sophisticatednetworks throughout the world. No country  therefore can decisively deal with this problem alone. It isimperative that we all pool our resources to resolutelydeal with the cancer of terrorism. Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001) forms a sound and clear basison which our cooperation should be anchored. It isabundantly clear that  if this resolution can be seriouslyimplemented  it may effectively frustrate and checkterrorist activities.It will be recalled that the strategic priority of theMillennium Summit held last year was to find ways ofreshaping and reorienting the focus of the UnitedNations that would inspire a renewed and shared senseof universal mission  thereby enabling it to make a real quantifiable difference in the lives of “We  the peoples”in the new millennium.And yet  regrettably  one year after that watershedevent  the commitments of the Millennium Summitalready seem to be anything but what they are —commitments — and to be mere platitudes on the partof the developed countries. The Summit’s much-trumpeted visions  goals and collective social29objectives already appear to have been consigned to thesame fate of non-fulfilment that has befallen similar previous commitments of the rich nations.It is saddening that  at the height of a globalintegration drive  a shockingly large number ofcountries remains outside the globalization loop  whilea handful of economically powerful countries of theNorth controls the pace and terms of participation inthe global economy  not least the skewed distributionof its benefits. It is equally disheartening to note  inparticular  that the African continent is nowhere nearattaining even half as much of the benefit that it hasstrenuously striven for in the global economy. Nowmore than ever  our continent is fast sliding deeper anddeeper into a plight of deteriorating mass poverty.This situation is aggravated by mounting externaldebt  crumbling public infrastructure  marginallyfunctional social services  severe environmentaldegradation  rising illiteracy and the rapid depletion ofhuman resources and the skilled labour force as a resultof endless armed conflicts and the devastation causedby epidemics  such as those of HIV/AIDS  malaria tuberculosis and other transmissible infections. Theseare some of the many issues that we have discussedtime and again in this Assembly and other forums  andyet we seem to be getting nowhere.Clearly  Africa is under the threat of imminentvirtual exclusion from the mainstream globaleconomy — more so if the underlying spirit  ideals goals and commitments of the Millennium Summit arenot faithfully upheld to ensure the concrete andeffective integration of the developing countries intothe global economic framework on terms that reflect ashared future of promise of equality  equity  prosperityfor all and a just world.In spite of all these apprehensions  my delegationis still encouraged by the wide global consensus on arange of major issues of critical concern to the leastdeveloped countries of Africa. The positiveconclusions reached during the special session onHIV/AIDS and the world Conferences that took placethis year — the Third United Nations Conference onthe Least Developed Countries  the United NationsConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms andLight Weapons in All Its Aspects and the WorldConference against Racism and Racial Discrimination Xenophobia and Related Intolerance — reflect a newlyemerging global recognition that there is an urgentneed to begin concretely addressing the issues that willaggressively advance the economic and social progressof the less developed nations. The declarations andprogrammes of action agreed at those Conferencesmust be the centrepiece of any genuine internationalcrusade to reduce social and economic disparities andinequalities between the North and the South. Indeed the persistence of these inequalities and injustices  inour view  is the root cause of the political  economicand social turmoil currently tearing apart the Africancountries and some parts of the world. Malawi wouldlike to reaffirm its steadfast commitment to thedeclarations of commitment  actions and programmesagreed at these Conferences.What the developing countries need is a chancefor a fresh start  which can come about only through acomprehensive package of total debt forgiveness thatcuts across the existing initiatives for debt relief including the enhanced Heavily Indebted PoorCountries Debt Initiative. We also need increasedtechnical assistance  enhanced official developmentassistance and much greater flows of capital resourcesand foreign direct investment from developedcountries.We would also like to insist on the genuinecommitment of the North to the full integration of oureconomies into globalized markets through the removalof technical obstacles placed in the way of our exports.The United Nations ought to play a leading role inbreaking down the walls of protectionism and tosustain the search for measures that can help the poornations wriggle out of their poverty and vulnerability.This is in line with the spirit of the resolutions anddecisions taken at last year’s World Summit for SocialDevelopment.I take this opportunity to pay special tribute toSecretary-General Kofi Annan for the numerousinitiatives that he has undertaken to prevent violentconflicts in Africa and other troubled regions of theworld. The recent release to the Security Council of hisspecial report on conflict prevention  which addressesin depth the many issues that arose from the Brahimireport  is one practical demonstration of the Secretary-General’s overpowering resolve to ensure that theinternational community addresses political disputesand tensions before they degenerate into all-out armedconfrontations and violent conflicts. These pose amajor challenge and real threat to international peaceand security.30In the same vein  to effectively tame violentconflicts  the United Nations needs to deal decisivelywith the problem of the illicit trade and trafficking insmall arms and light weapons. Their easy availability transfer and proliferation remain at the centre of theintractability of violent conflicts  rising insecurity andinstability in some parts of Africa.My delegation is most thankful for the success albeit measured  achieved during the recent UnitedNations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Armsand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. In spite of aspirited bid by others to water down the agreed globalconsensus and programme of action  Africa takes heartin the holding of the Conference itself as a goodstarting point for putting in place effective measures tocurb the immeasurable damage caused by these deadlyweapons.Many evils such as slavery  the slave trade colonialism  apartheid  genocide  the HIV/AIDSpandemic  poverty and starvation have afflicted thecontinent of Africa and its people. These evils havebeen entrenched to such an extent that even theinternational media only look forward to reporting onthe tragedies befalling the continent. However  despitethese ills  Africa deserves a special place in theeconomic  political and social spheres of the world. Itis in cognizance of this fact that our leaders  in theirquest for a prosperous and dynamic Africa  resolved totransform the Organization of African Unity into theAfrican Union.The birth of the Union has ushered in the NewAfrican Initiative  now renamed the New Partnershipfor Africa’s Development  which seeks to pull Africaout of stagnation and put the continent on a newfooting for economic recovery and prosperity as wellas for the promotion of human rights and goodgovernance. As a developing region with very limitedfinancial resources  we shall rely on our cooperatingpartners in order to ensure that our dream for a newAfrica is realized. Therefore  I wish to appeal forglobal support for this noble initiative being espousedby our leaders so that the people of the Africancontinent may see real social  economic and politicaltransformation for the betterment of their lives.Malawi recently assumed the one-year rotatingchairmanship of the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC). While SADC member States takepride in the relative peace and stability that prevail inmuch of the subregion  we still have serious concernsabout the persistent general economic slowdown andthe deterioration of human development in thesubregion. SADC is experiencing an unfair share ofproblems and challenges which require theinternational community’s enhanced generousassistance and good will.It is common knowledge that SADC is reelingunder the pressures of the untold devastation caused bythe HIV/AIDS pandemic  which is unravelling decadesof hard-earned economic gains. The subregionaccounts for 75 per cent of the world’s total number —that is  36 million — of people living with deadlyHIV/AIDS. SADC’s modest average economic growthrate of 3.2 per cent becomes a cause for seriousconcern when compared with its staggering populationgrowth rate of nearly the same level.Apart from causing untold human suffering  thecontinuing civil wars in Angola and the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo — two of the subregion’spotential economic powerhouses — have hamstrungevery genuine endeavour by SADC to promote itself asa prime destination for foreign capital and investment.Therefore  we call upon the United Nations to step upits efforts to bring pressure to bear on the belligerentsin Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congoso that the ongoing peace initiatives can yield the richrewards of an early and decisive settlement. We alsocall upon the international community to continuerendering vital support and cooperation to the peacefacilitator in the Democratic Republic of the Congo toensure that the inter-Congolese dialogue bears fruit andserves to consolidate the gains achieved so far by theUnited Nations peacekeeping operation and the Lusakapeace process.SADC would also like to see much more pressureexerted on Jonas Savimbi in order to force UNITA toreturn to the 1994 Lusaka peace framework. Only theintensification of the United Nations sanctions againstUNITA and the punishment of those violating theembargo would genuinely achieve that goal.The attainment of durable peace and stability inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola andthe removal of tensions in the rest of the subregionwould put SADC on a stronger footing for economicrecovery and a firmer foundation for sustainable peace security and tangible economic growth anddevelopment.31Time and again  Malawi has spoken in favour ofreadmission of the Republic of China on Taiwan toUnited Nations membership  which would grant to thatcountry a well-deserved opportunity for activeengagement in international affairs. Malawi finds itgrossly unjust that the hard-working and peace-lovingpeople of Taiwan should suffer diplomatic isolation sounnecessarily. Therefore  Malawi would like to appealto the entire United Nations membership to lookbeyond narrow political considerations and face up tothe geopolitical and economic realities that obtain onboth sides of the Taiwan Straits. The diplomaticisolation of Taiwan remains both a curiosity and acontradiction in terms. First  almost every countrydeals with Taiwan in terms of trade and other forms ofbilateral cooperation. Secondly  the isolation of Taiwanviolates its people’s inalienable right to free associationwithin the framework of the United Nations Charter.Lastly  let me reaffirm Malawi’s trust andconfidence in the leadership role of the United Nationsin making our world a better place in which to live. Iwould also like to reaffirm Malawi’s unwaveringcommitment to its obligations and responsibilities as amember of the international community of nations."
"121",4992,"MYS",56,2001,"﻿My delegation would liketo congratulate the distinguished Foreign Minister ofthe Republic of Korea on his election as President ofthe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I haveno doubt that under his able and wise stewardship hewill be able to guide the proceedings of this Assemblyto a successful conclusion. Our congratulations also goto the other members of the Bureau  including yourgood self  Sir.I should also like to join other speakers inexpressing my delegation’s gratitude to Mr. HarriHolkeri for the excellent manner in which he conductedand guided the work of the fifty-fifth session of theGeneral Assembly.I should also like to congratulate Mr. Kofi Annanon his re-election as Secretary-General for anotherfive-year term. We are confident that he will continueto serve the Organization with the same single-mindedcommitment he has shown in the past. We alsocongratulate him and the United Nations on beingawarded the centennial Nobel Peace Prize. That is duerecognition of the many contributions that he and theOrganization have made in the service of theinternational community.We are gratified that we are finally able toconvene the general debate after the uncertainties thatwe have had to face in the wake of the horrific eventsof 11 September 2001. Malaysia strongly condemnedthe terrorist attacks and shared the anguish of theAmerican people over the senseless deaths of so manythousands of innocent people. We once again expressour profound condolences to the United States andother countries that lost their nationals in that tragedy.We ourselves lost a number of our own and understandthe pain of the bereaved. As an Islamic country  we arevery much concerned that a group of misguided people identified as Muslims  carried out such terrible acts inthe name of our sacred religion. They have tarnishedthe name of Islam  which stands for peace  and havetried to equate their creed of terror with that of ourfaith  thereby doing a great disservice to our greatreligion and our community. Fortunately  their ploy hasnot worked. In this regard we are grateful to PresidentGeorge W. Bush and other world leaders forcategorically rejecting the stereotyping and associationof Islam and Muslims with terrorism. In this regard every effort should be made to ensure that people ofthe Islamic faith are not discriminated against simplybecause of their faith  ethnic background or the countrythey come from.On an unrelated matter  my delegation extends itssincere condolences to the delegations of the UnitedStates and the Dominican Republic  and those of otherMember States  for the loss of their nationals in thetragic air crash that occurred yesterday on Long Island.Malaysia is ready to contribute to the globaleffort to combat the scourge of terrorism. In dealingwith the issue  there is a need for the internationalcommunity  through the United Nations  to work out asound strategy incorporating all aspects of the problem.While we understand the natural urge for retributionagainst the people who are believed to be behind theheinous attacks and their supporters  we do not thinkmilitary actions are the best and most effectivesolution  nor politically a wise one. We are concernedthat military actions may raise more problems thanthey solve. A sound strategy should include  aside fromthe military option  political/diplomatic efforts andlegal  economic and other measures. It should involve along and sustained campaign in an effort to get at anddestroy  once and for all  each and every root of theterrorist organization or organizations behind theseattacks.A concerted and coordinated effort on the part ofthe international community is the most appropriateand effective approach. For this purpose there is a needfor the convening of an international conference at thehighest level to consider the issue of terrorism in all itsaspects and manifestations  including the necessity ofagreeing on the definition of what constitutesterrorism. That is important so that pure terrorism which cannot be excused under any pretext  can bedifferentiated from the legitimate struggles of peoplesunder colonial or alien domination and foreignoccupation for self-determination and nationalliberation  as recognized by the relevant resolutions ofthe United Nations and other international declarations.Agreement on the definition of terrorism is vitallyimportant so as to clear up any ambiguities anduncertainties that may hamper internationalcooperation. Such a conference should also address theimportant issue of the root causes of  or factors thatspawn  terrorism. Those factors may be political economic or social  but they must be addressed in all26seriousness and objectivity so that appropriatestrategies and practical and effective measures can beformulated to deal with them.As for Afghanistan  there should be an immediatecessation of the current bombings in order to spare thehapless people of Afghanistan further harm andsuffering. They have suffered too long enough — 20years too long. They should be allowed to return totheir villages and homes to prepare for the cold winterseason and Ramadan  which are fast approaching. Thecessation of the bombings would also allow for thereturn of international relief workers so that they canresume their commendable humanitarian work.Enormous amounts of international assistance arerequired. We commend those countries that haveresponded generously and appeal to those that have notdone so. We ourselves have set up an AfghanistanRelief Fund with a very positive response from boththe Government and the public. On the political/diplomatic front  the United Nations should make everyeffort to bring peace to Afghanistan through a politicalsettlement. We hope that the debate that is now goingon in the Security Council on this issue will yieldconstructive results.The situation in Palestine and the Middle Eastcontinues to be a matter of serious concern to theinternational community. The issue must be urgentlyaddressed  not only for its own sake but also to preventit from being exploited by certain groups of people fortheir own ends. It is imperative  if enduring peace is tobe achieved in the Middle East  for the peace processto be revived on an urgent basis. We believe that theMitchell report offers a good basis for bringing thesituation back to the negotiating table. We commendthe Palestinian Authority for unambiguously acceptingthe report. However  we regret that the Israeli side while indicating general “acceptance”  rejected majorparts of the report  including the call for the completecessation of settlement activity  one of the main causesof the current cycle of violence in the occupiedPalestinian territory.The continued military offensive against thePalestinians raises questions about the sincerity of theIsraeli leadership to work for peace. The Israeliauthorities have tried to cow the Palestinian people byan overwhelming use of force  using an assortment ofits formidable arsenals. That excessive use of force hasresulted in more than 800 Palestinians being killed andmore than 20 000 being wounded. Regrettably  the callsof the international community have fallen on deaf earsas the Israeli forces continue their offensive against thePalestinians on the pretext of ending the campaignagainst terrorism. The aggressive actions by theoccupying Power must cease if peace is to be given achance to grow.There is no military solution to the problem.Indeed  the provocative measures taken by Israel willonly aggravate the situation. We therefore strongly urgethe Israeli Government to desist from pursuing amilitary solution. A just  comprehensive and lastingsolution is possible only through a negotiated politicalsettlement — a process that the internationalcommunity and this body must actively pursue. Thismust include the complete withdrawal of Israel from allArab and Palestinian land occupied since 1967 including the city of Al-Quds al-Sharif and theoccupied Syrian Golan. We also reaffirm our supportfor the establishment of an independent State ofPalestine  with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital. Onlythe implementation of all international resolutions onthe Palestinian issue can guarantee lasting peacebetween Israel and Palestine. We once again call onIsrael to comply with Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973) and all other relevantresolutions of the Security Council and the GeneralAssembly. Equally  we look forward to the return of theSyrian Golan without further delay. We hope to see afuture environment that will bring development andopportunities in a peaceful and stable Middle East.Malaysia has consistently voiced its opposition tothe use of sanctions as an instrument of collectivepunishment. No one can deny its debilitating effects onthe general populace of the affected countries. Wetherefore strongly urge the international community  inparticular the Security Council  to seriously review theimpact of sanctions on Member States  particularlythose imposed on Iraq and Libya  which in our viewshould be lifted as soon as possible as they havealready served their purpose.The danger of a nuclear holocaust remains realand serious. We should strive for the ultimate objectiveof a world free of weapons of mass destruction —nuclear  chemical and biological weapons. We shouldmake every effort to strengthen all existing nuclear-related disarmament  arms control and reductionmeasures. The multilateral search for genuine measuresfor disarmament and non-proliferation  particularly in27the nuclear area  must remain the highest priority onthe global disarmament agenda.After more than 20 years of the HIV/AIDSpandemic  the United Nations finally recognized itscatastrophic impact on populations around the worldand convened a special session for an expandedresponse to the pandemic. It is now up to theinternational community to take resolute and concertedaction to combat this scourge and to acknowledge thatthe world’s most affected populations are also amongthe poorest and lack the much-needed resources to actalone. With about 95 per cent of all HIV-infectedpeople living in developing countries  it is essentialthat every assistance be given to them to combat thescourge. We hope that a review conference will beconvened a few years from now to assess how far wehave come in our fight against this devastating disease.Racism constitutes one of the most heinous formsof human rights violations  not only in itself  but as italso gives rise to other egregious forms of systematichuman rights violations such as colonialism  slaveryand genocide. These have in turn resulted in poverty underdevelopment  marginalization and socialexclusion for far too many. We are therefore heartenedthat the outcome of the World Conference againstRacism  Racial Discrimination  Xenophobia andRelated Intolerance  held in Durban recently  containedelements that will further our efforts to eradicateracism  the most prominent of which is the recognitionby the international community that slavery and theslave trade are crimes against humanity. Unfortunately we view the outcome documents as inadequate as theydo not sufficiently address the plight of the Palestinianpeople  who are victims of policies based ondiscrimination and exclusion.We look forward to the upcoming special sessionon children as an affirmation of the centrality ofchildren to our common future and a positive proof ofour commitment to ensuring the survival  protectionand development of all children around the world.While many of the goals set by the World Summit forChildren have been achieved  an estimated 600 millionchildren are still struggling to survive  eat and learn onless than $1 a day. Let us also not overlook the plightof children affected by sanctions  such as the haplesschildren of Iraq  many of whom do not survive beyondthe age of five.Many of us in the developing world hadwelcomed  indeed embraced  globalization almostunquestioningly as if it were a panacea for all ourproblems  only to be disillusioned over time when wefound that rather than a holistic process benefiting allof humanity  it was being pursued more often than notas a strategy for the benefit of a few. While the world isricher today  millions of people are still living inabsolute poverty  suffering from want  sickness andmalnutrition. Globalization is a complex process  withas many opportunities as challenges. While the impactof globalization is profound and pervasive  not all of itis necessarily positive. As we embrace it there is a needto ensure that we minimize its negative impact particularly on the developing countries.If globalization in its present form is pursued characterized  inter alia  by weakened nationalsovereignty and growing ownership and control of newtechnologies by powerful nations  it will not be theuniversal remedy it was thought to be. The Asianfinancial crisis demonstrated forcefully the downsideof globalization. It demonstrated the inherentinstability of the world economic system  in whichtrade and economic liberalization have not necessarilyled to faster growth and development for thedeveloping countries. What is clear is that growth anddevelopment require an enabling internationalenvironment and international support that can promotegrowth with equity for the benefit of all.To enable developing countries to participate inand benefit equally from globalization  adequatefunding for development  among other things  isrequired. It is therefore most disheartening to see thesteady decline over the years in the volume of officialdevelopment assistance (ODA) to developingcountries. The continued need for an inflow of ODAand new and additional financial resources will becomeeven more critical with the advancement ofglobalization and the shift to the new knowledge-basedeconomy. Unless the ODA situation improves  thedeveloping countries will be further marginalized in arapidly globalizing world economy  characterized byrapid change  high technology and stiff competition.The developing countries  particularly the leastdeveloped  must therefore continue to be assisted in amore sustained fashion in order to bring about a moreequitable distribution of growth and economicprosperity. The developing countries  for their part 28must put their house in order by adopting soundeconomic policies.The issue of financing for development isparticularly relevant and vitally important in solvingthe problems of development faced by many countries.The International Conference on Financing forDevelopment  in Mexico early next year  will providethe opportunity for us to achieve internationalconsensus on issues pertaining to financing fordevelopment in all its aspects. We thank theGovernment of Mexico for its willingness to host thatimportant Conference and look forward to participatingconstructively in Monterrey. We hope that theConference will be able to address the core problemsrelating to financing for development  including othersystemic issues such as the reform of the internationalfinancial architecture  on which  in spite of a generalrecognition of the need for reform  there has been noprogress thus far.As an innovative source of financing fordevelopment  the Conference in Monterrey could alsoconsider  inter alia  the possibility of establishing anappropriate system of international taxation for thepurpose of infrastructure-building in the leastdeveloped countries. This international tax  which wassuggested by my Prime Minister  Mr. MahathirMohamad  will be contributed by those countries thathave benefited from international trade  over and abovethe economic aid given by them to the developingcountries. Malaysia is quite prepared to contribute tosuch an infrastructure tax.The challenge facing developing countries inintegrating themselves into the international tradingsystem lies in their ability to fully and activelyparticipate in the multilateral trading system.Regrettably  many developing countries have notbenefited from global trade liberalization because oftheir inability to have access to the markets ofdeveloped countries. Although globalization carrieswith it the notion of free trade  many developedcountries maintain protectionist regimes and subsidiesas basic instruments of economic policy  even as theyinsist on opening up the markets of the developingcountries in the name of globalization. It is alsodisappointing to the developing countries that structurally  little has been done in the area of trade toimprove their ability and capability to compete in theglobal market. There is  therefore  an urgent need tofacilitate the integration of the developing countriesinto the global trading system through  inter alia  thespecial differential measures provided for under theUruguay Round. A new round  should it be launched should ensure that negotiations effectively address theparticular concerns and problems of developingcountries. However  any negotiations will have toformally recognize that the least developedcountries — indeed  for that matter  many of thedeveloping countries — have neither the financial norhuman resources to meet their existing obligations  letalone the outcome of future negotiations. In this regardwe believe that the role of the United NationsConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  asone of the few mechanisms concerned with thedevelopment of the developing countries  is of theutmost importance. We hope that UNCTAD willcontinue to play a leading role in helping developingcountries  particularly in efforts to reach theMillennium Declaration’s development target ofhalving poverty by the year 2015.With regard to the situation in Africa  mydelegation welcomes the United Nations MillenniumDeclaration adopted last year  which  among otherthings  pledged to pay special attention to meeting thespecial needs of Africa. The international communitymust continue to assist African countries in theirdevelopment needs. We should continue to assist ourAfrican brothers in their struggle for lasting peace poverty eradication and sustainable development.Malaysia  for its part  has been able to make a modestcontribution through the Malaysian TechnicalCooperation Programme  launched in 1981. To date many participants from African countries have takenpart in various short-term and medium-term courses inthe public  administration and technical fields inMalaysia. We have also developed economic relationswith some African countries based on the concept ofsmart partnership  involving Governments and theprivate sector  with the goal of promoting sound andsustainable economic activities to ensure a win-winrelationship for all. Within our limited resources Malaysia looks forward to further consolidating ourcooperation and solidarity with Africa in the spirit ofSouth-South cooperation.Malaysia welcomes the Secretary-General’spledge to move the United Nations from a culture ofreaction to a culture of prevention. This culture shouldbe the cornerstone of the Organization’s collectivesecurity system for this century. It is a far better and29more cost-effective approach  in financial as well as inhuman terms  than mounting any operation or activityafter a conflict has erupted. We are pleased to note thatthe Secretary-General continues to pursue that culturewith the relevant regional organizations in order tofurther enhance a comprehensive approach by drawingon regional preventive strategies. We urge theSecretary-General to continue to consult the relevantregional or subregional groups in this regard.In conclusion  I should like to raise an issue thatwas mentioned by my Prime Minister  Mr. MahathirMohamad  when he addressed the fifty-fourth sessionof the General Assembly. The problem relates toimmunities granted to nationals of Member States byvirtue of the 1946 Convention on the Privileges andImmunities of the United Nations and the 1947Convention on the Privileges and Immunities ofSpecialized Agencies once they are appointed asofficials of the United Nations  such as a rapporteur.While Malaysia acknowledges the need for immunitiesto be granted to ensure that these officials are able tocarry out their mandate effectively  it seems that theyare able to hide behind this cloak of immunity forevery criticism made of their own Government including words that fall outside their mandate. Surelyeven they should be treated as ordinary citizens governed by the laws of the land  when they are notofficially “on mission”. My delegation calls for clearguidelines to govern the conduct of United Nationsofficials  especially when residing in their owncountries  so that their actions fall strictly within theirmandates and that they will enjoy immunities thereonly at such times as they are officially performingtheir functions as United Nations officials  and not allyear round. Surely  also  there should be a better basisfor the appointment of United Nations officials — anominee should be one who is known for his or herneutral or unbiased views  and not who  in the words ofmy Prime Minister “is well known for his virulentattacks” — to report on any given matter. Surely onthis issue the United Nations would be among the firstto agree that while there is a need to protect and ensurethe freedom and impartiality of its officials  it mustalso  at the same time  protect the rights and interestsof its Member States."
"122",5019,"NAM",56,2001,"﻿The fifty-sixth sessionof the General Assembly is no ordinary one. We aremeeting in the aftermath of the despicable terroristattacks on New York  the seat of the United Nations Washington  D.C.  and Pennsylvania. Once again  weexpress our deep condolences to the Government andthe people of the United States. Our thoughts go out tothe families of those who lost their loved ones in thosetragic and horrific events of 11 September. Namibiareiterates its unreserved condemnation of these and allother terrorist attacks  wherever they occur.In the same vein  we express our condolences tothe families of those who perished in the AmericanAirlines accident on 12 November. We also convey ourcondolences to the Government and the people of theDominican Republic.Namibia also expresses its heartfelt sympathy tothe Government and the people of Algeria as theymourn the deaths of those killed by the violent stormand mudslides there. Our thoughts go out to theirfamilies.I would like to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-sooon his unanimous election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-sixth session and to assure him ofNamibia’s cooperation during his tenure. I would alsolike to congratulate his predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Harri Holkeri  for the skills he brought to the workof the General Assembly while presiding over the fifty-fifth session. Under his able leadership  we have madea firm beginning to the implementation of theDeclaration of the Millennium Summit.Our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  and theUnited Nations have earned a place among the NobelPeace Prize laureates. For this  as well as for hisunanimous  early re-election  Namibia extends warmcongratulations to the Secretary-General. This  indeed is eloquent testimony to the universal respect andadmiration he has earned from all Member States. Wewish him well and assure him of our full supportduring his new term of office.29Today we face multiple challenges  some ofwhich threaten the future existence of communities andnations. With the adoption of the historic MillenniumDeclaration  world leaders pledged their determinationto address old as well as new obstacles hamperingpeace and security. A solemn commitment has thusbeen made to enhance social and economic prosperityfor all people  thereby ensuring a better world.Through the United Nations  and with strongpolitical will  no challenge is insurmountable. TheUnited Nations is the only international body capableof serving the interests of all nations. It is an effectiveconsultative and organizational forum for world affairs and it can create trust and confidence among nations. Itcan bring peace to war-torn areas and bring relief anddevelopment to people who need it most. Whensufficiently funded  its programmes and mandates canhelp developing countries to meet the challenges ofHIV/AIDS  malaria and other diseases threatening ourpopulations.It is therefore important that we  the MemberStates  reaffirm our commitment to continue tostrengthen our Organization in order to effectivelyaddress the challenges of the new millennium. In thiscontext  we reiterate our call for the reform anddemocratization of the Security Council. The SecurityCouncil must be transparent and equitablyrepresentative. Above all  it must be responsive andaccountable to all States Members  on whose behalf itmaintains international peace and security.The outcome of the historic first Conference onIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in AllIts Aspects  held in July 2001  marked an importantfirst step and set achievable goals to address theproblems associated with this scourge  at all levels. Itwill now require the combined efforts of the UnitedNations  Member States and relevant international andregional organizations to ensure that rapid progress ismade to stop the proliferation of small arms and lightweapons  which has wreaked havoc  especially on theAfrican continent.Terrorism has assumed an increasingly alarmingglobalized character. For some time now  theMovement of the Non-Aligned Countries has beencalling for an international conference againstterrorism. The time is now right for Member States toreach a consensus on such a conference. In this respect I wish to point out that Namibia signed  on 10November 2001  the International Convention for theSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism  and we callon others to do likewise.At the 1990 World Summit for Children we madea collective commitment to put children first  take careof and educate them and protect them from harm exploitation  war and abuse. Yet too many children intoo many parts of the world are still deprived of apeaceful childhood. Let us seize the occasion of thetwenty-seventh special session of the GeneralAssembly  on children  to take effective measures tomake the world fit for all our children.The HIV/AIDS pandemic has reachedcatastrophic proportions. The Secretary-Generalreminded us that nearly 22 million people have died ofHIV/AIDS and that out of more than 36 million peopleinfected worldwide by HIV/AIDS  25.3 million live insub-Saharan Africa. Thus  if indeed we are to succeedin reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015  as worldleaders committed themselves to doing in so manyforums  then Governments  civil society and the privatesector must  in strong partnership  tackle HIV/AIDS. Inthis connection  the establishment of the Global AIDSand Health Fund to combat the AIDS epidemic andother communicable diseases is a welcome initiativewhich calls for generous contributions.The World Conference against Racism  RacialDiscrimination  Xenophobia and Related Intolerance held in Durban  South Africa  was the beginning of aprocess undertaken by the international community toaddress the inhuman and brutal treatment of the victimsof the dehumanizing practice of slavery andcolonialism  especially the African people. The trans-Atlantic slave trade and the colonization of the Africanpeoples remain the darkest and most humiliatingepisode in the history of the African continent. Thehealing process will be enhanced only if and whenthose who committed and benefited from slavery andcolonialism accept their full responsibility.Namibia applauds the establishment of theInternational Criminal Court (ICC)  designed to bringto justice those individuals accused of the most seriouscrimes of concern to the international community.Recently  the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC) adopted the Windhoek Plan ofAction on ICC Ratification and Implementation designed to promote early ratification of the ICC treaty.30Namibia is currently reviewing its national legislationto prepare for the ratification of the treaty.The knowledge-based global economy hasrevolutionized the nature of trade  finance employment  migration  the environment and socialsystems  as well as the concept and application ofgovernance.Namibia  like other countries of the South expects tangible results from the InternationalConference on Financing for Development  to be heldnext year in Mexico. It is in the interest of North-Southand South-South cooperation that additional options beexplored to mobilize financing for development.Similarly  the fourth Ministerial Meeting of the WorldTrade Organization  in Doha  Qatar  could pave theway to an equitable international trading system that ismutually beneficial to all countries  provided thatpolitical will prevails.The World Summit on Sustainable Development to be held in Johannesburg  South Africa  next yearshould galvanize momentum for the fullimplementation of Agenda 21  in particular theprinciple of common but differentiated responsibility.Desertification  land erosion and land degradationshould be given due and appropriate consideration.Africa has recently taken an important steptowards greater unity and cohesion with thetransformation of the Organization of African Unityinto the African Union. This momentous step wouldbring about closer integration of the continent andwould make Africa more competitive in anincreasingly global market. Furthermore  the heads ofState and Government adopted the New AfricanInitiative  now the New Partnership for Africa’sDevelopment  whose primary objective is theeradication of poverty through sustained economicgrowth and sustainable development. We call on theinternational community to support and assist Africancountries in the implementation of this NewPartnership.Let me stress that the initiatives undertaken byJapan  the People’s Republic of China  the UnitedStates  under the third Tokyo International Conferenceon African Development  the China-Africa Forum andthe African Growth and Opportunity Act respectivelycan complement the efforts of African countries forsustained economic growth.We congratulate the people of East Timor on theirstruggle for independence and on conductingsuccessful elections for their first ConstituentAssembly. We commend the United Nations for itsimportant role in East Timor. We wish the people ofEast Timor every success in the reconstruction andrehabilitation of their country. We call on theinternational community to be generous in its supportof the East Timorese people in this most challengingphase of their nationhood.The eleventh of November this year marks 26years of the independence of the Republic of Angola.But for more than a quarter of a century  the people ofAngola have endured a brutal and devastating war.They have suffered horrendous terrorist attacks againstcivilian targets  including most recently attacks on apassenger train  on school buses  the kidnapping ofschoolchildren  attacks on hospitals and the wantondestruction of infrastructure; all at the hands ofUNITA. Tens of thousands of innocent men  womenand children have been killed. Their agricultural fieldsare infested with landmines. Angola has acquired thedubious distinction of having the largest number ofamputees and the greatest number of landmines. This isnot right; it cannot be right. These heinous atrocitiescommitted by UNITA  as well as that group’sconsistent record of duplicity and always negotiating inbad faith  compelled SADC  in 1998  to declareSavimbi  UNITA’s leader  a war criminal.For its part  having determined convincingly thatUNITA is responsible for the violations of the LusakaProtocol and the resumption of the war  the UnitedNations Security Council imposed sanctions againstUNITA. While sanctions have been effective in manyimportant respects  more concrete measures need to betaken by Member States to strengthen them and makethem even more effective. African countries have abigger and special obligation in this regard. Sanctionsmust be tightened in those areas identified by theMonitoring Mechanism on Sanctions against UNITA such as the freezing of UNITA assets and bankaccounts and the closing down of UNITArepresentations abroad  which now operate undermisleading and innocuous sounding appellations butwhich in fact continue to promote UNITA activitiesand advocate its wicked cause. The internationalcommunity should respond more decisively to repeateddefiance of Security Council resolutions by UNITA. Byacting more resolutely against UNITA  the31international community will help end the prolongedsuffering  tears and agony of the people of Angola.Regarding the Democratic Republic of theCongo  Namibia is encouraged by the progress made inthe implementation of the Lusaka CeasefireAgreement. The ceasefire has been holding so fardespite some violations and infringements  particularlyin the eastern part of the country. The continuedoccupation by forces of aggression has createddeplorable human suffering and large-scale humanrights violations in the Democratic Republic of theCongo. Namibia  once again wishes to remind theMembers of the United Nations that a cardinalprinciple of the Charter of this Organization has beenviolated with impunity  when some of its Memberscommitted an act of naked aggression against theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. It is even moredeplorable when the aggressor countries are engaged inthe ruthless exploitation and plundering of the naturalresources of the Congo. We reiterate here thataggression should be rejected and condemnedwhenever and wherever it occurs. There should be nodouble standards when it comes to the violation of theprinciples of the Charter with regard to aggression. Theinternational community should also assist the peopleof the Congo in the rehabilitation and reconstruction oftheir country.Now it is time for the Security Council toimplement its decisions without further delay andapprove the personnel for phase III of the deploymentof the United Nations Organization Mission in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC)  takingfully into account the demands and requirements ofthat peacekeeping operation — the size of the countryand the non-existence of the infrastructure. The UnitedNations and the international community cannot failthe people of the Congo this time around.We are gratified by the increased efforts of theSecurity Council and the serious attention paid by theinternational community to Sierra Leone  which havenow started to pay off. The international communityshould remain actively engaged and continue to assistwith the peace-building and reconstruction of thepeace-loving people of Sierra Leone.History teaches us that no administrative Powerhas relinquished authority as a gesture of good will that no peace process has been problem-free and thatparties to a conflict  naturally  will have differences.This notwithstanding  however  no amount ofdifficulties can justify abandonment of the UnitedNations Settlement Plan for Western Sahara. Anyattempt to legitimize  in whatever form or shape  thepresent situation in Western Sahara is unjustifiable andis a departure from the United Nations Declaration ondecolonization and relevant General Assembly andSecurity Council resolutions. Ignoring the legitimateaspirations of the brave Sahrawi people will only delaydurable peace in the region. A departure from theUnited Nations Settlement Plan will deny the Sahrawipeople their inalienable right to self-determination andindependence. Namibia will reject and will dissociateitself from any plan  informal or otherwise  to deny theSahrawi people their legitimate right to expressthemselves through a free  fair and impartialreferendum for self-determination.No people can maintain peace and security orbuild its prosperity on the helplessness and abjectmisery of others  particularly their neighbours. Thepeople of Palestine and  indeed  the internationalcommunity are crying out for the establishment of thePalestinian State. They are crying out for peacebetween Palestine and the State of Israel. It is now timeto heed this call. The legitimate right of the people ofPalestine to self-determination and the establishment ofan independent State of their own cannot be denied andcannot be compromised. A Palestinian State will be inthe best interests of Israel  of security and peace  of theentire Middle East and of the whole world. The basisfor a just and lasting peace in the Middle East remainsSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973).Let us make sustained and determined collectiveefforts to promote peace and development in all cornersof the world  so that our children and grandchildren canlive in a peaceful world."
"123",5064,"NER",56,2001,"﻿Thefact that we are meeting under the presidency of one ofthe most eminent personalities of the Republic ofKorea bears eloquent testimony to the positive changesin international relations and to the end of theideological bipolarization of the world.I would like at the outset to convey thecondolences of the Republic of the Niger to the UnitedStates of America and the Dominican Republic for thetragedy that occurred this morning.The Niger would like to warmly congratulateMr. Han Seung-soo on his election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session  as well asthe other members of the Bureau. We are sure that hewill demonstrate the same dynamism  energy andhuman qualities as his predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeriof Finland  as he continues his outstanding work for thebenefit of humankind.I would like to reaffirm the warm congratulationsof the Niger to our brother  Mr. Kofi Annan  theSecretary-General  for his re-election to a post whosevisibility  prestige and effectiveness he has done somuch to enhance  as well as for the award of the 2001Nobel Peace Prize  which is a testimony — if furtherevidence were needed — to the global recognition ofthe work that he has already accomplished in theservice of humanity.This serves as an eloquent rebuttal to thearguments of all those who claim to find  in the denialof the fundamental principles of dialogue betweencultures and nations — principles enshrined in theCharter — the high road to salvation. In this regard  theNiger endorses the relevant General Assembly andSecurity Council resolutions  and welcomes theemergence of a general consensus on the need to wagewar against terrorism on a collective and global basis within the framework of the international legalityembodied by the United Nations.If we are to succeed  the fight against terrorismmust be based on a programme of internationalcooperation  including  in particular  substantialfinancial and technical assistance to the mostdisadvantaged States so as to enable them to make asignificant contribution to that process.Still on the subject of peace and security  I wouldlike to point out that  within the realm of disarmamentand the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  we are inthe final stages of the process of ratifying theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and ofsigning a safeguards agreement with the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency.With regard to conventional weapons  theconvening of the United Nations Conference on theIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in AllIts Aspects fulfilled one of the commitmentsundertaken by our heads of State or Government in thehistoric Millennium Declaration. The Niger welcomesthe fact that the Conference was able to adopt  byconsensus  a Programme of Action to combat thatscourge  which is one of the most serious threats tointernational peace and security. Furthermore  theNiger welcomes the fact that that Programme of Actiontook account of the principal concerns expressed byAfrican States in the Bamako Declaration  byproviding  in particular  financial and technicalassistance measures for the disarmament demobilization and reintegration of former combatants.No part of the world has been spared the illicittrafficking in and circulation of small arms. But thedeveloping countries  in particular those on thecontinent of Africa  are paying the highest price for theproliferation of small arms from the standpoint of theirsecurity  stability and development.That is why the Economic Community of WestAfrican States moratorium on the manufacture  importand export of small arms  adopted in Abuja in October1998  which was extended for three years on 5 July  aswell as the Programme for Coordination andAssistance for Security and Development  shouldreceive substantial financial support from theinternational community.36In this context  the Niger reaffirms its support forthe proposal of the United Kingdom to create aninternational fund  to be managed by the UnitedNations Development Programme  for the collection ofsmall arms. If it is effective  that fund will help tosupport regional and national projects for the collectionand destruction of small arms in exchange fordevelopment projects. In this regard  I am pleased toreaffirm to the Assembly the gratitude of the Niger tothe countries that participated in the work of the Groupof Interested States on Practical DisarmamentMeasures.Since the events of 11 September  the entireworld has been assessing the tragic consequences ofthat Manichaean ideology. Terrorists are  withoutdoubt  a threat to international peace and security. Ithas been claimed that those events were committed inthe name of Islam. But as everyone knows  Islam is thereligion of the golden mean  and condemns suicide andmurder. It advocates dialogue and persuasion and thesteadfast combating of any tendency towards individualor collective nihilism. That is one of the reasons whythe Niger fully associates itself with the globalcoalition against terrorism. That is also why  during therecent discussions on measures to eliminateinternational terrorism  the Niger reiterated its firmcondemnation of all forms of violence and itsdetermination to commit itself to all subregional andinternational initiatives aimed at eradicating thatscourge.In the Millennium Declaration  world leadersundertook to enhance the effectiveness of the UnitedNations in the maintenance of international peace andsecurity by providing it with the necessary tools andresources to better prevent conflict  bring about thepeaceful settlement of disputes and consolidate peaceand post-conflict reconstruction. In order to beeffective  a preventive conflict-management strategy as set out in the report of the Secretary-General requires the international community  working togetherwith national and regional actors  to adopt acomprehensive approach encompassing political diplomatic  humanitarian and institutional measures and to undertake actions aimed at economicrevitalization. As a follow-up to that report  last July inAgadez my country  acting within the national dynamicaimed at consolidating peace and with the support ofthe United Nations  organized a forum on conflictprevention — the first of its kind in Africa. That forumrecommended the elaboration of a national conflict-prevention strategy  the implementation of whichwould be coordinated by the National Commission forSocial Dialogue  which brings together representativesof the State and civil society.For too long  the international community’sattention has been focused on the Middle East  whererepeated efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement ofthe Israeli-Arab conflict have ended in deadlock. Thesupport of the G-8 for the idea of sending internationalobservers to Palestinian territory is an important stepforward; such action would guarantee the impartialapplication of the recommendations of the Mitchellreport.The Niger would like to reaffirm  here in theAssembly  that a lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict cannot be achieved without therealization by the Palestinian people of theirinalienable right to an independent sovereign State.The Niger wholeheartedly supports the position of theUnited States of America in this regard.With regard to the conflict in Western Sahara  theNiger supports the efforts of the United Nations  inparticular those of the Secretary-General and hisPersonal Envoy  to bring about a final settlement that isacceptable to interested and concerned parties.With regard to Asia  the summit meeting thattook place last July in India between the President ofPakistan and the Prime Minister of India raised greathopes for a political settlement of the conflict inKashmir. Such initiatives must be supported andencouraged so as to allow for the self-determination ofthe Kashmiri people as soon as possible in accordancewith the relevant Security Council resolutions.By according highest priority to the specificneeds of Africa  the Millennium Summit recognizedthe full magnitude of the serious problems that besetour continent. Proof of this is that most African Statesare included on the list of least advanced and poorestcountries and have been left behind by thetechnological revolution. The ravages caused by armedconflicts and the HIV/AIDS pandemic have affectedmore than 26 million Africans and wiped out the hard-won progress made over the past decade. At the sametime  the flow of official development assistance toAfrica has plummeted  while foreign direct investmentshave continued to stagnate. Worse yet  between 1999and 2000 those investments even fell from $10.537billion to $9.1 billion  while during the same periodthey rose in Asia and Central and Eastern Europe.It is therefore urgent to increase the volume ofofficial development assistance  to expand debt-cancellation initiatives  to improve the access ofAfrican exports to international markets and to promoteinvestment. These measures must be accompanied byappropriate support for the efforts of the UnitedNations system because this Organization is the bestforum for promoting new partnerships for the benefitof Africa.In this respect  the Niger very much hopes thatAfrica’s drive to reappropriate its own developmentwill be encouraged. That drive is marked by theproliferation of national and regional initiatives  themost recent manifestation of which was the adoption atthe Lusaka summit of the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) of an African development plan  theimplementation of which the G-8 has decided tosupport.The forthcoming International Conference onFinancing for Development should prove to be adecisive turning point in the establishment of a morejust and equitable world economic order. It should inter alia  lead to the adoption of a clear politicaldeclaration defining strategic priorities  accompaniedby a precise timetable  with respect to thestrengthening of the capacities of the developingcountries  particularly the least developed among them and their integration into the world economy. TheConference should be the point of departure of a broadworld partnership to channel all energies towards themobilization of resources for development and thereform of international financial structures.In this regard  the 10-year Brussels Programme ofAction for the Least Developed Countries has made itpossible to lay the foundations of an enhanced worldpartnership to achieve the economic growth essential toreducing poverty. Following the firm commitmentsundertaken in Brussels  there are now grounds for hopethat  particularly with regard to trade  the current roundof World Trade Organization negotiations in Qatar willtake fully into account the interests of the leastdeveloped countries  whose 630 million inhabitantshave a legitimate aspiration to benefit from the positiveeffects of globalization.In the absence of an appropriate response fromthe affluent countries  the damage caused by theHIV/AIDS epidemic may prove to be irreparable  giventhat some specialists estimate that there will be 100million dead from that disease by the year 2010 ifeffective measures are not taken immediately to stemthe scourge.Need we recall  moreover  that malaria claims asmany human victims in Africa as AIDS  particularly inWest Africa? It is comforting to note  however  that theinternational community has finally become aware ofthe signal danger posed by that disease. The Nigerwelcomes the decision of the United Nations toproclaim the period 2001-2010 the Decade to RollBack Malaria in Developing Countries  Particularly inAfrica. The United Nations is thus in step with thevarious initiatives of the OAU in the struggle againstmalaria  led by Yahya Jammeh of Gambia  OlusegunObasanjo of Nigeria and Mamadou Tandja of the Niger.There can be no doubt that the struggle againstmajor diseases calls for substantial resources and astrong capacity for coordinated action. The Nigertherefore welcomes the Secretary-General’sestablishment of the Global AIDS and Health Fund which should give a new dynamic to the struggleagainst AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis  which togetherclaim 5 million dead throughout the world every year.The announcement made at the G-8 summit inGenoa that $1.8 billion will be devoted to launchingthe Global Fund is an important step in the rightdirection. In spite of everything  a great deal remains tobe done. According to United Nations estimates approximately $3 billion must be mobilized before2001 for AIDS alone and contributions of $7 billion to$10 billion will be necessary every year thereafter until2005. Thus  today more than ever  the internationalcommunity must demonstrate active solidarity betweenrich and poor and a sense of unshakeable collectiveresponsibility — in a word  unfailing political will —if it wishes to translate into deeds the Declaration ofCommitment adopted at the special session onHIV/AIDS.The progress achieved in the Niger in its currentreform programme has allowed us to re-establish andconsolidate the country’s economic bases  to revivefruitful relations with the international financialinstitutions and thus to secure the Niger’s eligibility forthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative.Furthermore  the Niger recently established a newframework for the implementation of its own national38anti-poverty policy. A strategy for reducing povertydefines the country’s priorities and measures andactions to be undertaken in order to achieve the targetsset in various spheres  which will allow us to makeserious inroads into poverty by 2015.This struggle against poverty in the Niger enjoysthe highest political involvement. A programmeinitiated personally by the President of the Republic Mr. Mamadou Tandja  is designed to improve the livingstandards of the people of our country. The first phaseof what is known as “The Programme of the Presidentof the Republic” has already led to the construction of1 000 wells  100 mini-dams  100 schools and 100health centres for rural communities. It is well knownthat such communities in the Niger suffer intractableilliteracy  a serious lack of infrastructure and cyclicalfood shortages caused by irregular rainfall. TheProgramme also stresses the link between poverty andthe environment. It is in that context that we plan toplant 1 million trees throughout our national territoryby the end of this year.The Government is thus perfectly in step with thedeep-rooted aspirations of the people of the Niger  whorecognize in its actions their ancestral lore of personaland collective effort against adversity  and with itsbilateral and multilateral partners  whose ongoingconcern is the restoration of the environment. All theinstitutions of the United Nations family and theEuropean Union — in particular France  Germany Italy and Great Britain — as well as Canada and Japan have contributed significantly to reviving theecological system and to combating desertification inthe Niger.In the Niger  we are fully aware that this fight isprimary a national one. We wage it throughvolunteerism  the roots of which are deeply entrenchedin our traditions and extend beyond our frontiers. I takethis opportunity to reiterate the profound gratitude ofthe Niger to all the bodies of the United Nationssystem  in particular the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  the United Nations Population Fund  theUnited Nations Children’s Fund and our otherdevelopment partners  for their precious support for theefforts of the Government to promote the well-being ofour people.To conclude  I would say that the internationalcommunity needs a strong United Nations to achievethe ambitious objectives set forth in the Charter and toimplement the Millennium Declaration. It is thereforenecessary to give unstinting support to the Secretary-General in his efforts to reform the Organization strengthen its role and secure the resources that willallow him to accomplish his task effectively. TheUnited Nations remains indeed the only institutioncapable of bringing about the new world order to whichwe all so deeply aspire."
"124",5110,"NGA",56,2001,"﻿Recent events havemanifestly brought to the fore the importance andrelevance of the United Nations in the pursuit of globalpeace  security and stability. Only last year in thishistoric Hall  world leaders at the Millennium Summitreaffirmed their solemn commitment to strengthen thecapacity of the Organization in this very importantarea. Yet  two months ago  on 11 September 2001  theefforts of our Organization were temporarily called intoquestion by terrorist attacks on the United States.As a country which was directly affected by thefirst terrorist bombings in Dar es Salaam in 1998  inwhich our embassy building was destroyed  andbecause we lost nationals at the attack on the WorldTrade Center  Nigeria fully identifies with the rage andgrief of the bereaved families and the victims of thesebarbaric acts.Terrorism is a global menace that challenges thevery basis of our civilization. It must therefore beconfronted globally. That is why Nigeria fully endorsesthe prompt action taken by the General Assembly incondemning these attacks. We fully support SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001)  because the measurescalled for in the resolution would significantly reducethe capacity of terrorists to carry out such acts. Nigeriais committed to the implementation of the resolution’sprovisions. Let us sustain the unity of purpose andresolve that the terrorist attacks have generated bystrengthening the cooperation and coordination amongour countries. The terrorists and their supporters shouldbe exposed for what they are: fringe elementsundeserving of a respectable place in the comity ofnations. Our strategies therefore should be informed consistent and focused.In some respects  the grave challenges that weface today also offer new possibilities for cooperationpreviously unimaginable. Our Organization has notonly pursued the goal of international peace andsecurity  but it has also served as a focal point for thepromotion of other important agendas  particularly inthe areas of socio-economic development  the rule oflaw  good governance and respect for human rights.These goals  which reflect the aspirations of MemberStates to build a new world free of conflict  prejudice discrimination and oppression  must remain theenduring preoccupation of our common enterprise. Forthis  we have a clear compass  not only in the Charterof our Organization  but also in the solemncommitment of our leaders  as reflected in theMillennium Declaration. Let us strive to translate thesecommitments into practical policies for the benefit ofour peoples.My country’s long-standing commitment tofostering the objectives of the United Nations in thearea of conflict prevention  peace and stability is wellknown. It is regrettable that conflicts and wars continueto be waged in many parts of the world. It isparticularly disheartening that Africa has had adisproportionate share of these conflicts and wars  withdevastating impact on our societies and peoples. Yet amid the apparent gloom  we see a flicker of hope. Theprocess of peace and stability in Sierra Leone isgaining momentum  as the process of reconciliation through a programme of disarmament  demobilizationand rehabilitation  funded by the United Nations  hascontinued to generate trust and confidence. We areequally encouraged by recent developments inBurundi  where a newly installed interim transitionalGovernment is grappling with the challenges ofnational reconciliation and integration. These effortsattest to the determination of leaders in our continent tomake a success of initiatives for peace. Nigeria isproud to be associated with these efforts. Ourexperience in Liberia and Sierra Leone has reinforcedour conviction that  working in close partnership withregional and subregional organizations  the UnitedNations can facilitate the return to peace and securityin conflict areas. Let us provide these organizationswith the necessary financial and logistic support.Apart from the commitment to durable peace andsecurity  there must be a re-intensification of ourresolve to eliminate weapons of war  both conventionaland non-conventional. Of the utmost concern to us inAfrica is the havoc caused by the proliferation of smallarms and light weapons. The Programme of Actionadopted at the recently concluded United NationsConference on Small Arms and Light Weapons in AllIts Aspects provides us with a clear road map foreffective cooperation. Its effective implementation willattest to our commitment to strengthen the forces ofdemocracy and the rule of law in the world.We recognize the inexorable march ofglobalization and fully embrace the challenges ofexpanding opportunities in trade  finance  information18and communications technology which it offers. Butthe benefits should not be limited to only a smallsection of the international community. Globalizationand the twin phenomena of liberalization andderegulation should work for all countries. The healthand stability of the global economic system demandnothing less. For us in Africa  access to such benefitsshould be reflected in concrete actions and measuresthat will ensure our full integration into a new and fairglobal economic system.Nigeria’s call for a fundamental change in currentdebt strategies towards developing countries is derivedfrom a keen appreciation of the impact external debthas on the economic growth and political stability ofdeveloping countries. The fact that  in spite of welcomeinitiatives on debt relief and debt management  manyof our countries have neither grown out of debt norbeen able significantly to service their debts in asustainable manner  warrants a bolder and moreimaginative approach  such as outright debtcancellation.International efforts to resolve the debt problemshould be bolstered by collective action to discouragethe illegal transfer of funds from developing countriesand the repatriation of such funds to the countries oforigin. African leaders have established a clear linkagebetween our huge debt burden  the activities of foreigncollaborators and the transfer of funds by formerleaders and other individuals from our continent. Weare concerned about the corrosive impact of corruptionon our fledgling democracies and our social  economicand political development. Let us redouble our effortsto support an international instrument on the illegaltransfer of funds abroad.At the thirty-seventh regular session of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  which tookplace in Lusaka in July  the leaders of the continentendorsed the New African Initiative  now called theNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).The inaugural meeting of the ImplementationCommittee of Heads of State and Government onNEPAD took place in Abuja on 23 October 2001.Based on a common vision and shared conviction aboutthe need to urgently eradicate poverty and placeAfrican countries on the path to sustainable growth anddevelopment  NEPAD has  among its key themes  thepromotion of peace  democracy  human rights  socialand economic management  regional cooperation andeconomic integration. We appreciate the supportalready offered  and we sincerely believe that thisprovides the best platform for a viable partnership withour development partners.The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to poseserious challenges to development in our world. Weappreciate the contribution of the internationalcommunity in combating that scourge  as reflected inthe outcome of the special session on HIV/AIDS.Africa’s resolve to meet the pandemic head-on hasstruck a responsive chord  and we are grateful to theUnited Nations Secretary-General for his clearadvocacy. I believe that we have reason to beencouraged by the progress made in establishingstructures and a multilateral framework for greatercooperation and support in confronting the problem.Every effort should be made to ensure that the GlobalAIDS and Health Fund becomes operational by January2002. Meanwhile  we should maintain the momentumso that in the shortest possible time we bring succour tothose who live with AIDS or suffer from tuberculosisor other related infectious diseases. This is theexpectation of the African leaders who met in Abuja inApril this year to agree on a coordinated strategy onthis health and development crisis. Our attentionshould also be focused on the campaign againstmalaria  as a follow-up to an earlier summit  whichalso took place in Abuja.The rescheduling of the United Nations specialsession on the rights of the child to May 2002 shouldprovide us with an opportunity to ponder thechallenges which the world’s children face today. Forus in Nigeria  the session will coincide with thepassage of far-reaching legislation  now before theNational Assembly  to protect our children  and gobeyond the provisions of the OAU African Charter onthe Rights and Welfare of the Child  which we haverecently ratified  to revolutionize public awareness andthe defence of their rights. Indeed  in mid-2002 Nigeria proposes to host an international conferencethat will  inter alia  address the issue of trafficking inchildren in our region. We look forward to theparticipation of Member States.I cannot conclude without reference to thequestion of the reform of the United Nations system.Nigeria maintains that  in order for the United Nationsto meet the complex challenges of our new century long-overdue reforms of the Organization must bespeedily undertaken. The reform of the SecurityCouncil  in particular  constitutes one of the major19challenges facing the United Nations today. Let uswork assiduously to complete the reform process andthereby make the enlarged and expanded Council trulyrepresentative of the United Nations membership.May I express our profound gratitude toSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his leadership of ourOrganization in the past year. Nigeria rejoices with himover his well-deserved re-election  a reward for faithfulstewardship and a signal of the trust and confidence ofthe United Nations membership in his shared vision forthe future. No less significant is the award to him andto our Organization of the Nobel Peace Prize for 2001.We wish him well and heartily congratulate the UnitedNations on that achievement."
"125",5155,"NIC",56,2001,"﻿Before Iproceed  allow me  on behalf of the people and theGovernment of Nicaragua  to express our sorrow to thepeople and the Government of the Dominican Republicfor yesterday’s event. Allow me also  Mr. President  tojoin those who have come before me in congratulatingyou on your well-deserved election as President of thefifty-sixth session of the General Assembly  and toexpress my confidence that under your competentdirection this session will conclude its worksuccessfully. I also wish to express our most profoundappreciation for the praiseworthy work achieved by theoutgoing President  Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland.Likewise  I wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  not only for having been re-elected to a second mandate with the consensus of theentire international community  but also for the recent well-deserved  high distinction of being awarded together with the United Nations  the Nobel PeacePrize.The people and the Government of Nicaraguareceived with great concern the news of the criminalterrorist attacks against the people and the Governmentof the United States on 11 September. Since then  wehave offered our solidarity and cooperation to thepeople and the Government of the United States for thecapture and punishment of all those involved in thoseabhorrent acts. The magnitude of those terrorist actsbrings new and diverse challenges in the political economic and security areas. The enemies of peace anddemocracy have attempted to create a widespread5climate of uncertainty and fear. For this reason  ourfirst challenge is not to allow ourselves to beintimidated or paralysed by their criminal threats andactions.At the Central American level  on 19 Septemberin Honduras  the Presidents of the isthmus adopted aDeclaration entitled “Central America united againstterrorism”  in which we strongly condemned any tiesbetween groups or sectors in the Central Americanregion and international terrorism. As of that date  webegan to undertake concrete initiatives aimed atimproving information systems between neighbouringcountries; increasing coordination between air andnaval forces to deal with illicit traffic; ensuring betterborder monitoring; enabling the exchange ofinformation between specialized public securityagencies; increasing control over travel documents; andstrengthening security for airports and civil aviation.Nicaragua is a party to those measures andprovisions that promote and safeguard internationaland regional peace and security through the preventionand peaceful resolution of disputes between States andthe non-proliferation of nuclear and conventionalweapons of mass destruction  which contravene theprinciples of international humanitarian law.Our firm commitment to world peace and securityled my country to host the Third Meeting of the StatesParties to the Ottawa Convention  despite the fact thatthat meeting took place soon after the events of 11September. The Managua Conference allowed theStates parties to renew their commitment and to notewith satisfaction the important progress that has beenmade in the crusade to eliminate anti-personnellandmines. The ratification of the Convention by morethan 120 States; the strengthening of the mechanismsfor its implementation; the progress in mine removal;the destruction of mines stockpiled in different parts ofthe world; and the virtual embargo on the internationaltrade in these weapons are concrete steps in our effortto end the suffering brought about by antipersonnelmines.I would like to earnestly appeal to the States thathave not yet done so to ratify the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  as well as the Convention forthe Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Mines. Nicaraguaalso welcomes with satisfaction the Programme ofAction to prevent  combat and eradicate the illicit tradein small arms and light weapons in all its aspects adopted on 21 July.Just one year ago  we convened the MillenniumSummit  at which we made commitments designed tomeet the challenges of the twenty-first century andreaffirmed our faith in the United Nations as the centralinstrument for promoting peace  security  prosperityand justice.In order to respond effectively to the challengesthat the new millennium imposes on us — challengesthat cannot be ignored — it is crucial that we takeresolute steps to reform the United Nations  ensuringthat its policies and structures are commensurate withthe realities and aspirations of contemporaryinternational society. Nicaragua shares the interest ofall Member States in strengthening our Organization soas to optimize its work in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  conflict prevention the promotion of sustainable development and thebattle against poverty.In this context  it is crucial to move forward withreform of the Security Council so that that body canrespond fully and effectively to current needs and tofuture challenges to our peoples.Furthermore  the profound changes experiencedby societies throughout the world since 1945 requirethe United Nations urgently to reaffirm its universalvocation as a fundamental prerequisite for confrontingnew challenges through the full and effectiveparticipation of all peoples  without distinction andexcluding no one.However  this universal vocation cannot be fullyrealized as long as a democratic State and signatory ofthe San Francisco Charter is unable to participate as afull-fledged Member within the United Nations system.As is well known  the Republic of China is ademocratic country  and its freely and transparentlyelected Government is the only one that canlegitimately represent the interests and desires of thepeople of Taiwan at the United Nations. We should notcontinue to deny the 23 million people who live in theRepublic of China the right to be represented in theUnited Nations and to share with us the efforts topromote peace and development for future generations.Let us recall that the Republic of China hasplayed a positive role in the promotion of world trade the eradication of poverty and the advancement of6human rights. These laudable efforts at the national andinternational levels must be recognized by the UnitedNations; the Republic of China should be given theright to integrate itself into the international order ofthe United Nations  having fulfilled the basicconditions in accordance with international law.Since the beginning of my mandate in 1997  weNicaraguans have taken significant steps in theimportant task of consolidating democracy and guidingour country along the path of development. TheNicaraguan people have made great sacrifices in layingthe foundations of sustainable human development bystrengthening the rule of law; stabilizing the economythrough the implementation of responsible financialand fiscal policies; providing for the effectiveparticipation of civil society in national decision-making; and formulating a long-term strategy in thebattle against poverty and for reducing economic social and environmental vulnerability. That process however  has not been easy  because of the heavyburden of our external national debt  internationalfinancial crises  the fall in the price of our main exportproducts and natural disasters.The elections held in my country on 4 Novemberwill go down in national history as an example oftransparency  public spirit and profound democraticconviction. The orderly and transparent way in whichthe process unfolded  broad citizen participation  withfewer than 10 per cent of the population failing to takepart  and the attitude of the people of Nicaragua reflectof the degree to which my country has progressed instrengthening its democratic institutions.We strongly support the convening of the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development to take place inJohannesburg  South Africa  in September 2002  thetask of which will be to determine the current status ofthe implementation of the commitments undertaken atthe Earth Summit. As a reflection of that will  we noteour ratification of the Conventions on Climate Changeand Biological Diversity  the efforts carried out by theNational Council for Sustainable Development andNicaragua’s participation in major projects for thepreservation of the rich ecosystems of the region  suchas the Meso-American Biological Corridor and theAtlantic Biological Corridor.The new problems and challenges that humanityfaces greatly exceed our individual capabilities asStates. For that reason  it is imperative that we renewour commitment to the goals and principles of theUnited Nations  which will allow us to continue toadvance in the building of a world that is more just peaceful and secure for future generations."
"126",5202,"NLD",56,2001,"﻿How can anyonestand on the smoking ashes of “ground zero” and notbe overwhelmed by disbelief  anger  and frustration?How can anyone escape the enormity of what happenedin September or not feel compassion for all those whohave lost someone dear to them? At “ground zero” wenot only witness death and destruction  but we also seehow American values have come under siege. Theseare shared values. That is why the people I representnow stand squarely behind the United States.14No matter how deeply moved we may be  wemust look beyond our anger and frustration. Throughour tears  we should discover opportunity. Through ourbitterness  necessity. We must turn compassion intosolidarity  turn solidarity into common action. We needa plan — in sum  we must turn to the United Nations.The reaction on the part of the United Nationsfrom the beginning of this crisis has been prompt andresponsible. As we meet this week  we must try andkeep the momentum going. And that is precisely whatwe are doing. There is something I have sensed in thefirst few days of this general debate — namely determination — determination to use the UnitedNations to the fullest  on many different fronts  as acentre of gravity for our common actions — commonaction for confronting a global threat — commonaction to maintain the international order.With regard to that common action  what have welearned so far? Three lessons. Lesson number one: thelaw must be firmly in place. There is a wealth of legalrules to guide us in these difficult times  and more ofthem are on the way. A striking example of innovativerule-making was presented by the Security Council.Binding under Chapter VII of the United NationsCharter  resolution 1373 (2001) takes action not inregard to a specific threat or breach of the peace  notagainst a particular Member State  but takes action toconfront a phenomenon  a threat to our human valuesand economic interests — action against unidentifiedenemies. By writing new law  the Council has brokennew ground. Even more so  as it has set up theCounter-Terrorism Committee to monitor theimplementation of its decision.Jointly with our partners in the European Union we are taking the implementation of resolution 1373(2001) very seriously. One aspect of it is especiallyimportant to us: promoting ratification of all of thevarious anti-terrorism conventions and monitoringcompliance. My country has some expertise to offerand will gladly share it. Meanwhile  an overarchingconvention against terrorism is in the works. That isgood. But we are getting bogged down over adefinition of terrorism. That is bad. Let us not forgetthat it took us 20 years to produce a fairly uselessdefinition of aggression. The world cannot wait thatlong. Besides  when terrorism stares you in the face you’ll know it.In addition to rule-making  the real challenge liesin implementation. There  we should try harder. Let megive you one example. Just before the summer we lostour momentum in the fight against biological warfare and therefore the fight against bio-terrorism as well.The world is a scary place. Anthrax is only one motivefor retrieving that momentum. Let us resume ourefforts to turn the Biological Weapons Convention intoan instrument that can really make a difference.The need for stepping up security is immediate comprehensive and self-evident. In the aftermath of 11September  nobody would deny it. But we need to beconcerned with the downside of security as well. Partsof our value system may come under pressure whenGovernments seek to bolster public safety  and by this Imean human rights and fundamental freedoms. Asprivate citizens we must be ready to make concessionsand  yes  we will be forced to relinquish some freedomfrom intrusion in our private lives. But we cannot beexpected to live in a never-ending state of siege.Wherever we have to strike a balance  we have to do sowisely. Long ago  we drew a line beyond which wecannot step — we cannot detract from the basicprinciples of human rights. Those principles are thetrue measure of our evolution and our civilization. Ifwe look the other way  we lose the moral high ground.If we compromise  we lose out to those who besiege us.What is being put to the test here is our ownvalue system. The core notion of that system istolerance. Tolerance must  however  come from allsides. Tolerance is not the equivalent of giving in tointolerance. It does not imply that you bend at theslightest pressure. Tolerance means that you stand up tobe counted  that you draw a line in the sand when yourbasic values are challenged. That is lesson number one.Lesson number two: there are “black holes” in theinternational order: failing States. We knew they werethere all along  but we have never been quite sure howto deal with them. Why should we care about failingStates? For several reasons. Look at the avalanche ofdrugs  drug-money  weapons  and warlords spilling outof Afghanistan. Look at the blood diamonds streamingout of Africa. Think of how failing States attractparasites and how they turn into breeding grounds forterrorism  a haven for international crime. Think ofpeace and security  too; of how faltering countriesbecome a liability to their own people; of how theyflaunt the rules of the game and become a liability tothe whole neighbourhood.15How do we deal with failing States? Thatquestion has never been answered in a systematicmanner. Any answer begins by recognition on the partof the Member States of this Organization that failingStates are a problem. Indeed  it may turn out to be themost pernicious problem of the new century. From thatpoint on  we need to build a strategy  and do sotogether  within the framework of this Organization.What are we aiming at? How ambitious are we?Can we get in early to prevent failing States fromfailing? Are there any early warning signals to look outfor? If we see those signals  do we have the means toact? And the political will? Once States are failing  dowe try and fix them? Do we settle for ending thefighting  wherever fighting is going on? Or do we limitourselves to humanitarian aid? These are all difficultquestions.My belief is that outside intervention only goes sofar. I do not believe that massive injections of aid arethe right answer to failing States. For one thing  donorsare reluctant to poor money down a black hole. Butmore importantly: the solution should not come fromthe outside  but rather from the inside. Even in thepoorest country we will find well-educated citizens justas committed to building better lives for their childrenas in the rest of the world. They need a helping hand inbuilding good governance and a viable civil society.Yet  ownership is paramount. Failing States  too  havethe capacity to fix themselves. Indeed  only if they fixthemselves will they no longer fail. Our role should beto help galvanize and to enable those capacities.Lesson number three: the United Nations shouldbe doing the right things. As of today the NorthernAlliance has entered the city of Kabul. That fact makesit even more imperative that we speak aboutAfghanistan in the United Nations.Consensus is growing that in post-TalibanAfghanistan  the United Nations should play a centralrole. I certainly support that view. But a central role inwhat? For make no mistake: once the bombing stops the difficulties are still overwhelming. The country isnot only rugged and ruined  but also the size of CentralEurope and packed with landmines. Factional fightingis bound to continue. The United Nations can do a lot but we need to beware of sending the United Nationson an impossible mission. Instead of calling on theUnited Nations for functions where it is weak  let uscall on the United Nations for functions where it isstrong.For example  take governance  a major worry tous all. Much as we seek to avoid it  a political vacuumis a realistic prospect  given that tribal conflict inAfghanistan is as old as the country’s history. Afghansare a proud people. Hostility towards outsideintervention is strong. The country needs to begoverned from within. We may be looking both for abroad-based interim Government and for a stablepermanent structure. Without rushing to elections  weneed to be satisfied that such a political settlement issupported by the population. In the process  the UnitedNations might play a central role as a catalyst and as anadviser  but not as a governor. Afghanistan is not EastTimor. It is important  too  that any settlement besupported by the neighbouring States and by a SecurityCouncil resolution.As regards security: in the absence of a functionalnational army  transitional military arrangements areessential. They are essential to create a secureenvironment enabling reconstruction to begin andrefugees to return home. Choosing the right format iscritical. A conventional United Nations peacekeepingoperation may not be a good idea — certainly not forthe country as a whole. Supplying peacekeepers is stillvoluntary. Realistically  the troop levels needed for acountry this size would almost certainly not beattained. Bosnia has taught us the hard lesson of theprice we pay when we send in a United Nations forcethat is below par. We should be careful to avoid anotherSomalia. Different formats for security arrangementsare possible  and we should reflect on them as a whole.In a previous context  Ambassador Brahimi has offeredus a wide spectrum of lessons learned about UnitedNations peacekeeping. We should take them to heart.Now  as the Special Representative  he deserves all thesupport he needs from us.Concerning mine clearance: Afghanistan hasmore landmines than any other country in the world.The country cannot possibly get back on its feet as longas those mines are there. We have to get rid of them and the United Nations can help us to do that. We mustpay the bills.As to reconstruction: we should capitalize onwhere the United Nations is uniquely positioned eitherto deploy operations in the field or to coordinate thoseof others. Let us not limit our view to the part of the16United Nations here in New York  but rather broaden itto the entire United Nations system  including theDumbarton Oaks and Bretton Woods institutions. Weneed to bring the full weight of that system to bear onthe future of Afghanistan. I am speaking of the WorldHealth Organization and the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees  of the Foodand Agriculture Organization of the United Nationsand the United Nations Drug Control Programme  ofthe International Labour Organization and the WorldFood Programme  of the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme and the World Bank. There is no need toset up a whole new mechanism. The AfghanistanSupport Group is fully entrenched  and we should useit.Especially now  caught in the crossfire  theAfghan people are not to be envied. Their plight willnot be over once the guns are silent. Food stocks health care  housing  utilities  schooling  agriculture —the list of concerns is a long one. But all of us need topush that agenda. We may not be part of the problem ofAfghanistan  but we must be part of the solution.Yet again  reconstruction cannot be imposed upona nation. Here  too  a sustainable recovery needs tocome from within. All the men  and especially thewomen of Afghanistan  must once again become themakers of their own fate and future. The answer lieswith them.The United Nations is not merely “an ineffectiveacronym”  as a misguided message on the Internetwould have you believe. For global issues  multilateralcooperation is the only answer. Multilateralism issolidarity worked into a plan. As I said  the reaction bythe United Nations system in the aftermath of 11September has been prompt and responsible. In orderto maintain that level of performance  we  the MemberStates  will have to show the stamina  support andcommitment to make it happen. Our track record is notimpeccable. The United Nations can go no faster thanwe will let it  which means we have to make it work.This also means we have to provide it with all theresources  and the political will  to give it the push andpunch we need."
"127",5247,"NOR",56,2001,"﻿First  I would like tocongratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of thepresidency of the General Assembly.For more than half a century  the United Nationshas helped to settle conflicts and restore peace. Wemust reinforce these efforts and focus our work.For more than half a century  the United Nationshas worked to promote human rights and economic andsocial development. We must continue to invest inhuman dignity.For more than half a century  the United Nationshas given millions of people hope for a better future.Such hope has never been more important than it istoday.The Nobel Peace Prize could not have beenawarded to more deserving candidates than Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the United Nations. Let meonce again extend my heartfelt congratulations.15The terrorist attacks on 11 September were notonly directed at innocent people. They were directed atthe very values on which the United Nations is based.We stand united in our condemnation of theseattacks  in our call for international cooperation toprevent and eradicate terrorism and to bring the guiltyto justice. We will fight terrorism by all appropriatemeans: political  diplomatic  legal  financial andmilitary.Norway pledges its full support to the broadglobal coalition against terrorism. We are part of theAtlantic Alliance. We fully support the United States indefending itself against international terrorism. We areimplementing the provisions of Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001) by taking concrete steps to dryup the financial resources of terrorist networks.The Taliban regime has refused to adhere tomandatory Security Council decisions. It is harbouringand supporting terrorists  in blunt contravention ofCouncil resolutions. The Taliban are refusing tocooperate with the international community in ourcommon efforts to eradicate international terrorism.The use of military force is therefore the only optionleft.The military operations in Afghanistan are aimedat the terrorists and those who harbour them. They arenot aimed at innocent civilians or at Afghanistan as acountry. They are aimed at a group of extremists whoare exploiting a world religion for their own evilpurposes.Afghanistan has suffered misrule and war fordecades. While the immediate task is to end terrorismand provide humanitarian support to those in need  wemust work in parallel for a political solution. This isprimarily the responsibility of the Afghan peoplethemselves  but the international community mustassist. The United Nations must have a leading role.Planning and preparations must start now. We stronglysupport the efforts of the Secretary-General’s SpecialRepresentative for Afghanistan  Lakhdar Brahimi  tohelp lay the foundation for a broad-based and lastingpolitical solution.We must ensure that the Afghans receivehumanitarian assistance both inside Afghanistan and inneighbouring countries. But while seeking to meetimmediate needs  we must also focus on the longer-term assistance that will be necessary to rebuild thiswar-torn society. We must improve respect for humanrights and help the Afghan people  in particularwomen  who have suffered so terribly under Talibanrule. These are issues that Norway will focus on duringits chairmanship of the Afghanistan Support Groupnext year. Only through coordinated efforts can wecontribute to security and development in Afghanistan.A year ago  peace between the Israelis and thePalestinians appeared to be at hand. Today  the hope forpeace and security has given way to disillusion  despairand the murder of civilians.We are convinced that the only way out of thecurrent stalemate is through the full implementation ofthe recommendations in the Mitchell report  whichhave been endorsed by both parties and by theinternational community.First of all  there must be an immediate end to theviolence. Terrorism must be stopped. The cycle ofviolent action and reaction must be broken. Politicalleaders on both sides must do everything in their powerto halt the violence and reduce the tension.Secondly  confidence-building measures must beimplemented simultaneously. Trust must be rebuilt stepby step  since without it there can be no real dialogueor negotiation. The Mitchell report lists several stepsfor restoring trust. Given the high level of hostility andmistrust  the timing and sequence of these steps arecrucial. Decisions must be made now.Thirdly  the parties must find a way back to thenegotiating table. A halt to the violence  the resumptionof security cooperation and steps to restore trust cannotbe sustained for long without serious negotiations toresolve the underlying causes of the conflict.Norway will continue to support efforts to bringabout a peaceful resolution of the conflict. As Chair ofthe Ad Hoc Liaison Committee  we stand ready towork with other donors to help restore the economicand social infrastructure in the Palestinian areas.The bulk of the conflicts dealt with by theSecurity Council are found on the African continent.As a member of the Security Council  Norway isdetermined to do what it can to promote long-termpeace and stability in Africa. Most of the conflicts inAfrica clearly demonstrate the close links betweenpeace  good governance and development. The rootcauses of many of these conflicts are poverty and lack16of development  but also violations of human rightsand disrespect for basic democratic principles.Norway stands ready to assist in building a soundfoundation for good governance and development inAfrica. The developments in Burundi are encouraging although we recognize that the peace process is stillvery fragile. The deployment of a multinationalsecurity force  on the initiative of South Africa  will hopefully  improve the situation in Burundi. Norway isready to support this initiative.The United Nations is our foremost tool forsolving global problems. We should recall thatcombating terrorism has not removed any of thechallenges that were on the global agenda prior to11 September. Nor has it become less pressing toeffectively address these challenges. We must not letthe cruelty of terrorists divert attention from theambitious goals we set for ourselves during theMillennium Summit.Meeting those objectives must remain right at thetop of our agenda  along with our common fight againstterrorism. If the United Nations is to be effective inpursuing these tasks  we must all commit ourselves andprovide the necessary resources and financial support.As political leaders  we must show steadfastdetermination. We will have to make difficult choicesand hard decisions  sometimes with painfulconsequences. But the alternative is even more painand suffering.This is true in our common fight againstinternational terrorism. This is true in our struggle toend poverty  eliminate infectious diseases and upholdrespect for human rights and the rule of law. This istrue if we are to make the United Nations our primarytool for safeguarding our common security."
"128",5293,"NPL",56,2001,"﻿At the outset  I wish toexpress  on behalf of His Majesty’s Government andthe people of Nepal  and on my own behalf  ourprofound condolences to the Government and thepeople of the United States  as well as to the familieswho lost their loved ones in the unfortunate crash ofAmerican Airlines flight 587 on 12 November.Let me congratulate you  Mr. President  on yourwell-deserved election to steer the fifty-sixth session ofthe General Assembly. My felicitations also go to theother members of the Bureau.I also congratulate the Secretary-General on hiselection to a second term and on being awarded thisyear’s Nobel Peace Prize  together with the UnitedNations.We are meeting against the backdrop of the 11September terrorist attacks that took innumerable livesand caused colossal damage in our host country andhost city. The Nepalese people express their fullsolidarity with the American people in this hour ofgrief and support the American-led war on terror.The horror’s powerful ripples have been feltbeyond the borders of the United States  around theworld. They have pushed the already slumping globaleconomy into a recession that is sure to unleash miseryand starvation on millions of people and kill thousandsof children in the developing world.In the wake of the terrorist onslaught  the UnitedNations was quick to act. It approved fresh measures including Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) calling on Member States to stem the terrorists’channels of communication  freeze their finances  denythem refuge and support  strengthen domestic andinternational law against them and collectively take allnecessary measures to prevent and defeat them.A broad coalition of States united around acommon goal has launched a global campaign againstterrorism. Itself being a victim of terrorist activities which have taken nearly 1 800 lives over the past fiveyears and have grossly undermined developmentefforts  Nepal fully understands the challenges and costof defeating this elusive enemy that has no borders  noterritory and no standing army. Yet with collectiveresolve and determination and with preventive andcurative actions we can sniff out the forces ofterrorism  if we only refrain from political expediencyand moral relativism.Enforcing all the existing relevant conventionsand resolutions is as crucial as the early conclusion of a7comprehensive convention on terrorism in order toachieve the objective.The twenty-first century begins with a new anduncertain security environment. No sooner had we putthe wars  and the cold war  of the last century behind usand had begun to grapple with internal conflicts thanterrorism emerged as a grave threat to internationalpeace and security. It should be tackled decisively andwithout delay.As we engage in the war on terrorism  we mustnot forget that the edifice of durable peace can beerected only on the fundamental pillars of theprevention of conflicts  the peaceful resolution ofdisputes  persistent efforts for disarmament  povertyreduction and development  and respect for diversity fairness and justice. The culture of peace and dialogueshould advance the process.We now live in a global village where all areinterdependent. A fire in one house may consume theentire village if left unchecked. That is why concertedefforts to secure peace and stability are critical in thetroubled nations of Africa  Asia  Europe and elsewherethat have suffered wanton instability and violence thatare pernicious for their national integrity  socialharmony and economic progress.In particular  we will have to end the cycle ofviolence and death in the Middle East by finding adurable solution to its festering problem. The war onterror and the restoration of stability will succeed inAfghanistan if its people are saved from starvation andunwarranted hardship now and assured of theircountry’s reconstruction when the struggle is over.Criminal acts such as those involving the presentanthrax scare in the United States and the use of saringas in the Tokyo subway a few years back are strongtestimony to the necessity of abolishing biological andchemical weapons before an appalling catastrophebefalls us. More importantly  the proliferation ofnuclear weapons and the increasing likelihood of theiruse by terrorists  viewed in the context of thesuccessful 2000 Review Conference of the Parties tothe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons  constitute compelling reasons to follow thepath of complete and general nuclear disarmament.The inability of the Conference on Disarmamentto agree on its programme of work for the past severalyears raises serious doubts about our commitment todisarmament. That forum should be activated withoutdelay and should be tasked with negotiating newdisarmament treaties  including one on nucleardisarmament  and to strengthen the existing ones.In order for United Nations peace efforts tobecome instrumental in promoting global peace  Nepalhas lent them moral backing  has contributed nearly40 000 troops and has sustained 42 casualties in theline of duty. Nepal is willing to work for theimprovement of peacekeeping operations  taking intoaccount both the Brahimi Panel report and ourcollective experience.While we are preoccupied with the immediatesteps against terrorists  we must not overlook orabandon other equally pressing issues central todurable peace  such as the need to remove poverty create jobs and provide education  drinking water health and other basic services in poor countries. Thereason is simple: terrorists and anarchists often exploitthe vulnerabilities of the impoverished  theunemployed  the excluded and the disaffected to carryout their sinister designs.Of course  poor countries have no choice but toundertake painful reforms to improve their governanceand performance. Decreasing assistance to the poor inthe face of increasing prosperity in the rich countriesdefies our understanding. Therefore  it is equallyurgent and essential that they receive increased supportfrom their development partners.For example  rich countries need to reverse thedecline in development assistance and meet the aidtargets  fully fund and expand the Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries (HIPC) Initiative to cover all leastdeveloped and worst affected countries and facilitateinvestment in the South. Their trade barriers ought tobe dismantled and markets opened to spur exports andhelp to broaden the production capacities of developingcountries.As the advanced nations seek to hammer out astimulus package to extricate their economies from thedark shadow of the present economic downturn  theymust also be mindful of the much greater needs ofpoorer nations at this time of economic hardship.Undoubtedly  all developing countries faceserious obstacles to their development journey. Butlandlocked developing countries suffer from the8additional impediments of remoteness  transit-transportdifficulties and lack of access to sea-based resources.However  nowhere are the trauma of deprivationand dispossession and problems of development morestaggering than in the least developed countries virtually all of which are in Africa and Asia.Globalization has further marginalized them  and theinformation revolution has hardly touched them. TheUnited Nations special programmes of the past twodecades have apparently been inadequate and unable tomake a difference  as many of these countries havebecome increasingly worse off over the last decade.Nepal is committed to vigorously implementingthe outcome of the Third United Nations Conferenceon the Least Developed Countries. We sincerely hopethat our development partners will leave no stoneunturned in carrying out their commitments  includingthe European Union’s “everything but arms” scheme.Conflicts and chaos  and deprivation and disasterscontinue to spawn humanitarian problems and to createsituations in which human rights are compromised.Today there are 22 million refugees  including 100 000in Nepal  and many more internally displaced personsaround the globe. Responding to such exigencies isnaturally a priority  as is the war on terror  but we mustbear in mind that humanitarian assistance cannotprevent the recurrence of crises until people areempowered and their vulnerabilities addressed.I should like to take this occasion to thank theinternational community for its support in themaintenance of refugees in Nepal. We urge it tocontinue its assistance until the problem is resolved leading to their repatriation. To this end  we areengaged in dialogue with the Government of theKingdom of Bhutan.The need has never been so urgent to protectrefugees  maintain ecological balance  preserve theenvironment  promote sustainable development andensure that this planet remains at least as liveable forour children as it has been for us. The strengthening ofexisting global treaties on the environment  andparticularly the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol  isurgently required.Nepal  a least developed and landlocked nation has accorded its topmost priority to poverty reduction spending more than 70 per cent of its budget in ruralareas where the poorest people live  and has adopted amarket-led development policy with a two-prongedstrategy.Policies and measures have been instituted toattract foreign investment and to harness people’screative potential by means of economic liberalization investment incentives  decentralization and therationalization of public spending priorities. Of late  wehave taken steps towards land reform  theempowerment of women through education inheritance rights and political participation  togetherwith special developmental programmes to assist weakand vulnerable people and regions.Yet progress has been slow in coming  with theattendant serious consequences. Nepal’s per capitagross national product of $220 is one of the lowest inthe world; 38 per cent of the population lives below thepoverty line; and the ratio of the Government’s foreigndebt stock to government revenue is 410 per cent  andto annual exports  350 per cent. These statistics areincredibly disheartening  even among the leastdeveloped countries.Despite this  Nepal is left out of the HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. I thereforeurge the donor community to include Nepal in theInitiative to help release our resources from debt-servicing obligations  which will enable us toimplement poverty-reduction programmes moreeffectively. But this will in no way substitute for theneed for increased development assistance.The United Nations has an elemental role to playin meeting all these challenges. To prepare it to addressthem  Nepal believes that we should revitalize theGeneral Assembly and the Economic and SocialCouncil and augment cooperation and coordinationamong the various United Nations organs. Likewise we deem it imperative to enlarge the Security Counciland to improve its methods of work  including throughthe deepening of its cooperation with troop-contributing countries.Veto power militates against the basic tenets ofequality and democracy; it reflects the realities of abygone era. Nepal is convinced of the necessity to doaway with the veto and understands the profounddifficulty of achieving this goal. Until it has beeneliminated  this power ought to be rationalized bydefining the parameters for its application.9The Millennium Declaration has given us a visionof and benchmarks for a peaceful  decent  just andviable global society  and it has indicated how theUnited Nations could be instrumental in achievingthem. It is our collective obligation to implement them sharing the burdens and benefits equally. Nepalwelcomes the road map for the implementation of theDeclaration.The implementation review of various globalcompacts has unmistakably established a shortage offinancial resources as the principal reason for lack ofprogress. Nepal hopes that the World Summit onSustainable Development and the InternationalConference on Financing for Development  to be heldnext year  will do their best to chalk out a blueprint forfinancing developmental activities  which is theforemost concern of the developing world.As regional cooperation is an effective vehicle forbroadening markets and production as well as forbuilding collective competitiveness  Nepal and otherSouth Asian countries have been working togetherunder the umbrella of the South Asian Association forRegional Cooperation (SAARC). I am happy to informthe Assembly that Nepal will have the privilege ofhosting its next summit in January 2002  following itspostponement two years ago.Again  in the spirit of regional solidarity and ofits abiding commitment to peace and disarmament Nepal looks forward to the early relocation of theRegional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asiaand the Pacific to Kathmandu  where it belongs. Wehave  on our part  completed all necessary preparationsfor the effective functioning of the Centre from Nepal.Democracy  development and human rights areintegral to society’s advancement. Therefore  Nepal isengaged in promoting democracy and freedom  andhuman rights and justice for all  particularly women children and vulnerable groups. We cherish thesevalues  which are crucial to preserving human dignityand to bestowing on human beings the opportunity toreach their full potential.In the aftermath of the agonizing royal massacrein Nepal early this year  our people’s faith indemocracy has been further reinforced  as it ensured asmooth succession and stability in the face of a terriblecrisis. I thank all our friends for their solidarity andsupport at a time of national tragedy in Nepal.We have witnessed unprecedented unity amongnations in fighting major wars in the past  andterrorism at present. If we show the same kind ofresolve and dedication  we can successfully fightpoverty  deprivation and discrimination. The UnitedNations should brace itself to face them effectively  andMember States should assume a greater sense ofresponsibility. Nepal  committed as it is to theprinciples and purposes of the United Nations  willcontinue to do its best to help it achieve its goals and tomake a difference in our people’s lives."
"129",5310,"NRU",56,2001,"﻿I bid the Assembly welcomefrom the people of Nauru  the pleasant little island ofthe Pacific. Let me avail myself of the opportunity toextend to you  Sir  my Government’s belatedcongratulations on your assumption of the presidencyof the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.Much of the work of the United Nations since thedespicable attacks on the United States of America on11 September has been focused on counter-terrorism and this is understandable. The Security Council’sadoption of resolution 1373 (2001)  obligatingMembers to implement anti-terrorist measures  shouldrecognize the importance of supporting existingregional initiatives in the fight against terrorism. Tothis end  we welcome the undertakings by the SecurityCouncil Committee on Counter-Terrorism.The World Bank has predicted that the events of11 September will exacerbate the already gloomyglobal economic outlook. Its ripples will be felt acrossall of the world’s regions  particularly in countriesdependent on tourism  remittances and foreigninvestment. It is thus critical that the Security Councilallow the competent bodies of the United Nations toassess the costs of extending  expanding or adding newpeacekeeping operations before their implementation.Nauru joins the international community inoffering our belated but heartfelt congratulations toMr. Kofi Annan and the Organization on being the jointrecipients of this year’s prestigious Nobel Peace Prize.The former President of the General Assembly Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland  has to be commended forcapitalizing on the momentum generated by theMillennium Declaration.My delegation is pleased to endorse yourproposed agenda  Mr. President  for the fifty-sixthsession. The work of the General Assembly should berelevant to the tasks at hand  but at the same time itshould address long-standing issues affecting theefficiency and status of this body. Meaningfulcooperation between Member States must always beencouraged across the boundaries of religion  ethnicity2and culture. The recent World Conference againstRacism is a stark reminder of how the work of theUnited Nations will otherwise continue to befrustrated; but the one significant area where theUnited Nations has made little or no progress is on thequestion of the reform of the Security Council. Wewould therefore support a proposal to move the processto a higher level and to deal with the complex issues ina step-by-step fashion.The last meeting of the Pacific Islands Forumleaders was held in my country a few months ago. Thecommuniqué of that meeting has been circulated as adocument of the United Nations. In that communiquéthe Forum leaders sought to formalize cooperationarrangements between the United Nations and thePacific Islands Forum. I would like to take thisopportunity to kindly request your support of therelevant draft resolution.The issues of climate change and sea-level risecontinue to be of major concern to my country  and wehave repeatedly voiced our deep concern about theadverse impact of human-induced climate change especially on the low-lying atolls around the Pacific.We have stressed the importance of efforts to buildappropriate human and institutional capacity.The Kyoto Protocol represents a significant stepforward on the path to taking action to combat climatechange  but unless significant action is taken on apractical compliance regime  there is little prospect ofany outcome being enforceable.Nauru therefore looks forward to participatingwith the rest of the world in Johannesburg next year toreview the progress made since Rio  and it is ourfervent hope that the Kyoto Protocol will have comeinto force by then.There is a special urgency for Nauru. Economicgrowth in our small country has been negative for morethan a decade  and  as reflected in recent revisions ofour classification by the United Nations and the UnitedNations Development Programme  our per capitaincome has fallen by almost 80 per cent since the1980s. We look to the international community  theUnited Nations and its various agencies to assist usthrough these difficult times and to help secure a safefuture for our children.Our region  the world’s very first nuclear-freezone  has a long history of supporting disarmament andnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons  born of theregion’s harsh experience with nuclear testing bycolonial Powers. The Pacific Islands Forum leadershave again expressed their desire for the entry intoforce of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.Nauru will be depositing its instrument of ratificationtoday  and I call on other States to follow suit.The trans-shipment of radioactive material andMOX fuel  through our exclusive economic zones is acontinuing concern  but we are committed to pursuingour concerns constructively and vigorously at theappropriate political level.Nauru’s commitment to the international effort tocombat money-laundering is unwavering. OurParliament passed anti-money-laundering legislation inAugust of this year to correct the deficiencies in ourregulatory and administrative arrangements. However Nauru is disappointed not to have graduated from thelist of special non-cooperating countries despite thefact that the legislation was drafted in closecollaboration with Financial Action Task Force onMoney Laundering (FATF) regional representatives.We will nonetheless continue to work on satisfying thekey players in FATF on this issue  and we look forwardto working with our regional partners under the Pacificregional action plan being developed.Nauru  along with 20 other Member States  againsupported the inclusion of a resolution on theadmission of the Republic of China on Taiwan on theagenda of the fifty-sixth session. While the attemptfailed  Nauru will not be discouraged from continuingits efforts to correct this anomaly. We on Nauruwholeheartedly believe that the Republic of China onTaiwan has a part to play in this Organization  and itspeople should not be denied a voice in this world body.We note with pleasure the recent admission of theRepublic of China on Taiwan to the World TradeOrganization.Finally  I wish to end my statement by revisitingthe issue of security and terrorism. It is indeed sad thatas we meet here today  there is a war going on in theworld - a war against terrorism. Prior to the horrific 11September attacks on the United States of America  myGovernment  at the request of the Government ofAustralia  agreed to the use of Nauru as a refugee-processing centre. We made this decision onhumanitarian grounds. As a consequence  we now haveon Nauru nearly 800 asylum seekers from Afghanistan 3Iraq and Palestine — 10 per cent of the wholepopulation of Nauru — along with migration personnelfrom the United Nations  the International Organizationfor Migration and Australia. The asylum seekers arenow being processed.I have taken it upon myself to personally visit thecamps from time to time and to mingle with theseunfortunate people  and on several occasions have satdown and broken bread with them. I found that they arelike you and me. They are brave human beings seekinga better life for themselves and their children andescape from the oppression back home.The resources of the United Nations need to beaugmented to cope with this humanitarian tragedy  andthe international community needs to urgently tacklethe problem in a coordinated manner  not only in termsof providing assistance and refuge where possible but also in terms of addressing the sources and causesof refugees  people- smuggling and terrorism.Understanding and responding will not necessarilysolve the problem  but it will make it easier forGovernments to share in the continuing internationaleffort that will be needed.Finally  may I say that the good old days  before11 September  are gone forever  and I shed a tear. Thesad part is that we inherited a world that was goodfrom our forefathers. Today  I ask  do we leavetomorrow a better world for our children and ourchildren’s children? That I ask. Mr. President  we lookto you for leadership on these vital issues.Thank you. May God bless those in sorrow. MayGod bless the United States of America. And may Godbless the United Nations."
"130",5357,"NZL",56,2001,"﻿May I first express mycondolences to the families and friends of those whodied in this morning's air crash. This was a tragedy in acity that has already seen more than its share of tragedyin recent times.We meet in New York at this session of theGeneral Assembly under the shadow of terrorist attackson this city just two months ago. We mourn the lives ofnearly 5 000 people from 79 countries who  havingdone nothing to deserve that fate  died in the attack.The scale  premeditation  coordination and indifferenceto mass murder that characterize this attack represent anew age of terrorism. It is a terrorism that appears toset no limit to its consequences. Those responsible forit foreshadow a willingness to use biological  chemicaland nuclear weapons of mass destruction. Thepotentially catastrophic effects if they are able to carryout that threat demand an urgent and comprehensiveresponse to pre-empt any such action.We cannot allow the rule of terror to replace therule of law. We cannot tolerate the damage thatterrorism has already done to the global economy. Wecannot allow terror to threaten basic human rights tolife and security.New Zealand welcomes the lead by the UnitedNations in coordinating an effective and enduringresponse to terrorism. Security Council resolution 1373(2001)  adopted unanimously  sets out a blueprint foraction which every Member State has an obligation toimplement. Its emphasis is on measures to close offfinancial support and the provision of refuge forterrorist groups in every country of the world.International cooperation in imposing these measuresand bringing the terrorists to justice will  in the longerterm  lie at the heart of the campaign to defeatterrorism.Removing the immediate threat posed byterrorists such as those in Al Qaeda and those whoharbour them will  however  require more thanresolutions. Time and again over the past three years the Security Council has called on the Taliban toprevent the use of Afghanistan by terrorists to launchstrikes against other countries. Those resolutions andthe sanctions that accompanied them have been ignoredby the Taliban. Where groups operate beyond the ruleof law and countries put themselves outside ofinternational codes of behaviour  the use of forcebecomes a necessary part of our response.Multilateral action and cooperation on a widerfront are also necessary if we are to be successful inremoving the threat of terrorism on an ongoing andlasting basis. Comprehensive action is needed tominimize the threat of chemical  biological or nuclearweapons falling into the hands of extremist groups. NoState should develop  test and hold weapons of thisnature. Such weapons are a threat to humanity. Theiruse by States would destroy and otherwise harminnocent human beings as certainly as did the actionsof the terrorist group that attacked New York.Nations yet to sign and ratify the United NationsConventions on Chemical and Biological Weapons andtreaties to ban mines and inhumane weapons must doso. Nations must equally commit themselves to theelimination of nuclear weapons  the early entry intoforce of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and an immediate start to negotiations on a fissilematerial cut-off treaty.The attack of 11 September should alsoencourage all nations to ratify the Rome Statute tobring into effect the International Criminal Court as aforum for pursuing action against those responsible forcrimes against humanity.Suppression of terrorism must also involve actionto deal with its causes. States must consider whetherthe suppression of dissident or minority groups ratherthan allowing legitimate channels to voice dissentleaves resort to force as the only option.The events of 11 September should encourage allcountries and organizations  particularly those directlyinvolved  to renew efforts to find a just and peacefulsolution to the Middle East crisis. To achieve apeaceful solution between Palestinians and Israelisrequires good will and flexibility on both sides. Therecan be no double standards in how the principles of15human rights  freedom and social and economicopportunity are applied to all peoples.One consequence of the campaign againstterrorism has been to bring the world's attention to thesituation in Afghanistan. Afghanistan reminds us thatwhere a vacuum is created by the absence of legitimategovernment and the rule of law  it will be filled byextremist elements  criminal groups dealing in drugtrafficking and terrorist organizations  all of which canoperate with impunity.The international community has for too longbeen indifferent to the situation in Afghanistan and tothe long-standing refugee crisis that has resulted from22 years of war  from famine and from Talibanoppression. Pakistan and Iran have carried the burdenof 3.6 million refugees  while much of the worldshowed concern only when a handful of those refugeesin desperation sought to enter other countries illegally.Too little concern has been shown internationally to the300 000 Afghan children who have died annually frompreventable causes. One in three children in refugeecamps die before they reach the age of five. The groupsnow protesting against military intervention were silentwhile this human catastrophe was unfolding over thelast few years.Any loss of innocent life in conflict is tragic  andextraordinary measures must be taken to avoid it. But afailure to remove the Taliban regime and a failure toassist the Afghan people to put in place a broad-based moderate and stable Government to replace the Talibanwill mean the ongoing loss of hundreds of thousands oflives and the continued suffering of the Afghan people.Renewed efforts are needed through UnitedNations agencies to provide emergency relief to peoplewithin Afghanistan and in the refugee camps to avoidunnecessary loss of life through the winter and in themonths to come. The United Nations must stand readyto assist Afghanistan to rebuild itself once the conflictis over  working with as broad a coalition of Afghangroups as is possible to create a viable political economic and social infrastructure.Resolving the problems that have forced so manymillions of people from their homes is fundamental tosolving the growing refugee crisis. In Afghanistan andelsewhere  people flee their homelands through fear ofdeath or persecution  or because of poverty and lack ofopportunity.In a world made smaller by advances incommunication and transport  no State can ignore theplight in other countries or expect not to faceconsequences from unacceptable discrepancies inwealth  opportunity and human rights standards.Suppression of criminal organizations responsiblefor people trafficking is a challenge which demandsincreased international cooperation. Those who profitfrom people's desperation and who  once paid  arecareless as to whether or not their human cargosurvives must be stamped out. However  removing thecauses of people fleeing from their countries remainsfundamental.New Zealand's own region of the Pacific has notbeen immune from violence and instability. In recentyears  we have seen conflict in East Timor  violencebetween Government and separatist movements withinIndonesia and in Bougainville  ethnic conflict in theSolomon Islands and a coup that overthrew a legitimateGovernment in Fiji.Problems remain in the region  but there havebeen notable areas of improvement. A peace settlementhas been signed in Bougainville. Fiji has helddemocratic elections. Indonesia is seeking to resolveseparatist conflict by offering greater autonomy. InEast Timor  there have been free elections  and thatcountry will gain independence as the first new nationof the twenty-first century in May 2002. Internationalcooperation and a capable transitional administrationby the United Nations have achieved a remarkabletransformation in a poor and devastated country. Icongratulate the Security Council on its endorsement ofthe Secretary-General's concept for a post-independence United Nations presence in East Timor toconsolidate what has been achieved.In acknowledging the role of United Nationspersonnel  I would also stress the need to ensure theirproper protection in situations which are oftendangerous. The murder of United Nations reliefworkers in Atambua  West Timor  and the failure tobring to account those fully responsible are a reminderthat more must be done to protect our United Nationspersonnel. We endorse the Secretary-General'srecommendations on extending the legal protection forUnited Nations and other personnel involved inhumanitarian operations.It is timely at this General Assembly to stress theimportance of the role of the United Nations. The16critical wars of the twenty-first century will not be wonby single nations  however powerful  or even bycoalitions. It is the United Nations acting collectivelywhich will win the wars against terrorism  poverty anddisease; threats to the environment; and the threatsposed by conflict and weapons of mass destruction.The commitments made by heads of State andGovernment in the United Nations MillenniumDeclaration last year take on even greater relevancefollowing the events of 11 September.However  for the United Nations to achieve itspotential  it must undergo reform. To prevent theGeneral Assembly and the Secretariat from becomingoverwhelmed by so many tasks that they fail to beeffective in tackling any of them  we need to prioritizeour agenda and to be more selective.The Security Council needs reform. Itsmembership should be expanded to reflectcontemporary realities  but without maintaining orextending the veto. Countries contributing topeacekeeping operations should be afforded greaterinvolvement in the Council's decision-making withrespect to those operations. Peacekeeping operationsmust be sufficiently resourced.The capacity of the United Nations for rapidreaction must be strengthened. New Zealand is ready toenter into discussions on a memorandum ofunderstanding with the United Nations on itsparticipation in the standby arrangements system. Thisis consistent with New Zealand's long-standingreadiness to contribute to peacekeeping operations andits current involvement in more than 12 suchoperations  including its commitment since 1999 of abattalion to help ensure the success of the UnitedNations operation in East Timor.The United Nations was founded after the SecondWorld War to build a world free from poverty  violenceand the violation of human rights. Nations committedthemselves to a collective response to problems thatcould not be solved by countries individually.Countries agreed on rules of international behaviour.No one would claim that the United Nations hasan unblemished record of success. But without it  theworld would be a much less secure place  much lessable to confront the difficulties which we face. Let thisfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly reaffirmour commitment to work collectively to defeatterrorism  conflict  poverty and disease  and set theagenda for peace  development and respect for humanrights for all."
"131",5402,"OMN",56,2001,"﻿I wishto express my sincere congratulations to Mr. HanSeung-soo on his assumption of the presidency of thefifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We areconfident that his skills  competence and experience ininternational affairs will facilitate his task of leadingand enriching the work of this session and of bringingit to a successful conclusion with the desired results.We assure him of our delegation’s cooperation in theattainment of our shared objectives. We also want toexpress our sincerest thanks and appreciation to hispredecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri  former Prime Ministerof the friendly country of the Republic of Finland. Wethank him for his efforts in directing the work of thelast session and the various special sessions that tookplace during his term.35I want to take this opportunity to reiterate mysincerest congratulations to the Secretary-General  Mr.Kofi Annan  and to the United Nations itself on beingawarded the Nobel Peace Prize. This is a well-deservedaward and a mark of distinction for the contributionsand the remarkable role played by the Secretary-General and the United Nations in the maintenance andthe strengthening of international peace and security.On behalf of my delegation  I also want toexpress my sincere congratulations to the Secretary-General on being granted a second term of office at thehead of the Organization. We intend to cooperate withhim in the attainment of our objectives  in thefulfilment of the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations Charter and in the preparation anddevelopment of mechanisms for internationalcooperation in all fields.The terrible events of 11 September that struckthis city  which is host to our Organization  have beenforcefully condemned by my Government. This cityhas attracted people from all over the world to adialogue among civilizations through our internationalOrganization  and it therefore deserves to be a city ofpeace  not of terror and violence. We therefore take thisopportunity to express once again our sincerestcondolences to the families of the victims and to thefriendly American people  whose sorrow we share. Theworld was horrified by this dangerous turn of events —the terrorist acts that struck such vital sites in NewYork and Washington  taking many lives and leavinggreat destruction in their wake.While expressing our solidarity with the friendlycountry of the United States of America in its struggleagainst terrorism and in the defence of its territory andits people  and while we understand the reasons for themilitary action being taken in Afghanistan  it is ourfervent hope that every effort will be made to spareinnocent civilians the destruction and disasters of warso that they will not suffer further tragedies. For itspart  the international community must play its role inprotecting the Afghan people.We must not forget the peaceful means of dealingwith terrorism. Every sincere effort must be made toeliminate the scourge of terrorism  which will destroycivilization and all the achievements of humankind if itis not firmly confronted and if its causes are notexamined and uprooted. We stress that the use ofmilitary force is not the best or the only solution foreliminating terrorist groups. We appeal for a long-termvision to prevail so that all elements of the problem canbe dealt with. In this respect  we reiterate ourwelcoming of the Egyptian proposal for aninternational conference on the fight against terrorismin order to arrive at an effective  binding internationalinstrument for States.In the midst of this tragedy  we have heard certainopportunistic political circles in States and at theinternational level linking terrorism to Islam andMuslims. We fully and categorically reject this. Islamis a religion of mercy for all  a religion based onfraternity and tolerance. Muslims are the bearers of acivilization  a culture and noble human andhumanitarian values. This is why the Organization ofthe Islamic Conference  at its extraordinary sessionheld in Doha  Qatar  last October  totally dissociateditself from all terrorism and reiterated its condemnationof terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Thesession’s final communiqué reported in paragraph 3that the Conference“stressed that such shameful terror acts areopposed to the tolerant  divine message of Islamwhich spurns aggression  calls for peace coexistence  tolerance and respect among people highly prizes the dignity of human life andprohibits killing of the innocent. It furtherrejected any attempts alleging the existence ofany connection or relation between the Islamicfaith and the terrorist acts as such attempts arenot in the interest of the multilateral efforts tocombat terrorism and further damage relationsamong peoples of the world. It stressed as wellthe need to undertake a joint effort to promotedialogue and create links or contacts between theIslamic world and the West in order to reachmutual understanding and build bridges ofconfidence between the two civilizations.”In this respect  my delegation wishes toemphasize its categorical rejection of the calls of allthose who would like to use this human disaster tosettle old scores and old political differences and toexpand the field of military action to other areas underthe pretext of fighting terrorism.We are concerned about the humanitariansituation of the friendly Afghan people. Internationalhumanitarian organizations report that the militaryaction taking place in Afghanistan has caused hundreds36of civilian casualties  that hundreds of thousands havebeen displaced and that the civilian population isexperiencing severe living conditions. Humanitarianorganizations have warned that a humanitarian disastercould be imminent for the Afghan people  especiallywith the approach of winter. My country supportsinternational efforts to provide humanitarian aid to theAfghan people  especially through the recent resolutionadopted at the meeting of Foreign Ministers of theConference of the Islamic Conference with a view tocreating a fund for this purpose.The series of difficult and painful events in thepeace process in the Middle East on all its tracks and atall its stages  particularly regarding the Palestinianaspect of the question  confirms that in order to arriveat a just  comprehensive and lasting peace it isnecessary to work towards implementing SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  as wellas all other relevant United Nations resolutions thatdemand the withdrawal of Israel from all Arabterritories occupied in 1967 and recognition of thelegitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of its ownindependent State  with Al-Quds al-Sharif as itscapital. This is a basic  just and legitimate demand forthe purpose of consolidating the pillars of peace andstability in the region. We express our full support forthese just demands of the Palestinian people who arefully entitled to use all means available to them to putan end to the Israeli occupation of their territory.The Islamic countries also support the right of thePalestinian people because of the justness of theircause. Theirs is a legitimate right recognized andguaranteed by all international norms and instruments.The Sultanate of Oman invites the United Nations andthe Security Council to assume their full responsibilityto have Israel implement all relevant Security Counciland international resolutions and to stop the collectivepunishment of the Palestinian people.Following the Madrid Peace Conference  in 1991 the region was full of hope and optimism. It seemed asthough peace were becoming a reality. Manyagreements had been reached  from Oslo to Sharm el-Sheikh  and all the parties had embarked on dialoguewith one another in circumstances that were not ideal.Nonetheless  despite all the missteps  peace movedforward  because peace was the ultimate goal thateveryone eagerly sought. The Arabs believed in peace.They had agreed to it as an irreversible strategic optionbased on the principles of Islam  which advocatestolerance and peace  and because they were convincedthat peace alone would make prosperity  stability anddevelopment possible.The Sultanate of Oman has therefore supportedevery effort  with a view to achieving that much-desired peace based on justice  fairness and the legalityof international resolutions and the principle of land forpeace. But Israel deviated from those principles inventing its own concept of peace. Israel has usedevery possible means of imposing its own kind ofpeace. Israel does not really want the peace that theworld is considering. Israel wants its own special kindof peace. It wants the international community to goalong with the current reality — the occupation ofterritory  without giving the Palestinians any role or aState. This is why violence in the region is a dynamicof action and reaction. This is why there has beenbloodshed and why life and property continue to bedestroyed. Will the world stand by and watch thekilling of innocents  the murder of the elderly andchildren?The Sultanate of Oman therefore invites the twosponsors of the peace process — the United States ofAmerica and the Russian Federation — and theSecretary-General to play their role so that the situationcan return to normal and so that the peace process  inall its aspects  can be revived and resumed from thepoint where it left off.My Government supports the just position of thefraternal Syrian Arab Republic. Its actions are aimed atrecovering the occupied territory of the Golan Heightsand at ensuring Israel’s withdrawal to the 4 June 1967border. In our opinion  it is in Israel’s interest toresume the negotiations  in accordance with theprinciples of international law and internationalresolutions including Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973)  as well as the principle of landfor peace  in order to lay the foundation for peace andsecurity  so that an effective partnership can be builtand a lasting  stable and viable relationship based onmutual interests among the States of the region can beestablished and consolidated.My Government also asks Israel to work towardsthe full implementation of Security Council resolution425 (1978)  which calls upon Israel to withdraw fromall Lebanese territory. The Shab’a farms area is anintegral part of Lebanese territory and is covered by37that resolution. It is in Israel’s interest to withdrawfrom that territory in order to broaden the prospects ofpeace and to strengthen peace and stability  whicheveryone desires.The imposition of sanctions as a politicalmechanism means that Governments must fulfil theirobligations under international resolutions. However we see that this policy has become a weapon thatjeopardizes the fundamental rights of peoples. This isunacceptable. Hence  it is important that the SecurityCouncil seek effective policies and mechanisms thattake into account the extent to which resolutions havebeen implemented by the countries to which thoseresolutions are addressed  such as Iraq  Libya andothers.Despite all the serious international and regionalefforts to relieve the suffering of the fraternal Iraqipeople  we note that the overall situation in Iraq andthe future of the Iraqi people are becoming increasinglyproblematic because of the economic embargo imposedon them in 1990. That is also the view of thehumanitarian and international agencies andorganizations in Iraq.The Sultanate of Oman supports all efforts to liftcompletely the economic sanctions against Iraq. At thesame time  we call upon the Iraqi Government tocooperate constructively with the United Nations inorder to implement the remaining relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions  particularly regarding prisoners ofwar  missing Kuwaitis and missing persons from thirdStates.The Sultanate of Oman warmly welcomes thewise approach of our brethren in Bahrain and Qatar.Those two countries have proceeded to implement theJudgment of the International Court of Justice of 16March 2001. That positive approach by those twofraternal countries has eliminated many sources oftension and has made a genuine contribution to theestablishment of peace  security and stability in theregion.My Government is gratified by the friendlyofficial contacts between the United Arab Emirates andthe Islamic Republic of Iran  which will enable thosetwo countries to agree on joint means to put an end totheir dispute over the three islands belonging to theEmirates.The political  economic  social and culturalchanges taking place in today’s world mean thatAfrican countries and their leaders must work hard tobuild trust among their peoples and their countries sothat they can cooperate on the basis of common interestand constructive dialogue and so that they can takelocal measures and initiatives to resolve all theirdisputes and to solve the refugee problem. We call onthe international community  as represented by theUnited Nations  to take equitable measures to improvethe situation in Africa and to make it possible toresolve its political  economic  social and healthproblems.Because of the great importance that theSultanate of Oman attaches to development  we arepleased that the first International Conference onFinancing for Development will take place in Mexicoin 2002 and that this date is in the near future. Weappreciate the value of dialogue between the richcountries of the North and the countries of the Souththat are bedevilled by social and environmentalproblems  and we hope that contacts and dialoguebetween the two groups will increase genuinecooperation and coordination among States in allfields  with a view to narrowing the economic andtechnological gap between their peoples.Over the past 30 years of Oman’s developmentprocess  my Government has constantly worked tobalance development and environmental protection.Such efforts have been successful thanks to HisMajesty the Sultan’s declaration of 2001 as the Year ofthe Environment. In the framework of our contributionand of our interest in global environmental issues  wehave pledged that we will sign all conventions andtreaties aimed at protecting the Earth’s environment.My country today appeals to developed countries tomeet the commitments they undertook at the UnitedNations Conference on Environment and Development held at Rio de Janeiro  especially with respect to theprovision of technical assistance to developingcountries.In the light of the importance of integration intothe world economy  my country officially joined theWorld Trade Organization on 9 November 2000. Wehope thus to enhance the role and the level of our tradeand industrial organizations and services and to ensurethat they are duly integrated into world markets. Mycountry has undertaken great economic reforms toliberalize trade and investment. We have also enacted38many laws and have strengthened our mechanisms andregulations in these areas.I should mention that  on 20 December 2000 atNew York  the Sultanate of Oman signed the RomeStatute of the International Criminal Court. We hope tocomplete the ratification process and thus to accede tothis new organ of international law  which is aimed atbringing to justice those who violate human rights andcommit crimes against humanity  wherever they maybe.We thank the Secretary-General for his annualreport on the work of the Organization (A/56/1). It setsout the achievements of the United Nations whiledescribing the obstacles in its way  and it charts acourse for the future to strengthen our work towardsthe purposes for which the United Nations wasestablished. In his report  the Secretary-General alsodiscusses the implementation of the MillenniumDeclaration and its ambitious recommendations. Wemust be ready now to endorse visions that wouldstrengthen the United Nations and restructure it in linewith current realities. That includes enlargement of theSecurity Council in a manner proportionate to theoverall membership of the international community. Inthat way the Organization can serve as an effectiveintermediary in international life and a source ofinternational law.It is our hope that this session will be successful and that it will set out a vision of the future that willdefine the contours of future action for the benefit ofall mankind."
"132",5448,"PAK",56,2001,"﻿I would like toextend to you  Mr. President  my felicitations on yourelection. I also wish to congratulate your predecessor Mr. Harri Holkeri  for his stewardship of themillennium session of the General Assembly. Deepappreciation is also due to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for his untiring efforts to translate thevision of the Millennium Declaration into policies andactions by the world community.Mr. Secretary-General  please also accept myheartiest congratulations on the award of the centenaryNobel Peace Prize conferred upon you and yourOrganization  and on your election for a second term toyour prestigious office.Last year  at the Millennium Summit  all of uswere looking forward to a renaissance in the newmillennium — a renaissance in the hearts and minds ofpeople  for a better world where peace and justicewould prevail. Unfortunately  today we gather againstthe sombre backdrop of the terrorist outrage that theworld witnessed in shock and horror on that fateful dayof 11 September. In seconds  images of fire and deathreached all of us around the globe. Thousands ofinnocent lives were lost in minutes. Eighty or morenations lost some of their brightest and their best.Pakistan  like the rest of the world  mourned thecolossal loss of innocent lives. The map of the worldchanged  and the entire globe descended into a deepcrisis. At a time of such great turmoil  when there is aneed for clear thought and firm action  I come fromPakistan with a message of determination and resolveas well as a message of peace for all peoples.The General Assembly meets this year under theshadow of a horrendous act of terror perpetratedagainst the people of the United States — an act forwhich no grievance or cause can ever be a justification an act that must be condemned unambiguously and inthe strongest words. This was an attack on humanityitself and we all must therefore unite to fight thisscourge. Pakistan has followed words with actions.Now that the world has committed itself to fightagainst terrorism  it is time for introspection. In thisdark hour  we owe it to posterity to shed light on somedangerous and growing trends  misconceptions and2misperceptions which  if not countered  may lead theworld into even greater disorder and disharmony.Muslims in various parts of the world  and thereligion of Islam itself  are being held responsible forthe trials the world is facing. This point of view istotally misplaced. Just as all religions teach peace andlove for fellow beings  so Islam places upon itsadherents the obligation to do good  to be generous merciful  kind and just to all fellow beings. TheMuslim greeting “Assalam alaikum”  meaning “Peacebe with you”  symbolizes the very essence of theIslamic faith. Islam is a religion of peace  compassionand tolerance.Terrorism is not a Christian  Buddhist  Jewish orMuslim belief. It is to be condemned no matter who theperpetrator  be it an individual  a group or a state.We need to ask ourselves what really causes theseextreme acts around the world. To my mind  it isunresolved political disputes: disputes in Bosnia Kosovo  Palestine  Kashmir and other places.Unfortunately  all these disputes involve Muslims and what is more sad  Muslims happen to be the victims inall of them. This fact tends to give a religious tinge tothese otherwise political disputes. The lack of progressin resolving them has created in Muslims a sense ofdeprivation  hopelessness and powerlessness.The frustration grows even worse when disputeslike those relating to Kashmir and Palestine  whichhave been the subject of Security Council resolutions remain unsettled. The question then becomes  are thepeople asking for their rights in accordance withUnited Nations resolutions to be called terrorists  or arethe countries refusing to implement United Nationsresolutions perpetrators of State terrorism? In Kashmir Indian occupation forces have killed over 75 000Kashmiris  attributing these killings to foreignterrorists. It is time that India stopped such deceit.United Nations Security Council resolutions onKashmir must be implemented.Media images of the Palestinian child Mohammed Al-Durra  were etched into the hearts andminds of people all over the world. It is perverse toregard the rape of Kashmiri women as a punishmentinflicted in the course of war. The images of thosemoments when the World Trade Centre towers camedown will remain definitive for all the agony  disbeliefand loss that people suffer from acts of terror all overthe world. All forms of terror must be condemned prevented and fought against  but in condemning themthe world must not trample upon the genuine rights aspirations and urges of the people who are fighting fortheir liberation and are subjected to State terrorism.To fight the extremist  deprive him of hismotivation. The extremist survives in an environmentwhere millions suffer injustice and indignity. Deprivehim of his support by giving all the peoples of theworld peace  security  justice and dignity  regardless offaith  religion or creed.A just and honourable solution for the people ofKashmir and an end to the miseries of the people ofPalestine are the major burning issues that have to beaddressed vigorously  boldly  imaginatively andurgently. We must get to the root causes; cosmeticsolutions will only make matters worse. Consider theanalogy of a tree: terrorists are like so many leaves —take out some  and there will be plenty more  anunending growth. Terrorist networks are branches:prune a few  and there will be others  and furthergrowth. The only way to do deal with them is to go forthe roots. Eliminate the roots  and there will be no tree.The roots are the causes  which need to be addressed tackled and eliminated  fairly  justly and honourably  soas to give people back their dignity  self-respect andhonour.In essence  therefore  to tackle the issue ofterrorism in its entirety  we need to follow athree-pronged strategy of going for individualterrorists; moving against terrorist organizations; andaddressing disputes throughout the world in a justmanner.After the events of 11 September  Pakistan took adeliberate  principled decision to join the worldcoalition in its fight against terrorism. This decisionhas catapulted us  once again  into the position of beinga front-line State in the battle against terrorism. Whilethe people of Pakistan have accepted this new reality they still suffer from a sense of betrayal andabandonment as a result of being left in the lurch in1989 after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.Then  too  we were a front-line State — and what wegot in return was 3 million refugees  a shatteredeconomy  drugs and a Kalashnikov culture  to be dealtwith single-handedly and through our own limitedresources. Pakistan only hopes that the mistakes of thepast will not be repeated and that Pakistan’s legitimateconcerns will be addressed. Our economy again faces a3crisis from the fallout from the operations inAfghanistan. We need financial and commercialsupport on an urgent basis  and hope that this will beforthcoming.After the events of 11 September  and afterOsama bin Laden and Al Qaeda became aninternational issue  Pakistan tried its utmost  up to thelast moment  to work with the Afghan Government soas to avert military action in Afghanistan. Regrettably we did not meet with success  and the coalitionoperation against terrorists in Afghanistan continues with no immediate end in sight. Sadly  the civiliancasualties resulting from this action are increasinglydepicted as an open war against the already poor suffering and innocent people of Afghanistan. Theworld in general  and Pakistan in particular  mourn theloss of these innocent lives  and sympathize with thebereaved. It is desirable that the military operation beas short and as accurately targeted as possible. It is alsoessential that a fall-back political strategy be evolvedwhich could attain the same objectives as those beingsought through military application.In its entirety  dealing with Afghanistan involvesa three-pronged strategy to address military  politicaland humanitarian-cum-rehabilitation issues. It mustremain the effort of the coalition  after achieving itsmilitary objectives  to prevent a vacuum leading toanarchy  through the immediate application of jointpolitical and rehabilitation strategies.In our view  the political set-up in Afghanistanmust be home-grown and not imposed — and I say thathaving knowledge of the Afghan psyche. We mustensure the unity and territorial integrity of Afghanistan within a broad-based  multi-ethnic dispensation representative of the demographic composition of thecountry.The people of Afghanistan have been sufferingthe ravages and devastation of conflict for over twodecades. It is the moral obligation of the worldcommunity to support them generously. Assistance toAfghanistan should be in two forms: first  ongoinghumanitarian assistance; and secondly  post-militaryoperations  rehabilitation and reconstruction.To offset the ill-effects of the ongoing militaryoperation  it is imperative that we launch a morecoordinated and concerted humanitarian relief effortinside and outside Afghanistan  with more generousfunding. This will go a long way to alleviating thesufferings of the common Afghan.It is equally important that we  concurrently formulate a post-operation rehabilitation programmefor when peace returns to Afghanistan. This effortwould entail  at the minimum  the restoration of water-management systems; the revival of agriculture throughland development; the reconstruction of the physicalinfrastructure — roads  buildings and utilities; and theestablishment of institutions.A stable and peaceful Afghanistan is in the vitalinterests of the region and  in particular  of Pakistan.Conditions must be created for the more than 3 millionrefugees in Pakistan to return to their country. Wepropose the establishment of an “Afghan trust fund” under United Nations auspices  for the rehabilitationand reconstruction effort.I would now like to focus on the harsh realities inthe developing countries  which have a relationshipwith extremism of all kinds. Poverty and deprivationlead to frustration  making the masses vulnerable toexploitation by extremist organizations. It is thecollective moral responsibility of the developed worldto address this issue squarely  through substantiveeconomic uplift  poverty alleviation and social actionprogrammes in the developing countries. Economicimbalances have to be removed in order to achieve ajust  equitable and harmonious world order. A majorstep in this direction would be to reduce  if noteliminate  the debt burden  which hangs like amillstone around the necks of the poor and theunderdeveloped.The bigger tragedy of the third world is that theirrulers  together with their minions  plunder theircountries’ wealth and are afforded easy access to safehavens to stash away the loot in the first world.Restrictions have long been imposed on the launderingof drug money  and the money supply for terrorists isbeing choked off. Why can similar restrictions not beimposed on the money-laundering of loot?I appeal  through this forum  to all of thedeveloped countries to legislate against deposits of ill-gotten money  to assist in investigating the looters andto ensure the early return of the plundered wealth to itscountries of origin. In fact  I would not be far off themark if I were to state that  with the return of thislooted money  many of the developing countries might4be able to pay back their debts and revive theireconomies.Pakistan is deeply conscious of the nucleardimension of the security environment of our region the danger it poses and the responsibility it places onnuclear-weapon States  particularly the two nuclearStates in South Asia. We are ready to discuss howPakistan and India can create a stable South Asiansecurity mechanism through the peaceful resolution ofdisputes  the preservation of the nuclear andconventional balance  confidence-building measuresand the non-use of force  as prescribed by the UnitedNations Charter. In this context  we are ready todiscuss nuclear and missile restraints  as well asnuclear risk-reduction measures  with India  in astructured  comprehensive and integrated dialogue.Pakistan is fully aware of the responsibilities ofits nuclear status. We have declared a unilateralmoratorium on nuclear testing. Pakistan was not thefirst to initiate nuclear tests and will not be the first toresume them. We are ready to formalize a bilateraltreaty with India for a mutual test ban. We havestrengthened our export controls and have establishedmulti-layered custodial controls on all our nuclearassets. Let me assure the Assembly that our strategicassets are very well guarded and in very safe hands. Weare constantly upgrading our command and controlmeasures  and we have instituted an elaborate nuclearcommand and control mechanism for ironclad custodialcontrols to ensure the safety and security of all ourassets. Pakistan is opposed to an arms race in SouthAsia  be it nuclear or conventional. We will maintaindeterrence at the minimum level. We want to live in theregion with honour and with dignity.I would now like to very briefly cover internaldevelopments in Pakistan. Over the past two years  thefocus has been on economic revival  povertyalleviation  the improvement of governance inPakistan  political restructuring and the introduction ofgenuine democracy in the country. We havesuccessfully put in place a sound democratic structurethat is based on empowerment of the people at thegrassroots level. A revolutionary step has been takenthrough the provision of one third of the seats towomen on the district-level governing councils.I want to put on record at this gathering thatPakistan is proud of this representation andempowerment of women  which is a unique feature inthe world. Our resolve to hold elections to theProvincial and National Assemblies and to the Senatein October 2002  in accordance with the road map Iannounced last August  will remain unchanged in spiteof the prevailing environment in the region.In conclusion  and in view of the fact that we aregoing through a time of enormous trials andtribulations  I wish to make an appeal — an appeal forthe sake of mankind  for the sake of our futuregenerations and for the sake of a better world.Let justice prevail; let no people be wronged; letsuffering be eliminated; let discontent be addressed; lethumanity rise as one nation to eliminate subjugation ofthe weak; and let there be peace."
"133",5491,"PAN",56,2001,"﻿TheRepublic of Panama welcomes with particular pleasurethe election of Mr. Han Seung-soo as President of thefifty-sixth session of the General Assembly  and wishesto assure him of our fullest cooperation in the sensitivework with which he is entrusted. It is also a pleasurefor us to express the deep satisfaction of theGovernment of Panama at the well-deserved honour ofthe award of the Nobel Peace Prize jointly to theSecretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. KofiAnnan  and to the Organization itself.As we participate today in this forum  we are stillreeling from the impact of the terrifying terrorist actscarried out on 11 September in New York  Washington D.C.  and Pennsylvania. These crimes against humanitywill never be forgotten  and  as a tribute to thethousands of innocent victims of these senselessattacks  the United Nations must take whatevermeasures are necessary to legitimize any multilateralaction that will have to be taken in future to neutralizethe threat of international terrorism.The Republic of Panama  as a State Member ofthe United Nations  fully respects the mandates issuedby the Organization  and  therefore  we are pleased tostate here unambiguously that every resource availableto us has been directed to fulfil our responsibilities inthe war against terrorism.Similarly  we support the Security CouncilCommittee set up under resolution 1373 (2001) chaired by the Ambassador of the United Kingdom ofGreat Britain and Northern Ireland  Sir JeremyGreenstock. We propose to remain in communicationwith him on an ongoing basis.The Government of Panama  under the leadershipof President Mireya Moscoso  is prepared vigorously toimplement the provisions contained in all UnitedNations instruments on international terrorism. To thatend  we will soon submit to our Legislative Assemblythe four United Nations instruments that have not yetbeen ratified by our country  together with theInternational Convention for the Suppression of theFinancing of Terrorism of December 1999  which wehave just signed here. Likewise  we will ratify  as soonas possible  the Rome Statute creating the InternationalCriminal Court.In parallel with the joint actions taken againstterrorism in conformity with the many relevant UnitedNations Conventions and resolutions of the GeneralAssembly and the Security Council  and in order toaddress terrorist activities  we respectfully appeal to allto set aside any differences that may have arisen in Julyin respect of the problem of massive illegal trade insmall arms and light weapons. It is well known that theultimate beneficiaries of this deadly traffic are not onlyrebel movements — sometimes sponsored by othernations — but also notorious terrorist groups. That iswhy Panama reiterates the position it maintainedduring the Conference: that no State has the right topromote this deadly traffic by claiming its own nationalinterests are at stake. This issue must be re-examined inthe light of recent events.The Republic of Panama is particularly concernedat the social  political and economic implications of theillicit trade in small arms and light weapons and wishesto declare its commitment to promoting an Americanconvention on this question  with a view to creating alegal framework that will enable the countries of thehemisphere to completely suppress this traffic and thusstrengthen regional security.We are caught up in a vortex of bloodshed thatbrings us ever closer to generalized conflagrations. TheStates represented here  when we became Members ofthis Organization  undertook formally to promote peaceand human rights; to meet the food  health care andeducational needs of our peoples; to preserve theenvironment; and to bring about overall social economic and political development.However  for this commitment to have a realeffect  we must secure the support of those States that due to pure fanaticism  particularly in the Middle East have not been able to come to terms with the purposesand principles of the United Nations. My countrybelieves that the intolerance and intransigencedemonstrated in that part of the world are the result ofancient ways of thinking and injustices that can beeasily discerned and which constitute flagrantviolations of the United Nations Charter. The Republic4of Panama has repeatedly urged the parties in conflictto renounce the use of force  re-establish cooperationon security and adopt measures to restore mutual trust which enable a return to the peace process based on thenorms of international law.In recent days  the international community haswitnessed with deep sadness the intensification ofviolence in that region. Because of the brutalityoccurring in the Middle East  Panama considers that itis the responsibility of the United Nations tovigorously strengthen its mediating role in order to putan end to the unfortunate bloodshed that has grievedthe international community for decades.In particular  Panama calls on the SecurityCouncil to assume a more active role in the efforts toapply the recommendations of the Mitchell report which proposes using constructive dialogue and mutualconcessions to move beyond the violence. Anindispensable step is recognizing the right of thePalestinian people to create a sovereign State and theright of the State of Israel to live in peace and security.We must make our best effort  employ our mostoutstanding human resources and put ourselves to thetask of reconciling all humankind. The Republic ofPanama will persist in this task and will alwaysadvocate peaceful solutions to conflicts throughdialogue and the rejection of violence as the means toresolve internal or international disputes.Other examples of situations that causeunnecessary friction and that could be resolved throughdialogue are the issues of the Saharan people’s right toself-determination  the Argentine Republic’s claim tothe Falkland Islands  and the representation of theRepublic of China on Taiwan in the United Nationssystem while the internal situation of that fraternalpeople is being resolved.Panama defends human rights without reservationand will never accept acts which violate them wherever the violations occur and whatever thecircumstances used to try to justify those violations.Let us add to this very clear position of ours oursincere commitment to the universal campaign for therights of the child and to the fight against HIV/AIDS as these are an essential part of human rights. On thislatter issue  Panama considers that the key to any futuresuccess lies in everyone’s acceptance of their economicand social responsibilities with respect to this terribledisease and in developing good community planning atthe local and provincial levels to prevent the spread ofHIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.Human rights are clearly defined in the politicaland civil spheres as much as in the economic  socialand cultural spheres. Since the proclamation of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights on 10December 1948  much progress has been made.However  the principles proclaimed on that occasionare being challenged by the inequalities ofglobalization and financing for development  byunpayable foreign debts and by the indiscriminatedestruction of the environment. All these factors ofextreme poverty require acts of profound solidarity onbehalf of the richer nations. We firmly believe that theeradication of poverty and inequality will prevent theerosion of human rights and halt the social upheavalsthat generate violence and cause the loss of thepolitical  social and economic rights of the citizens ofthe world.The United Nations Conference on Environmentand Development  held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 was a tremendous effort towards sustainable worlddevelopment. The most important outcome of theConference was the adoption of Agenda 21  whichcovers in depth the topics of poverty  hunger  disease illiteracy and the progressive deterioration ofecosystems. Agenda 21 also encourages us to focus ourattention on the financial resources required to promotesustainable development at the national level  with thegoal of creating a corresponding measurement systemfor it that can be easily interpreted. This is an ongoingand important task that we cannot neglect.The United Nations Conference on Financing forDevelopment will be held in Monterrey  Mexico  inMarch 2002. We believe that the Conference offers amagnificent opportunity to reduce the abyss betweenthe rich countries of the North and the poor countriesof the South in both the practical and conceptualaspects of this issue.In the course of last month’s meetings of theConference’s Preparatory Committee  opinions withsubstantial differences were expressed  and these mustbe reconciled. As a result of these disagreements  therehave been pessimistic predictions that it will beimpossible to formulate a plan of action at Monterrey. Ibelieve  on the contrary  that since we already know theobjections that will be made by those who assume the5risks of financing  we cannot delay revising ourarguments  in order — creatively and responsibly — todefine parameters for financing for development thatare more in tune with the realities of today’s world.The current realities are pressing and encompass among other things  the need to provide financing atdiscounted rates to developing countries; to vigorouslyattack the problem of foreign debt; to design measuresto raise the depressed prices of our raw materials andother export products; and to agree collectively onmechanisms to prevent financial crises.Following this line of thought  and because weconsider it of interest to the General Assembly  we willmention that in June of this year the Central Americancountries and the United States signed a jointdeclaration under the Alliance for the SustainableDevelopment of Central America (ALIDES). Thisalliance is a regional strategy to make the CentralAmerican isthmus a region of peace  freedom democracy and development. Its general objectivesinclude the sustainable management of biodiversity  thestrengthening and modernization of institutionalstructures  the promotion of trade and the mitigation ofnatural disasters.Specifically  ALIDES works for regionaleconomic integration and the region’s integration in theinternational economy; the harmonization ofmacroeconomic policies and the modernization ofinfrastructure in the areas of energy  transportation andtelecommunications; the creation of protectedbiological corridors  river basins and other areas; thestrengthening of democracy and the rule of law in theregion; the improvement of the levels of education health and security of the population of CentralAmerica; and the restoration and preservation ofnational values.Central America’s desire for development hasbeen strengthened by the launching of the Puebla-Panama Plan. We created for the region a mechanismfor ongoing and permanent consultation to perfect anintegral strategy for long-term development.While we are making great efforts to mitigate thesocial problems that afflict us in some regions  in theUnited Nations we continue to debate structuralproblems that limit to some extent the ability of manyof our countries to have an effect on the administrationof the Organization. Among the different debatesrelating to United Nations reform  we would like torefer to the one held on 30 October on agenda item 49 entitled “Question of equitable representation on andincrease in the membership of the Security Council andrelated matters”. Last year the delegation of Panama both at the Millennium Summit and the GeneralAssembly  supported the aspiration of many years tobring about the reform of the Security Council.We have said — and we wish to repeat today —that we agree it must have a more equitable and morerepresentative composition  but in order to achieve thisfundamental objective it is indispensable that thepermanent members accept that the power structure of1945 has ceased to exist. Now  looking at the new andvital interdependence of all nations around the world we see a genuine opportunity opening before us to getrid of the obsessions that no longer suit the structure ofour Organization.In conclusion  we would like to restate ourconviction that  as we have seen after the horrendousterrorist acts of 11 September  the legitimacy andeffectiveness of future Security Council actions willdepend on all Member States feeling the absence ofunilateral measures and of the usual marginalization indecision-making on matters affecting all of us. It is inthis direction that we should guide our work."
"134",5538,"PER",56,2001,"﻿This is the first time I have had the privilege ofaddressing this prestigious world forum. To arrive here I travelled a long road. I was born in a small villagehigh in the Andes  at an altitude of nearly 4 000 metresabove sea level. Like millions of brothers from ourcontinent of Latin America  I know first-hand the hardface of poverty.To survive  in my childhood  I sold newspapers lottery tickets and shined the shoes in which otherswalked.Today  I have come before this world assembly asthe constitutional President of Peru  bringing thestories  the hopes and the dreams of millions ofPeruvians.I come from a country that is heir to an ancientculture and the cradle of great civilizations. I come tolead our present with responsibility and to constructour future with vision. Thus  in these few briefminutes  I would like to share with the Assembly threesubjects that are of the greatest concern to myGovernment:First of all  I would like to be clear about onething: we are engaged in a head-on struggle againstterrorism and its perverse alliance with drug traffickingand corruption. These are scourges for which there canbe no room for ambiguity. With the samedetermination  however  I need to point out that theworld is facing the enormous challenge of musteringthe necessary clear vision so as not to put off thehuman development agenda  which in large measure isthe underlying principle of the United Nations.Secondly  there is the need to reduce militaryexpenditures in Latin America and in the world  so thatthese resources can be channelled instead into a directfight against poverty.Thirdly  we need to think and act together indealing with the world economic situation to protectemployment opportunities and income for the poorest.There can be no real democracy without sustainedeconomic growth that will generate decent jobs.Barely a year ago  Peru was enmeshed in adramatic struggle between a corrupt dictatorship andthe hopes for democracy of the vast majority of thePeruvian people. Faced with this situation  wePeruvians stood up and proved capable of mobilizingourselves and peacefully struggling to regain ourdemocracy and our freedom. On behalf of millions ofmen and women of my country  I would like to thankthe peoples and Governments of the world for theirfriendship  active role and solidarity in helping usregain our democracy.Today  Peru has now begun a new democraticdawn. We are aware  however  that we have greatresponsibilities. We must strengthen a full-fledgeddemocracy and our still fragile institutions andreactivate our economy so as to achieve sustainablegrowth that will generate decent and productive jobs.We must strengthen our institutions and defeat poverty which form an indissoluble part of the same goal because poverty  corruption and drug traffickingconspire against democracy. We can now declare  herebefore the international community  that the time hascome to give a human face to globalization  so thatcompetitiveness becomes permanent.We Peruvians have freshly inscribed in ourcollective memory a horror of terrorism. During the 20years of terror  Peru has lost 25 000 human lives  whichhas cost more than $30 billion and has left the pooreven poorer. That is why I reaffirm our deep solidaritywith the people and Government of the United States inthe face of the insanity of terror of 11 September. Thiswas not an attack against the United States alone. Itwas an attack against the peoples that believe in peaceand democracy  for all our differences of opinion.We are determined to take unambiguous actionsto fight terrorism. We shall do so in the spirit of respectfor religious freedoms and ethnic identity. We willactively contribute to the work that has been entrustedto the ad hoc Committee of the Security Council making available to it the experts that may benecessary to intelligently fight the threat ofinternational terrorism within the framework of theprinciples of the Charter and the decisions of theSecurity Council.At an inter-American multilateral forum  wemade an effective contribution. This week weintroduced before the Organization of American Statesa draft convention against terrorism. In keeping withthis purpose  this morning we deposited at theSecretary-General’s office the following instruments:the Statute of the International Criminal Court; the9International Convention for the Suppression ofTerrorist Bombings; and the International Conventionfor the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.Thus  my country has become a party to allinternational treaties against terrorism.Our States must build up an extensive network ofobligations to effectively cooperate in the judicial police  information and financial fields to facilitate thecapture and extradition of the perpetrators of crimesagainst humanity or of acts of corruption that lead tosuch crimes. Human rights violations and corruptionare two sides of the same coin. They spell impunity.It would not be possible to face up to corruptionwithout linking it with the fight against drug traffickingand money laundering. We are working hard in thisregard. We have established high-level authoritiesdirectly under the head of State to wage the fightagainst drug trafficking and corruption.I know that this is a decision that impinges uponpowerful interests. We shall not be swayed from ourdetermination. Peru is now seeking to re-establishdemocracy to the fullest. We are aware  however  thatthere are powerful forces hidden in the shadows which  with certain political accomplices  are trying toachieve impunity for the corruption committed duringthe decade of Montesinos and Fujimori. That is why addressing you from this prestigious forum  I call onthe international community not to allow  as theglobalization of justice process  for capriciousinterpretation of certain national laws that trivializeactions or allow for the granting of impunity.There is no justification for a democraticgovernment to sacrifice development of the poor forthe sake of an arms race. Therefore  the second issuecentral to our foreign policy is our proposal  which weput to the Heads of State and Government of LatinAmerica  for an immediate freeze on the purchase ofoffensive weapons in the region. We also seek anagreement among the countries of Latin America toreduce their military expenditures and to reorient theirfinancial resources towards investment in nutrition health and education.Peru has recently achieved important agreementson this issue with the brotherly countries of Chile andEcuador and is promoting an understanding among theother countries of our region that will allow us toembark together on the path towards the reduction ofpoverty there. Peace is not only the silence of guns; itshould also mean dignity for the poor. This proposal isaimed at the adoption of a broad regional framework toreduce military spending. However  might we not alsoconsider expanding this proposal  which is not a newone  to other regions around the globe? We must investin the great enterprise of knowledge — in the minds ofour people. That means investing more  and morewisely  in nutrition  health and education.The third item relates to our concern about theglobal economy. We regret the onset of recession in themost important developed economies  which isshrinking markets  eliminating jobs and thus hinderingthe implementation of the measures set out in theMillennium Declaration. There is an urgent need tocontrol the damage being done to the poor economiesby the current global economic crisis. It is thereforeimportant that the next round of the World TradeOrganization not be an aseptic commercial round. Itshould be a round on behalf of the poorest  avoidingprotectionist policies for the agricultural sector of theindustrialized countries and allowing the textileindustry to create good jobs in our countries.I call on the people of the world to embarkunflinchingly and without fear on the path towards afuture of peace and democracy  without terrorism without violations of human rights and withoutimpunity. I am convinced that  together  we can build aglobalized  competitive yet united world with a humanface. In that respect  Peru assumes its responsibilitytoday before the General Assembly."
"135",5585,"PHL",56,2001,"﻿Let me begin bycongratulating Your Excellency  Mr. Han Seung-soo on your election as President of the General Assembly.I am especially gratified to be addressing the Assemblywhen a distinguished Asian is again at its helm.I congratulate as well His Excellency Mr. KofiAnnan on the Nobel Prize that he  together with theUnited Nations  has received. That prize constitutesrecognition by the international community of theindispensable role of the United Nations and of thenecessary work it has done on the Secretary-General’swatch towards world peace and justice.At the most elemental level  we feel most deeplythe sad and tragic impact of the recent inhuman acts ofterrorism: the lost lives  the orphaned children  thewidowed spouses  the parents struck with theunimaginable grief of outliving their children and worse yet  of watching them die. As we watched thehorror unfold  we felt as though it were happening tous — as indeed it was  for the United Nations is in asense one family. The blow that was struck at thisinternational city of New York was felt as directly bythe rest of the world. As people the world over stoppedto watch in horror as the twin towers came down  theworld’s economies ground to a virtual halt.Business activity stopped  investments werewithdrawn  markets shrank  tourism dried up  morejobs were lost  living standards dropped even further destitution spread and the very conditions that favourterrorism spread and deepened. Our misgivings about aworld slowdown deepened into certainty about arecession that will be felt most deeply by those leastable to endure it: not just classes but whole countries.The average growth rate in the gross domestic productof developing countries could fall from last year’s 5.5per cent to 2.9 per cent. For most poor countries  thatwill translate to sub-zero growth.The face of terrorism that this city saw over amonth ago is a familiar one to Asians. It has taken aterrible toll in terms of the lives of our people and theeconomies of the region. It has destroyed our credit andhas deterred investment. It has caused AsianGovernments profound embarrassment at being caughtflat-footed and unable to offer their citizens the mostbasic security. In the south-western part of thePhilippines  it has taxed our resources and our patienceto the limit  for terrorism is the argument of those whoare not really interested in reasoning but only in gettingwhatever they want on their terms alone.We know terrorism. We are fighting it in thesouth-western Philippines. The perpetrators of the firstattack on the World Trade Center were apprehended byour police. Rather than dismembering our country anddispossessing our people of their homes  we have beennegotiating with secessionist groups. But we havethrown the full weight of the law  including the use offorce  at those who have resorted to terrorism. Weknow the enemy  and we know that these are not peopleyou talk to; these are people you fight. As theSecretary-General has pointed out  there are those whowill hate and who will kill even if every injustice isended. You must fight them in the field  when they taketo the field and hunt them in cities when they hideinside.It was in the light of that experience in the south-western Philippines that we immediately condemnedthe terrorist attacks on the United States  for werecognized them immediately as desperate anddespicable acts by that violent minority which seeks toenslave the world with fear. And indeed  they havegiven the world good reason to be afraid. The attack onthe World Trade Center  which aimed to take the livesof the 50 000 people who worked inside it  shows us anenemy without pity  without compunction and preparedto use any means to achieve the greatest destruction.The Philippines did not need to join the war onterrorism: it was in that war already  in the south-western part of our islands. The Philippines could nothave done otherwise than to renew its commitment tofight terrorism in a wider field in the wake of 11September. We know that this is an enemy that must be9fought everywhere so that it cannot again strike at willanywhere it pleases.This is a fight between tolerance and bigotry between reason and fanaticism  between law andanarchy  between justice and murder pretending to bejust. In this fight  there is no side to choose but the onewhere the civilized nations of the world — long-timeallies and former enemies — have chosen to standunited  not least here in this Hall.The Secretary-General has declared that the 11September attacks struck at everything ourOrganization stands for: peace  freedom  tolerance human rights  and the very idea of a united humanfamily.I do not know if the future belongs to our side but I am convinced that there will be no future if ourside does not prevail in this fight — at least  no futurethat any of us would care to live in. In fact  it wouldnot be a future in which most of us would be allowedto live. It would be a future where happiness wassuspect  delight was blasphemy  beauty was a cause forshame and independent thought a capital crime.But while terrorism cannot be placated  and noterrorist should be appeased  there is no doubt in ourminds  either  that we must address the concerns thatthey pretend are the inspiration for their terrible deeds.If the world can show that it will carry on  that itwill persevere in creating a stronger  more just  morebenevolent and more genuine international communityacross all lines of religion and race  then terrorism willhave failed.No  terrorism will not stop  but it will have failed.To stop terrorism  the terrorists themselves will have tobe stopped. What we can do  however  is to strip themof their moral pretensions and take upon ourselves thecauses that they have perverted.No nation will indefinitely endure the yawninggap between rich and poor — a gap that is onlygrowing bigger  not just within  but across thecountries of the world. It is this growing disparitybetween the ever fewer rich and the ever-increasingpoor that has given terrorism the freedom of movementand impunity from accountability that it has enjoyed.Poverty can be reduced partly by nationaleconomic growth. But  more than that  societies have toadopt deliberate policies to ensure that the incomelevels of the poor rise faster than those of the rich.Recent developments in the global economy havedisplayed the perils of overdependence on externalmarkets. We must expand domestic demand andincrease the purchasing power of the masses of ourpeople.This is largely the responsibility of each nation.We in the Philippines are addressing the affront ofmass poverty through housing  education  lowermedical costs  more efficient power  transportation andcommunications  infrastructure in the countryside credit to small farmers and micro-industries productivity  protection of the environment  anddevelopment of the areas farthest from our centre ofpolitical power and economic activity.The international community also has aresponsibility in the elimination of poverty.Commitments to devote a certain percentage of grossdomestic product to official development assistancehave a place. But the most effective  and least costly anti-poverty measure on a global scale is for developedcountries to open their markets wider to the products ofthe developing countries  including in particular thoseproducts turned out by poor people in the poorcountries — agricultural commodities  textiles clothing and footwear  as well as electrical andelectronic appliances and components.The global trading system cannot allowdeveloped countries to subsidize heavily theiragricultural exports while the developing countries arewithout the means to help their own farmers.The recent Ministerial Meeting of the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) decided to launch a newround of multilateral trade negotiations. To ensure thatthe WTO does not lose credibility at this crucial time our top priority is to ensure that the Doha round is trulya development round.The effort to conquer poverty must embrace allcultures  all ethnic groups and all religiouscommunities. Nations must allow all to preserve theirown cultures.We must make political autonomy accessible toregions that want it. At the same time  no one must beallowed to resort to terrorism to further political aims.10Respect for culture and religion  resources fordevelopment  openness to political autonomy withinthe sovereignty of the nation and rejection of terrorismare the foundations of the Philippine approach to ourethnic diversity and to the uplifting of our Muslim andtribal minorities.The vision of nations where poverty is rapidlyreduced cannot be attained in places where women andgirls are mistreated and their rights trampled upon. Asa woman head of State  woman head of Governmentand woman Commander-in-Chief of the world’sfourteenth largest nation  I say: we cannot conquerpoverty without liberating women and girls where theyare oppressed. The gender gap is a part of thedevelopment gap and must be addressed with equalvigour.The fight against terrorism  the struggle toeliminate poverty  the work on behalf of social andinternational justice  the strengthening of the rule oflaw  the promotion of tolerance and mutual respect  thepractice of humanitarian compassion  the liberation ofwomen  the never-ending quest for peace — these havelong been on the United Nations agenda. We in thePhilippines have been doing this in our region  incooperation with our neighbours.The heightened virulence of terrorism  therenewed sense of insecurity among the world’s peoplesand the alarming slowdown in the global economyhave intensified the urgency and importance of ourwork. Together  let us get on with the job. It is serious.It is essential. It is urgent."
"136",5604,"PLW",56,2001,"﻿Let me begin byconveying my deepest sympathy and condolences tothe families and relatives of the victims of AmericanAirlines flight 587  which crashed in this great city twodays ago  exactly two months and one day after the 11September terrorist attack. The people of New York areonce again being put to the test  and once again theywill come out of this tragedy more resolved anddetermined  under the leadership of Mayor Giuliani andGovernor Pataki. While we pray for the victims andtheir families  let us also pray that the crash  as tragicas it was  will prove to be an accident and not an act ofterrorism.In the wake of an unfathomable  barbarous act ofterror against a civilian population made up of citizensfrom nations around the globe  we gather together inunprecedented unity. We are united in our sorrow overthe losses arising from 11 September — the loss oflives  the loss of friends and loved ones  the loss oflivelihoods and the loss of innocence  for want of abetter word. We are united in our condemnation of thehorrific acts perpetrated by an isolated group ofextremists who have no respect for human life. We areunited in our resolve that those responsible for theatrocities of 11 September  and those who supportthem  are a cancer in the body of nations — a systemicblight which extends beyond the individualperpetrators and which must be utterly eradicated  lestit return and spread.At the same time  we are united in our convictionthat their evil cannot be allowed to force us to abandonrespect for human rights and adherence to the rule oflaw  which are fundamental principles of thisOrganization. We are united in our recognition that  forall their claims to holiness  those responsible for thesecriminal acts of terror bear no legitimate claim to anycivilized religion and certainly do not represent thenoble and honourable beliefs of Islam. We are united inour understanding that the peoples of Afghanistan arealso victims of the corruption and ill-fated control oftheir Government by these criminals and theirsupporters  as well as in our desire to assist inimproving the quality of life of the people ofAfghanistan. In all these things and more  we areunited to a degree that would have been unthinkablebefore 11 September.2This new spirit of cooperation reflects the mostpositive feature of globalization — the feature whichpro-globalization factions do not often put forward andanti-globalization forces never consider. It is the onlyfeature of globalization that Pacific island countriessuch as Palau can see as being truly and inherentlypositive — a feature that the Pacific island countrieshave recognized among themselves for decades. Thatfeature is the acknowledgement that  ultimately  thereis only one system in which we exist  and the relatedunderstanding that any act or condition within thatsystem affects each of us  although in varying ways anddegrees. In such a system  problems are best addressedthrough coalition-building and a consensus-drivenapproach  a process of give and take  involving thewidest possible range of participants. We see proof ofthis as the world continues to cooperate in respondingto the 11 September attacks against humanity.As I have said  in this new spirit of cooperation the process of decision-making and the implementationof those decisions must be as open and participatory aspossible. This is especially true in the light of the needto weave together military  financial  law enforcement trade  intelligence-gathering and foreign aid issues. Inthese troubled times  it simply makes no sense toisolate a proven ally in the fight against terrorism. Yetthat is what is happening. The Republic of China onTaiwan  which could and should be a very valuableasset in these and other cooperative actions  issignificantly restricted in the role it can play because ithas been barred from membership in this body. In fact it is the only nation in the world which has no voice inthis Organization.Not only is the exclusion of Taiwan contrary tothe fundamental  inclusive principles of the UnitedNations  but on a more pragmatic level it compromisessecurity in Asia and the Pacific. Lacking a neutralforum for the non-violent  diplomatic resolution of anydisputes it might have with the People’s Republic ofChina  the Republic of China on Taiwan is at a greatdisadvantage in maintaining stable and peacefulrelations in the region. It is simply counterproductive from either a practical or a political viewpoint  toexclude from this body a peaceful  democraticallygoverned  economically vibrant nation which embraceshuman rights and plays a major role in otherinternational organizations.Similarly  it makes no sense  in this new globalsystem  to ignore an entire bloc of nations because ofperceptions left over from an earlier  colonial-eraworld. Yet the Pacific island countries are still beingmarginalized in the various United Nations bodies andprocesses. It is time to recognize that the Pacific islandcountries are unique entities  island countries withdistinct traditions  cultures  needs  interests andconcerns and are not merely the leftovers ofcolonialism. It is time to recognize that they are amongthe youngest nations of the world  with specialrequirements for assistance in assuming their properplace in the global arena. Those needs  interests andconcerns are often overlooked against the largerbackdrop of the Asia-Pacific Group in the UnitedNations. It is time to change that; to deal more fullywith the Pacific island countries as such  rather than asan afterthought tagged onto Asia.Resolutions have been put forward which couldcorrect the erroneous exclusion of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan  pave the way to providing a properlyexpanded role for the Pacific island countries as such and produce greater cooperation and broader support inall the key works of the United Nations. Now is thetime for the membership to adopt those resolutions inrecognition of the need for full participation of allpeoples in the global events unfolding now and sure todevelop in the foreseeable future.Moreover  it is equally important in this newglobalization and world order that the most importantorgan of the United Nations  the Security Council  bereorganized and restructured to reflect truerepresentation of this Organization. While wecommend and applaud the five permanent members ofthe Security Council for their efforts and contributionsto world peace and security  the time has come for thisbody to consider the inclusion of several MemberStates as permanent members of the Security Council.Japan  among few others  has certainly reached thelevel and capacity to be one of the permanent membersof the Security Council. In this respect  we applaud therecent decision of the Japanese Government to sendsupport forces to the United States-led coalition waragainst international terrorism.Finally  if it can be said that any good came fromthe abominations of 11 September  it would be this:countries of the world that gave little thought toengagement and cooperation in a larger  global systemare now fully engaged and working side by side withcountries to which they were formerly antagonistic orto which they gave only passing thought  at best. This3new perspective can and should be applied to respondto another global attack  one that is even more basicthan terrorism and will remain a threat to humanityafter the criminals of 11 September are brought tojustice.This threat arises from the attack on our ownecosystem through desertification  through thereduction in global biodiversity and through globalwarming and sea-level rise  all resulting from humanactivities. These attacks  infinitely less dramatic thanthose of 11 September  are nonetheless equallysystemic in nature and equally threatening to us all. Itis time to apply the same new understanding of globaldynamics  so forcefully driven home on 11 September to our environment.We applaud and are very much encouraged by thedevelopments of the recently concluded seventhsession of the Conference of the Parties to the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change inMorocco. To that end  I want to repeat my oft-statedcall for all nations to finalize negotiations on  sign ratify and implement the Kyoto Protocol as soon aspossible. Just as we must now directly confront theeffects of transnational acts of terror  we must nowdirectly confront the environmental consequences ofour own actions. Delay on either matter is unacceptableand will only further compromise our well-being.For perhaps the first time in its glorious history the phrase “United Nations” literally describes thisOrganization. While we remain shocked  saddened anddeeply offended by the events giving rise to the newunity  we must acknowledge and nurture whatevergood those events can be turned to. We now have theability to see the clear advantages of close cooperationon matters which affect us all. Let us use theknowledge  that wisdom gained from pain  and forgeeven stronger  institutional reliance on cooperation consensus and coalition-building across the widestpossible constituency as we go forward in this newglobal system."
"137",5645,"PNG",56,2001,"﻿On behalf ofthe people and Government of Papua New Guinea  Iwish to join previous speakers in congratulating thePresident on his election to this prestigious post.His election shows the high esteem in which theinternational community holds both him personally andhis country  the Republic of Korea.My delegation is confident that  through his greatdiplomatic skills and leadership  which is alreadyevident  he will continue to guide the work of thissession of the General Assembly to its successfulconclusion.I also take this opportunity  through him  toexpress my delegation’s sincere appreciation to hispredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Harri Holkeri  for hisoutstanding leadership and stewardship in facilitatingthe work of the historic Millennium Summit and thefifty-fifth session of the General Assembly.We also congratulate and pay tribute to Mr. KofiAnnan for his re-election to the office of Secretary-General of the United Nations and for the award of theNobel Peace Prize.Papua New Guinea is resolute in its commitmentto the purposes and principles of the United NationsCharter. Papua New Guinea acknowledges the value ofmany of the United Nations treaties and declarations including those that advance human rights  the rule oflaw and good governance. Many of these principles areenumerated in our national Constitution.We acknowledge that the Organization has hadsome limitations  many of which are self-inflicted. Wenote that the United Nations is now in a much healthier31financial position than ever before. However  there isno room for complacency in the pursuit of its reformprogramme. The United Nations bodies and systemsmust be restructured to reflect new dynamics andgeopolitical changes and to create hope for all at thebeginning of the new millennium.We believe that our common global and regionalproblems cannot be resolved under the auspices ofviolence  terrorism  war and destruction; nor can theybe resolved in a vacuum. The United Nations providesa forum and an avenue for fostering dialogue forpeaceful resolution of disputes.An effective Security Council  we believe  shouldbe representative of all subregions of the world. MyGovernment also believes that the use of the vetopower should be limited to Chapter VII issues  whilethe working methods and deliberations of the Councilshould be more transparent and democratic.Papua New Guinea’s development aspirationshave been compromised by problems associated withthe downturn in the global economy  the economiccrisis within the Asia-Pacific region and naturaldisasters  over all of which we have little control. TheGovernment has addressed these challenges through acomprehensive programme of structural adjustments.We have worked hard to make sure that these structuraladjustments are made in the public sector in order tostimulate and expand growth in the private sector.The measures we have adopted have stabilizedthe economy. However  as we look into the future  wecannot but hope that the incidents of 11 September willnot unduly affect our future recovery. Judging by theevidence of a downturn in the United States economy it seems clear that every effort is required to make theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment next year a success.We are grateful to the Friends of Papua NewGuinea group  comprising Australia  Japan  theEuropean Commission and China  among others  whichhave been generous in assisting our Government in itsdevelopment efforts. The World Bank  InternationalMonetary Fund and Asian Development Bank havealso been very positive in their responses to ourpolicies.My country has experienced an unfortunate andterrible conflict and has been trying to build mutualconfidence and security by pursuing a progressivepolitical settlement  including through restoration anddevelopment for the past four years in its BougainvilleProvince. We have utilized the Melanesian way ofbuilding consensus between all parties to the conflict.The consensus is now reflected in the BougainvillePeace Agreement  signed by the parties on 30 Augustthis year. The Government is resolute in its desire toimplement the Agreement. It has completed work ondrafting amendments to our Constitution to provide forgreater autonomy  a referendum and amnesty. Togetherwith ongoing efforts to implement other aspects of theAgreement  the parties are expected to facilitateprogress on weapons disposal and associated issues such as reconciliation and the unification of politicaland administrative structures in Bougainville. A specialsession of Parliament will be been convened nextweek  on 22 November  to continue to debate theAgreement. Parliament will deliberate on theconstitutional amendments on or soon after 14December this year.We wish to place on record our deep appreciationto the United Nations  in particular Ambassador NoelSinclair and his team on Bougainville  the UnitedNations Development Programme  the EuropeanUnion  individual European Union members and theGovernments of Australia  Fiji  Japan  New Zealand Solomon Islands and Vanuatu for their continuing andconstructive roles in Bougainville.It is also my pleasure to speak on behalf of theBougainville parties and the Government to thank theSecretary-General and all members of the SecurityCouncil  past and present  for continuing to renew themandate of the United Nations Political Office inBougainville. We are confident that the SecurityCouncil will continue to provide all the assistance weneed with respect to arms collection  storage anddisposal.The process of decolonization will not becompleted until the people of the remaining 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories have exercised their right toself-determination and/or achieved self-government.Papua New Guinea welcomes the cooperation ofthe Government of France with regard to the progressmade in implementing the Nouméa Accords and settingin motion the eventual exercise of the right of self-determination by the people of New Caledonia especially the indigenous Kanak people.32We acknowledge the full cooperation of theGovernment of New Zealand in the progress made sofar with respect to the question of the Tokelau Islands.My Government notes the progress made in EastTimor. We heartily welcome the announcement of 20May 2002 as the day the people of East Timor willattain independence and nationhood. We look forwardto welcoming them as a full Member of this family ofnations.Papua New Guinea continues to urge the otheradministering Powers to cooperate with the SpecialPolitical and Decolonization Committee inimplementing and completing its mandate soon.The future of each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories can be assured only by apositive  constructive and  above all  transparentapproach to developing a unique solution for each ofthem.The fifty-fourth session of the General Assemblyestablished the Consultative Process on oceans toimprove the coordination and management of theprogrammes associated with the use  development andprotection of the oceans and seas. The ConsultativeProcess has been successful in bringing to the fore  andfocusing the attention of Member States on  a numberof issues.The Pacific Islands Forum group includes smallisland developing States that are custodians of thelargest ocean space. This ocean space is rich in naturaland marine resources. However  the small islanddeveloping States of the region have limited human financial and technological capacities to harvest control  manage and secure these resources for thebenefit of our current and future generations.It has been said that to divert the poor from thecall of the evil  it is not enough to appeal to theirstomachs only. Rather  one must appeal to theiraspirations as well. We joined others having particularinterest in the sustainable use and management of thefish stocks in our region to establish the Convention onthe Conservation and Management of Highly MigratoryFish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Oceanin September 2000. The next meeting of the signatoriesto this Convention will be held in Papua New Guineaearly next year.We welcome Malta’s lodgement last Sunday of itsinstrument of ratification of the Agreement for theImplementation of the Provisions of the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December1982 relating to the Conservation and Management ofStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory FishStocks. The Agreement  which will now come intoforce on 11 December 2001  called on States tocooperate to enhance the ability of developing States in particular the least developed and small islanddeveloping States  to conserve and develop their ownfisheries for such stocks. For all small islanddeveloping States in the Pacific  financing fordevelopment has to be linked to the development oftheir fisheries sector.In order to emphasize my point  I have providedsome data on the last page of my written statement.The Assembly will note that the Central and WesternPacific fishery is valued in excess of $2.5 billion perannum  while the Pacific small island developingStates earn an average of only $66 million per annumin licensing fees. For the small island developing Statesof the Pacific to attain sustainable growth anddevelopment  this situation has to change.Last year my delegation also welcomed theconclusion by the International Seabed Authority of theexploration code for seabed mining. Continuing workis to be undertaken with respect to a code forexploration for polymetallic sulfides and cobalt-richcrusts. Papua New Guinea has particular interest inpolymetallic sulfides.My delegation would like to thank once again theSecretary-General of the International SeabedAuthority  Ambassador Satya Nandan  for his report onthe work of the Authority. We welcome the executionof contracts by pioneer investors and urge theremaining pioneer investor to follow suit as soon aspossible.Papua New Guinea supports the principlescontained in the Barbados Programme of Action and inAgenda 21 of the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development. We continue to supportthe principles contained in the Kyoto Protocol and theUnited Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange. We once again stress the urgent need fordeveloped countries to make a concerted effort toreduce their greenhouse gas emissions.My delegation welcomes the achievements of parttwo of the sixth session of the Conference of theParties to the climate change Convention  held at Bonn33last July  and the successful completion of the recentseventh session of the Conference  held at Marrakesh Morocco.Another of the greatest challenges facing theUnited Nations is to strengthen the capacity of theglobal community to respond promptly and effectivelyto climate change and natural disaster. In 1997  PapuaNew Guinea experienced drought and frost caused byEl Niño and in 1998 came the tsunami and the La Niñaphenomenon  bringing floods and landslides andleaving death and destruction in their wake. Weacknowledge the prompt and generous support of ourneighbours in dealing with the effects of such disasters.Global warming has also brought increased numbers ofcases of diseases such as malaria to the higher-altitudeand most populous region of our country. The threat ofincreased incidence of malaria in that region is real and could negatively affect the demographics of thecountry. There is definitely a link among climatechange  natural disaster and the spread and increasedincidence of disease.Nor is Papua New Guinea exempt from the HIV/AIDS epidemic or from tuberculosis. We are grateful toAustralia and to other partners which have providedassistance in that field of health care. We also welcomeagain last year’s announcement by the JapaneseGovernment that it would set aside substantial financialresources for disease eradication programmes indeveloping countries.The forthcoming International Conference onFinancing for Development and the World Summit forSustainable Development must be platforms forlaunching new and innovative methods for realigningthe policies of the Bretton Woods institutions so thatthey focus more on development and on the eradicationof poverty. There must be a concerted effort to linknew and innovative financial instruments to thedelivery of specific outcome-oriented approaches.There must be flexibility in assisting developingcountries  especially small island  landlocked and leastdeveloped countries. As I have said before  for thepeoples of the Pacific islands to become meaningfulparticipants in the globalization process  new financialinstruments and mechanisms should be developed tofacilitate the transfer of technological capacity andexpertise in the fisheries sector.Papua New Guinea is committed to peacefuldialogue among nations and condemns those thatemploy terrorism against people or that finance  recruitor train terrorists or mercenaries. The barbaric acts of11 September have been described in many ways.Some have called them horrendous  despicable and thework of evil-doers. The use of any adjective to describethe horror and the continuing threat to human securityonly adds to the esteem in which some hold theperpetrators. The use of qualifiers to describe theinnocence of the deceased lends legitimacy to thoseacts and shields the nakedness of their wilful andwrongful nature.Papua New Guinea condemns the 11 Septemberattacks on the United States and supports the ongoingcampaign by the United States and its allies againstterrorism. On behalf of the Government and the peopleof Papua New Guinea  I convey our heartfeltcondolences to the immediate families and otherrelatives of all those who had their lives brutally takenaway from them in New York  Washington  D.C.  andPennsylvania. My Government is committed toimplementing Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)and is in the process of examining all existingconventions relating to terrorism with a view toacceding to them early next year.Papua New Guinea also notes the death severaldays ago of the political leader of the people of theIndonesian province of Irian Jaya  Mr. Theys Eluay under questionable circumstances. As a neighbouringcountry which shares a common border with thatprovince  Papua New Guinea is concerned about thelikely spillover effect of new developments in theprovince. We urge Indonesia to undertake a thorough impartial and transparent investigation into Mr. Eluay’sdeath  to make public the results and to bring to justicethose responsible.My Government is committed to a stable peaceful and environmentally safe world and thereforesupports the objectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and of theComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. We call on allthat have nuclear weapons and other weapons of massdestruction  including biological weapons  to stoptesting  manufacturing and storing them  andfurthermore to take steps to destroy them.We also support efforts to ban transboundarymovements of radioactive and other hazardous wastesthrough the Pacific region. We call on those States thatpreviously conducted nuclear-weapon tests or that have34discharged chemical or other non-degradable wastes inour subregion to adequately compensate and provideappropriate medical assistance to the scores of personsand families affected. Remedial action should be takento clean up the damage done to the environment.Global and regional partnerships to promotechange are the key to addressing the challenges that theworld will face in the twenty-first century. Papua NewGuinea believes that a challenge for Member States isto reshape the Organization so that it can serve as aneffective tool for implementing our collective desire: tomake the global village a better place for all."
"138",5691,"POL",56,2001,"﻿We have just learnedof the crash of an American Airlines plane in NewYork. We the Polish delegation  offer our heartfeltcondolences  and express our sympathy to theGovernment of the United States and the DominicanRepublic and to the families of the victims of thistragedy.At the outset  let me offer Mr. Han my sincerecongratulations on his election to the prestigious officeof the President of the fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly. The delegation of the Republic of Polandextends to him its firm support in his demandingmandate.Let me likewise express to the former President Mr. Harri Holkeri  of Finland  our appreciation for hisremarkable leadership  which he brought to the fifty-fifth session of the Assembly.I should also like to convey to Mr. Kofi Annan the distinguished Secretary-General  my sinceregreetings  and to say how pleased Poland is at hissecond term in that high post. May I also take thisopportunity to renew to him  and indeed to thisOrganization as a whole  my Government'scongratulations on the recent Nobel Peace Prize. Theaward comes as a timely token of appreciation of theway the United Nations and the Secretary-General havebeen meeting their formidable challenge.The appalling tragedy of 11 September calls forresolute reaction of the entire international community for active solidarity with the United States and foreffective counter-measures against those who sowdeath  hatred and terror.The terrorist attack of 11 September  the way itcame about and the circumstances by which it wasconditioned should be seized by the internationalcommunity as an occasion for an in-depth reassessmentof the very foundations of the international order.Preoccupied as we are with ever-new developmentseach day  we tend to be mentally incapable offollowing signals that predict new trends ininternational relations. We have hardly been able toafford the time for searching reflection on  andadjustment to  negative phenomena that  if ignored can  in time  become the breeding ground for upheavalsand conflicts. In this era of enormous new challenges it is time for creative thinking  vision and intellectualcourage.The essence of security has changed dramatically.In Poland's view  all aspects of security need urgent thorough and imaginative reassessment. In this contextparticularly searching reflection must be focused on therole of the State  an entity that operates in entirelynew circumstances in an era of dramatically increasingintegration  globalization and fragmentation. This is atime of interdependence and multiculturalism  in whichopenness  close international cooperation andinteraction should be seen as countermeasures againstdiverse processes of fragmentation and disintegration which can lead us even further towards the nationalism separatism  closure and isolation that loom all around.Fragmentation is creating instability and conflicts. And7the most dangerous fragmentation process of thecurrent era is being generated by the wideningdevelopment gap between regions and States  whichhas been so well attested and documented by manyUnited Nations publications. In this  the role of theUnited Nations is particularly fundamental and crucial.There is no better-equipped and more universal forumto deal with those issues.At the Headquarters of an Organization which thepeoples of the United Nations established 56 years agoin order to maintain international peace and security that axiom should be self-evident. The whole world istrying to respond to the challenges of globalization  thenew scientific revolution  and  quite recently  thedestabilizing forces of terror. The United Nationsshould find adequate answers to those challenges. Thisis a time for collective and resolute action.Perhaps as ominous as terrorism itself is the factthat in some countries  the monstrous acts of violencethat have taken place have been met with somesympathy on the part of those who are destitute deprived of any hope  and who  driven to the marginsof social life  have become frustrated and desperate.Terrorists must never be exculpated or theiractions justified. We need to do away with the reasonswhy many perceive terrorists as present-day RobinHoods. Though such a perception can be described asgroundless  this does not release us from ourresponsibility to take a careful and courageous look atthe phenomena that are emerging in the presentinternational order  which tend to consolidateinequalities and lead to various social calamities.From the very beginning  Poland has proclaimeditself entirely on the side of the international anti-terrorist coalition. We are working seriously anddiligently on the implementation of Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001).Regional undertakings can make a significantcontribution to drafting a global strategy for thestruggle against terrorism. With that in mind  last weekin Warsaw we organized a very successful internationalConference on Combating Terrorism. The Conferencewas attended by representatives of 17 CentralEuropean  Baltic and Balkan States  including 13Presidents. The Conference also provided a directconnection with the White House and President Bush who had the opportunity to talk directly with theConference's participants. The declaration adopted bythe Conference indicates a strong political commitmentto fight against that plague at the dawn of the twenty-first century  in close collaboration with the UnitedStates and the entire international community.The plan of action adopted at that Conferencespells out concrete measures. It is significant that theleaders of that region of Europe gave unanimousbacking to the relevant actions of the United Nations the European Union and other organizations.In the course of Poland's very complicatedhistory  my nation has on several occasions beenbetrayed by disloyal neighbours and allies and has paidthe highest price for this. Therefore we understandbetter than anyone how priceless and crucial trueloyalty and alliances are. Thus we will continue tosupport our friends and allies by all available means.Our principal goal at present is to ease peoples' fears -fears that have been imposed on them by the enemiesof mankind.The horrible scenario in which public order andthe safety of peoples is threatened  passenger planeshijacked and destroyed  deadly viruses spread andwater poisoned must not be repeated. We must defeatthose who participate in  or contribute to creating  sucha threat. Our approach must be a comprehensive one.Let me make it clear: there is no room for anyselectivity  flexibility or relativism when the mostfundamental values of humankind are openly andfuriously attacked.However  we need to reconsider our position onhow to respond to the needs of those millions whoevery day suffer from hunger  disease and a lack ofclean water. For them  the same question arises everymorning  a question that sounds like the classicalphrase to be or not to be. That question is how tosurvive. Extreme poverty deprives people of theirinherent dignity and human rights and of their chancefor a better tomorrow  thus pushing them to takedesperate steps.Let the tragedy of 11 September teach all of us tocollectively combat evil. Let us do everything to ensurethat the forces of darkness never prevail.In the course of the last few years it has beeneloquently argued  from this very rostrum  thatglobalization is a very positive force which willultimately usher in an era of prosperity and stabilityand a global society. Alas  this has not happened.8This calls for a new approach to internationalcooperation  for a new role on the part of multilateralinstitutions  and for the restoration of the primacy ofcourageous political decisions and intergovernmentalaccords. This also calls  on the one hand  for greatermoderation on the part of the strong and the rich  and on the other  for more determined endeavours on thepart of the weak and the poor  who must be convincedthat their consistent aspirations to improve their ownlot will ultimately pay off. In my opinion  thepromotion of democracy and good governance offersone of the most important paths towards such a goal.Poland's own experience in the past 12 years  since thehistoric transformations of 1989  testifies to the meritsof that path.It is my Government's firm view that  in the faceof the threats which will forever be symbolized by theatrocities of 11 September  the interests of internationalsecurity would be well served by the earliest possiblesignature and ratification of  or adherence to  themultilateral conventions against terrorism which havebeen elaborated under the auspices of the UnitedNations. In particular  the spreading anthrax scare which represents but the tip of the iceberg when itcomes to the potential danger of bioterrorism  and thespreading of fissile materials and chemical weapons area powerful argument for the urgent need to strengthenand strictly enforce the Biological WeaponsConvention of 1972 and other legal instruments in thisfield.We should immediately move  to quote theSecretary-General  from a culture of reaction to aculture of prevention.While imperative  the struggle against terrorismmust not obscure the necessity for the United Nationsto effectively discharge the mandate entrusted to it bythe international community  a mandate whose scopeis expanding over the years. This is not only true withrespect to the international security problems which Ihave just referred to  but also concerns problemsrelated to socio-economic cooperation  the protectionof human rights and humanitarian issues  particularlythose concerning refugees and the protection of theenvironment.Also of major importance  in our view  is theelaboration and adoption of a package of regulationsand commitments in respect of development aid indebtedness and trade. Thus I wish to emphasize theimportance of the full implementation of the set ofprinciples and practical measures embodied in theMillennium Declaration. We are mindful  of course that the translation of that programme into practicalsteps cannot be the responsibility of the United Nationsalone. It is essential for other institutions andorganizations  including financial  trade and regionalones  to help in that effort. Above all  individual Statesmust become directly involved  otherwise the smoothand timely implementation of the MillenniumDeclaration could be seriously jeopardized.The United Nations is now facing enormous andunprecedented challenges. These challenges ñ arisingas they do at the dawn of the new millennium - meangrowing divisions and  indeed  pose a risk offragmentation of the international community.My country  Poland  is ready to be an activeparticipant in the process of searching for a new rolefor the United Nations. We have been active throughoutthe entire history of the United Nations  and we want tobe active in the immediate future as well."
"139",5717,"PRK",56,2001,"﻿I congratulate you  Sir once again on your election as President of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I also wish toexpress high appreciation to Mr. Harri Holkeri  whocarried out his duties as President of the fifty-fifthsession of the General Assembly in an excellentmanner. I would like to take this opportunity to extendwarm congratulations again to Mr. Kofi Annan on hisre-election as Secretary-General of the United Nations.Last year  heads of State and Governmentthroughout the world held the Millennium Summit in33this Hall and committed themselves to building apeaceful and prosperous world in the new century. Thatgave high hope and expectations to all people of theworld. However  the developments that are now takingplace on the globe overshadow possibleimplementation of the Millennium Summitcommitments. The principles of respect for nationalsovereignty and equality that constitute a cornerstoneof international relations are being undermined bycertain forces that consider strength as the means toachieve everything. As long as there is acquiescence toacts of arbitrary power that seek to destroy strategicstability and hold absolute supremacy by establishing amissile defence system in defiance of internationalopposition  the world will be engulfed in another coldwar and arms race.The problem of the Korean peninsula alwayscomes up as one of the major issues in deliberations onglobal peace and security. That is because of the powerpolicy and arbitrary actions directed in most casesagainst the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Weare exposed to constant threats from huge armedforces  including nuclear weapons  deployed around theKorean peninsula on the pretext of an alleged threatfrom North Korea  and that is the main source ofinstability on the Korean peninsula and in the Asia-Pacific region. That notwithstanding  we have beenable firmly to defend the dignity and sovereignty of thecountry on our own in the face of the offensive byhostile forces  and under difficult conditionsresembling an arduous march  unprecedented in ourhistory  thus contributing to the peace and security ofthe region. That is entirely attributable to theoutstanding army-first policies of the respected GeneralKim Jong Il. The great leader General Kim Jong Ilconducted active diplomacy  including his visit toChina and Russia and his meeting with the top-leveldelegation of the European Union this year  and thusmade a great contribution to developing overallinternational relations and strengthening global peaceand security.In particular  the summit meetings and talksbetween the Democratic People’s Republic of Koreaand Russia and the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea and China resulted in the adoption of documentsreflecting shared views on strengthening the leadingrole of the United Nations in resolving majorinternational issues  ensuring strategic balance  and soon. This serves as an historic milestone in establishinga fair  new world  based on the principles of mutualrespect and cooperation for mutual benefit. We will  asever  firmly defend our sovereignty and the socialistsystem of our country and advance convincingly alongthe road chosen by ourselves under the army-firstleadership of the respected General Kim Jong Il.It is the unanimous desire of all Korean people toreunify the divided country at the earliest possible date.Last year  the inter-Korean summit meeting was heldand the North-South Joint Declaration issued for thefirst time in the history of the national division  thanksto the idea of national independence and great nationalunity of the great leader  Comrade Kim Jong Il. TheJoint Declaration reflects the will and aspirations of theKorean people to achieve reunification independentlyby pooling the efforts of the nation. It enjoys widesupport and is welcomed by the internationalcommunity. The General Assembly  at its fifty-fifthsession  unanimously adopted the resolution supportingthe Joint Declaration. With the publication of the JointDeclaration  the enthusiasm for reunification wasmanifested throughout the Korean peninsula anddialogues and contacts in various fields took placebetween the North and the South of Korea. Itdemonstrated that the Korean nation could well openthe door to reunification by itself  if the North and theSouth make joint efforts with sincere will forindependent reunification. However  inter-Koreanrelations and the implementation of the 15 June JointDeclaration  which were proceeding well and in theright direction  now face a big obstacle due to the hard-line  hostile policy and unjust interference of the newUnited States Administration against the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea.The half-century history of national division and in particular  experiences during the past year  clearlyshow that the North and South of Korea should  aboveall  adhere to a stance of national independence if theyare to implement the North-South Joint Declaration.Only when the North and South collaborate as onenation will they open up a bright future for the nation without becoming a victim of outside forces. The mostimportant element in implementing the North-SouthJoint Declaration and achieving peace and reunificationon the Korean peninsula is to put an end to the hostilepolicy and interference of the United States against theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. It is totallyirrational to say that the United States deploys hugearmed forces in and around the Korean peninsula and34conducts large-scale military exercises against us toadvance peace  self-defensive measures taken by mycountry to cope with the United States military threat isa threat to peace. Our missile programme is of a purelypeaceful nature and does not pose a threat to anycountry that respects the sovereignty of the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea.It makes no sense for the United States to arguethat it needs to establish a missile defence system outof fear of our missiles while itself possessingthousands of nuclear bombs and missiles that couldextinguish humankind many times over. That argumentonly covers up the United States strategy to gaindomination of the world  based on superior power.Since the cold war is over and the North and South ofKorea are proceeding towards reconciliation andcooperation in accordance with the 15 June JointDeclaration  there is neither reason nor any otherground whatsoever for United States troops to remainin the South of Korea. Withdrawal of United Statestroops from South Korea is an urgent issue whosesolution should not brook any further delay in theinterest of ensuring peace and security on the Koreanpeninsula and in North-East Asia. Dialogue should beconducted on a fair and equal basis. Resumption of theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea-United Statesof America dialogue will only be possible when thepresent United States Administration gets rid of itscold-war mentality and adopts a stance at least at thelevel of the one taken by the Clinton Administration inthe last period of its term of office.During the past two years  we have establishedofficial relations with almost all member States of theEuropean Union (EU) and diplomatic relations with theEU itself  and countries of other regions as well  on thebasis of the principles of respect for sovereignty andequality. We are also ready to develop relations withthe United States on the principles of equality andmutual benefit if the United States respects oursovereignty and freedom of choice  takes an attitude ofgood will towards us on an equal footing  and refrainsfrom obstructing the reunification of Korea.Another factor of instability that casts a darkshadow on the future development of the Koreanpeninsula and its surroundings is the orientation ofJapanese moves  that is  the ultra-rightist inclination ofJapan and its undisguised attempt to revive militarism.My delegation wishes to draw the attention of allMember States to this matter at this session of theGeneral Assembly held in the first year of the twenty-first century. The Japanese authorities are not willing toterminate their past crimes against humanity  but tryinstead to justify them  openly visiting the YasukuniShrine  where the departed souls of the war criminalsare enshrined  distorting history textbooks for newgenerations and legalizing the overseas advance of theJapanese self-defence force.On 29 August  Japan test-fired an H-2A large-sizedelivery rocket that could easily be converted into anintercontinental ballistic missile. That is a clearindication that the militarism of Japan has becomepoliticized and is proceeding to an open and dangerousstage.Japan  which has always stigmatized our peacefulsatellite launch as a missile launch  said openly that itstest-fire of the rocket was done to cope with NorthKorea’s missile  thus invoking military confrontation.Japan should not misjudge our moratorium on satellitelaunches and the peaceful character of our missileprogramme. We strongly urge Japan to look squarely atreality; put an end to its past inhumane crimes  andsincerely turn to the road of peace in this new century.That will be good for the future of Japan.The most important task of Member States todayis to strengthen the central role of the United Nationswith regard to international issues. It is essential thatMember States honour and implement the UnitedNations Charter in good faith. The United NationsCharter enshrines the purposes and principles fordeveloping friendly international relations on the basisof sovereign equality. However  certain countries donot hesitate to undertake unilateral coercive actions andeven resort to the use of force against sovereign States ignoring and violating the United Nations Charter.Member States should reject any attempt that goesagainst the United Nations Charter and other principlesand norms of international law  and should strive toestablish a fair  new world structure based on the ruleof law  equality  mutual respect and cooperation formutual benefit  with a view to ensuring world securityand stability. If the leading role of the United Nationsin dealing with global issues is to be strengthened  theUnited Nations should be reformed in a democraticway. In this regard  we are of the view that it isessential to strengthen the authority of the GeneralAssembly. The General Assembly must be empoweredto consider issues relating to world peace and securityand approve major resolutions of the Security Council35on these issues. Reform of the Security Council shouldbe pursued in the context of strengthening the authorityof the General Assembly. We hold that the SecurityCouncil reform should be undertaken in full conformitywith its intrinsic purpose. The Security Council reformmust ensure enough representation of the developingcountries and full fairness in United Nations activitiesfor achieving international peace and security. Weplace on record our strong opposition to considering inany manner the permanent membership of Japan on theSecurity Council when it has neither put an end to norrecognized its past crimes  and while no agreement hasyet been reached on increasing the number ofpermanent members.One of the major challenges to the UnitedNations and its Member States today is global poverty which grows ever more serious. Poverty  which hasresulted from colonialism in the past  continues to beaggravated due to the inequitable internationalmonetary systems and neo-colonial policies. It alsobecomes a factor that begets conflicts  diseases andhunger and hampers the independent and creative lifeof peoples and their enjoyment of the right todevelopment. If poverty is to be eradicated  a fair andequitable international economic order should beestablished and sustainable development ensured. Wewill have to draw due lessons from the demonstrationsin Genoa last July and properly handle the issue ofglobalization. In this regard  it should be underlinedthat the developed countries and the internationalfinancial institutions assume big responsibilities. TheUnited Nations should encourage Member States todirect their attention to considering more practicalmeasures for eradicating poverty and achievingdevelopment.It is the consistent and principled position of theGovernment of the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea to oppose support  of whatever kind  to anyforms of terrorism. The large-scale terrorist incidentthat occurred in the United States on 11 September wasvery regrettable and tragic and reminds us of thegravity of terrorism. The situation in Afghanistan isnow grave  where instability and unprecedented humanloss and material damage are brought about by themilitary operation of the United States. The prevailingsituation requires that the leading role of the UnitedNations in preventing terrorism be definitelystrengthened and the national obligations for theelimination of terrorism be fully discharged by allMember States.Yesterday we signed the International Conventionfor the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism andacceded to the International Convention against theTaking of Hostages. That shows that we are makingevery possible effort to eliminate terrorism in theworld. As already stated  the aim of our opposingterrorism is to promote global peace and stability defend the sovereignty of the country and nation andprotect the lives and property of the peoples of theworld. We are strongly of the view that imposing thelabel of terrorist on countries that advocate sovereignequality  while violating their sovereignty andinflicting immeasurable pain on the people by resortingto arbitrary armed intervention  sanctions  and so on should in no way be tolerated. There is no justificationin any case for the use of force or resorting to war andtaking innocent lives  undermining the situation anddestroying stability in the fight against terrorism.My delegation wishes to reaffirm that theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea will continueto cooperate fully with all Member States to upholdand implement the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter under the ideas ofindependence  peace and friendship."
"140",5762,"PRT",56,2001,"﻿English text furnished by the delegation): It is withgreat pleasure that I congratulate Mr. Han Seung-sooon his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly. I also pay tribute to the outgoing President Mr. Harri Holkeri. I renew my respects to theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for the notable andcourageous way in which he has continued to fulfil hismandate and for the well-deserved award of the NobelPeace Prize to him and to the United Nations.18My Belgian colleague has already addressed theAssembly on behalf of the 15 States members of theEuropean Union in a statement with which my countryaligns itself completely. I would  however  like toreflect upon certain issues on the international agenda.First  I cannot fail to refer to the tragic terroristattacks of 11 September against the United States  andin particular against the city of New York and innocentcitizens of many nationalities. I reiterate our deepsorrow and reaffirm our complete solidarity with allthose who  like us Portuguese  were victimized by theloss of their compatriots and by the suffering of thebereaved families.We are dealing with violence without a face violence that kills indiscriminately and that must beconfronted by the international community as a whole irrespective of the religion we practice  the race towhich we belong  the ideology we follow or thecivilization into which we were born. It falls to eachand every State Member of the United Nations to fightthis scourge  whose blind hatred has plunged the worldinto a state of turmoil not seen since the end of theSecond World War. What is most shocking to us is thefact that we are faced with a force that ignores ordespises the very concept of the right to life.We must embark on a concerted effort at alllevels to submit to justice those guilty of the crimescommitted  with a view to avoiding a repetition of theterrorist acts of September. We believe the UnitedNations has an irreplaceable role to play as the sourceof legitimacy for the collective effort of theinternational community in the fight against thiscommon enemy. It is for other forums to complementthese actions  orienting and adjusting them inaccordance with the concrete needs of their respectivemandates.In this context  I would like to recall that Portugalhas supported without reservation the internationalfight against terrorism here in the United Nations  inthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization  in theEuropean Union  in the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and in our bilateralrelations with the United States and other countries. Iwould like to assure the Assembly that in itspresidency of the OSCE next year  Portugal willattribute particular priority to this matter.In the light of the current circumstances  I muststress the importance of the entire range ofinternational legislation produced  or awaitingapproval  under the aegis of the United Nations in thearea of the fight against terrorism: the 12 conventionswhose ratification and implementation make themcrucial weapons in preventing and fighting against thisscourge. Because of its particular significance at thistime  I refer specifically to the work of the GeneralAssembly on the draft global convention on terrorism.The great efforts made by the great majority ofdelegations in search of compromise solutions bearwitness to a renewed convergence of wills in pursuit ofthis common goal. We should take advantage of thecurrent momentum of collective commitment to reachthe speedy completion of this essential instrument.Portugal has already signed 11 of the 12international conventions against terrorism and isstrongly committed to fully implementing theirprovisions. Yesterday we deposited our instrument ofratification for the International Convention for theSuppression of Terrorist Bombings  and shortly we willdeposit our instrument of ratification for the Protocolfor the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence atAirports Serving International Civil Aviation. Wewelcome the adoption of Security Council resolutions1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001)  which are fundamentalinstruments for the cohesion of the internationalcommunity in its legitimate fight against terrorism. Iwould also like to highlight the measures containedtherein for the fight against terrorist financing — anabsolutely crucial area.As I have already stated  Portugal has supportedfrom the beginning the international campaign underway in Afghanistan  which has been legitimized by thedeliberations of the United Nations. Those responsiblefor the terrorist acts that claimed the lives of thousandsof innocent civilians on 11 September must be capturedand tried  and their military infrastructure must beeliminated. In our view  the principles guiding theintervention in Afghanistan should include thepreservation of territorial integrity and the unity of thecountry  as well as the establishment of a broadlysupported  multi-ethnic and representativeGovernment.We believe that  from the very start  the Afghanpeople should be associated with the reconstruction oftheir country  which has been devastated in recent yearsby a brutal regime that is not recognizedinternationally. The international community should19spare no efforts in alleviating the serious humanitariansituation affecting the Afghan people.Finally  let me reiterate that the PortugueseGovernment unequivocally supports the effortsundertaken by the United Nations  and in particular bythe Special Representative of the Secretary-General Mr. Lakdar Brahimi  in envisioning a transitionalgovernmental structure and in planning a possibleUnited Nations mission on the ground. In a post-Taliban scenario  the United Nations will be calledupon to take a decisive role in the reconstruction ofAfghanistan as well as in the establishment of peacefulrelations between Afghanistan and its neighbours.The United Nations plays an indispensable role inthe prevention of conflicts  the maintenance ofinternational peace and security and the reconstructionof territories devastated by war. Numerous conflicts areawaiting resolution and constitute a considerablechallenge to the international community’s capacity toguarantee their peaceful and definitive settlement.The situation in the Middle East  specifically inPalestine  is the most worrisome  placing eveninternational security at risk. The internationalcommunity can spare no efforts to ensure that Israeland the Palestinians return to the path of dialogue.Only there will a solution be found that is just  both forthe Palestinian people — who have fought for decadesfor the recognition of their homeland  an inalienableand undeniable right  and for dignified livingconditions within a sovereign and responsiblePalestinian State — and for Israel  which has an equalright to live in security in the region and at peace withits neighbours.As another example of international conflicts thatdrag on  apparently with no definitive resolution insight  my country profoundly regrets the continuationof the armed conflict in Angola and its severehumanitarian consequences. Portugal reaffirms itscommitment to and support for the search for apolitical solution to this problem  in line with theprovisions of the Acordos de Paz  the Lusaka Protocoland the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. Itis essential that the commitments undertaken withregard to the international community  and principallywith regard to the Angolan people  be respected.Portugal encourages the Angolan Government toredouble its efforts to achieve national reconciliation.We also encourage the introduction of political andeconomic reforms in Angola  with a view toreinforcing in particular the legitimacy of itsrepresentative and pluralistic institutions and thestrengthening of the credibility of its monetary andfinancial structures.We also appeal for a return to political means onthe part of those — such as the sector that inspires themore radical line of UNITA — that have resorted tomethods  namely violence against civilians  that haveplaced them outside the international community. Infact  the absence of constructive proposals — includingwith regard to a ceasefire or the cessation of offensiveoperations — does not contribute to theimplementation of possible platforms for dialogue which the current situation demands.We praise the important and increasingcontribution made by Angolan society  particularly itschurches  to peace and reconciliation. We believe that aUnited Nations presence in Angola continues to beessential and should be encouraged.In that vein  I would like to actively encouragethe Secretary-General to intensify all possible efforts torelaunch the peace process in Angola with a view tothe adequate implementation of the Lusaka Protocol  sothat that great country can finally guarantee tranquillityto its citizens and recover its standing and the role towhich it is entitled in international life  fully takingpart in achieving the objectives of the Africanrenaissance. I am certain that the troika of observerStates  as well as the African regional organizationsand the European Union  will firmly support thecontribution of the Secretary-General to a definitiveresolution of the Angolan issue.When the international community successfullyintervenes in a conflict  it should not be turned asidefrom the consolidation of the solutions reached. TheUnited Nations has the responsibility of maintaining anappropriate level of involvement until the definitiveconclusion of the peace process  so as not to put at riskthe investments made and expectations created. TheUnited Nations should proceed without hesitation insupporting the creation of viable nations.I welcome the Security Council’s endorsement ofthis understanding with regard to East Timor  on 31October. The international community cannot neglectthe consolidation of the solutions achieved in EastTimor  whose transition to independence is  in fact  aclear case of success for the United Nations and a20special reason for pride for the Community ofPortuguese-Speaking Countries. I take this opportunityto underline that this entire process has been conductedin an exemplary manner by the United NationsTransitional Administration in East Timor under theleadership of Sergio Vieira de Mello.The work of the United Nations towards theconsolidation of a new and indisputably sovereign democratic and economically viable State onlyreinforces the credibility of the Organization at a timein international life when its inspiration and leadershipare more needed than ever before to correctly managethe great global challenges of the twenty-first century."
"141",5808,"PRY",56,2001,"﻿As I begin my statement in the general debate  allowme to express to you  Mr. Han Seung-soo  Minister forForeign Affairs of the Republic of Korea  the pleasureof my delegation at seeing you preside over the workof this session of the General Assembly. Your personaland professional qualities  with which we are familiar will ensure the success of our work. Your election isalso recognition of the sisterly Republic of Korea  acountry with which we have close links of cooperationand friendship. You can be sure of the steadfast anddetermined support of the delegation of Paraguay asyou carry out your duties.Likewise  I would like to take this opportunity torecognize the work being done by the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Kofi Annan  who wasrecently honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize for hisdedication to the cause of the United Nations  which ispeace itself. We are certain that under his leadership the efforts of the United Nations will reach all peoplesand the Organization will adapt itself to the new realityand important challenges imposed on us by the contextof international politics.Allow me today  two months after the tragic andcondemnable events of 11 September  to reiterate thesolidarity of my Government and of the people of theRepublic of Paraguay with the Government and peopleof the United States and state our unswervingcommitment to the fight against terrorism in all itsmanifestations. The Republic of Paraguay is not neutralin the face of such a cowardly crime  and it willcontinue to support all the efforts of this Organizationand the international community to put a definitive endto these crimes against humanity. We must not confineourselves exclusively to demonstrations of solidarity6and condemnation. We must make definitecommitments to the international consensus that hasbeen built in order to face this grave threat to humanity.This general debate is taking place incircumstances that would have been unimaginable to usand that have reminded us of our vulnerability toindividuals and groups of individuals that commitindiscriminate violent acts that are totally unjustified inthe minds or feelings of civilized human beings. Wemust also recall that the theme of internationalterrorism has been on our Organization’s agenda sincethe twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly and since then to date we have not been sufficientlydiligent in taking the legal and collective securitymeasures necessary to prevent events such as those weare belatedly regrettingThe urgent fight against terrorism in all itsmanifestations  which should not be interpreted as aclash of civilizations or of religious beliefs  is the toppriority on our international agenda  and we cannotassert that any country is free of the danger posed byinternational terrorism. Rarely in history have therebeen such grave challenges to international peace andsecurity like the one we face today — a fact whichforces us take clear and firm positions that are inkeeping with the provisions of the Charter and theprevailing norms of international law. Not only isinternational security at stake today  but so is thedemocratic system itself  which represents victory anduniversal good in its constant aspiration to and strugglefor freedom and justice.Immediately after these events  my Governmentstrengthened internal measures required by thecircumstances so as to be able to exercise greatercontrol and security over movements into and out ofthe country  while respecting the principle of the freemovement of persons.Mindful of its responsibility and consistent withthe commitment made as a Member of thisOrganization  the Republic of Paraguay  by a decree ofthe executive branch of 24 October 2001  establishedan inter-ministerial commission to implementresolution 1373 (2001)  recently adopted by theSecurity Council. The Republic’s judicial andlegislative branches and the Attorney General’s officewere called on to designate various governmentaldivision representatives. The commission was installedon 6 November 2001  under the coordination of theMinistry for Foreign Relations.A draft law is also currently under considerationby the judicial branch  which defines and sets penaltiesfor the crime of terrorism  and it enjoys the full supportof the executive branch.On 12 October 2001  Paraguay signed theInternational Convention for the Suppression of theFinancing of Terrorism  which is being referred to theNational Congress for adoption. The nationalGovernment has embarked on constitutional proceduresso that the other conventions on this matter to which itis still not a party will be signed and ratified or adheredto as soon as possible.We also expect the early adoption by the GeneralAssembly of the two conventions on terrorism  whichare under discussion in the Ad Hoc Committee createdfor this purpose in the Sixth Committee. We must notwait for a replay of the events of 11 September in orderto accelerate our strengthening of the internationallegal framework. The time we delay in strengtheningour legal framework will be an opportunity for theterrorists to increase their capacity and expand theircriminal activities to other countries.Within the framework of the Organization ofAmerican States (OAS)  we have participated with fullconviction in deciding on actions and formulatingdecisions that were recently adopted during theconsultative meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs.In the context of our regional association — theCommon Market Southern Cone (MERCOSUR) — on28 September 2001  it was decided to undertake thebroadest possible cooperation among its members inorder to carry out information exchange  studies concerted actions against terrorist acts and theestablishment of an open-ended working group toappraise and devise common policies in the fightagainst terrorism.In recent weeks we have experienced once againa new terrorist threat  and I am referring particularly tothe use of biological agents  whose effects could reacha planetary level and threaten humanity itself as awhole. This new criminal practice compels us to reactas rapidly and energetically as possible and bedetermined in all our efforts to uncover the perpetratorsand their sponsors  who are acting in anonymity.7International concern and actions generated bythe events of September must also prompt us to reflectand evaluate other themes of transcendental importanceon our agenda  such as the fight against poverty  theneed to strengthen international economic cooperationfor development  access to markets and informationand communication technologies by the developingcountries so that the imbalances that still characterizeinternational relations may become less severe.Achieving the goals set in the MillenniumDeclaration  along with other commitments enteredinto in the context of development in the variousforums of our Organization  must continue to be one ofour greatest and urgent challenges in coming years.For this reason  we fully concur with the pointmade by the Secretary-General in his report on thework of the Organization that the most difficult battlefacing the international community is the eradication ofpoverty — which is exactly why we must speed up theeconomic growth of the developing countries. We trustthat the International Conference on Financing forDevelopment  to be held next year in Monterrey Mexico  will achieve the desired results. To this end we believe that consideration must be given to theclear-cut differences among existing levels ofdevelopment  to the unevenness that prevails in thecapacity of countries to participate in internationalprocesses and  in this regard  to the special situation oflandlocked countries  which  because of the nature oftheir territory  face greater difficulties in engaging inexternal trade  thus putting a brake on their economicdevelopment.It is our hope that the final outcome of thatConference will not be confined solely and exclusivelyto a mere political declaration or expression of wishes.We hope that it will set clear objectives and goals toensure that the globalization process  rather thanwidening the existing gap between rich and poor  willpromote the development of all nations within aninclusive and equitable framework.Given the new challenges and changes that havearisen since the beginning of the new millennium  wereaffirm our commitment to the urgent need tostrengthen our Organization  underscoring first andforemost the central role that should be played by theGeneral Assembly as the most representative  universaland equitable deliberative organ. We should not allowthe General Assembly to become a mere meeting placewhere we participate in order to fulfil a routinefunction within a pre-established timetable of work.Speeding up reform of the Security Council isanother of the key aspects in strengthening the UnitedNations. The Council should become a moredemocratic  representative and transparent organ sothat it can strike a better political balance. This processshould provide for an increase in both permanent andnon-permanent members  so as to secure a better levelof participation for developing countries which  at thepresent time  are under-represented. Likewise webelieve that  in the area of transparency of theCouncil’s activities  it is appropriate to establishinteractive machinery involving the other MemberStates of the Organization so that they will have greateraccess to the Council’s work. For this reason  we havewelcomed the briefing meetings that the Chairman ofthe Special Committee established pursuant to SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) is giving to otherMembers of the Organization.Another outstanding issue that needs to beresolved by our Organization  and one that gives usutmost concern in view of the recent increase inviolence and loss of life  is the situation in the MiddleEast. We believe that both the General Assembly andthe Security Council should redouble their efforts toarrive at a solution that will respond to the rightfulaspirations of the parties concerned. It should includerecognition of Israel’s existence within secure andwell-defined borders and the Palestinian people’s fullenjoyment of the right to have its own homeland. Weneed to tackle this issue firmly and resolutely  ensuringthat we work together with the necessary political willto contribute to international peace and security.My country  Paraguay  also hopes that other areasof tension in the world may be settled. In this regard mindful of the principle of universality enshrined inour Charter  we advocate a solution to the question ofthe Republic of China and Taiwan within theframework of the norms of international law.The current economic and social state of affairs and its consequences  obliges us to mobilize efficiently with the greatest possible degree of responsibility andsolidarity  the cooperation required from the developedcountries and the international financial institutions totackle the challenges that we  as leaders  face when wetry to create conditions of equal opportunity for paidemployment  and when we seek to eliminate income8inequities that undermine social stability  and toprovide for basic care and services for our peoples andfor the sustainable development of our countries.In conclusion  we are aware today  more thanever  of the need to begin a process that allows us towork together in a rational way to build a moresupportive and participatory new economic worldorder  the ultimate purpose of which would be topromote development and well-being for all of ourpeoples  once and for all. In this regard  I wish toexpress my Government’s utter conviction that thecurrent international situation underscores theimportance of this process beginning and ending withinthe sphere of the United Nations  thus ensuring fullparticipation in it of all Member States."
"142",5827,"PSE",56,2001,"﻿I wouldlike to begin by extending my congratulations to you Mr. President  on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at this session. I would also like toextend my congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on hisre-election to a second term as Secretary-General of theUnited Nations. I also wish to congratulate him and theUnited Nations on being awarded the Nobel PeacePrize.It is important for me to be here today at thismeeting  which is being held in very critical andimportant circumstances in the aftermath of thehorrific  criminal and ugly terrorist acts against thecities of New York and Washington  D.C.  on 11September 2001. We strongly condemn those acts. Inthis context  I would once more like to extend ourdeepest and warmest sympathy to President George W.Bush and to the Government and the friendly people ofthe United States. In particular  I wish to express mycondolences to the families of the victims.The Palestinian people have expressed theirreadiness to confront all forms and manifestations ofinternational terrorism  including State-organizedterror  in order to build a new world that guaranteesjustice  peace  security and freedom for all peoples — anew world based on human rights and internationallegality. We call on all nations to coordinate theirefforts within the framework of the United Nations andinternational legality and the need to pursue andencourage a dialogue between all nations  religions andcivilizations.I would like to express my deepest appreciationto President George W. Bush for the declarationcontained in the statement he made yesterday withregard to the need to achieve a just peace based on theimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242(1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and on the basis ofa two-State solution — Israel and Palestine — and withregard to expeditiously resuming the peace process.For our part  we will exert every possible effort toachieve those objectives. We have worked to providethe best possible conditions for that endeavour  and wewill continue to do so.I would also like to salute  and extend myappreciation to  all my brothers who have preceded meand clearly and eloquently made references to thequestion of the Palestinian people and their right torealize their legitimate rights under internationallegality.Last year I had the honour of addressing theUnited Nations Millennium Summit. Today I am onceagain addressing the Assembly  bringing the pain of thePalestinian people and their just cause  which stillawaits a just solution. As Members will recall  in 1947the General Assembly adopted resolution 181 (III) which provided for the partition of Palestine into twoStates — one Jewish and the other Palestinian. But thePalestinian State has still not been recognized by theUnited Nations. The Palestinian people facedtremendous historic injustice  and the majority of themwere uprooted from their homes and made refugees.The Palestinian people continue to seek theirrights to self-determination and return — rights thattoday form the backbone of all relevant SecurityCouncil and General Assembly resolutions  theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  international33law and international humanitarian law and that shouldbe exercised on the Palestinian national soil. Membersare aware that we have accepted the solution providedfor by international legality. Yes  we have accepted lessthan 25 per cent of historic Palestine  while the GeneralAssembly granted us almost 50 per cent of historicPalestine  as provided for in resolution 181 (III). Onthis new approach  we went to the Madrid PeaceConference  which was based on the principle of “landfor peace” and which had the objective ofimplementing all relevant international resolutionsrelated to Palestine  particularly Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973)  425 (1978) andGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III) concerning thePalestinian refugees. Then we signed the OsloAgreement at the White House in Washington  D.C.  inthe presence of and witnessed by representatives of theUnited States of America  the Russian Federation  theEuropean Union  China  Japan  Egypt  Jordan and othercountries  including Arab  African  Asian and LatinAmerica States.Later we signed a number of agreements andmemorandums of understanding. After theassassination of my late partner  Mr. Yitzhak Rabin —my partner in the peace process — consecutive IsraeliGovernments clearly took the path of non-complianceand did not implement Israel’s obligations stemmingfrom the signed agreements. This impeded our sincereefforts to reach a comprehensive  just and lastingpeace — the peace of the brave. The number ofsettlements and settlers has doubled since the start ofthe peace process. This reflects the lack of seriousnessof the Israeli Government and its lack of commitmentto the agreements signed between us.Then came Sharon’s visit to the holy sanctuary inHoly Jerusalem. I had personally and officially warnedthe Israeli Government of the grave consequences thatwould have on the peace process and the region. Thisaction sparked the Palestinian intifada  reflecting therejection by the Palestinian people of the IsraeliGovernment’s non-compliance with the agreementssigned  the settlement policies  which deepen theoccupation rather than end it by withdrawing from theoccupied Palestinian territory  and its policies ofundermining our Christian and Muslim Holy Places.The current Israeli Government continues theaggression against the Palestinian people begun by theprevious Government. State terror is being practisedagainst the Palestinian people and land  using the mightof the Israeli army  including F-15s  F-16s  Apachehelicopters  tanks  missiles  armoured vehicles  navyvessels and lethal weapons  including those that areinternationally banned. Practices of the Israeli armyalso include the assassination of Palestinian politicalleaders  the demolition of homes  the destruction ofprivate and government institutions  ruining farms andfields and uprooting hundreds of thousands of oliveand fruit trees  as well as the killing of women children and the elderly. There have beenapproximately 1 800 Palestinians killed and 37 000wounded. Many of them have been handicapped forlife. Thousands have been arrested in only 13 months.It should also be noted that the Palestinianeconomy has been devastated. The losses amount to$7 billion as a result of all forms of economic financial  medical and food closures and siegesimposed on all the Palestinian cities  villages andrefugee camps. These practices continue to restrict themovement of goods and people  including students andteachers who are prevented from reaching their schoolsand universities. All these acts of closure and siegehave recently been tightened. Our internationalborders  checkpoints and airports have been closed. Allthese measures violate outright basic human rights.Workers have also been prevented from reaching theirwork places  their means to sustain their families andchildren.Facing this aggression  escalation and the bloodywar of State terror being waged by the IsraeliGovernment against our people  land  Holy Places  —Jerusalem in particular — and Bethlehem  Beit Jala Hebron and other Palestinian towns  the incursion intoour cities  villages and refugee camps with tanks andthe brutal massacres committed in various locations inthe West Bank and the Gaza Strip  we call on theinternational community  as represented by all present and on the peace-  freedom- and justice-loving peoplewho defend human rights and dignity throughout theworld to work sincerely and resolutely and to exert allpossible efforts to stop this war of aggression and tosend international observers to protect our people fromthe occupation  terror and ethnic cleansing practised byIsrael and to supervise the implementation and theconsolidation of the ceasefire  by which we are abidingand which has been consistently violated by the IsraeliGovernment.International sponsorship of the Middle Eastpeace process is the only true guarantee for efforts by34the international community to make peace anestablished reality in our region. The absence ofinternational involvement in this conflict — in theserious search for a solution to the Palestinian question in accordance with justice and the principles ofinternational law — will push the region back into aspiral of violence  confrontation and bloodshed andcould make the situation more explosive and fragile.Therefore  I call upon the internationalcommunity to redouble its sincere efforts to end thecurrent situation and the escalating crisis that  in theabsence of the peace process  threatens to explode with grave consequences for our region. The activeinvolvement of the international community and theinfluential Great Powers is essential to save the peaceprocess and to put it back on the right track  to move itforward sincerely  resolutely and effectively. Lastingpeace will not be achieved or sustained withoutinternational legality to provide an effective andbinding international mechanism to implement therelevant Security Council and General Assemblyresolutions. The accurate and honest implementation ofthese resolutions will establish and sustain peace andwill prevent bloodshed in our region.Proceeding from our belief in peace as anirreversible strategic choice of our people  we havecooperated fully and positively with all internationalefforts and initiatives  including the Egyptian-Jordanian initiative  the Tenet Understandings and theMitchell Report  which we accepted as acomprehensive  integrated package. We have alsounilaterally declared an immediate comprehensiveceasefire  and we have exerted maximum efforts tosustain that ceasefire. On the eve of the Jewish NewYear  we initiated the Palestinian call for peace  offeredour sincere congratulations to the Israeli people andcalled upon them to make the New Year an occasionfor a new era of peace  security and peacefulcoexistence between the Palestinian and Israeli peoplesand the peoples of the whole Middle East region. Wemade very clear and unequivocal our strategiccommitment to peace  negotiations and the politicalsolution to all outstanding issues between us and theGovernment of Israel.Most regrettably  the Israeli Governmentinstructed its war generals and army to escalate themilitary campaign against our people  cities  villagesand refugee camps. This included the buffer zones andthe siege that closed off wide areas of cities  villagesand cultivated lands and led to the destruction of ourfarms and the uprooting of thousands of trees invarious places in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.Allow me to extend my deepest appreciation andto salute sincerely all the brotherly  friendly nationsand to the Great Powers that have realized today  morethan ever before  that the establishment of anindependent Palestinian State  with Holy Jerusalem asits capital  is the only guarantee for peace  security andstability in the region and the world. This constitutes abasic cornerstone in establishing and sustaining thatpeace.We call upon these nations  particularly theUnited States  the United Kingdom  the RussianFederation  France  China  Japan  the members of theEuropean Union and the non-aligned countries  theinternational community  individually and collectively to exert every possible effort to translate this visioninto action and political reality in order to enable thePalestinian people to live in peace  dignity  freedom independence and sovereignty within their independentState on their national soil  with Holy Jerusalem as itscapital. This can be achieved by bringing Israel  theoccupying Power  to withdraw fully from all of theoccupied Palestinian and Arab territories  includingHoly Jerusalem  to the boundaries of 4 June 1967  inaccordance with the principles of the Madrid PeaceConference  to end settlement activities and evacuatesettlers from our land  and to guarantee the right ofreturn to the Palestinian refugees  in accordance withGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III)  which providedfor this right and called for compensation to those notwishing to return.We welcome the positive positions taken byPresident George W. Bush and other leaders who havecalled for the establishment of a Palestinian State. Webelieve this constitutes a significant step towardsending the conflict and establishing peace in theMiddle East. I will say candidly to you that revivingand completing the peace process will need a newqualitative push  and after all that has happened it willnot be possible to confine ourselves to interimsolutions. It is impossible  of course  to achieve anotherinterim agreement  as called for by some. To controlthe situation on the ground and to get the situation backto the way it existed before 28 September 2000requires clear political imagination and new hope.35What the peace process now requires to achieve ajust and lasting peace is a genuine effort on the part ofthe co-sponsors of the peace process — the UnitedStates and the Russian Federation — as well asinfluential international actors  including the EuropeanUnion  and of course the Arab and Muslim countriesand other friendly nations in the Non-AlignedMovement as well as in the United Nations. All ofthem should immediately introduce a comprehensiveframework for a permanent final solution based oninternational legality and the agreements signed so thatboth parties can negotiate expeditiously the details ofthat permanent solution. This  of course  should bepreceded by the full and immediate implementation ofthe Mitchell Report and the Tenet Understandings.It is clear that we are in need of greaterinternational efforts  including an internationalpresence on the ground  to help the parties moveforward. In any case  the United Nations and theSecretary-General must carry out their natural andimportant roles in this regard so that we can achieveour desired peace objectives. I call upon the IsraeliGovernment and the Israeli people to respondpositively to this approach so that we can togetherbuild peace in the land of peace  the Holy Land ofpeace — the Holy Land; I repeat  the Holy Land.Needless to say  we need an expeditious effortthat brooks no further delay  especially at the currentinternational situation. We are ready to carry out ourshare of responsibility. We trust you are also ready toshoulder your share of responsibility. I realize that theinternational community  after the assassination of mypartner  Yitzhak Rabin  is looking forward to the peaceprocess. From here I convey to the Israeli people myfull commitment to the peace process  which I beganwith my late partner Yitzhak Rabin  and my partnerShimon Peres  a peace that guarantees freedom stability and security for the Israelis and thePalestinians and all the peoples in the Middle Eastregion — the peace of the brave; the just andcomprehensive and lasting peace that will end theIsraeli occupation of all the Palestinian and Arabterritories and will lead to the establishment of theindependent Palestinian State with Holy Jerusalem asits capital.This is what we should be working for  for thesake of our children and their children. From here I callupon the Israeli Government to resume the final statusnegotiations in order to implement the resolutions ofinternational legality and the agreements signed.I salute all of you and hope that this session willproduce the required solutions and recommendationswhich will enable our peoples and our nations and thewhole of humanity to live in peace  stability  progressand prosperity.May peace and God’s blessing be with you."
"143",5873,"QAT",56,2001,"﻿It is my pleasure to address theGeneral Assembly today in my capacity as the Emir ofthe State of Qatar and as Chairman of the NinthSummit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference.It is our duty to make this important session ofthe General Assembly a session for rebuildingconfidence and realizing the aspirations andexpectations of our peoples for a world where peaceand prosperity prevail.I take this opportunity to extend to you  Sir  mycongratulations on your election to the presidency ofthis session  and would like to extend my thanks toyour predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri. I must alsocongratulate Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-election asUnited Nations Secretary-General and on receiving theNobel Peace Prize along with the United Nations.We are all aware of the critical and extraordinarycircumstances in which this session is being held andof the political situation prevailing in the world in thewake of the events of 11 September. An analysis ofthese terrible events  which we condemn  prompts us tosay that humanity has actually reached a tremendousturning point.Personally  I believe that the way to offer thegreatest peace and serenity to the souls of the victimsof that criminal act  the sincerest consolation to theirfamilies and the most effective support to the friendlyUnited States of America  where these events tookplace  is for the international community as a whole notonly to confront what happened but also to actdecisively to avoid the repetition of such acts.What happened in New York and Washington isunprecedented and almost beyond our imagination.There may be some strategic planners who see theevents as confirming their predictions  but for the restof us they would have seemed like fiction only a shorttime ago. Sadly  the events were all too real  and wewatched with amazement  horror and sympathy as werealized their full import for the future of humanity.Dealing with the repercussions of these eventsshould not be a matter of merely punishing thosewhose guilt in masterminding and carrying out thesecriminal acts is proved. Inflicting punishment  thoughimperative  will not  in my opinion  prevent the14repetition of similar or even more terrible acts in thefuture.We face an extremely serious situation. We areseeing what could be described as a globalization ofterrorism through the evil utilization of the revolutionof technology and communications. Thus  we are allinvolved in an unconventional war for which we arenot yet prepared.As we know  terrorism is neither a temporaryphenomenon nor confined to a certain continent  creed culture or race; it is everywhere  concealed like timebombs in our midst.We should therefore ask ourselves  what have wedone as an international community about thissituation? Have we actually faced up to it? What havewe done to rebuild confidence among people? Whathave we done to contain the fear that is demoralizingour citizens? What are we going to do now to stop theeconomic recession and social anxiety that threaten usall? Furthermore  is this the world we promised at theMillennium Summit a year ago — a world that wouldbe ruled by amity  peace and cooperation?If anything  we have moved away from theseideals. We now live in a world where liberties areincreasingly restricted  where democracy is in retreatand where caution and isolation are replacing freedomand openness.The State of Qatar  along with all other Islamiccountries  has condemned the terrorist acts that tookplace on 11 September. This stand was explicitlyexpressed at the emergency meeting of theOrganization of the Islamic Conference Ministers forForeign Affairs held in Doha last month. Ourunanimous agreement condemning what happenedemanated from the values of our true Islamic religionand its sublime sharia  which is based on tolerance justice  equality and cooperation among people andforbids the unjust taking of human life. It urges us torebuild and to propagate peace and tranquillity.In this connection  I would like to stress that whatdeepens our conviction and strengthens our stancetowards these eternal cultural values is our realizationand understanding of the geopolitical importance of theMuslim nation  with its diverse peoples  which makesit a strategic partner in the process of building balancedinternational relations.In fact  this is what makes Muslims deplore thosewho deliberately and desperately try to link Islam withterrorism. Our peoples condemn and reject terrorism aswell as all attempts to distort the image of Islam  whichis the last of divine faiths  and those who abuse andterrorize its adherents and jeopardize their lives dignity and interests.Therefore  it is now necessary to stand resolutelyagainst all forms of harassment against Arab andMuslim communities in any country that take placeunder the pretext of combating terrorism and thepursuit of terrorists.We need to have a clear definition of terrorismand distinguish between this phenomenon  which isbased on criminal practices and attacks againstinnocent civilians  and legitimate struggles to throw offthe yoke of colonialism and subjugation.Terrorism has taken root not only because of ourinability to tackle the sources of tension in the world’shot spots  but also because we have tolerated for toolong those who pursue policies of repression and denytheir citizens fundamental liberties and basic humanrights. The seeds of terrorism lie in places wherepluralism is rejected  corruption is allowed to spread authority is exploited and political opponents arehounded in the guise of protecting the security ofhomelands and people. It is neither just nor logical foranyone to claim to improve internal conditions byresorting to oppressive practices or to suspendingdemocracy.In this context  we feel it is high time to put anurgent end to the tragedy of the Palestinian people atthe hands of the Israeli occupation forces. We call onthe international community to shoulder itsresponsibilities in providing the necessary internationalprotection for these people against the unjustified andunacceptable daily aggression to which they areexposed.That is indispensable if we want to avert animminent human catastrophe  which would lead only toa further cycle of violence  terrorism and destruction inour region. We urge everyone to support their politicalleaders when they call for restraint so as to avoid theloss of innocent civilian life and so that the rightclimate can be created for a just peace to prevail in thattroubled region.15In this context  we should like to put on recordour support for the positive stance of the President ofthe United States  George W. Bush  and hisAdministration  with regard to the establishment of aPalestinian State. We would also like to pay tribute inthis respect to friendly European countries and otherinternational bodies concerned with the settlement ofthe crisis. The ultimate test will be whether theyimplement measures reflecting the positions that theyhave taken and move from making statements to takingaction.We must emphasize the need to address thehuman tragedy of the people of Afghanistan. Webelieve that it is our duty to provide all possibleassistance to those people  most of whom are livingunder extremely difficult conditions — conditions thatfurther exacerbate their suffering  which was alreadyacute years before the crisis brought about by theevents of 11 September.We therefore appeal to the internationalcommunity to provide assistance and aid to save thelives of millions of Afghans who are facing a bleakfuture. There is an urgent and immediate need for reliefas the Afghan winter approaches. We urge the Talibanauthorities to cooperate fully with relief organizationsto ensure that essential food and medicines can reachall of their people. We urge the internationalcommunity to designate a safe corridor for suchsupplies before winter sets in.In addressing these urgent humanitarian concerns we believe that it is essential to seek a long-termsolution of the Afghan problem  as proposed by theOrganization of the Islamic Conference. Such asolution would be based simply on maintaining theterritorial integrity and Islamic identity of Afghanistan and forming a government representing all factions ofAfghan society  excluding none.It is the responsibility of the internationalcommunity to elaborate comprehensive programmesand plans to confront all forms of global challenges. Inthis respect  we are convinced of the necessity ofreforming the United Nations so as to step up theeffectiveness of its organs and agencies and to promoteits efficiency. Equally  as States Members of theOrganization  we are required to shoulder our politicalresponsibilities and honour our financial and moralobligations towards the Organization. In this context we support the idea of expanding the membership ofthe Security Council to make it more democratic andmore representative of the international community inour contemporary world. We also support the idea ofexpanding the permanent membership of the Council inorder to secure wider international representation. Wealso support restrictions on the use of the veto on thepart of permanent members  regulating the ability toexercise that right within limits established by specificconditions and provisions to be agreed upon by theinternational Organization.From this rostrum  I would like to say that thetime has come for us to take steps immediately toactivate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Inimplementing it  international organizations should notconfine their role to merely recording the violations ofits principles. They should move towards acomprehensive  democratic dialogue that consolidatesits provisions guaranteeing people’s right to participatein governance  expands its scope and makes it moreresponsive  not just for today’s requirements  but alsofor those of the future.The State of Qatar is convinced of the importanceof — indeed  the necessity for — such a dialogue. Aswe would be one of those to benefit from the outcomeof such a dialogue  we are willing to contribute inmany different ways in order to make this a year fordemocratic dialogue that would truly reflect theprinciples of the United Nations Charter at thebeginning of this millennium.If approached with conviction and resolve  thisendeavour will lead to the interaction of differentviews  and could help to unify our efforts againstcurrent threats and future challenges and dangers. Inthis way  our cultural distinctions could be turned intoa source of strength and wealth  our social disparitiescould become an element of diversity and contribution and our political and geographical borders couldbecome points of cooperation  convergence andcommunication among our peoples and nations. Thatwould provide an opportunity for all of us to live in aworld whose inhabitants take pride in their humanityand look forward to a future of prosperity and well-being for their children and grandchildren without anydiscrimination or distinction.May the peace and blessings of God be upon theAssembly."
"144",5919,"ROU",56,2001,"﻿My most sincerecongratulations go first to His Excellency Mr. HanSeung-soo on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-sixth session. His outstandingpersonal qualities and the consistently valuablecontributions of his country  the Republic of Korea  toUnited Nations activities are clear guarantees that thestewardship of the current session of the GeneralAssembly  which started under dramatic and sorrowfulcircumstances  has been entrusted to a safe pair ofhands.I would also like to renew my heartfeltcongratulations to our Secretary-General on the well-deserved awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize and on hiselection to another term in office. Romania willcontinue to support his commendable endeavourstowards reforming the Organization in a way thatshould enable it to cope effectively with the challenges old and new  of our modern world.The horrific terrorist attack of 11 September wasa rude awakening for all of us. It brought into focusboth the abyssal evil we have to confront and the highvalue of human solidarity in the international responseto it. It also shed new light on some problems that theinternational community has been facing for quite awhile and accelerated certain processes  the far-reaching consequences of which are still not easy topredict.There can be no ambivalence or half measureswhen it comes to condemning and effectivelycombating terrorism and militant  violent fanaticism ofany kind. The tragedy that befell the United States andthe United Nations host city affected all humankindand created a new resolve to bring to justice theperpetrators and those who support  abet or harbourthem. We share the views of the President of the UnitedStates  Mr. George W. Bush  that what is at stake is notjust America’s freedom but that this is the world’sfight  civilization’s fight  the fight of all who believe inprogress and pluralism  tolerance and freedom.Belief in those fundamental values have inspiredthe noble concept of the dialogue among civilizations so eloquently expounded by the Secretary-General inhis address to the Assembly. Indeed  it is only throughdialogue that points of convergence can be identifiedand cooperation becomes possible on matters thatacquire significance once they become the object ofshared concern.From the very beginning. Romania joined theinternational democratic community in its ongoingcampaign against evil-doers and their supporters for asafer and freer world. The consensual view of theRomanian nation across the political spectrum wasunequivocally expressed in Parliament’s decision tomake Romania’s air  maritime and land space availableto the United States and the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization and to provide access to any otherfacilities that our partners may require. This is tangibleproof of our commitment to acting as a de factomember of the North Atlantic Alliance.My country firmly supports the relevantresolutions recently adopted by the General Assemblyand the Security Council  and we have alreadyundertaken the necessary steps to ensure their fullimplementation in Romania.Regional solidarity is also essential. At a veryrecent conference on the common fight againstterrorism  held in Warsaw on 6 November  the heads ofState of Central and Eastern Europe reflected upontheir past common experiences and voiced theirdetermination to stand firmly united in the fight againstterror for as long as it takes. It is also appropriate to18highlight here the meaningful work done by theBucharest-based Southeast European CooperationInitiative Regional Crime Center for CombatingTransborder Crime  involving active inputs from 11countries. The Center should build upon its currentactivities in order to enhance its contribution to theworldwide fight against terrorism by making good useof existing liaison systems  intelligence-sharing andjoint task forces.I fully agreed with Secretary-General Kofi Annanwhen he recently said that we must not let the terroristattacks distract us from the rest of the work we have todo. In no way do these tragic events make the broadermission of the United Nations less relevant. Indeed  thenew focus on terrorism should not divert us from thecore business of the world Organization. The agenda ofthis session is both comprehensive and substantial. Weshare the view that a large portion of our work shouldbe devoted to seeking practical ways to implement thebroad agreement reached at the Millennium Summitalong the lines indicated in the Secretary-General’svisionary road map report.We support the Secretary-General in his efforts tointegrate human rights into the whole range of UnitedNations activities. We encourage closer cooperationbetween the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees  other United Nationsagencies and mechanisms and regional structures thathave extensive expertise in this field  such as theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe whose chairmanship-in-office is currently held byRomania.We regard the enhancement of the United Nationspeacekeeping capability as a top priority. Recentexperience in the Balkans and elsewhere has taught usthat proper policing can be at least as important as theuse of military might in modern-day peacekeeping andpeace-building operations. That is why Romania hasdecided  in addition to its previous commitments in thearea  to contribute a significant contingent of militarypolicemen to the international presence in Kosovo toassist the transition from conflict to stability.The United Nations can become a focal point forconstructive interaction with regional or subregionalstructures and specialized organizations of civil societyin dealing with concrete problems ranging fromconflict prevention to peace-building and post-conflictrehabilitation  reconstruction and sustainabledevelopment.Probably the greatest challenge to theinternational community is still how to reduceeconomic and social disparities and to achievesustainable growth and poverty reduction within andbetween all countries through appropriate policies andwell-focused institution-building. The world’s leadershave pledged to engage political determination financial resources and innovative policies to reduceglobal poverty by half before the year 2015. This ismost commendable  but it may prove to be moredifficult to accomplish than originally envisaged.The 11 September attacks have affected not onlyworld security but also the global economy  which inthe preceding months was already showing signs of aslowdown. The consequences are likely to be far-reaching and much more dangerous than those of the1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. The volume ofinternational trade  which increased by almost 13 percent in the year 2000  may decline by as much as 3 percent in 2001. People in developing countries inparticular are going to be hurt again.The United Nations has an essential part to playin promoting further integration of the world economyin accordance with the principles of sustainabledevelopment. But let us face the reality: we live in aworld where the developmental gap between the centreand the periphery  between North and South  betweenrich and poor  is still wide and growing wider. Theexisting mechanisms for an orderly transfer ofresources appear to have been sadly inadequate. Onewould expect that the recent shock  and the renewedsense of global solidarity that it has triggered  wouldprompt us into action to address the underlying causesof blind anger: misery and hopelessness. The waragainst terrorism can be truly successful only if it alsobecomes a war against poverty  illiteracy  disease andintolerance. I trust that the collective wisdom andgoodwill of responsible politicians everywhere will beable to produce new and effective internationalmechanisms meant to combine the vision ofsustainable  environment-friendly development withgood governance and the generalized observance ofbasic human rights.We see disturbing signs that the increasingpolarization with regard to wealth creation goes handin hand with a deepening knowledge divide. The19emerging knowledge economy has scarcely heeded theinjunctions of globalization. It still appears to the eyesof many to be self-serving and parochial. However  it isprecisely the link between economic development andthe advancement of knowledge that should give thelaggards a chance to catch up through a more rationalutilization of resources  including intellectualresources. We hope to see a new pattern of opennetworking which will benefit each country —especially those that are less developed — as well asthe international system as a whole. Again  existinginstitutions do not seem creative or flexible enough toaddress this challenge. The United Nations system maybecome the catalyst for concerted action in public-private partnerships to bring the “digital dividend” intoevery community and every home.The knowledge gap is compounded by theubiquitous phenomenon of brain drain from thedeveloping to the developed world. The problem isalmost as old as the United Nations itself. How toreverse that trend  transforming it into a “brain regain” is another major challenge facing us all. To put itsimply  what we have here is a steady  not-so-hiddenflow of subsidies from the poorer nations to the richerones. After all  most of an education budget comes outof the taxpayer’s pocket. Banish the thought ofregarding the individual as the property of the all-powerful State: that notion is dead and gone. But itmay make sense to start thinking of some sort oflegally binding international instruments built on abroader interpretation of the concept of intellectualproperty to ensure a fairer distribution of the benefitsof knowledge.The European Union has recently regulated thetransfer of players between soccer clubs. What about asimilar contractual arrangement between  say “Polytechnic University X Club” and “MicrosoftClub”? Some experimental domestic schemes haveworked well in linking industry to higher learning byresorting to market mechanisms. Why should we notconsider international intellectual partnerships mutually beneficial for countries having advancedtechnologies and infrastructure and those generatingcreative human energies?Romania supports the strengthening of the UnitedNations through comprehensive institutional reformson the basis of the set of proposals now before us. Asthe Secretary-General rightly noted  the United Nationsshould turn from a culture of reaction to one ofprevention  aiming at the root causes of the prevailingnegative phenomena. We look forward to anincreasingly effective General Assembly regaining itscentral position in the United Nations family  as calledfor in the Millennium Declaration.Experience shows that enhanced regionalcooperation can be both the engine and the result ofglobalization. In a regional format  States canimplement innovative strategies for better access toresources and markets. Regional organizations arepoised to become a significant factor in the globalcommunity. Regional cooperation makes it possible tocapitalize on the advantages of globalization whilereducing its risks.A set of policies can be successful only if it reliesconsistently on the fundamental aspiration of ordinarypeople to a peaceful and decent life. The currentunprecedented level of knowledge will  I am confident enable us to find the requisite resources  both inourselves and in society  for greater tolerance  mutualrespect and constructive dialogue  as opposed to theprimitive inclination to hatred and intolerance.It is incumbent on the United Nations  the onlyinternational organization of universal vocation  toidentify within itself the resources for the resolution ofproblems of global concern. The United Nations shouldkeep working tenaciously to renew its structures andimprove its operational performance as we advanceinto the new millennium. Romania is ready and willingto add its contribution to that effort."
"145",5965,"RUS",56,2001,"﻿This session of the General Assembly istaking place in the shadow of an unprecedentedchallenge to humanity posed by international terrorism.We all must seriously analyse how this could havehappened. However  it has already become perfectlyclear today that the period of globalization and thethreats and challenges to international and regionalsecurity that it brings with it make it urgent for of all ofus to take fundamentally new approaches tointernational affairs.We face a tough dilemma  whose solution willtruly be of paramount importance. Either we worktogether to responsibly construct a genuinely just anddemocratic world order that can guarantee equalsecurity and sustainable development for all States inthe world  or we show ourselves to be unable tocounter real threats to global stability and security.The most important task of the internationalcommunity today is to create a global system tocounteract new threats and challenges  first andforemost among which is international terrorism. Thistopic was the focus of negotiations between thePresident of the Russian Federation  Mr. Vladimir V.Putin  and the President of the United States ofAmerica  Mr. George W. Bush  which recently tookplace in Washington  D.C. and Crawford  Texas.A universal anti-terrorist coalition has beenformed. The Russian Federation is a responsibleparticipant in this coalition. The creation of thiscoalition has involved the United Nations playing avery important role in consolidating and coordinatingactivities. It is precisely the United Nations that has thenecessary universal character and authority to organizea response to the threats and challenges that confrontmankind today.The broad decisions taken by the SecurityCouncil and the General Assembly create a solidpolitical and legal framework for efforts to neutralizethe threat of terrorism. It is now important for thesedecisions to be implemented by all States.If necessary  the use of the most decisive meansagainst terrorists may be permissible  including the useof military force. The Charter grants that right. At thesame time  this threat cannot be overcome by forcealone. A comprehensive approach to eradicatingterrorism would imply the use of the whole range ofpolitical  economic  financial and humanitarianmeasures.The consolidation of the international legalframework for combating terrorism is now on ouragenda. It is extremely important to rapidly completeand adopt the comprehensive convention oninternational terrorism and a convention for thesuppression of acts of nuclear terrorism.It would be of great importance to establishwithin the United Nations a mechanism to monitor thefulfilment by States of their treaty obligationsconcerning the suppression of terrorism.We consider promising the idea to establish under the aegis of the United Nations  a centre forcoordinating assistance to States to resolve crisescaused by terrorist acts. Such a structure could focus onproviding consultative and material and technicalsupport in managing the consequences of terrorist acts.The Russian Federation also proposes studyingthe possibility of including in international law the5principle of the responsibility of States for their failureto take measures against terrorists in their territory orunder their jurisdiction.Of key importance in the success of thecomprehensive fight against international terrorism isthe maintenance and strengthening of strategic stabilityat both global and regional levels and strengthening thenon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.The focus of the international community shouldcontinue to be on the interdependence and merging ofinternational terrorism  drug trafficking andtransnational organized crime. The Russian Federationfavours the rapid entry into force of the InternationalConvention for the Suppression of the Financing ofTerrorism and the United Nations Convention AgainstTransnational Organized Crime and its additionalprotocols.It is perfectly clear that the fight against terrorismis not aimed at any particular religion  civilization orculture. This was clearly demonstrated by thediscussions on the dialogue among civilizations duringthe current session of the General Assembly. We alsohope that a practical contribution in this area can bemade by the implementation of the initiative putforward by Islamic religious leaders from the RussianFederation to organize an international conferenceentitled “Islam against terrorism” in Moscow.Terrorism is rooted in the gap between affluenceand poverty  both within States and in the internationalarena. Thus  the task now  as never before  is to ensuresustainable development throughout the world and toensure that the social aspects of the globalizationprocess are addressed.The United Nations and its specialized agenciescan do a lot to ensure effective rejection of extremismof all forms. We suggest that thought should be givento organizing  under the aegis of the United Nations  aworld forum that would discuss what contribution civilsociety and  particularly  the mass media could make tocombating terrorism.International experience has shown thatsuccessful prevention and settlement of regionalconflicts are an integral part of the counter-terroristefforts of the international community. This is yetanother compelling argument in favour of furtherdeveloping and ensuring greater effectiveness ofUnited Nations preventive and peacekeeping activities.In particular  the Russian Federation advocates thedevelopment within the United Nations of acomprehensive strategy aimed at reliably blockingchannels for outside fuelling of the conflicts.We need to ensure that there is regionalcooperation in fighting these new threats. An exampleof such successful cooperation is that of theCommonwealth of Independent States  under theauspices of which a CIS anti-terrorist centre has beenset up and is working effectively.Today  the moment of truth has arrived for eachof us. The Russian Federation is in favour of theinternational community taking decisions that canprovide for strategic stability and equal security for allStates  sustainable development and prosperity for allthe peoples of the planet and peace and tranquillity foreach family and each individual.These noble aims can only be achieved jointly  byworking cooperatively and uniting the efforts of theentire international community. The United Nations hasa vital role to play in this regard. Our Organizationwas  and indeed remains  the most importantinstrument available to the international community whose effective and responsible use will allow us tocreate a new democratic and just world order for thetwenty-first century."
"146",6012,"RWA",56,2001,"﻿It is agreat honour for me  on behalf of the Rwandandelegation  to join previous speakers in extending fromthis rostrum of the United Nations our sincere andwarm congratulations to Mr. Han Seung-soo on hiselection as President of the General Assembly at thefifty-sixth session. I should also like to take thisopportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to hispredecessor for the farsightedness with which he ledthe work of the fifty-fifth session of the GeneralAssembly.I also wish  on behalf of my Government  toextend my warm congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan onhis re-election as Secretary-General of ourOrganization. His remarkable efforts in strengtheningthe role of the United Nations and his numerousinitiatives to resolve conflicts have been eloquentlyattested to by his election to a second term of office and even more by the Nobel Peace Prize that has justbeen awarded to him.This session began in a very tragic climate in thewake of the cowardly and ignoble acts orchestrated byenemies of international peace and security. Thoseterrorist acts led to the deaths of thousands of innocentvictims in the cities of New York and Washington. Thiswas a very heavy blow to the Government and the20people of the United States and also a challenge to theUnited Nations and to the entire internationalcommunity.The Government of Rwanda learned of theseignoble acts with indignation and consternation  andhas presented its condolences to the AmericanGovernment and the families directly affected. TheRwandan Government reiterates its condemnation ofterrorism and remains open to all initiatives designedto combat all forms of terrorism. It is in this spirit thatmy country unreservedly supports all the resolutionsadopted against terrorism  in particular resolution 1373(2001) of 28 September  and we reaffirm ourdetermination to implement them.The acts of 11 September 2001 are a challenge tothe United Nations and to each of its Member States.Since the United Nations is the crucible of internationalpeace and security  and since terrorist groups takeinnocent human lives  it is up to every Member State every truly human organization and every person whocherishes peace and justice to fight as vigorously aspossible against such a terrorist group  no matter whatits pretext  no matter how powerful it may be. Whenwe say no matter how powerful  we know what we aresaying  having been victims ourselves.We were victims of the terror not of just anyorganization  but of a State that in reality became anon-State  but with all the State machinery available toit to fight the very people whose protection was itsmost fundamental duty. Rwanda and its people livedunder the terror of a murderous  terrorist and genocidalState for three months. This reign of terror by a State as the Assembly well knows  took more than 1 millionhuman lives in 1994. The instruments of this blind merciless terror  whose overwhelming result wasgenocide  are well known: the organization ofparamilitary militias commonly known as theInterahamwe  and the former Rwandese Armed Forces known as the ex-FAR. From this rostrum we call forthese two organizations  which for a decade have beenveritable killing machines  to be duly listed as terroristgroups to be fought and pursued throughout the world.The Democratic Republic of the Congo  whichsince 1994 has been harbouring these forces of evil has fed them  has provided them with arms andmunitions and has allied itself with them  must respondto the Security Council’s repeated appeals to stop allsupport for the negative forces on its territories including the Interahamwe and ex-Far  which plannedand carried out genocide in Rwanda.With regard to peace in the Democratic Republicof the Congo and throughout the Great Lakes region inAfrica  my country is determined to implement theLusaka Agreement  which  with respect to theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  has two importantcomponents: the inter-Congolese dialogue  whichshould lead to a political solution to the Congolesecrisis  and the disarmament and withdrawal of negativeforces  which should lead to peace on the Rwandan Ugandan and Burundi borders of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo.We wish to note with great satisfaction  theactions of the sisterly Republic of South Africa  which given the failure of inter-Congolese dialogue in AddisAbaba — because of  among other things  lack offinancial resources — generously offered food andlodging to over 300 Congolese delegates going to thatgreatly anticipated inter-Congolese forum. We wishalso to congratulate the Rassemblement congolais pourla démocratie (RCD)-Goma and the Mouvement pourla libération du Congo (MLC)-Gbadolite on their fineinitiative to create a special force to carry out thedisarmament and disengagement of negative forcesunder their control on the territory of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  and on having invited theKinshasa Government to join this initiative.Regarding human rights  we would like toreaffirm our attachment to the rule of law ininternational relations. We are determined to strengthenthe rule of law  as well as respect for human rights andfundamental freedoms. The Government of Rwandawelcomed with great interest the report on humanrights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It isregrettable  however  that the Special Rapporteur Mr. Roberto Garretn  was not present when the reportwas submitted on 8 November 2001. Because of hisabsence  no real debate between the parties concernedand the Rapporteur was possible. Once again  mydelegation finds this highly regrettable.The report on human rights in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo contains numerous gratuitousallegations  including one on the alleged annexation ofthat country. We would like to recall here that theregular Rwandan army did not cross borders into theDemocratic Republic of the Congo in order to annexthe country  as the report claims  but  as we have21explained and demonstrated a number of times  toensure the security of our territory and our population.We acted in the context “of the inherent right ofindividual ... self-defence” of a country  as we areauthorized to do under Chapter VII  Article 51 of theCharter.Indeed  security in the north of Rwanda has beenand continues to be constantly disrupted by the ex-FARand the Interahamwe militia that committed thegenocide in 1994 and that are using Congolese territoryas their rear base in order to repeat their gruesomedeeds. These armed groups are infiltrating Rwanda andkilling thousands of innocent people. We hope thatphase III of the United Nations Organization Missionin the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) in close cooperation with the initiative of the RCDGoma-MLC Gbadolite  will lead to the completedisarmament of these groups and to stability and peacein the Great Lakes region.We are pleased to note the establishment of aTransitional Government in Burundi. We believe thatthis is a major step towards the reconciliation to whichour brothers  the people of Burundi  aspire. Today theGreat Lakes region is seeking solutions to the conflictsthat undermine it. May the example of Burundi  underthe inspiration of President Nelson Mandela  bear fruitin the general interest and for the benefit of the peopleof Burundi and Africa as a whole.Also regarding Africa  we feel that a definitivesolution to the problem of Western Sahara should alsobe found.We would like to see peace in the Middle East.The question of Palestinian refugees  which is severaldecades old  needs to be re-examined. Indeed  theexistence of an independent Palestinian State alongside an independent Israeli State assured of itsexistence as such is necessary for peace in the MiddleEast. The friends of the Israelis and the Palestinianswithin the United Nations  including us  ought rather atthis stage to work on cultivating and strengtheningrelations of friendship and cooperation between thesetwo fraternal States — the Israeli State and thePalestinian State. We are anxious to start work on thisnoble task.Aside from Africa and the Middle East  we arepleased to note the significant progress made on theKorean peninsula  where both Koreas have shownencouraging signs of reaching a final settlement of aconflict arose in the context of the cold war.This fifty-sixth session of the General Assemblyis the first after the Millennium Summit  and thusshould follow it up and lay the new foundation for thefuture of mankind. The Summit stressed  among thevalues that underpin international relations and respectfor the fundamental principles of the Charter  the rolethat the United Nations ought to play andrecommended the creation of a propitious climate forthe development of the least developed countries thatwere not yet on the path towards globalization.Throughout this general debate poverty and theproblem of debt have been stressed as major obstaclesto development and thus to entry into the era ofglobalization. Globalization  with its advantages forsome and problems for others  does not seem to be ableto resolve the problem of the gap between the rich andpoor countries. To the contrary  the gap between themcontinues to grow. The marginalization of poorcountries in international trade and the debt burdenhave severely hampered their efforts for developmentand have exacerbated their poverty. This is why theUnited Nations needs to define policies for thedevelopment of all and adopt international measures tosupport poor countries in the field of investment. Suchmeasures should also be aimed at cancelling debt andensuring adequate integration of these countries intothe world economy.In this context  we call on the United Nations toreconsider the report submitted to the Security Councilby the Independent Inquiry led by Mr. Carlsson  formerPrime Minister of Sweden  on which there has been nofollow-up to date. As a Member of the United Nations we believe that the Organization to which we belongshould undertake a follow-up to this report that defineswell the need for economic and social reconstruction inpost-genocide Rwanda."

Mr. President:It gives me great pleasure to extend to you and to your friendly country  the Republic of Korea  our sincere congratulations on your election as President of this General Assembly  expressing full confidence that you will steer the business of this important session competently and effectively.  I would also like to express our gratitude to the President of the previous session of the General Assembly  Mr. Harri Holkeri  who managed its business with wisdom and expertise  in a way that deserves our thanks and appreciation.It is also my pleasure on this occasion to greet His Excellency the Secretary-General and extend my thanks and appreciation for his continued efforts to establish peace and security in the world  maintain the role of the Organization and raise its efficiency in order to restore credibility and effectiveness.Mr. President:The international community is still going through the aftermath of the horrendous disaster that befell the United States of America on September 11  resulting in huge material losses and the death of thousands of innocent victims:  tremendous damage that cannot yet be reckoned or determined  such was the gravity of the catastrophe  its depth and repercussions.An earnest global direction has emerged  to stand resolutely and firmly against whoever is proved to be responsible for or connected with this heinous criminal act; and to attempt every way and means conducive to the eradication of the phenomenon of international terrorism that has lately been spreading and from which various nations and countries have suffered irrespective of their affiliation or ethnicity.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was one of the first states to express its absolute condemnation and strong denunciation of what happened in New York  Washington and Pennsylvania. Without hesitation it has contributed to any effort or alliance aimed at the eradication of this perilous scourge that threatens us all. This stance of the Kingdom is in harmony with its constant and continuing policies against terrorism and its perpetrators. The Kingdom itself has suffered from terrorism  and has taken numerous administrative  legal and security measures to combat it and eliminate it; to curb terrorist actions and practices  or at least to minimize the possibilities of their occurrence.Mr. President:Our meeting during this session  convened just two months after the New York disaster  and a few miles from ground zero  must take us from the phase of shock and sorrow at what happened to the phase of earnest action and the adoption of practical and effective means for combating terrorism: to sever its roots and causes. It is therefore most fitting to take up the spirit expressed by His Excellency President George W. Bush in his address to this distinguished forum a few days ago  in which he stressed that the time is ripe to move together seriously and purposefully in confronting this joint enemy  and not be satisfied merely with denunciation  repudiation  and the expression of sorrow.On our part  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  even prior to the September incident  had in fact taken a series of measures and regulations that prove our seriousness in anti-terrorism endeavors. For example  my country enacted a series of laws and regulations related to combating terrorism and inflicting harsh punishment on its perpetrators. It has adopted financial and banking measures that restrict the potential for extremist groups to benefit from means of financial support to facilitate implementation of their plans.At the regional level the Kingdom was one of the first signatories to the Arab Convention for Combating Terrorism issued in 1998 by the League of Arab States  as well as the Convention on Combating Terrorism of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. At the international level  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has acceded to numerous UN agreements concerning terrorism. It is on the point of joining two agreements: the International Convention on Terrorist Bombings  and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.Mr. President:There is a fact that should not be overlooked concerning the growing global concern on the issue of terrorism  in the context of crystallizing policies and adopting international agreements designed to combat it. The mere enactment of laws and regulations to combat terrorism  while essential  is not enough by itself to prevent incidents of terrorist action.Eradication of terrorism requires all of us to move towards eliminating the infrastructure that is relied on by terrorist groups scattered all over the world  the infrastructure that is providing them the means of support and publicity. In this context we should remember that certain countries grant privileges and immunities to those who resort to them under cover of ""political opposition""  with the result that they are able to avail themselves of freedom of movement in any country that hosts them  exploiting its laws and spreading their propaganda  making contacts and sending hate messages  attempting to influence public opinion and instigate the performance of violent and terrorist activities within that country. If we are serious in fighting terrorism  we must close this door in the face of anyone who wishes to exploit a country to achieve an end that may seem legitimate for some but in reality is a path leading to violence and terrorism that has no relation to a just cause.The other issue that we should understand and pay attention to  particularly in light of the feelings generated by the events in New York and Washington  is the necessity to be aware that if the process of combating terrorism takes the form of accusing particular nationalities or religious groups  and is motivated by prejudice and bias  from an angle of generalization devoid of rationale or firm evidence  then this haste in accusation and spreading unfounded allegations such as linking terrorism and terrorists to Islam  will benefit only those who aim at propagating the idea of a clash of civilizations  which we believe is the basic objective of those who committed the events of September. Following such confrontational trends will result only in contributing to the achievement of the aims of the terrorists themselves.We look forward to the United Nations  as the body that represents all of us without exception  to make the international endeavors against terrorism sincere global efforts devoid of discrimination and bias  and for the service of all members of the international community  protecting them from the evil of terrorism  including official terrorism that is supported by states.Within the framework of its endeavors to combat terrorism  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has supported all efforts that stem from our international Organization  whether acceding to international agreements as mentioned earlier  or through endorsing the relevant resolutions on this topic  including Security Council Resolutions 1368 and 1373 (2001).My country supports the call for convening an international conference on terrorism to be held under the auspices of the United Nations  with one of its prime functions that of putting a specific definition to terrorism:  distinguishing terrorism as a serious phenomenon threatening the security and stability of the international community  from the right of nations to struggle and resist occupation in accordance with the provisions of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.Mr. President:Combating terrorism requires from all of us diligent action in order to solve unresolved issues that inflame hatred  inculcate bitterness  implant mistrust and deepen the feelings of oppression and lack of justice. When we state this matter our intention is not to link terrorism to any other issue  because we recognize very well that combating terrorism is an issue that requires our concerted effort irrespective of any other consideration. What we should pay attention to and take into consideration  however  is the necessity for not availing any opportunity to the terrorists to sneak in and exploit unresolved issues in justifying their terrorist activities  thereby linking their practices to such issues.It is our duty in this case to undo any such linkage  in a positive manner that will deprive the terrorists of any justification on which to base the implementation of their plans. From this perspective  we call for acceleration of finding a just solution to the Palestinian issue  one that is not looked at as a response to the terrorists' pressures but to a pressure from our side to deprive the terrorists from exploiting the continuation of this issue that is suspended without resolution.This is exactly what makes us look with full appreciation to what has been stated in the address of the President of the United States of America before the General Assembly where he indicated - in the context of his reference to this issue - that violence in Palestine is the responsibility of all parties and not one particular party  and that it is the right of both Israel and Palestine to live jointly as independent states. The peace process should not be derailed by sporadic incidents of violence. The optimal way to stop violence is in getting the peace process to its desired target through reviving it and integrating it according to its principles and grounds  based on the resolutions of international legitimacy particularly Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of land for peace.Mr. President:The war going on in Afghanistan represents one of the ramifications of the situation that the Afghan problem has reached  and that has led to an environment in which international terrorism found fertile ground in which to implement its plans and objectives.  With all our understanding of the motivation of the international coalition in launching its military campaign against the hideout of terrorism in Afghanistan  what we fear is that this campaign will be constrained by its military framework and the consequences of exposing Afghan civilians to greater suffering and displacement without achieving any acceptable objectives or outcome  and possibly exposing the future of Afghanistan to more trouble  division  and instability.Therefore  the Kingdom has done its best to avert Afghanistan from such a painful destiny  while contributing to the direction of the international coalition towards the path that is in harmony with the spirit of the Security Council resolutions relevant to the Afghan issue. As such  we have submitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations a perspective that embodies a number of ideas designed to safeguard the autonomy of Afghanistan and place it on the road leading to stability and development; and that on the other hand  will help eradicate terrorists and those collaborating with them by providing them with protection and a safe haven in Afghan territory.Military action alone cannot  in our opinion  lead to achieving the desired objective in Afghanistan  and therefore it is imperative to depend on a political perspective that assists in achieving the targets of the coalition on the one hand  and on the other  safeguards Afghanistan's stable political future.Mr. President:Today the international community is most in need of joint endeavor and cooperation in order to devise solutions on which agreement comes as a result of our collective thought and the outcome of our joint action on the basis of justice and equality. It is imperative to strive to reach agreement on the parameters of international existence based on respect for human values  traditions and principles  to realize peace  stability and development  as well as to encourage the setting up of creative dialogue and positive interaction among global cultures in order to realize understanding and enhance international cooperation with the aim of achieving peace  security  stability and welfare for all nations and peoples.May God's peace and blessings be upon you."
"148",6094,"SDN",56,2001,"﻿Allow meto extend  on behalf of the people and Government ofthe Sudan  our heartfelt condolences to the Governmentand people of the Dominican Republic and to thefamilies of the victims of the tragic American Airlinescrash that took place earlier this week.We would also like to express our condolences tothe brotherly people of Algeria  who recently sufferedsweeping floods in their country.At the outset  I would like to express to you Mr. President  our warm congratulations on yourelection as President of the fifty-sixth session of theGeneral Assembly. We are pleased to assure you of ourconfidence in your ability to lead our work to success.We would also like to express our gratitude toMr. Harri Holkeri for the able and efficient way inwhich he discharged the presidency during the lastsession.I would also like to salute Mr. Kofi Annan Secretary-General of the United Nations  and extend tohim our warm congratulations on his re-election tohead the Organization for a second term. I am pleasedto congratulate him once again on winning the Nobel25Peace Prize. We are confident that he will continue inhis untiring efforts to lead the Organization towards itsnoble objectives of achieving a better tomorrow forhumanity.This session is being held at a time of extremelycomplex developments in the wake of the tragicterrorist acts that took place in New York andWashington  D.C. From this podium  I would like toreaffirm Sudan’s condemnation and denunciation ofterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We wouldlike to express once again our sincere condolences tothe Government of the United States and to the familiesof the victims.The Sudan calls upon the Organization to rise tothe onerous challenges  heavy burdens and subsequentrepercussions of these events. This will require acoordinated and collective international effort tocombat terrorism and uproot its causes and sourcesunder the authority of international legitimacy. In thiscontext  we must differentiate between good andevil — we must avoid putting both in one basket. Weshould not confuse the issues  because if we do  goodmight be transformed into evil.I would like to take this opportunity to emphasizeSudan’s readiness to continue to participate in andcontribute to this effort. Sudan has ranked first amongMember States that have ratified or acceded tointernational conventions on terrorism. At the regionallevel  Sudan was among the first countries to ratify theArab Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. Ithas also ratified the Convention of the Organization ofthe Islamic Conference on Combating InternationalTerrorism. We are in the process of ratifying theConvention of the Organization of African Unity on thePrevention and Combating of Terrorism. At thenational level  we have adopted a law to fightterrorism. Through these measures  my country ishelping to build a proper and sound foundation forcombating and uprooting international terrorism inaccordance with international legitimacy.I would like to join those who preceded me bysaying that terrorism does not belong to a particularreligion  nationality  or ethnic group. It is aninternational phenomenon. Therefore  we mustcoordinate our efforts internationally to uproot it. Wedeplore efforts in some circles to link terrorism withIslam in cheap attempt to sow discord among thefollowers of divine religions and to portray the issue asa clash between cultures and civilizations. Islam is areligion of peace and tolerance  and as such is far fromhaving any connection to terrorism.The proceedings of this session could not havecome at a more opportune moment for us in the Sudan.We reaped the benefit of our common efforts supportedby our brothers and friends to lift the sanctions thathave been imposed on the Sudan by the SecurityCouncil since 1996. This will contribute to Sudan’sfurther cooperation with the international community.In this context  the Sudan calls upon the SecurityCouncil to pursue this objective policy and review thesanctions it has imposed on a number of countries including Libya and Iraq.The Sudan also calls upon the Security Council todispatch a fact-finding mission in connection with theAlshifa pharmaceutical factory in the Sudan  whichwas destroyed by American missiles in August 1998.We believe that the bombardment of this factory was aflagrant mistake committed by the former Americanadministration. It is a mistake that should berecognized and corrected  which would allow MemberStates and peoples of the world to regain confidence inthe Organization and help remove a source ofgrievance and injustice. Thus the people of the worldcould live together in a world of justice  equality security and peace.The delegation of the Sudan believes that now isthe time to end the unilateral coercive economicmeasures imposed on certain countries  including theSudan  which have negative effects on many sectors ofour population  particularly women and children.We in the Sudan look forward to a new era in ourrelations with the Organization following the lifting ofthe sanctions imposed on our country. We are pleasedto confirm that we will endeavour to make everypossible moral and intellectual effort to support theactivities of the Organization that promote the well-being of humanity. We also anticipate that theOrganization will play an effective role and make anew contribution towards assisting the Sudan in theimplementation of its national developmentprogrammes  including the eradication of poverty andthe rehabilitation of areas destroyed by war.26The Sudan  as the current Chair of two Africanregional organizations  the IntergovernmentalAuthority on Development and the Community ofSahelo-Saharan States  would like once again to recallthe historic Declaration adopted by the MillenniumSummit so as to confront the challenges faced at alllevels by the international community in the twenty-first century. The Sudan hopes this Declaration will betranslated into real and tangible action aimed atachieving justice and equality and the full participationof all Member States in the creation of a bettertomorrow where human beings will be liberated fromfear  poverty and destitution.For us to realize our aspirations  this sessionshould give special attention to reforming theOrganization’s organs  since they are the mechanismsthrough which the international community coordinatesplans to realize international peace and security comprehensive development and prosperity for allhumanity. The Security Council tops the list of theseorgans. Member States have been calling for anexpansion of its membership in the permanent and non-permanent categories  so that it will be morerepresentative of the current United Nationsmembership. They have also called for improvement inits working methods and decision-making process which should be more democratic and transparent.The General Assembly should be enabled to carryout its role as enshrined in the United Nations Charterwith respect to maintaining international peace andsecurity  and should also exercise its duty to hold otherorgans of the Organization accountable.We should like to emphasize the need torevitalize the role of the Economic and Social Council considering that it is the forum that sets outinternational development policies. Its resolutionsshould be linked more to economic and social aspectsthan to political ones. The Council should be guided bythe decisions adopted at the Vienna Conference  whichconsidered the right to development an inalienablehuman right.All countries that participated in the WorldConference against Racism  Racial Discrimination Xenophobia and Related Intolerance  held in Durban South Africa  unanimously confirmed their utmostdetermination to eradicate all forms of racism andxenophobia and to address their root causes in order toachieve justice and fairness for all peoples who havesuffered and continue to suffer from the scourge ofthese heinous practices. The Sudan supported theimplementation of recommendations from the DurbanConference  including those of the Group of eminentpersons.With regard to the deteriorating situation in theMiddle East  the Sudan expresses its deep concern atthe stalemate in the peace process and reaffirms theneed for total Israeli withdrawal from the occupiedArab territories in accordance with United Nationsresolutions. This will enable the Palestinian people toregain its sovereignty over its territories and establishits independent State with holy Jerusalem as its capital and allow sisterly Syria and Lebanon to restore theirsovereignty over all their occupied territories.The Sudan also reiterates its deep concern for thenegative humanitarian impacts of the current militaryoperations in Afghanistan on the civilian population.We welcome and support the mission of the Secretary-General’s representative  Lakhdar Brahimi  to bringpeace and stability to Afghanistan.With regard to Somalia  where the tragedies ofthe long-standing war spread negative effects to thewhole region of the Horn of Africa  the Sudandelegation calls upon all Somali parties to respond tothe voice of reason and complete nationalreconciliation in Somalia  allowing Somalia to fulfil itsregional and international role.By the decision adopted at the eighthIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)Summit in Khartoum last November  the Sudan wasmandated  together with neighbouring countries  tocomplete the national reconciliation efforts incoordination with Somalia’s Transitional Government.In conformity with this mandate to restore stability inSomalia  the President of the Republic of the Sudan Omer Hassan Ahmed Al-Bashir  current Chairman ofIGAD  has appointed a special envoy for peace in thatsisterly country. The special envoy is engaged inintensive contacts with the countries of the subregion the Transitional Government in Somalia  the differentSomali factions and the IGAD secretariat. From thispodium  the delegation of the Sudan calls upon theUnited Nations and the international community tosupport the efforts to restore security  stability andinfrastructure in Somalia  so that the Government willbe able to fulfil its commitments and establish peaceand stability in the country.27We understand the concern of the internationalcommunity over the continuation of the war in thesouthern Sudan. I would like to bring to theAssembly’s attention the position of the Government ofthe Sudan with a view to ending the war and achievingpeace through the following steps: an immediate supervised and total ceasefire; regular access tohumanitarian assistance for the population in need;negotiations on a political solution to the problem; andthe reconstruction of the areas affected by the war.The ninth IGAD Summit is to be held inKhartoum in January of next year. We hope that thequestions of the Sudan and Somalia will be given theimportance they deserve so that leaders will come awaywith a clear vision of how to end the war and restorepeace in this sensitive region of the world.In this context  I would like to refer to thestatement of the Special Rapporteur on the situation ofhuman rights in the Sudan before the Third Committeelast week. He stated that the war in the Sudan is not areligious war  as is repeatedly alleged by some circleswishing to distort the truth.I would like to take this opportunity to commendthe Arab Republic of Egypt and the Libyan ArabJamahiriya for their joint initiative for peace andreconciliation in the Sudan. I would also like to paytribute to IGAD member States for their initiative tostop the war in the Sudan and the genuine efforts torestore peace in my country. The Government of theSudan will continue its commitment to cooperatingwith the United Nations  donor countries andhumanitarian organizations in order to facilitate thedelivery of humanitarian assistance to the victims ofthe war.With regard to economics  the Government hasmaintained and enhanced reform and liberalizationprogrammes and has introduced measures andincentives to promote local and foreign privateinvestment. The Sudan has now succeeded innormalizing its relations with regional andinternational financial institutions. A positive sign ofthis is an increase in local investments and steadyflows of foreign investment to the Sudan.We are mindful of the accelerated pace ofglobalization in the domain of international law especially in the field of criminal liability and bringingbefore international criminal authorities individualscharged with committing heinous crimes prohibited byinternational law.In this connection  we believe it is imperative thatall States and individuals should stand as equals beforeinternational law. The avoidance of double standards isa true safeguard against the distortion of internationaljustice and ensures that it stays on the right path. Wehave made considerable effort in the past few years  incoordination with many countries of the world  toguarantee the faithful application of these standardsand noble principles. To this end  the Sudan chose tofollow words with deeds by quickly signing the RomeStatute establishing the International Criminal Court.International cooperation on disarmament shouldbe based on commitment and adherence tointernational law and the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter  including the sovereignequality of States  territorial integrity  the peacefulsettlement of disputes  non-interference in the internalaffairs of other States and the legitimate right of Statesto self-defence.In conclusion  I would like to invite the Assemblyto reaffirm the political will required to achieveinternational peace and security. I call upon all to adoptconcrete measures ensuring that globalization becomesa positive engine of progress; that its advantages andbenefits are shared by humanity at large  not restrictedto a minority; and that globalization does not lead tocultural and intellectual hegemony and is not used as ameans of political and economic pressure. If thathappened  it would undoubtedly result in widening thedevelopment gap and the clash between the differentcultures of the North and the South.Let us all join together in a new era ofinternational relations based on the rejection ofconflicts and confrontation  on mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of others. To thisend  I would like to reaffirm the Sudan’s commitmentand pledge to cooperate with the internationalcommunity to move forward in realizing the commonaspirations of all humanity."
"149",6139,"SEN",56,2001,"﻿Pendingfurther news  I also wish to share in the sadness we allfeel on the announcement of an aeroplane crash inQueens.Through me  Senegal has the pleasure ofaddressing its warm congratulations to Mr. Han Seung-soo on his brilliant election to the presidency of thefifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.His election clearly is a tribute to his outstandingqualities as a diplomat and statesman and it alsoexpresses the unanimous recognition of the MemberStates of our Organization of his country  the Republicof Korea  for its steadfast commitment to the service ofuniversal peace and international cooperation.I wish to express to his predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland  our deepgratitude for the competence  commitment and spirit ofopenness with which he discharged his mandate duringa particularly heavy year.Finally  I am happy to reiterate Senegal’s deepappreciation to the Secretary-General  His ExcellencyMr. Kofi Annan  and at the same time to reiterate tohim our wholehearted compliments on his historic re-election  the dazzling consecration of outstandingqualities of a man of good will  conviction and vision who has devoted his life to the noble causes of theUnited Nations. I also congratulate him on the brilliantrecognition he and the United Nations have justreceived as the Nobel Peace Prize laureates.He deserves our full support in the pursuit and theachievement of the outstanding work in the area ofreform in which he  along with his colleagues  is fullyinvested to bring our Organization closer to therealities of the twenty-first century.The terrorist attempts of 11 September  whichtragically struck New York  the Headquarters of ourOrganization  Washington and Pennsylvania  haveradically changed our vision of the world and ofinternational relations. My country  Senegal  onceagain conveys its sympathy to the people of the UnitedStates and reiterates its heartfelt condolences to thebereaved families.Let us say it unambiguously: there is no moral religious or political cause noble enough to justify17terrorism or its always barbarous manifestations —which all of us without exception must condemn withunwavering unity and with the utmost force.Senegal is a secular democratic country whosepopulation is more than 90 per cent Muslim; we rejectall forms of confrontation between religions  culturesor civilizations. Senegal believes that Islam  like otherrevealed religions  is a faith of peace and tolerance  andvigorously condemns any equation of Islam withterrorism and any attempt to invoke or use religion forcriminal purposes. The massacre of pregnant womenand the destruction of buildings occupied by innocentcivilians — God’s creatures every one — are acts thathave no justification in any religion  least of all Islam whose banner of peace and harmony among men andwomen  peoples  cultures and civilizations we proudlybear.Beyond simply condemning terrorism in all itsforms  methods and manifestations  the internationalcommunity must act firmly to eradicate terrorism  itssources of financing and its bases of action throughoutthe world.Senegal is committed to that course  which is whyHis Excellency President Abdoulaye Wade took thewell known initiative of convening on 17 October atDakar an African conference against terrorism  inwhich 27 countries participated. President Wadesubmitted to that forum a draft African pact againstterrorism as a needed complement to the Organizationof African Unity (OAU) Convention on the Preventionand Combating of Terrorism. The conference endedwith the adoption of the Dakar Declaration againstTerrorism  which firmly condemned terrorism in all itsforms; reaffirmed our solidarity with all victims ofterrorist acts  in particular the thousands of innocentcivilian citizens of countries throughout the world whodied on 11 September; and invited the OAU promptlyto convene an extraordinary session on terrorism toconsider  inter alia  the draft African pact againstterrorism submitted by Senegal with the support ofother countries.Let me make it clear that those who argue thatAfrica has priorities other than terrorism are surelyforgetting that tragedy resulting from acts of blindslaughter struck first in Africa: in Kenya and Tanzania.With bald lack of consideration and respect for Africanlives  bombers in Nairobi killed 12 United Statesnationals and 212 Kenyans and wounded more than3 000 of our Kenyan brothers and sisters. They havenever expressed any regret  much less remorse  fortheir obvious contempt for us. Fighting internationalterrorism means saying loud and clear that Africans like Europeans  Americans and all the other peoples ofthe world  have an equal right to safety  security stability and peace.That is the powerful message that His ExcellencyPresident Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal wants to echothroughout the world. Let us remember his initiativefor a genuine security policy in Africa  along with hisinitiative to review African debt and his OmegaPlan — a genuine African globalization strategy whichhas now been merged with the Millennium Partnershipfor African Recovery to form the New AfricanInitiative.There are years that the long march of historycannot conceal or obliterate  and the past 12-monthperiod is undoubtedly among these; it wasextraordinarily rich in events of great importance bothfor the United Nations and for Africa  the seat ofhumankind. Thus  within the framework of the fifty-fifth session  the Millennium Summit brought togetherin this Hall heads of State or Government to  in thefelicitous words of the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  identify and work to solve the world’s majorproblems.In an extraordinary convergence of views  worldleaders reaffirmed their faith in the United Nations andits irreplaceable mission to protect international peaceand security  to fight poverty  to promote economic andsocial development  to strengthen democracy and therule of law and to ensure justice and equity amongcitizens  peoples  cultures and civilizations.In view of the universality which is the hallmarkof the United Nations and which was reaffirmed at theMillennium Summit  Senegal firmly supports thelegitimate request of the Republic of China on Taiwanto resume its seat in the Organization and in itsspecialized agencies. That request is not directedagainst any State Member of the United Nations; meetingit would be a key contribution to consolidating theideal of the universality of the United Nations and tothe advent of an era of peace and stability in thatsensitive part of the world.Africa remains the region where some conflictsseem to exist in tragic eternity; it is where nearly halfof the world’s refugees and displaced persons are to be18found; it is the site of 33 of the world’s 48 leastdeveloped countries. Africa is also the region whoseinhabitants are the most appallingly affected by theHIV/AIDS and malaria pandemics. Unquestionably that enormously disturbing situation calls out to theentire international community and  in particular  toAfricans. That is why it is important to implement theoutcome of the twenty-sixth special session of theGeneral Assembly  which was devoted to the fightagainst HIV/AIDS.Last July  the African Union was christened at thehistoric Lusaka summit of the OAU. By that historicact  Africa committed itself  in a proactive and unifiedspirit  to find African solutions to the many challengesbefore it  by establishing a modern  viable  openinstitutional framework that can respond to Africa’semergencies and needs in the new century. Here  Irenew my congratulations to my friend and brotherAmara Essy  to whom African heads of State orGovernment have entrusted the task of following SalimAhmed Salim in shouldering the high responsibilitiesof the post of Secretary-General of the OAU and ofputting in place the new structures of the AfricanUnion.The second major event of the Lusaka summit ispart of the same pan-African dynamic: the adoption ofa plan for the economic and social development ofAfrica  known as the New African Initiative — the newpartnership for the development of Africa  to which Iearlier referred. This has the quality of having beenconceived by Africans for Africa on the basis of themerger of two novel projects: the Omega Plan ofPresident Abdoulaye Wade; and the programme for anAfrican renaissance of Presidents Thabo Mbeki ofSouth Africa  Abelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria andOlusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria. That joint initiativeshould help create the synergy needed to eradicatepoverty in Africa and to lay the foundations forsustainable economic and social development  which isa prerequisite for integrating the continent into theongoing process of globalization.For the first time in the history of plans for therenewal of Africa  an international conference on thefinancing of the New African Initiative is planned forJanuary 2002 at Dakar. That forum will truly be anAfrican Davos and should make it possible to hold afruitful dialogue among all development partners thathave understood the renewal heralded by the new plan which sums up our experiences and symbolizes thehopes of all of us who unconditionally love Africa.There has been impressive progress in Africa thisyear with respect to the urgent need to tackle the rootcauses of the many conflicts that shake the continentand to work peacefully towards their lasting resolution.On the crises in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Burundi and in Sierra Leone  we are pleased to saythat significant milestones have been reached by allactors in the implementation of peace agreementsalready concluded.From that standpoint  there is true cause forencouragement in the beginning of an inter-Congolesedialogue in Gaborone  Botswana  and the recentformation  with the help of the incomparable NelsonMandela  of the transitional government of Burundi fornational reconciliation. It is now up to the SecurityCouncil to perform all of its responsibilities underChapter VII of the Charter. These efforts deserve to beintensified and given diplomatic support by theinternational community through concrete actions tofinance strategies for post-conflict peace-building. Inthe same spirit  it is important to support the efforts ofAngola and the Organization of African Unity for therapid settlement of the conflict in that country.In light of the debt crisis aggravated by theexponential drop in official development assistance  theinternational community must explore new ways andmeans to develop the third world  especially Africa through  inter alia  an increase in direct foreigninvestment. It is this break with the past — this“epistemological” departure — that our Presidentproposes to Africa and its partners. He argues that theaid/credit couplet  which has been the principal way tofinance development in Africa and has led to theimpasse we all know  should be abandoned andreplaced by an approach that makes Africa attractiveand competitive  leading to a massive inflow of privateinvestment  both domestic and international.The cycle of debt followed by ever greaterdebt — a cycle that has been described by ourPresident as a scourge similar to the slavery thatdevastated Africa — should give way to an approachthat brings in massive investment in an adequate fiscaland legal environment — investment capable of fillingthe gaps in priority sectors such as infrastructure education  health  agriculture  new technologies andaccess to the markets of developed countries. This19approach  of course  would be part of a strategy ofgood political and economic governance andunqualified respect for the rule of law  democracy andhuman rights.Africa is relying greatly on the results of theMinisterial Conference of the World TradeOrganization that just opened in Doha; theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment in Monterrey  scheduled for March 2002;and the World Summit on Sustainable Development inJohannesburg  planned for September  to provideinnovative solutions to the challenges besetting Africaat the beginning of this millennium.Looking sadly toward the Middle East  Senegal isfollowing recent developments with great concern andfeels solidarity with the Palestinian people in light ofthe new tragedy. Horrified by the scope of this tragedy Senegal condemns the Israeli occupation of Palestinianterritories and the intensification of acts of violenceagainst innocent civilians. Senegal addresses an earnestappeal to all the parties  the co-sponsors of the peaceprocess  the European Union  the Security Council andthe international community  for the withdrawal ofIsraeli forces from the occupied Palestinian areas; forthe immediate cessation of all acts of violence andprovocation; for respect for the Geneva ConventionRelative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Timeof War and the relevant United Nations resolutions; forthe resumption of peace negotiations in accordancewith the agreed timetable; and for the conclusion of anoverall settlement agreement that is just  durable and inconformity with resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)of the Security Council.Peace cannot prosper nor can the development ofthe region be ensured so long as Israelis andPalestinians fail in their efforts to forge bonds ofconfidence  as sovereign States within internationallyrecognized and guaranteed borders. I am happy to notethat the European Union and the United States haverecently affirmed this  inasmuch as Israel and thefuture State of Palestine each have the right to exist  tolive in peace and to develop in security and dignity.I wish to conclude by saying that theconsolidation of the rule of law and the promotion andprotection of human rights and fundamental freedomsremain one of the major focal points of our nationaland foreign policy. The special importance that ourPresident attaches to these matters has been eloquentlyexpressed in the appointment of a woman to the post ofHigh Commissioner for Human Rights.The World Conference against Racism  RacialDiscrimination  Xenophobia and Related Intolerancewas held  despite all obstacles  and dealt with itsagenda despite the complexity of the issues and theparticularly difficult conditions under which thenegotiations took place. My country  which had thehonour to preside over the work of the PreparatoryCommittee  once again addresses a solemn appeal to allactors in international life to translate the Declarationand Plan of Action adopted at Durban into action.Thus  at the beginning of the twenty-first century  theworld can be definitively freed of the scourge ofracism  which represents a grave infringement ofhuman dignity and a flagrant violation of human rights.Speaking of human rights  we also naturally thinkof the rights of women and children. The twenty-seventh special session of the General Assembly planned for 8-10 May 2002  will adopt a new agendafor the international community aimed at betterensuring  safeguarding and defending the rights of thechild and promoting the Convention on that subject.The commitments to which our Governments willsubscribe must be implemented  as must theconclusions of the Fourth World Youth Forum of theUnited Nations system  held in Senegal in August thisyear.It is imperative that we face the challenges ofpeace and development. We have no other choice but todo so through multilateralism and universalism. Thusthe world needs the United Nations  an organizationthat is universal and unique. This is the conviction ofSenegal  which proclaims that a United Nations that iswell restructured and more representative would bebetter equipped to face the challenges that humanityconfronts today. Those challenges seem as immovableas mountains  but everything is possible in a world ofsolidarity  brotherhood  security and respect for thesacred character of human life  dignity and theinalienable right of all peoples to happiness and liberty."
"150",6186,"SGP",56,2001,"﻿It does seemstrange to congratulate Minister Han Seung-soo on hisappointment as President of the General Assembly solate in this session. But we live in unusual times. TheUnited Nations needs clear leadership. With hisdistinguished track record in public service in theRepublic of Korea  we are confident that Minister Hanwill provide it to this Assembly. We assure him of ourfull support.We also congratulate Mr. Harri Holkeri for hiscommendable leadership last year and  of course  theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  and the UnitedNations on the Nobel Peace Prize that they received.The timing of this General Assembly indicatesthe difficult circumstances we are in. Never before inits 56-year history has the United Nations had topostpone the general debate. Clearly  the terroristattacks of 11 September have already had drastic andimmediate international consequences. The long-termconsequences are still unknown. But we can be surethat they will be both powerful and wide-ranging.For the short term  the events of 11 Septemberhave shaken an already vulnerable world economy. Thedeveloped world is suffering a growing economicslowdown. This is well known. Unfortunately  what isless well known are the damaging effects of theterrorist attacks on developing countries. In thedeveloped countries  which provide the principalengine of the world’s economy  the attacks haveundermined consumer confidence  disrupted commerceand destroyed wealth. But these are temporary shocksfrom which the developed world can and will recover.But what the terrorist attacks have dramaticallyhighlighted is the reality of interdependence in today’sglobalized world. Joseph Stiglitz  a recent Nobel Prizewinner  like the United Nations  highlighted thisinterdependence in a Washington Post article dated 11November 2001. He said  “It used to be said that whenAmerica sneezed  Mexico caught a cold. Now  whenAmerica sneezes  much of the world catches cold. Andaccording to recent data  America is not just sneezing it has a bad case of the flu.”Hence  the developing countries  which dependon a healthy global economy for their hopes of growthand prosperity  face great dangers. The fear ofterrorism may constrict the key arteries ofglobalization. We have already seen new precautionstaken in many countries  at ports  airports  trainstations  banks  media offices  government buildings factories  offices  hospitals and many other publicinstitutions. These precautions are important to protectinnocent people in their daily lives. However  they alsoinevitably impose additional costs. These newrestrictions on travel  on shipping  on national andinternational mail and on the free flow of goods andinformation everywhere are effectively a tariff imposedby terrorism upon the global community. Tragically  itis also a regressive tariff  one that affects the poorermembers of the global community more.34If the arteries of globalization becomeincreasingly constricted and cease to functioneffectively  developing countries will lose their bestchance of growing out of poverty. This will onlyaggravate the hopelessness  marginalization  ignoranceand fear that can breed terrorism. We must avoid thisvicious cycle. In developed countries  the economicslowdown is already strengthening protectionist voicescalling for restrictions on imports  the imposition ofnon-tariff barriers  anti-dumping duties  restrictions onmigration and governmental support for domesticindustries. A genuine concern over terrorist use ofinternational financial and information networks couldalso be used as a justification for restrictions on theflows of international investment and information. Anddeveloping countries need these flows.Indeed  even before 11 September  developingcountries were not benefiting sufficiently from theseflows. The greater part of foreign direct investment(FDI) flows mainly among developed countries. Of theremainder  12 major developing countries take 75 percent of private FDI to the developing world  while 140developing countries take a share of only 5 per cent.The poorest nations of the world therefore suffer notfrom too many connections with the wider world  buttoo few. Indeed  the poorest 48 countries account foronly 4 per cent of total world trade  while sub-SaharanAfrica receives only 5 per cent of the total net long-term private capital flows to developing countries. Atthe same time  in the developed countries  tariffs on theexport of goods of developing countries are 30 per centhigher than the global average. The fact that tariffs ongoods of developing countries are 30 per cent higherthan the global average is truly a shocking statistic  andwe are surprised that this has not been highlightedbefore in key forums. All this shows that the poorcountries cannot afford any further restrictions ontrade.In this regard  we are relieved that the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) meeting in Doha  Qatar which ended yesterday  has finally agreed to launch anew round of trade talks that we hope will keep theglobal economy on track towards freer trade andinvestment. Today’s Wall Street Journal  which  as weall know  is a conservative journal  drew this linkbetween the events of 11 September and the results ofDoha:“In an effort to keep poorer nations on theirside in the war on terrorism  United States andEuropean negotiators went further than anyoneexpected to meet the demands of the developingworld. …“Ultimately  the United States and Europemade big concessions to the developing world —concessions fiercely resisted by pharmaceuticaland steel companies in the United States andfarmers in Europe.”This Doha meeting therefore confirmed that theneeds of poorer countries will have to be addressed inthe months and years to come  because as a result of 11September  poorer countries will certainly suffer morethan richer ones. To give another obvious example tourism from richer countries is a major source ofincome for many developing countries. But the fear offlying — which I think has become quite realnowadays — engendered by the recent terrorist attackshas already caused airlines all over the world to cutflight schedules and in many cases terminate themaltogether. It is already much harder to get directflights from  say  New York City to many LatinAmerican destinations. The World Travel and TourismCouncil has estimated that the events of 11 Septembermay cause the loss of up to 8.8 million jobs in thetravel and tourism industry. Of these  only 2.3 millionwill be in the United States and Europe. The rest willbe in the developing world. Clearly  the impact ondeveloping countries dependent on the tourist tradewill be enormous.The record of the past 30 years shows clearly thatcountries better integrated into the global economicsystem have enjoyed greater long-term growth thanhave relatively isolated countries. I can quote no betterauthority than the Secretary-General  who has said “Success in achieving sustained growth dependscritically on expanding access to the opportunitiesof globalisation. The countries that have achievedhigher growth are those that have successfullyintegrated into the global economy and attractedforeign investment.” (Making Globalisation WorkFor The Poor  The Independent  12 December2000)In a recent book  The End of Globalization:Lessons from the Great Depression  the author HaroldJames examines the fallout from a collapse of theintegrated world in an earlier era. He provides asobering historical perspective on what we areexperiencing today. In the era before the First World35War  the world was in many ways a well-integratedplace. Movement of capital  knowledge and labouramong both rich and poor countries was much lessrestricted. The rise of protectionism and isolationism inresponse to this led to the Great Depression of the firsthalf of the twentieth century. This long-lasting globalrecession ended only with the outbreak of the SecondWorld War. This is not a cycle that we should repeat aswe enter the twenty-first century.One big lesson of 11 September is therefore thatglobalization  which we assume to be a powerful irresistible force  is actually a very fragile construct dependent on the will of its participants for itscontinuing existence. If it collapses — and the point tobear in mind is that it may collapse — developingcountries could suffer more. Hence  the terrorists whodestroyed the World Trade Center could also seriouslydamage the global economic system that represents thebest chance that the developing countries have forlong-term development  growth and prosperity. If theterrorists succeed  we will all be worse off.Hence  at the recently concluded summit of theAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) inShanghai  China  APEC leaders representing 21countries  both developed and developing  and comingfrom three continents  unequivocally condemnedterrorist acts as a profound threat to the peace prosperity and security of all people  all faiths and allnations and pledged to cooperate fully to ensure thatinternational terrorism does not disrupt economies andmarkets. We are not engaged here merely in a strugglebetween a few developed nations and a few terrorists.The whole world is involved in this struggle.Following 11 September  we in the internationalcommunity must act together to safeguard what wehave achieved and what we have yet to achieve. Thestruggle against terrorism itself will take much timeand stamina. To track down the terrorist groups and ripup their networks will be a difficult  long  messy andeven tedious business  requiring the cooperative effortsof many countries. Countering terrorism must be aninternational endeavour  and in this internationalendeavour the United Nations has a critical role to play.The United Nations remains the indispensableforum to mobilize international opinion and develop astrong political consensus against terrorism. Throughthe Security Council  it also provides a platform forpractical cooperation  as we saw  for example  inSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001). Within theUnited Nations system several bodies are alreadyseized of the various dimensions of terrorism. Oneuseful course of action would be for the various lawenforcement and other agencies dealing with terrorismto get together to examine existing norms and practicesand areas for further cooperation. Where suchcooperation is already taking place bilaterally ortrilaterally among countries  the United Nations canserve as a useful disseminator and clearing house ofinformation and best practices.In the long term  the economic and socialconditions that encourage terrorists must be addressedurgently  and certainly after 11 September  we nowknow how urgent this task is. International economicintegration  while ultimately the only guarantor ofprosperity  is today incomplete in scope and uneven inits distribution of costs and benefits. Many developingcountries remain imperfectly integrated into the worldeconomy. These problems must be addressed bycapacity-building and infrastructure developmentwithin developing countries  with whateverinternational assistance is necessary  and by theelimination of trade barriers and protectionism in thedeveloped countries.It is useful here to cite the latest World Bankreport  which states clearly that abolishing all tradebarriers could boost global income by $2.8 trillion —that is an enormous sum — and could also lift as manyas 320 million people out of poverty by 2015. We hopethat the World Trade Organization negotiators will bearthis in mind when they commence the new round ofnegotiations after the Doha  Qatar  meeting.To conclude  please allow me to quote theSecretary-General once again:“In an increasingly globalized world  noneof the critical issues we are dealing with can beresolved within a solely national framework. Allof them require cooperation  partnership andburden-sharing among Governments  the UnitedNations  regional organizations  non-governmental organizations  the private sectorand civil society.” (A/56/1  para. 11)Global actions  facilitated by consultative leadership are needed to address challenges of global dimensions.We hope that we can make a small beginning at thissession of the General Assembly to do this."
"151",6219,"SLB",56,2001,"﻿At the outset let me express my sincere felicitations and those of myGovernment and the people of the Solomon Islands  onyour election  Sir  as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-sixth session. As you know  theRepublic of Korea and Solomon Islands enjoy verywarm and cordial relations. My delegation is thereforedelighted to see you presiding over this Assembly. Ourgratitude also goes to your predecessor  Mr. HarriHolkeri  for the efficient manner in which he conductedthe work of the previous session. I also congratulate theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  on his well-deserved reappointment for another term in office  andon the award  to him and to the United Nations  of the2001 Nobel Peace Prize.The horrendous terrorist attack on the UnitedStates on 11 September was an attack against humanity.What we witnessed on that day was unimaginable. Itbrought pain and loss on an inconceivable scale; therecan be no justification for it. This morning I visitedground zero to pay my respects to the thousands ofinnocent people buried there and to reaffirm thesolidarity of Solomon Islands with the Government andthe people of the United States of America.Terrorism is an evil phenomenon which must beeradicated. Individuals and organizations perpetratingsuch evil must be brought to justice. Similarly  Statesthat harbour or provide safe haven for terroristactivities must play their full part in eradicating thismenace.The war against international terrorism must aimto have far-reaching solutions  rather than be merelyreactive. Effective international cooperation is criticalto the global implementation of anti-terrorismmeasures  in order to deny terrorists any weak spotsthat they could exploit to launch their criminaloperations. Solomon Islands is taking steps towards theratification of the various international conventionsagainst terrorism. Countries such as mine needtechnical support in law enforcement  surveillance andinformation-sharing so as to effectively implementthese instruments. In this regard  I welcome PresidentBush’s offer to help countries that need assistance in2strengthening and implementing anti-terrorismstrategies.While the war against terrorism is a matter ofurgency  the United Nations should not underestimatethe continuing need to address other global issues thatalso threaten human security. Persistent poverty andunderdevelopment; environmental degradation; internalconflict and war; the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  as well as of small arms and lightweapons; trade in illicit drugs; the deadly spread ofHIV/AIDS; and violations of human rights are allcomplex global problems that continue to demandconcerted global responses.With their limited resources and capacity  smallisland developing States like Solomon Islands areunable to cope with the magnitude of these problems.Post-cold-war security now rightly embraces human environmental  economic and political dimensions.The inter-ethnic crisis that the Solomon Islandsexperienced between 1998 and 2000  and itsdevastating impact on the country  is a soberingreminder that peace and development are intrinsicallylinked. One cannot be achieved if the other fails. Inmost situations  including in our case  peace takesprecedence  as no rebuilding is possible withoutsecurity and stability. My Government has workedresolutely to bring the warring factions to the table.Our efforts culminated in the signing of the TownsvillePeace Agreement in October 2000 and of the MarauPeace Agreement earlier this year.The Townsville Agreement led to the cessation ofthe conflict. However  progress in the implementationof the Agreement’s disarmament provisions has beenslow. With a considerable number of high-poweredweapons still to be handed in  the peace processremains fragile. A review of the Agreement was begunrecently  but it has been temporarily suspended. We areconfident that the review process will soon resume inorder to positively consolidate the ongoing peaceprocess.At this juncture  I wish to acknowledge thecontributions of our development partners towards thepeace process  in particular the Governments of theRepublic of China on Taiwan  Australia  New Zealandand the countries of the European Union. MyGovernment is also grateful to civil society institutions including the churches and non-governmentalorganizations  for their efforts  especially at the heightof the crisis.The challenge is far from over. With a shatteredeconomy and a delicate peace process  the task ofrebuilding the country and ensuring lasting peace isformidable. It requires the patience  cooperation andcommitment of all Solomon Islanders. My Governmenthas adopted a National Peace Plan and Programme ofAction aimed at addressing the root causes of theconflict through meaningful dialogue and discussionand by encouraging a more participatory approach inthe country’s socio-economic and politicaldevelopment. The recent ruling by our judiciaryaffirming the constitutional legitimacy of myGovernment has given us additional resolve toimplement this Plan and Programme of Action. In thisconnection  the understanding and support of theinternational community  in particular our developmentpartners  is important.Development cooperation should strive to reducethe vulnerability of societies to violent conflicts. Aidshould go beyond immediate humanitarian needs. It hasto be linked to peace-building initiatives in order tomake peace sustainable. Development assistance could therefore  be a means of conflict prevention and aninstrument for peace-building.There is a clear imperative to address the povertyand inequality that exist among our countries. But thereis also an irrefutable common interest for doing so  asmany of today’s problems — especially in the leastdeveloped countries — are rooted in underdevelopmentand poverty. The timely implementation of theoutcomes of the Third United Nations Conference onthe Least Developed Countries is therefore imperative.We are fully aware that primary responsibility to put inplace the necessary reforms for poverty reduction andeconomic growth lies with the least developedcountries. Education  infrastructure development andimproving basic health services remain priority issuesfor Solomon Islands.Undoubtedly  investment of overseasdevelopment assistance resources to support our effortscan accelerate development. Donor countries andagencies must be more inclined to ensure that they donot give with one hand  only to take away with theother. In a globalizing world  donor partners’ policies3in virtually every sector — including trade andinvestment  financial systems and the environment —must help promote development for the poorest. In theabsence of that  the goal of attaining sustainabledevelopment and managing globalization in a way thatmaximizes its benefits for all will be difficult torealize.In the same spirit  I call on the developmentpartners to consider more practical and realisticmeasures to deal with the huge amount of debt burdenthat poor countries continue to shoulder. Developmentpartners must continue to positively consider measuressuch as writing off debts; for even the Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries Debt Initiative and the Paris Clubinitiatives to address the problems of highly indebtedand poor developing countries have been cumbersomeand slow.The International Conference on Financing forDevelopment  which is to be held in Mexico nextMarch  offers a unique opportunity for achievingconsensus on how to mobilize new and additionalresources for development. Solomon Islands looksforward to participating actively in the Conference.Agenda 21 remains a valid blueprint for themanagement of the Earth’s environment and thesustainable development of its resources. The WorldSummit on Sustainable Development  to be held inJohannesburg next year  10 years after Rio  shouldreach consensus on ways and means to ensure widerand effective implementation of Agenda 21 andsubsequent international programmes  including theBarbados Programme of Action for the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States.The ocean and its bounty continue to be aprincipal resource for Solomon Islands. Our prioritiesconcerning oceans include sustainable fisheriesmanagement  habitat protection and avoidance ofmarine pollution. For us  the success of nationaldevelopment planning depends significantly on thecontinued health of the marine environment.The unique circumstances of small islanddeveloping States must be fully understood by theinternational community as we strive to address theserious threats of natural disasters  climate change andsea-level rise. The Kyoto Protocol remains a significantfirst step on the path to ensuring effective global actionto combat climate change. The internationalcommunity must now build on the outcomes of theseventh session of the Conference of the Parties to theFramework Convention and work further towards theresolution of all outstanding negotiating issues.We must recall the vision which the UnitedNations was created to serve  i.e. that each and everyhuman being deserves to live in dignity  be wellnourished  be educated  have access to decent healthcare and decent work  be respected and consulted  andbe able to develop their talents and creativity. Ourchallenge is to strengthen the United Nations and otherinternational institutions to strive more effectivelytowards that vision. Solomon Islands remainscommitted to the reform initiatives of the Secretary-General.This session should also continue with efforts tomake the work of the General Assembly more efficientand effective. Furthermore  discussions on the reformof the Security Council have gone on for too longwithout substantial progress. Greater flexibility isrequired in order for this process to be completed. Thegoal is to have a more democratic  transparent andeffective Security Council.In what is surely one of the bitter ironies of ourtimes  free and democratic Taiwan  home to 23 millionpeople and a peace-loving country  has been excludednot only from the United Nations and all its specializedagencies but also from nearly every otherintergovernmental organization in the world. Althoughthe Republic of China on Taiwan willingly abides byinternational norms  standards and obligations  it is notable to enjoy the same normal standard privileges andtreatment accorded to others. This is simply unfair andunjust. The time has come to reconsider the exclusionof the Republic of China from the United Nations. TheRepublic of China on Taiwan was a founding memberof the Organization. It is a model of economic successand democratic politics. Taiwan has continued to shareits development experiences with the widerinternational community when given the opportunity.Its continuing assistance during humanitarian crisesalso deserves full commendation.Solomon Islands’ appeal for Taiwan’srepresentation and participation in the United Nationssystem is premised on the principles of justice  dignityand the right of the people of Taiwan to be heard andrepresented in the international arena and for them tobe able to enjoy the same benefits that the rest of usenjoy. My Government firmly believes that Taiwan’s4membership in the United Nations will effectivelyserve to facilitate peaceful dialogue between the twoChinas and provide a solid basis for a lastingreconciliation between them. Dialogue is the onlymeans to resolve differences  and parity and mutualrespect must be the foundation upon which both sidescan build trust and confidence. The United Nations isthe best forum to nurture that trust and confidence. Theissue of Taiwan’s membership is consistent with theUnited Nations principle of universality. But  above all it must be acknowledged that the Republic of China onTaiwan is fully committed to fulfilling the obligationsof the United Nations Charter.Finally  next month my country is going to thepolls to elect a new parliament  and thereafter a newGovernment will be formed. This election manifestsour continuing commitment to constitutional andparliamentary democracy. It is a critical election  as itwill confer a new mandate for the next Government tocontinue with the ever-important responsibilities ofensuring the rule of law  rebuilding the economy andfurther consolidating the current peace process.Those are difficult tasks  but we are determinedto write a new page in our young history — a new pagethat should provide for ethnic harmony and co-existence  comprehensive and lasting peace  economicprosperity  and  above all  engender and nurture abetter future and hope for our children and futuregenerations."
"152",6265,"SLE",56,2001,"﻿My delegationextends to you  Sir  its warmest congratulations on yourelection to the presidency of this body at its fifty-sixthsession. Given your impressive credentials  we areconfident that under your guidance we will concludeour deliberations successfully. I would like to take thisopportunity to express our appreciation to HisExcellency Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland  who17admirably conducted the affairs of the epoch-makingMillennium Assembly last year.Let me also warmly congratulate ourindefatigable Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  onhis reappointment to a second term of office and on hisaward  with the United Nations  of the 2001 NobelPrize for Peace. As citizens of the West Africansubregion  we in Sierra Leone are proud of hisstewardship. Sierra Leone is indeed indebted to him the staff of the Secretariat and the United Nationsfamily for their invaluable support of our effort tosecure peace and stability in my country.Forty years ago  on 29 September to be exact Sierra Leone was admitted as the one hundredthMember of the United Nations. During the period thatfollowed  we made our own modest contribution to themaintenance of international peace and security. Wehave faithfully adhered to the purposes and principlesof the Charter. We have practised  and continue topractise  tolerance and good-neighbourliness. Our faithin the Organization remains as strong as it was 40 yearsago.At the same time  the United Nations and itsagencies have done a lot for the people of SierraLeone. As President Kabbah told the MillenniumSummit last year  in the course of its membership Sierra Leone has tested the capacity of the UnitedNations to respond to major challenges  especially inthe areas of peacekeeping  through the United NationsMission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL)  and ofhumanitarian law  through the proposed special court totry those who bear the greatest responsibility forserious violations of Sierra Leonean law  war crimesand crimes against humanity committed in SierraLeone. In conveying our sincere thanks to theOrganization and the rest of the internationalcommunity for their support  my delegation expressesthe hope that Sierra Leone and the United Nations willcontinue to work closely for peace  security andsustainable development in the coming years.Sadly  this session of the General Assembly istaking place in the aftermath of the despicable acts ofterrorism inflicted on our host country on 11 September2001 — acts that claimed the lives of thousands ofAmericans and of the nationals of 86 other countries.As we share their grief and renew our heartfeltcondolences to the families of the victims and theGovernment of the United States  we Sierra Leoneansare reminded of that ominous day in January 1999when over 5 000 innocent civilians were brutally killedduring the rebel onslaught on our capital city. Hundredsof others  including children and young girls  wereabducted or raped or had limbs deliberately amputated.Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations isdeplorable and must be eradicated. My delegationwould like to assure this Assembly that we shall doeverything within our power and available resources tosupport the current multilateral counter-terrorism effortunder the aegis of the United Nations.The new emerging coalition to counteract thescourge of terrorism is absolutely necessary. However the Sierra Leone delegation strongly believes that weshould also strengthen existing coalitions or build newones against those forces that continue to kill millionsof children and adults throughout the world everysingle day. We know these forces. We know theirvicious and destructive powers. Hunger  poverty malnutrition  malaria  HIV/AIDS  brutality andintolerance — these are but a few of them.Sierra Leone calls upon this Assembly and theentire international community to use the currentinternational solidarity against terrorism to translate theAgenda for Peace  the Agenda for Development  theMillennium Declaration  the Declaration and Plan ofAction of the World Summit for Children and similarstrategies and goals into a series of new coalitions: anew coalition against childhood diseases; a newcoalition against poverty and humanunderdevelopment; a new coalition against the scourgeof HIV/AIDS and malaria; and a brand new coalitionagainst the accumulation of nuclear weapons and otherweapons of mass destruction.There has been a marked improvement in thesituation in Sierra Leone. The serious humanitariancrisis still prevails  but is gradually subsiding.Thousands of ex-combatants have been disarmed anddemobilized. Government authority and civiladministrative services are gradually being establishedin areas previously occupied by rebels. Ourrestructured army is now truly professional  thanks tothe intensive training programme directed by theGovernment of the United Kingdom.By all accounts  we can say that the overallsecurity and safety situation is one of great expectation.In the coming months  the people of Sierra Leone willonce again start to enjoy to the fullest extent their basic18right to life — a life free from brutal armed rebellionsuch as that provoked and abetted by external forcesand fuelled by blood diamonds for 10 long years. Inthis connection  my delegation would like to expressour sincere gratitude to the United Nations and itsagencies  the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS)  UNAMSIL troop-contributingcountries  the United Kingdom and other friendlynations for their individual and collective contributionsto the peace process in Sierra Leone.Allow me from this rostrum to express thecondolences of the Government and people of SierraLeone for those brave and dedicated ambassadors ofpeace from the United Kingdom  Zambia  the Ukraineand Bulgaria who lost their lives in the recenthelicopter accidents in my country.Despite our optimism for peace and stability inSierra Leone  past experience of adventurous attemptsby the rebels to renege on their obligations under peaceagreements have taught us a lesson: We have to remainconstantly vigilant. The safety and security of thepeople will remain high on our national agenda  as willthe process of consolidating the peace throughsustainable development. This is why we would likethe United Nations  especially the Security Council  tocontinue to generate the necessary international supportfor our post-conflict and peace-building effort.In this connection  we would like to draw theattention of the international community and those whoassist us in the implementation of our disarmament demobilization and reintegration programme to the factthat the disarmament and demobilization of ex-combatants will soon come to a successful end.However  the process of reintegration remains crucial.We could lose the gains we have made in the peaceprocess if we allow the reintegration of ex-combatantsto collapse for lack of adequate funding. As PresidentKabbah pointed out recently  we also have tens ofthousands of young people who have never seen touched or used an AK-47 rifle or a rocket-propelledgrenade. They  too  are waiting to be integrated into themainstream of our economic and social sectors.On behalf of my Government  I would like toappeal to the international community  as a matter ofurgency  to help us remove some of the root causes ofconflict by increasing support for our reintegration andintegration programmes for the benefit of youths. Weshould no longer allow the legitimate social andeconomic needs or grievances of these young people tobe exploited by ruthless warlords whose sole objectiveis to drain our precious mineral resources for their ownselfish ends.Speaking of diamonds  I would like to inform thisAssembly that our diamond certification system established under Security Council resolution 1306(2000)  has so far been a major success. First  there hasbeen a substantial increase in revenue from legitimatediamonds since the system was established just over ayear ago. Secondly  it has also helped to reduce theincidence of an old problem that preceded thephenomenon of conflict or blood diamonds — namely smuggling. My Government is in the process ofupdating the status of the certification system in itsthird report to the Security Council through theCommittee that is monitoring the implementation ofresolution 1306 (2000).The sacrifices we have made for peace in SierraLeone are not for Sierra Leoneans alone; they are alsoin the interest of peace and stability in the Mano RiverUnion triangle in particular and the West Africansubregion as a whole. The recent rapprochement at theministerial level  followed by meetings of the JointSecurity Committee and the initiative launched by theMano River Union Women Peace Network in the threecountries — Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone — augurwell for the proposed Mano River Union summitmeeting. Meanwhile  I can assure the Assembly thatPresident Kabbah remains committed to hisdetermination to help restore adherence to the principleof good-neighbourliness in the Union. This should leadto a revitalization of economic cooperationprogrammes among the three countries. We must admitthat conflict and tension in the Union have had anegative impact on the ability of ECOWAS toconcentrate on the principal objective for which it wascreated  namely  economic cooperation anddevelopment.We are aware that primary responsibility foralleviating poverty  stimulating economic growth andreducing conflicts and their often disastrousconsequences lies in the hands of the developingcountries themselves. We are also aware thatdevelopment requires sound fiscal policies and rationalmanagement of both our human and natural resources.19However  the international consensus is thatsustainable development also requires greatercooperation between developing and developedcountries in such areas as trade  debt relief and externalfinancing. In this regard  Sierra Leone  one of the leastdeveloped countries in the world  eagerly looksforward to the results of the forthcoming Conferenceon Financing for Development and the World Summiton Sustainable Development.There are many pressing and unresolvedproblems on the international peace and securityagenda of the United Nations. One of them is thesituation in Palestine. It remains the core issue in thesearch for peace in the Middle East. In our view  it alsobreeds tension  and directly fans the flames of war inother parts of the world. In the current state of affairs itis no longer enough to speak about the right of thePalestinian people to self-determination. They have aright to an independent State of their own. In short  theestablishment of an independent Palestinian State iswell overdue. In terms of international peace andsecurity  we cannot afford any further delay.Sierra Leone is obviously not a nuclear Power.However  as a member of the human family  we areconcerned about the threat or use of nuclear weapons.Indeed  we believe that these weapons pose the greatestthreat to human survival. Therefore  we shall continueto support universal adherence to regional andinternational disarmament and non-proliferationinstruments. For instance  Sierra Leone recentlyratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty which we strongly believe is central to the question ofthe vertical  or qualitative  proliferation of nuclearweapons.We are also seriously concerned about theproliferation of conventional arms  including those thathave brought untold suffering to the people of SierraLeone during the past 10 years.Last July  at the United Nations Conference onthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons inAll Its Aspects  we pleaded in vain for action toprevent the transfer of these weapons to non-Stateentities such as terrorists and rebels who commitatrocities against innocent civilians. The recentterrorist attacks and the awareness that biologicalweapons in the hands of such non-State entities pose athreat to us all should  in the view of my delegation prod those Member States that were unable to supportour plea last July to seriously reconsider their positionon this important issue of arms transfers to non-Stateentities. We also need their full support in theimplementation of the Programme of Action adopted atthat important Conference.In conclusion  my delegation is convinced thatthe international community has at its disposal theinstruments  institutions  strategies  targets and roadmaps for counteracting and eradicating terrorism  HIV/AIDS  malaria  hunger  malnutrition and other deadlyforces  through closer multilateral cooperation.Let the fifty-sixth session of this Assembly which was interrupted by the common enemy ofterrorism  go down in history as the new multilateralcooperation session  one that should inspire all nations large and small  nuclear and non-nuclear  to dealresolutely with the other common enemies of thehuman race."
"153",6312,"SLV",56,2001,"﻿We congratulate you  Sir  on your election topreside over the General Assembly at this session andwish you every success in fulfilling your mandate. Ourappreciation also goes to Mr. Harri Holkeri for hiswork at the last session.We wish to convey to our Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  our sincerest congratulations on hisunanimous re-election for a second term as leader ofthis Organization in a broad acknowledgement of hisabilities  leadership and firm resolve to promote thepurposes and principles of the Charter  which havebeen rightly recognized with the awarding to him andthe United Nations of the Nobel Peace Prize.The delegation of El Salvador believes that thedeplorable and irrational terrorist attacks on the peopleand Government of the United States  which werepudiated and condemned at the time and do so againin this forum  have made it plain that terrorism in all itsforms and manifestations is a grave threat to peace freedom and democracy. Given the special nature ofthat scourge  it is essential that we unite our wills andpool our efforts to combat and eradicate it.These acts of terrorism have affected us alldirectly  because they represent an assault oncivilization  which is based on the values andprinciples embodied in the Charter of the Organization.Indeed  such acts affect not only international peaceand security  but also the growth and development ofour economies. In view of all this  the countriesrepresented here should not allow minority groups tocrush our peoples’ democratic spirit or to sowpermanent uncertainty and fear by means of violenceand threats directed against the most fundamentalprinciples of human coexistence.It is precisely the norms of human coexistencethat underpin and sustain peace  freedom anddevelopment for humanity  regardless of ideology culture  race or religion. We concur with manydelegations that the struggle against terrorism should4not be considered  much less interpreted  as a struggleamong civilizations or nations.Pursuant to the decisions taken by theinternational community  the Government of ElSalvador is taking the proper steps to fulfil theprovisions articulated in the pertinent resolutions of theSecurity Council and the General Assembly and othermeasures decided upon at the regional and continentallevel. It is appropriate to mention that at the CentralAmerican level  the Security Commission has adoptedan ambitious programme of action so that we can worktogether to combat terrorism.With respect to our national situation  on anumber of occasions we have reiterated thecommitment and political resolve of the Government ofEl Salvador to tackle effectively the challenges ofbuilding sustainable human development. We havemade much progress in the last decade.However  as everyone knows  this year beganwith serious natural disasters. The two earthquakes inJanuary and February shook the very foundations ofSalvadoran society  since 25 per cent of the populationwas affected  and losses amounted to 13 per cent of thegross domestic product. The devastating effects of theearthquakes extended into the economic and socialspheres  obliging us to implement an emergencyprogramme  which meant changing and adapting theGovernment’s plan to match the new priorities redirecting the State’s limited financial resources toreconstruction. This was compounded by anunprecedented drop in international coffee prices  ourmajor export commodity. We also suffered awidespread drought  affecting agricultural production which is the unpinning of our economy.Thus we believe that it is essential to reiterate ourspecial recognition of and gratitude to all the countriesand international organizations that provided us withvaluable assistance during these natural disasters. Iwish to thank in particular the World Food Programmefor its effective work in relieving the food-supplyproblems of large sectors of the population affected bythe drought.It is of the utmost importance to the Governmentof El Salvador to refer on this occasion to somethingthat has marked a turning point in the history of ournation and which  at the same time  represents asuccess for United Nations peacekeeping operations:the first multidisciplinary mission to resolve an internalconflict  as was the case in El Salvador.I wish to highlight  with great satisfaction  that 16January 2002 will mark 10 years since the historicsigning of the El Salvador Peace Agreements  whichformally ended the armed conflict that had wreakedhavoc in our society for 12 years. The Secretary-General participated actively and played an importantrole as intermediary in the process of negotiation andin the verification of the parties’ compliance with allthe commitments they had undertaken.Since that date  we have engaged in a process thatwe can divide into two phases — first  the transitionfrom war to peace  and second  the transition frompeace to democracy. During the process we have madegreat efforts to fulfil the commitments of theAgreements in order to achieve peace  democracy respect for and protection of human rights  nationalreconciliation and reunification of Salvadoran society and we have achieved qualitative changes in theseareas.The Government of El Salvador  as a signatoryparty deeply interested in faithful observance of theAgreements  has been gratified to see the successachieved in executing these undertakings  putting intopractice a constructive policy that has enabled us todeal with sensitive and complex issues. The membersof the international community  especially the donorcountries and the United Nations  can attest to this.In fulfilling the Peace Agreements  allSalvadorans shouldered the obligations with theseriousness and responsibility that were required mindful of the solemn significance and the implicationsof such fulfilment for the aspirations and expectationsthat the Agreement outlined  both domestic and vis-à-vis the international community. This is why we arevery pleased that in fulfilling our obligations we havenot betrayed the trust of those that showed us solidarityand supported us throughout the process.Now more than ever  new possibilities areopening up for all sectors of the country — with avision of being a nation — to face the future with asense of shared responsibility  and for us to undertakethe new challenges involved in continuing to bolsterdemocracy and promoting economic and socialdevelopment. Consequently  we are committed to theprocess of modernizing and strengthening democraticinstitutions in conformity with the strategy of5sustainable development  whose focus and destiny areto improve the quality of life of each and everySalvadoran.In a globalized and interdependent world  anysituation that affects the economy of the industrializedcountries and those with emerging economies has asignificant impact on the conditions in the remainder ofthe countries of the international community. The trendtowards a slowdown in these economies becomesdisquieting for our countries because of its adverseeffects on fostering economic progress and maintainingsocial stability.In this regard  it is essential to pay attention to theproblems besetting the international economic orderand prevent them from spreading and becoming causesthat generate fresh conflict  especially in thedeveloping countries. For this reason  we hope that theoutcome of the meeting of the World TradeOrganization in Doha will be beneficial for thedeveloping countries.It is appropriate to note that during theparticipation of the President of El Salvador  FranciscoFlores  in the Group of Eight Summit in Genoa  Italy on 10 June  he voiced the anxiety and concerns that wefeel about the serious problems that exist and stated ouraspirations as developing countries to promote theprogress of our peoples. On that occasion  PresidentFlores noted that we do not want handouts orconcessions based on paternalistic approaches. Wewant to become partners in development and achievemutual benefits so that we have the opportunity togradually improve our conditions and have betteraccess to and derive greater benefit from internationalmarkets.In El Salvador  we have put into practice anumber of measures concerning the free market andpromotion of foreign investment. They have led tointernationally recognized economic openness  whichin practice has included a process of privatization especially in the communications  energy and financesectors and in the area of social security  enhancing ourpotential for growth and development.At the beginning of this year  as part of a gradualprocess that will lead finally to the elimination of thenational currency  the Government of El Salvadorenacted the Monetary Integration Act  establishing thedollar as the unit of account in the financial system.This will facilitate our trading and financial integrationand further improve conditions for national and foreigninvestment and access to international financialsources.In the area of trade  in addition to having a free-trade relationship with our fraternal Central Americancountries  we have extended our ties with Mexico  theDominican Republic and Chile  establishing free-tradetreaties with them  while others are in the process ofbeing negotiated with Panama and Canada.At the same time  we are making an effort tostrengthen the process of the Central AmericanIntegration System (SICA)  where we have takensignificant steps  including customs activities and aregional proposal to modernize and transform CentralAmerica. The proposal’s strategic projects fordevelopment were presented this year to theConsultative Group in Madrid. The implementation ofthe Puebla-Panama Plan  in which Central America ispartnered with Mexico for its development  is part ofthese efforts.In general  we can say that  given the trendtowards globalization  which marks moderninternational relations  and despite the difficulties andcomplexities involved  our country is doing its utmostto take advantage of the phenomenon. In this regard the least that we can hope is that there will be goodwill and political resolve on the part of the developedcountries to grant us solidarity and support to enable usto become effectively incorporated in the process.In view of the importance of the commitmentassumed by the heads of State and Government in theMillennium Declaration of the United Nations  we notethat the International Conference on Financing forDevelopment  to be held in Mexico  and the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development will provideopportunities to demonstrate the solidarity andcooperation of the international community particularly on the part of the developed countries  bythe adoption of appropriate measures conducive toachieving fair and equitable development  especially inthe developing countries.With respect to other sensitive issues for theinternational community  the Government of ElSalvador views with concern the continuation orworsening of certain problems that  if not resolved will be a threat to international peace and security.These include the ongoing conflict in the Middle East which is a source of great concern  especially because6during the past year we have seen unremitting violence leading to the irreparable loss of human life andmaterial and economic damage in the region  and to aconstant increase in the suffering of the Israeli andPalestinian peoples.In that context  the Government of El Salvadorreiterates its support for all efforts and measures aimedat achieving a negotiated political solution that takesinto account the interests of the parties directlyinvolved  in order to achieve a firm and lasting peace.The State of Israel’s right to exist and to live withinsecure borders  as well as the inalienable right of thePalestinian people to self-determination and toestablish its own State  are basic preconditions forachieving peace  which will enable the leaders of theregion to devote themselves to promoting the progressand well-being of their peoples.The extraordinary situation of the Republic ofChina in Taiwan is a case that the internationalcommunity should examine  particularly in the light ofthe most recent changes in the international system.Regarding the strengthening of the worldOrganization  it is important that this opportunity notbe lost to address an item of priority interest for allMember States: Security Council reform. In thisregard  we must emphasize the commitments containedin the Millennium Declaration so that this reform canbe carried out. In that regard  we urge the Open-endedWorking Group established for this purpose to redoubleits efforts so that those commitments will be fulfilledand so that we can achieve  on the basis of flexiblepositions  a general agreement on the issue.Finally  given the complex and uncertaininternational situation  we urge all Governments groups and sectors of civil society to reflect on theimperative importance of working together in a spiritof human solidarity that will enable us to overcome alldifferences that separate us in order to achieve greatglobal objectives that could not be achieved on anindividual basis  with a view to attaining the spiritualand physical peace to which all nations aspire."
"154",6337,"SMR",56,2001,"﻿On behalf of theGovernment of the Republic of San Marino  I wish tocongratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixthsession and to thank his predecessor for his valuablecontribution.I would also like to congratulate the Secretary-General  who was recently re-elected for a secondterm. Over the past five years  my country has greatlyappreciated his efficiency  charisma and excellentdiplomatic ability.14In expressing its most sincere satisfaction  theRepublic of San Marino congratulates the UnitedNations and its Secretary-General on having beenawarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of thisOrganization’s ongoing commitment to peace andirreplaceable role and of its leader’s outstandingdiplomatic skills and dedication  which have alwayscharacterized his fruitful activity.Quite understandably  these days the GeneralAssembly is debating and wondering how and why theworld could change in just a few hours and how theprocess of civilization of the international communitycould be so ferociously attacked. We have gathered inthe most important international forum to define therole to be played by each country  individually ormultilaterally  and to determine how this daunting andinsidious challenge can be faced by each and everyoneof us. Our discussions should also focus on how toadjust our national legal systems to better support aresolute fight against any form of internationalterrorism  strengthen our defence systems and promotea common culture of solidarity and firm condemnationof any violation of and attack on human rights and civilco-existence  the respect and safeguard of which arecrucial.However  at a time of enormous difficulties  whenthe wave of hatred and violence seems to beinexorable  the international community is sending astrong signal of hope by showing its determination notto bend to people who  acting underground  try tospread terror and turmoil by any possible means. Largeand small countries alike have joined forces to combatterrorism and have expressed their full solidarity withthe United States’ outstanding example of democracyand liberty. To the United States and the families of thevictims  I wish to express my deepest sympathies andcondolences.Almost all countries have seen the attack on theUnited States as an attack on each of them. Thatexplains why  in the face of such tragedies  many smallnations  too  such as the Republic I represent today cannot remain neutral by simply offering solidarity ormaking statements of principles. Each and every one ofus is called upon to offer a determined and timelycontribution  however small  to the fight againstterrorism  which my country has always condemned inall international forums as the main threat to peace.In this spirit  San Marino immediately expressedits willingness to collaborate with the United States ofAmerica and to fully comply with Security Councilresolutions  in particular resolutions 1333 (2000) of 19December 2000 and 1373 (2001) of 28 September2001. This decision was motivated not only by the factthat our Republic has been a Member of thisOrganization for almost a decade  but above all by itsinherent vocation to promote peace and respect forhuman rights  prompted by the conviction  maturedover 1 700 years of peace and liberty  that any effort inthis direction helps to create and maintain internationalco-existence and mutual respect.The Republic of San Marino will spare no effortin the global fight against terrorism  as it has alreadydone to prevent and combat money-laundering. To thatend  it has adopted the necessary legislativeinstruments and effective domestic measures and hasactively participated in the action carried out in thisfield by major international organizations  such as theInternational Monetary Fund  the Council of Europeand the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope.My country has successfully integrated manyinternational provisions aimed at countering terrorismand intends to proceed to the ratification  as soon aspossible  of those instruments that are not yet part of itslegal system. Indeed  San Marino is well aware of theimportance and effectiveness of international law which has been expressly designed to promotecooperation in this field. In this context  the proposalsubmitted by India on a comprehensive anti-terrorismconvention should be taken into consideration as  todaymore than ever  this is a very topical issue that deservesour greatest attention.At the beginning of this new century  mankindcannot and must not move backwards. That would beextremely dangerous  as it would challenge the state ofcivilization that mankind has worked so strenuously toachieve. All free spirits must do their utmost to avertthis potential defeat and embark on the path ofsolidarity  cooperation and mutual understanding.I would also like to convey the hope expressed bythe Government of San Marino and major institutionalbodies for intensified activity by the United Nations  inthe conviction that a more active role of theOrganization is needed to face the numerousinternational challenges that  aside from today’s15exceptional circumstances  are still at the top of theworld political agenda.On this occasion  I feel duty-bound tocongratulate the Secretary-General and the President ofthe General Assembly for having implemented  withgreat determination and courage  a major programmeof reforms aimed at strengthening the United Nations well aware of the fact that only a continuousmodernization process will enable the Organization towork effectively and to keep abreast of futuredevelopments.In this regard  San Marino has repeatedly stressedthe need for a reformed Security Council that  in betterreflecting the new world order  would guarantee ahigher degree of representativeness  democracy andtransparency. We believe that such prerogatives can beensured by simply increasing the number of non-permanent members. Moreover  San Marino hopes thatthe right of veto may be gradually restricted with aview to its eventual elimination. Indeed  my country isconvinced that the exercise of that right  or the merethreat of its exercise  still represents a major obstacleto the proper functioning of the Organization.Equally important is the ongoing revitalizationprocess of the General Assembly. The progress that hasbeen achieved in terms of greater efficiency makes usbelieve that the General Assembly will regain its statusas the major decision-making and representative bodyof the United Nations. My country hopes that the AdHoc Working Group  open to all Member States  willcarry on this revitalization process.In consideration of the pivotal role of the UnitedNations in fostering international peace and security the Republic of San Marino is of the opinion that thisOrganization is the most appropriate negotiating forumat the disposal of the community of nations. Besidescarefully following the Security Council’s efforts toaddress the latest events  my country has paid greatattention to the Council’s ongoing commitment tosettling the conflicts afflicting Africa. Today more thanever  we believe that the immediate implementation ofthat body’s decisions is crucial to restoring peace in ageographical area already stricken by poverty epidemics and underdevelopment.San Marino is also seriously concerned about theescalation of violence and the increased hostilities inthe Middle East and hopes that  in that tormented andcontested land  dialogue and negotiations can beresumed as the sine qua non of a longed-for worldreconciliation.Against today’s international backdrop  thephenomenon of globalization also deserves carefulconsideration. I am not referring exclusively to itseconomic and commercial implications  though theseare its most tangible components.Market expansion and the progressive abolitionof customs barriers have unquestionably contributed toexporting job opportunities and  eventually  toeconomic well-being. On the other hand  however  thegap between the living conditions and standards of theNorth and the South  of the industrialized countries vis-à-vis the developing and least developed ones  whichare also burdened by huge foreign debt  has wideneddramatically. That gap must be immediately bridged inorder to guarantee the globalization of opportunitiesalong with the globalization of markets.We have all witnessed the anti-globalizationdemonstrations in Seattle  Prague and  more recently Genoa. Paradoxically  both the participants in thesummits and the demonstrators were striving for thesame objectives: poverty eradication  foreign debtrelief for developing countries and greaterenvironmental protection. I believe that the existenceof common objectives is a first step in the direction ofan open and constructive exchange of views.The Republic of San Marino also maintains thatpoverty alleviation is one of the major challengesfacing the international community for the immediatefuture. Future projects should address not only the lackof access to consumer goods  but also the lack ofeducation  liberty and participation in decision-making.In this broader context  poverty is an insurmountableobstacle to the full enjoyment of human rights andfundamental freedoms.Recently published data dramatically show thatmore than 1.5 billion people live on less than $2 perday  and at least two thirds are illiterate; 830 millionpeople suffer from severe malnutrition  and 750 millionare homeless  without access to health care. Moreover how can we ignore the fact that hundreds of millions ofchildren are suffering from malnutrition  that 30 000children under five years of age are dying every dayand that more than 500 million of them live on lessthan $1 per day?16Well aware of the dramatic situation of manydeveloping countries  the Republic of San Marino hasfully supported the initiatives sponsored by creditorcountries and international financial institutions toreduce or cancel foreign debts of highly indebtednations. Though not sufficient to mitigate the problemof poverty or to stop the vicious cycle of misery  theseinitiatives reflect the will of both creditor and debtorcountries to find jointly a solution for the scourge ofpoverty and to share responsibilities.It is not utopian to think that  by addressing andsolving the problems of hunger  poverty and thedisproportionate social  economic and cultural gapsbetween a minority living in the North and anoverwhelming  poor and despairing majority living inthe South  terrorism will also be wiped out in the nearfuture. Indeed  poverty and ideological extremismserve as fertile soil for terrorism  with its destructivepotential and toll in human lives.Once again  the Holy Father has rightly called onall States and peoples to struggle for justice  since thisis the only way to affirm the pre-eminence of law forthe international community. Throughout its long andglorious history of freedom  San Marino has alwaysfully shared this ideal.Prompted by these sentiments and determined tofurther support progressive international détente  forthe benefit of both nations and individuals  I reiteratethe hope of the Republic of San Marino that theinternational community  through the recognizedability of the United Nations system  will be able togive new impetus to the principles of dialogue andcooperation upon which it is based."
"155",6375,"SOM",56,2001,"﻿I seize this opportunity toextend  on behalf of my Government  my warmcongratulations to Mr. Han Seung-soo on his electionas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixthsession. I am confident that  with his experience andprofound dedication  he will successfully guide theproceedings of this session. I also avail myself of thisopportunity to thank his predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Harri Holkeri  for his excellent stewardship of thefifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. May I alsoextend our warmest congratulations to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  on hiselection to a second term and on the award of theNobel Peace Prize to him and to the United Nations.Last year  at the Millennium Summit held here inNew York  the President of Somalia  His ExcellencyMr. Abdikassim Salad Hassan  stood before theAssembly after Somalia’s absence from theinternational arena for about a decade. That was amoment of historic significance for my country  whichcontinues to strive to emerge from the abyss of conflictand to reassert its position as an active Member of theUnited Nations. I reiterate our deep gratitude to theinternational community for welcoming us back intothe fold.In the last century  humanity witnessed great andlaudable achievements in the political  scientific technological and economic fields. Yet  despite thoseaccomplishments  we continue to face challenges thatneed to be fully addressed. Conflicts are abundant;poverty is rampant; the economic divide between Northand South continues to widen; and the scourge ofHIV/AIDS remains unabated in the world. Nationsaround the globe are reeling from the attendantconsequences and call for urgent and immediate action.The events of 11 September shocked theconscience of all decent human beings. We in Somaliarelate to the pain and suffering of the people of theUnited States in a very profound and special way. TheSomali people have been subjected to a reign of terrorperpetrated by the warlords. We in Somalia  therefore know very well what it means to lose loved ones. Letme say that those who committed the heinous and36atrocious crimes of 11 September have nothing incommon with Islam or with the Islamic faith. Islampreaches peace within one’s spiritual self and withone’s neighbours; it preaches tolerance andcompassion.Allow me to reiterate our heartfelt and sincerecondolences to the families of the victims and to thepeople and the Government of the United States ofAmerica on their tragic loss. We continue to share theirgrief and pain.The inhuman terrorist attacks of 11 Septemberbrought to the forefront new challenges to internationalpeace and security. Our fight against terrorism must bebased on collective action by the internationalcommunity and on the principles enshrined in theCharter of the United Nations. The immediate andstrong response by the Security Council and theGeneral Assembly  including the adoption of SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001)  reflects our collectiveapproach in the fight against terrorism. TheGovernment of Somalia fully supports SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) and is firmlycommitted to translate its provisions into action.Having said that  I must observe that terroristswill exploit situations of injustice and imbalance aswell as conflicts in fragile and unstable States. Theinternational community is under a moral obligation tocome to the aid of those States in the form of post-conflict peace-building and national reconstruction sothat they do not become vulnerable to the evil forces ofterrorism. In that context  we welcome the statementmade before the Assembly by His Excellency PresidentGeorge W. Bush  in which he expressed the readinessof the United States Government to extend assistanceto those countries that lack adequate resources tocombat terrorism. A case in point is the situation in mycountry  where there was a political vacuum and noGovernment for a decade.The present Somali Government has been inoffice for about a year and a few months. It is aGovernment that inherited destroyed institutions anddevastated infrastructure. There are two options beforethe international community in dealing with thesituation in Somalia: watch the country slide back intoanarchy and chaos or fully support the strugglingSomali State by providing the necessary resources toenable it to play a meaningful role in the fight againstterrorism. The Somali Government needs urgent andadequate assistance from the international communityto be able to comply with resolution 1373 (2001).Let me at this juncture address the persistentreports in the media and elsewhere alleging  amongother things  the existence of terrorist camps inSomalia. First  I should firmly state that the SomaliGovernment hosts no terrorists nor does it offer basesor training camps for them. My Government has notoffered and will not offer them any sanctuary. We willarrest and hand over immediately any known terroristwho comes to our shores. Secondly  we want tochallenge the veracity of these reports. It is alsoimportant to evaluate objectively the integrity of thesources of this kind of information.We are a transparent and open society and aremore than willing to cooperate fully with the UnitedNations and with States in this regard. The SomaliGovernment is ready to invite the media and otherinterested parties to visit our country to verify the factson the ground. First  we need to see the evidence andestablish the facts first. It is a fundamental principle oflaw and natural justice that every person is presumedinnocent until proven guilty. This principle  in ouropinion  is equally applicable to States.In view of my Government’s serious concernabout these accusations  we propose setting up aninternational committee of inquiry under the auspicesof the United Nations Security Council to investigatethese allegations. We also propose that the committeeidentify Somalia’s needs in regard to theimplementation of Security Council resolution 1373(2001). We are fully prepared to cooperate with theproposed committee  if established  in the fulfilment ofits mandate.As I mentioned earlier  the Somali Governmenthas been in office for approximately a year and threemonths. During this time  the Government has faceddaunting challenges  primarily in enhancing security inthe capital and others areas. We have succeeded indemobilizing 25 000 militia personnel. We haveestablished police stations and deployed 3 000 policeofficers in the capital. A judiciary system has been putin place  courts are functioning  and the Government iscollecting taxes for the first time in a decade.The Somali Government continues to search for alasting peace in Somalia through dialogue with those37outside the Arta process. This is in conformity with theTransitional National Charter and resolutions adoptedby regional  subregional and internationalorganizations  as well as the presidential statements ofthe Security Council on Somalia.In this regard  let me also refer to the numerousimportant initiatives that have been launched topromote national reconciliation and peace in Somalia.We extend our profound thanks and appreciation to allthose countries that have contributed to the search forpeace in Somalia.Let me  in this regard  pay special tribute toPresident of the Republic of Djibouti  Mr. Ismail OmarGuelleh  and Government of Djibouti for theirsignificant  continuous and positive contribution to thenational reconciliation process. I would also like tothank Mr. Omer Al-Bashir  President of the Sudan andthe current chairman of the IntergovernmentalAuthority on Development (IGAD)  for his consistentsupport for Somalia and the search for a lasting peacein my country. The United Nations  the Organization ofAfrican Unity  the League of Arab States and IGADcontinue to play a positive role in this regard  for whichwe thank them.Finally  I want to express  on behalf of myPresident  our thanks to President Daniel arap Moi forhis recent efforts in bringing peace to Somalia.President Moi’s latest initiative was the recent meetingheld in Nairobi last month. The meeting broughttogether the President of Somalia and some of theopposition groups. A joint communiqué was signed stipulating the principles upon which future talks couldbe based. We expect a broader-based meeting to beheld soon.In conclusion  let me once again emphasize thatSomalia is a struggling country working towardachieving peace. This country needs massive assistancefor the reconstruction and rehabilitation of itsinfrastructure and institutions. We urgently need theassistance and goodwill of the internationalcommunity. It is my sincere hope that the internationalcommunity will respond positively and in a timelymanner to our appeal for urgent and immediateassistance."
"156",6412,"STP",56,2001,"﻿Mr. President  allow me tocongratulate you on behalf of the State of Sao Tomeand myself on your election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session  whichtestifies to the international community’s esteem forand recognition of the Republic of Korea and youpersonally. Please accept our wishes for every successas you carry out your mandate. Let me also express ourthanks to your predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri  for theexemplary way he led the work of our last session.I should also like to pay tribute to His ExcellencyMr. Kofi Annan  our Secretary-General  both on hisresounding re-election and on the well-deserved andjust awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to him and the6United Nations  reflecting their major contributions tothe cause of peace and development.This session is being held at a particularlyimportant juncture in the history of internationalrelations  when the entire international community ismobilizing to confront the devastating phenomenon ofinternational terrorism  the scope and magnitude ofwhich were evident in the 11 September attacks onNew York and Washington  D.C.  and in Pennsylvania which took the lives of thousands of innocent people.At that time  Sao Tome and Principe expressed its totalindignation at the criminal and monstrous actscommitted against the American people  as well as itsfull solidarity with the American authorities and thefamilies of the victims. We share the opinion that thoseresponsible for these barbaric acts must beapprehended and punished  and that terroristorganizations supporting them must be dismantled byall necessary means.We reaffirm our full readiness to cooperateactively at both the regional and international levels inthe fight against terrorism  which is one of the majorevils threatening world peace and security today. Wehail all initiatives taken to contain the military action justly launched against those who sow terror as well asthose who shelter them in their territories  so as toavoid having innocent victims among the civilianpopulation. We welcome the efforts of the internationalcommunity to adopt a juridical instrument to make thefight against terrorism more effective in the context ofa global strategy.No one can doubt that this act of criminal unacceptable and unjustified aggression  condemnedthroughout the world  requires a new dynamic in thefight against it  particularly within the United Nations.We note with satisfaction that important measures havebeen taken in that regard  notably by the SecurityCouncil in resolution 1373 (2001)  of 28 September.Yet the manifestation of extreme violence in theserecent attacks alerts us to the need to understand in adifferent and comprehensive way the great problemsfaced by mankind throughout the world  without losingsight of the merciless fight that must be waged againstinternational terrorism in all its manifestations.Despite the considerable scientific andtechnological progress recorded throughout history which has permitted high levels of development striking imbalances persist in a number of areas withregard to social and economic development  bothwithin and among the countries  regions and subregionsof the world. Witness particularly the situationprevailing in sub-Saharan Africa. A look at thestatistics of economic and social conditions in thecountries of that region is enough to reveal the urgentneed to develop a front that  acting concertedly andcollectively  can fight to eradicate their absolutepoverty.Faced with this scenario — rich countries on theone hand and poor countries on the other — one mightwonder whether the political will exists to reverse thissituation  which is dominated by selfishness and theinterests of individuals  groups and States. Only thuscan one explain the lack of cooperation  indifferenceand  indeed  the lack of sensitivity shown by theindustries of developed countries in the face of realscourges that devastate thousands of people  makingthe countries of the South even more vulnerable. Forexample  I am thinking of the HIV/AIDS pandemic aswell as other epidemics  such as hepatitis B andmalaria.The efforts of international organizations —notably the United Nations and its system  as well ascertain non-governmental organizations — to helpmankind cope with this painful situation must bevisible.Moreover  beyond the economic data reflectingthe growth of poverty in Africa  the situation of ourcontinent is worsened by the persistence of armedconflicts  particularly the crises in the Great Lakesregion  the Horn of Africa and Angola  to cite only afew examples of the fratricidal war that afflicts us.As to the situation in Angola  we reaffirm oururgent desire to see an end to the war in that fraternalcountry. We condemn the terrorist acts that haveclaimed countless lives  particularly among the civilianpopulation  and we call for a renewed application ofthe terms of the Lusaka Protocol for conflict resolution.In the context of conflict resolution  we welcomethe efforts of the international community to find asolution to the East Timor question  as well as progressmade in the process of emancipation of the Mauberepeople under the aegis of the United Nations. It is ourgreat hope to see this brotherly people admitted to theUnited Nations as a full-fledged Member and to see astrengthened Community of Portuguese-SpeakingCountries.7We note with concern the escalation of violencein the Middle East. In our view  it is essential thatIsrael and the Palestinian Authority resume thenegotiations on the peace process  the only way to finda just and peaceful solution that takes into account boththe right of the Palestinian people to self-determinationand the guarantee of security for the State of Israel.Unfortunately  Sao Tome and Principe is still onthe list of poor  least advanced or underdevelopedcountries  despite the efforts of its people and thedetermination of its leaders to place it on the track ofdevelopment. Today  my country is unquestionably aplace of freedom and democracy where fundamentalindividual human rights are respected. The recentpresidential elections  held in July this year  whichbrought Mr. Fradique de Menezes to the highest officeof the State of Sao Tome  are irrefutable proof ofdemocratic stability in our country. Nevertheless  theconstraints arising from the inequalities that prevail inthe new international economic order keep us fromattaining a state of well-being and from creating moredignified living conditions for our people.During the Millennium Summit last year  theheads of State and Government adopted in this Hall avery important text called the United NationsMillennium Declaration. I take pleasure in citing aportion of it:(spoke in French)“we have a duty therefore to all the world’speople  especially the most vulnerable and  inparticular  the children of the world  to whom thefuture belongs”. (resolution 55/2  para. 2)(spoke in Portuguese; interpretation from French textprovided by the delegation)This Declaration takes on particular importancein the case of our country  where the future and well-being of children seem badly compromised  bearing inmind the atmosphere of terror  the horrors of war andthe abuses of exploitation  famine and poverty. Wemust act now to protect our children. We must fight byevery available means to ensure full respect for theirfundamental rights. This is why we welcome withmuch satisfaction the Second World Conferenceagainst Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children scheduled for next month  and the world summit on thefuture of children  to be held in May 2002.Sao Tome and Principe considers globalization tobe a phenomenon of interdependence  a uniqueopportunity to bring peoples together  not a politicalideal driven by the dominant economic Powers. Thuswe enthusiastically welcome the New Partnership forAfrica’s Development and share the certainty that thisplan — based on our needs and the aspirations of ourpeople for the future  and designed to find practicalsolutions to the economic and social problemsthroughout Africa — will be favourably received byour partners  notably those of the G-7/G-8  forimplementation.The environment is a fundamental issue for thesurvival of mankind  and it must continue to be thefocus of special attention by the United Nations. Wetherefore stress the importance of the outcome of therecent seventh Conference of the Parties to the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change held at Marrakesh. Every effort must be made to createand disseminate technology that can minimize theenvironmental impact of human activities and tomobilize the resources needed to implement thepolicies and strategies adopted in a range ofinternational forums.Today more than ever before  it is obvious thatwe need to change the working methods of the organsof the United Nations so that they can better respond tothe demands of the day. As a universal organization the United Nations must be open to all States. Here weare talking about international law  the sovereignconduct of relations with other States  and activeparticipation  in a spirit of solidarity  in developmentefforts through cooperation and international traderelationships. That certainly applies to the Republic ofChina on Taiwan. We believe in the right to disagree especially when disagreement is democraticallyexpressed by people. We also believe that dialogue isthe only way to ease tension wherever it is most acute.The United Nations  which has always aimed tosupport the development efforts of all countries especially the poorest  must play a key role in the questfor solutions to the major problems facing the world. Itmust do so through fostering determination andadopting appropriate measures to create a fairer  morehuman world: a better world."
"157",6453,"SUR",56,2001,"﻿My delegation cannotfind the words to convey its sadness about the planecrash that occurred in a residential area in New Yorkthis morning. At moments like these  silence speaks foritself. The Government and the people of Surinameoffer their heartfelt condolences to the families of allthe victims. We pray that our love and friendship maybring comfort and peace to all who have been affectedby this tragedy and by the horrific attacks on 11September.During the United Nations Year of Dialogueamong Civilizations  the need for dialogue is provingto be essential throughout world. In Suriname  we havealways tried to apply the concept of dialogue.Suriname is a small country with a multi-ethnicpopulation. Our ancestors came to Surinamegenerations ago from West Africa  China  India Indonesia  Europe and the Middle East. We have beenfortunate that  owing to mutual respect andunderstanding  in Suriname these groups have livedtogether and are living together peacefully. More thanever  we realize that this harmony should be treasuredand nurtured  since we can no longer take peace andharmony for granted.Our Government plays a very important role inthis peaceful coexistence  because we have stronglypromoted and actively worked for mutual respect andconsensus. We believe that for people to be activelyinvolved in the development of the country  they mustbe able to see themselves represented in national andlocal government. We strongly promote such consensusdemocracy in Suriname  for this power-sharingarrangement has stimulated all ethnic groups to betolerant and respectful of each other's politicalideologies  cultures and religions. Our Government andour people firmly uphold the principle of freedom ofreligion  as well as of tolerance and respect for eachother's forms of cultural expression.In the same vein  the indigenous people ofSuriname live in the interior with their own culturaland religious beliefs. The needs and rights ofindigenous people are dealt with at the highest level inour Government. Their views and concerns are sharedwith the central Government through continuousdialogue. My Government therefore looks forward tothe first conference of the Permanent Forum onIndigenous Issues  scheduled to take place in May2002.We know  and have experience of the fact  thatpeople's primordial attachments become stronger attimes of need and despair. The grief of families fromthe United States of America and other parts of theworld has been deeply felt  and all over the globe manyfamilies and groups have turned to each other forcomfort. Our hearts go out to all of the victims of the11 September attacks and their families.We cannot yet assess all the social and economiceffects of those attacks. However  we have already seenthe devastating effects on the Caribbean in terms ofloss of income in  for example  tourism and trade.Natural disasters have also affected our area  and mydelegation sympathizes with the people of theCaribbean  especially those of Belize and Cuba  whosecountries were recently struck by hurricanes Iris andMichelle.As a member of the Caribbean Community  weknow that we have grave problems in the region.Limited access to global markets because of stringenttrade rules and World Trade Organization (WTO)regulations have resulted in increased poverty in ourregion. Suriname pleads for an institutionalarrangement between the United Nations and the WTOso as to allow developing countries easier access to thatbody.We have further expanded and deepened ourregional ties. In this respect  we would like to expressour gratitude to the countries of the westernhemisphere which have offered us assistance andshown their support for including us in the variousintegration movements.We in the Caribbean enjoy a high level ofdemocracy and are guided by the rule of law. OurGovernments have been actively involved in creating5an environment to attract foreign investors and toincrease the production of goods and services. We stillneed assistance. The promises made by the developedcountries in the Millennium Declaration of 2000 havenot yielded an increase in official developmentassistance. We  the countries in development  needequal opportunities.If we  as the international community  agree thathuman-centred development is at the top of our agenda we need to understand that we have to achieve ittogether. If our goal is to eradicate abject poverty  wemust make an effort to achieve that goal. Cutting inhalf by 2015 the number of people living on less than$l a day is one of the main goals we want to achievefor the benefit of the truly disadvantaged.The International Conference on Financing forDevelopment  to be held in March 2002 in Mexico will give both developed and developing countries anopportunity to reach concrete agreements and makearrangements for resources for development. If we donot take the opportunity offered by that Conference towork towards sustainable development for all people inthe world  we will miss a great chance to achieve amore equitable distribution of global wealth.If we do not take that opportunity  we will alsomiss the chance to intensify our struggle to combatdeadly diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria  whichaffect millions in the world. We in the Caribbean havecommitted ourselves to continue the struggle againstHIV/AIDS in our region. We must not lose sight of thefact that people are still dying every day of thisdisease. It is up to us  the international community  tofind solutions and improve the lives of those billions ofpeople who are faced with global problems such asextreme poverty  HIV/AIDS  malaria  tuberculosis andilliteracy  as well as problems resulting from the debtburden  the refugee issue  environmental degradationand the widening gap between rich and poor.Suriname has made great efforts in genderequality  and  with the assistance of the United NationsDevelopment Programme  we have begun trainingprogrammes in gender sensitivity. We have women inhigh-level positions  and it gives me great pleasure totell the Assembly that our current delegation consistsmainly of women. We are pleased with thisdevelopment in my country  but we still have a longway to go.Our commitment to the role of women hasprompted my country to work on a draft resolution inthe Third Committee of the General Assembly onmainstreaming the situation of older women intosociety  to ensure that that part of the population willnot be marginalized further in our societies.Ageing has become a subject of increasingconcern to the international community  for it raisessignificant social and cultural questions  as well asquestions of economic stability. My Government willjoin the international community and the UnitedNations to address and support the United Nationsinitiative to achieve a society for all ages. We shouldcome up with appropriate strategies to collectively dealwith these issues during the Second World Assemblyon Ageing.Human development constitutes one of the keypillars of the development policy of my Government.People  especially our children  are our country'sgreatest treasure. This is why looking after their well-being is placed high on our national agenda. Surinameis looking forward to the Special Session on Childrenthat has been postponed to 2002.Suriname hopes that the World Summit onSustainable Development of 2002  in Johannesburg and the assessment of the Earth Summit of June 1992 will lead to recommendations and commitments for theimplementation of real sustainable human developmentin a globally sustainable environment. Protecting theenvironment is the responsibility of all countries.Suriname took a first step in conserving biodiversityfor contemporary and future generations byestablishing the largest protected nature reserve inSouth America three years ago. With this first step  wehope to encourage other countries in the world toprotect the environment  and to work together on themany emerging global environmental threats.Suriname is extremely concerned about the trans-shipment of nuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea but we are pleased to see that so many countries haveratified the Kyoto Protocol.The ever-widening global digital divide thatprevents developing countries from benefiting fullyfrom the advancements in information technology is aconcern that we have discussed in various internationalforums  but it still needs much more of our attention.6The effects of globalization have not beenfavourable to most developing countries. However  wehave come to understand and experience that our worldis an interdependent one  and we cannot turn back thisclock. The attacks of the 11 September have shown ushow interdependent we are. The loss of lives wasdirectly felt in the United States and in more than 80countries in the rest of the world. The economic effectsare also being felt in all parts of the world.In conclusion  the Secretary-General and theUnited Nations received the Nobel Peace Prize thisyear at a time when the world was still trying tocomprehend the horrific attacks of 11 September on theUnited States. Suriname hopes that this distinguishedaward will encourage the United Nations to continueits important work for human rights  peace  socialjustice  human development  human-rights educationand economic prosperity for all the peoples of theworld. We congratulate the Secretary-General on thisprestigious award and his re-election. And wecongratulate Mr. Han on his election as President andlook forward to his guidance and leadership during thefifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.As members of the United Nations family  we arecalled upon to practice tolerance and to live together inpeace with one another as good neighbours. Because ofthe devastating consequences of 11 September  wehave the obligation to look closely at the root causes ofterrorism. The causes of terrorism have to be discussedand dealt with to protect all our peoples and interests.For the world is our home  and we are the people wholive in it. "
"158",6477,"SVK",56,2001,"﻿At the outset  I wish tojoin other speakers in warmly congratulating you  Sir on your election as President of the fifty-sixth sessionof the General Assembly. It is my deep conviction thatin this difficult situation we will  under yourexperienced leadership  materialize the expectations ofthe international community  which has always desiredto view the United Nations as a reliable guarantor ofworld peace. I recall our recent meeting in Seoul  and itis a pleasure for me to see you  Sir  presiding over theGeneral Assembly this year. I also wish to thank yourpredecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri  for his hard work dedication and leadership in presiding over the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly.7The recent brutal terrorist attack against our hostcountry  which has left all of us in deep shock  wasundoubtedly also directed against the United Nationsand its principles and values  which we as MemberStates share. This inhuman act was an attack on all ofus. However  it has united the international community which realized the potential danger and threat ofterrorism to the existence of human civilization. Theinternational community has responded in the only wayappropriate: international terrorism cannot be tolerated;all the nations of the world must stand united in thebattle against this evil; and they have to searchvigorously for ways to effectively respond to it.We were relieved to see the United Nations actingpromptly and in a very determined way  adopting thevery next day General Assembly and Security Councilresolutions urging the international community toredouble its efforts to prevent and suppress terroristacts by increased cooperation and full implementationof the relevant international anti-terrorist conventionsand Security Council resolutions. In particular Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) is of a greatimportance and must be fully implemented.We appreciate that after the terrorist attacks countries and international organizations havemanifested moral maturity and their capacity to closelycooperate and coordinate their actions in the fightagainst world terrorism. We welcome the active andirreplaceable role the United Nations plays in this fight.As United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annanexplicitly stated in his response to the arrogant anddisdainful words of bin Laden addressed to the UnitedNations  people will understand that the position of theUnited Nations is the expression of the will of all itsMembers.A year ago  many of my colleagues and Ielaborated on the role of the United Nations incombating international terrorism. The SlovakRepublic joined the anti-terrorist coalition swiftly effectively and without any hesitation. It will remain afirm part of the coalition of nations and peopleresolved to fight terrorism and determined to face thisthreat to peace and security on our planet. The SlovakRepublic is a party to 11 of the 12 universal anti-terrorist conventions. Shortly  we hope to ratify theInternational Convention for the Suppression of theFinancing of Terrorism  which we signed last January.We call on all other countries to redouble their effortsin order to achieve a speedy conclusion of acomprehensive convention against terrorism.The terrorist attack has certainly changed ourperception of the world. A re-assessment ofinternational arrangements is a necessity in thiscontext. After a period of mostly emotional reactions we now need more qualified answers  supported byresolve and responsibility. I am convinced that theresolve and responsibility will be translated intoexecutive actions and systemic steps by the UnitedNations.The legal instruments devised here at the UnitedNations constitute an especially good basis fordeepening the effectiveness of the fight againstterrorism. Using the words of the aphorist BlaisePascal  I want to emphasize that the only thing thatremains to be done is to implement all the goodprinciples that have already been laid down. It isencouraging that the words of comfort and the ideasand commitments uttered by high representatives of theMember States of this  the most universal internationalcommunity  overwhelmingly share that spirit. Slovakiafully associates itself with those views. In that context we wish to express our hope that the Rome Statute ofthe International Criminal Court will enter into forcesometime next year. With that the internationalcommunity will be establishing a body that will endimpunity for crimes of the greatest seriousness including crimes against humanity.The world has a unique opportunity to achieveprogress in tackling long-lasting conflicts through jointefforts. Slovakia considers United Nationspeacekeeping operations to be one of the key and mostvisible aspects of the Organization’s activities. Weview all United Nations activities in conflictprevention  peacekeeping  peace support and peace-building as particularly important. It is the people inthe regions suffering from conflict who look to ourOrganization with hope  and we must not let themdown.As a country that is materially and personallyinvolved  we welcome with great attention anddevotion and participate actively in the discussionsaimed at reforming and improving the efficiency ofUnited Nations peacekeeping. We are ready to continuecontributing our share in every possible way to thisnoble endeavour. The participation of the SlovakRepublic in United Nations peacekeeping operations8has grown almost six-fold since the beginning of theyear 2000. This year we took part in the United Nationsmission in East Timor  where we deployed a level IIhospital. In Cyprus the Slovak contingent has replacedAustria and has become the lead nation in Sector 4. Wehave sent our demining experts and other personnel tothe United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea.I would also like to add my personal note to thisdescription of my country’s engagement. For the pasttwo years  the Secretary-General has entrusted me withan exceptionally demanding and responsible task namely  to serve as his Special Envoy for the Balkansand to oversee the peaceful resolution of the still-smouldering conflict in Kosovo. I am aware of thecritical importance of the coming elections to be heldin Kosovo under the supervision of the United NationsInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Iam now therefore in a position to state a single criticalthesis: that area must stay multi-ethnic and theinternational community must continue to be consistentin its policies on the matter.As a country that is experiencing dynamicdevelopment and one that shares a great interest instable international development and the prosperity ofthe international community  Slovakia also has anambition to play a more visible role in the UnitedNations. Our Prime Minister  Mikuláš Dzurinda  alsoclearly expressed our position on many other topicsand challenges at last year’s Millennium Summit. Thespirit of the commendable initiatives adopted at theSummit will produce the best results only through theirunrestricted practical implementation  although newand unprecedented barriers have emerged on the way.Our position on the issue of Security Councilreform is linked to the importance of making theOrganization more effective. Let us be honest andadmit that we have not been fully successful inachieving this goal for years  and that we will nowhave to cope with new and unprecedented challenges.In my letter to the previous President of the GeneralAssembly I emphasized that  in addition to maintainingsufficient representativeness  the Security Councilshould also preserve sufficient operational flexibility.We also believe that the Security Council should baseits decision-making on majority voting  and that theright of veto should only be reserved for decisionstaken under Chapter VII of the Charter.Slovakia supports the enlargement of the SecurityCouncil in both the non-permanent and the permanentcategories of membership. However  the failure toachieve consensus on the enlargement of one categoryshould not result in blocking enlargement in anothercategory. I avail myself of this opportunity to confirmthat while increasing the number of Security Councilmembers in the category of elected non-permanentmembers  we consider it fully justified to allocate oneadditional seat to the Group of Eastern EuropeanStates. Its membership has doubled in the last decade.Exceptionally urgent current challenges have casta malicious shadow of destruction over this year’sagenda of the General Assembly  which I have notcommented on in detail. I would like  however  toassure the Assembly that Slovakia believes in the needfor a universal world organization — which the UnitedNations is — as a source of hope for a better and morejust world. We have no doubts about the irreplaceablerole of the United Nations in tackling global issues  beit the protection of human rights  the eradication offamine  poverty  diseases and illiteracy or theprevention of drug and arms proliferation orguaranteeing sustainable development. A life of dignityfor all of us is really unthinkable without the enduringinvolvement of the United Nations. However  itrequires universal respect of its paramount place ininternational life  and joint cooperation in intensifyingits activities.In conclusion  I would like to underline thefeeling of deep satisfaction of my country  and mepersonally  with the appointment of Mr. Kofi Annan toserve a second term as the United Nations Secretary-General. I also wish to voice our recognition of thehonour given to him personally and to our universalworld Organization through the prestigious and well-deserved award of the centenary Nobel Peace Prize and to congratulate him wholeheartedly on thisachievement"
"159",6502,"SVN",56,2001,"﻿All ouradmiration goes to the United States for makingpossible the normal work of the United Nations and thesessions of the General Assembly despite the recenttragic events and all their global consequences. Thetragic crime  which affected the whole world  hasbrutally confronted us with new  very serious and long-term issues. This year’s general debate is thus anopportunity and a new and great responsibility for usall — a responsibility that must be accepted. Words ofcondemnation and solidarity cannot be enough.As we sympathize profoundly with the Americanpeople  we must also tell the world in one voice that weshall be deliberately and effectively allied in the future too  and that we will cooperate in the fight againstterrorism and in the eradication of the roots of that evil.We will responsibly consider joint measures for aworld of more peace  greater freedom  solidarity andsecurity and more social justice for every person andevery nation  as well as ever less room for violence.The idea of such a world requires us to avoid thevortex of evil by undertaking a considered and resoluteresponse to the terrorist crime that was committed. Theimmediate decisive military reaction of the UnitedStates of America and other countries of the anti-terrorist alliance was imperative.We cannot simply rest at that  however. Thevortex of violence could threaten the democratic valuesthat humanity has set over its long development as themeasure of life in human society. That is why we areultimately obliged to avoid dividing cultures along theprinciple of “us versus them”  dividing races  religionsand nations into the categories of civilized andbarbaric  and ascribing a priori fundamentalism to anyreligion or civilization. The United Nations hasproclaimed this year the Year of Dialogue AmongCivilizations. We should seize this opportunity.The contemporary world is diverse  but allmodern civilizations  cultures and major religionsrespect human dignity and human life. Killing is anaberration anywhere in the world. Sadly  human andsocial pathology have made killing a lucrative businessand given international terrorism its own internaldynamic. The instigators and perpetrators of thesedespicable acts must be brought to justice  while it isthe responsibility of politics to remove the social andpolitical roots of this evil. It is the universal values ofall contemporary civilizations  such as the sanctity oflife and respect for human dignity  that enable thecreation of a global democracy based on a global ethos.Resolute action and attention must focus on thosegroups and individuals throughout the world whobrutally violate these principles and bring chaos murder and madness into our human world. Sadly there are enough such people in all cultures andcivilizations in all parts of the human world  includingthe Christian world. They warn us that the global worldrequires a different perception of the world and itsdilemmas  especially of the unequal distribution ofpoverty and wealth  and that it raises questions towhich there are as yet no answers.At the Millennium Summit last year  we camevery close to a realistic analysis of some of the majoreconomic  financial  social  cultural  political andecological effects of the global economy. We havecome closer to the important understanding that aglobal world also requires global responsibility  andthat starts with the responsibility of each State.States cannot arbitrarily do things that are incomplete conflict with the values of the democraticworld. In particular  cannot systematically violate basichuman rights and freedoms through State violence  norcan they allow and encourage activities that threatenthe security of other countries and of the internationalcommunity  all in the name of their own sovereignty even within their own boundaries. Neither can theyignore such activity by others and shut themselvesbehind their own borders.Last year’s position on humanitarian interventionwas the first step in this direction  yet  unfortunately not a sufficient one. The escalation of internationallysyndicated and organized terrorism demands thatfurther steps be taken. We cannot allow terrorism andcrime to abuse the opportunities offered by ourglobalized world before the democratic world itself iseven in a position to put these opportunities to gooduse in finding answers to completely new challenges.I see these challenges in pronounced divisionswith global implications — divisions into owners ofcapital  knowledge  ideas and informationtechnologies  on the one hand  and the billionscondemned to ignorance  a life of poverty andvegetating without prospects at the margins of society 11on the other hand  in the ever greater financialweakness of many nation-States and whole continentsthat are left without development potentials orprospects. In its relentless growth in power andauthority  global capital has long since gone beyondState borders. However  it assumes no responsibilityfor people’s social position and prospects for freedomand democracy  for development and the future  forpeople’s security. This responsibility is left to Stateadministrations.I also see challenges in all kinds offundamentalism  even in the perverted understandingof competitiveness which leads to production andservices with an ever-shrinking labour force  withoutcaring about people and nature  about life on the planetand its future in an economy whose only motive andaim is profit.I see them also in the very pragmatically orientednational and international politics operating in aframework of dramatic simplicity and simplification and so their euphoric haste does not match their effect.These are politics that ignore the dimension of timeand the duration of phenomena  such as the ecologicaleffects of genetic or biomedical interventions that arenot apparent immediately  but perhaps only in decades only with the coming generations.I see challenges in the neglect of a comprehensiveand interconnected perspective on phenomena andprocesses and in the disregard for the way in whichthey are interconnected. All modern political  socialand ecological dramas and conflicts  as well as theglobal socio-pathological cancers  are a result ofthe interaction of a range of social forces andelements. These phenomena — including internationalterrorism — which are like epidemics  cannot beconfined within the borders of one or more States. Thisapplies to a host of phenomena  not just terrorism  butalso ecology  food  genetics  finance  the informationsociety and violence.I also see challenges in the lack ofcommunication between the authorities andincreasingly global civil movements. Protests fromSeattle to Genoa are a powerful warning of the dangerof a division into two worlds that are beginning tocommunicate solely through protests and violence.The world today is clearly different from what itwas before. It could be better  but only with anawareness of and mechanisms for assuming globalresponsibility. This will enable the search for adynamic balance leaving no room for the chaos thatuncontrolled developments and acts of terror lead to. Inorder to achieve this  we will have to change manythings.Therefore  adapting the United Nations to thesenew circumstances is  in a way  a call of distress. It willnot be a simple task. All 189 Members and theirrepresentatives are bound primarily to the sovereigntyof their own States. However  the world clearly alsoneeds global governance. More than ever  we need theUnited Nations as a global entity common to all States an entity that will be able  with the full authority thatrests on the global responsibility of States  to takemeasures to the benefit of dynamic development  adevelopment of balanced forces and effects of theglobal economy and globalization in general.Otherwise  we will have to state the alternative.We must accept the recognition that every society including the global one  must subordinate itself tospecific rules  or else it will be subjected to the rule ofcrude force. Our difficulty is that we have overlookedthat the world has become a single society full ofinternal contrasts  which in real life  especially ininternational relations  recognizes and respects fewrules. What we urgently need is the common politicalwill to provide legitimacy to a universal system ofinstitutions and bodies  to which together we haveentrusted the power to prescribe common rules.We need common political will to subjectourselves to these rules and to respect them. The actualpower to prescribe rules would not be only in the handsof States. Could this also be the United Nations? Whatreforms are needed to achieve this  in order for theUnited Nations to become this? We cannot wait withthe answers.I am also speaking from the experience ofSlovenia  which I represent. In gaining independence10 years ago  we experienced brief but serious violenceon our own territory. In our immediate vicinity  South-Eastern Europe  we were faced with one of the mostbarbaric policies since the Second World War  a policyresponsible for genocide and other forms of widespreadviolence. With independence  Slovenia stepped into aworld that is prepared to behave better than the self-enclosed world that the former Yugoslavia had becomein the final years of its life  when the equality of rightsof people and nations was violated and when hope for a12different future was denied. We have stepped onto thepath of freedom  and Slovenia has accepted its ownshare of the responsibility for our global world.I believe that this global world will tend toward adynamic balance  provided that States — large andsmall  rich and poor  technologically developed andmarginalized — will together seek new solutions. Thevenue can only be a fundamentally reformed UnitedNations. It is within such a United Nations that both adurable coalition against terrorism and a durablecoalition of common responsibility of all countries fora world with more solidarity and social justice for allhumanity and all its parts can be achieved."
"160",6547,"SWE",56,2001,"﻿Let me start bycongratulating the United Nations and its Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  on being awarded the NobelPeace Prize. This is an extremely well-deserved awardto a unique Organization and a unique Secretary-General.Let me also take this opportunity to express mysincere condolences to the families of the victims ofyesterday’s tragedy near John F. Kennedy Airport.We are all going through days of sorrow andanger: sorrow for human suffering  for the loss ofhuman lives and for loss of security; anger  becauseterrorists hit innocent people and because terror istargeted at openness and democracy and threatens ourcommon security and welfare.Seldom has the international community beenchallenged as it was through the terrorist acts of 11September. The United Nations rose to the challengeand took the lead in the struggle against internationalterrorism. Seldom have we — the peoples of the UnitedNations — shown such a strong common reaction andunity. Sweden stands wholeheartedly by the UnitedNations in its call to fight terrorism  and we expressour solidarity with the American people andGovernment at this difficult time.We have now three immediate tasks. First  allnations have to take action against terrorism  as statedin Security Council resolution 1373 (2001): actionagainst the financing  planning and execution ofterrorist acts; and action that makes it clear to thoseresponsible for terror that they will be punished fortheir acts.We support the right of the United StatesGovernment to self-defence  in accordance withinternational law. We emphasize the central role of theSecurity Council.Secondly  we must assist the people ofAfghanistan in their immediate needs. The Afghanpeople have suffered war  natural disasters andoppression for decades. They are held hostage by anillegitimate regime. Women and children aresystematically abused. Women are denied health careand work; girls are practically denied education; andtheir freedom is heavily restricted. Human rights do notexist under Taliban rule. It is crucial that in all citiesnow liberated from the Taliban human rights and lawand order be guaranteed.The humanitarian situation facing the people ofAfghanistan is acute. The United Nations and all itsMember States must increase their efforts to meet theneeds of the Afghan population. Closed borders mustbe opened immediately  both for refugees who seekasylum and for the secure transport of emergencysupplies.Thirdly  we must assist the people of Afghanistanin the reconstruction of their country. The restorationof this ravaged nation to a state of peaceful coexistencemust involve a political process leading to arepresentative government that respects human rightsand fosters democratic development. The role protection and participation of women must be high onevery policy agenda.While addressing these immediate tasks  we mustnot lose sight of our long-term agenda.A year ago  here in New York  heads of State andGovernment from 147 countries adopted theMillennium Declaration. Their message was clear: onlyby working together can we meet the challenges ofglobalization.33Today we need to build coalitions and to joinforces  not only against international terrorism  but alsoto fight other global problems. We need to join forcesin the fight for global justice. Globalization andopenness make people aware of what they have  and ofwhat they lack. People wish to participate. People wishto share the benefits of development. This is positiveand represents a challenge to the internationalcommunity’s ability to narrow the gap between richand poor.Globalization creates wealth  but that wealth mustbe more equally distributed. Today  more than onebillion people live in absolute poverty. The MillenniumSummit pledged to halve poverty by the year 2015.This is a welcome commitment  but it is still notenough. Political efforts should be combined witheconomic  technical and scientific progress.Development cooperation  trade and agriculturalpolicies must aim at poverty eradication. Theinstruments are there  and the possibilities today arebetter than ever before  but we  the Governments  needto show courage and political will. We must providehope of freedom for the oppressed  education for theilliterate  food for the hungry  health care for the sickand equality for women.Increased official development assistance istherefore crucial. Sweden is one of the few countriesmeeting the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent ofgross national income in development aid. I urge alldeveloped countries  in particular the big economicPowers  to make real progress towards achieving thisgoal.The poorer countries must be integrated into theworld economy  and the new United Nations road mapis a concrete and welcome step in this direction. TheInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment  to be held in Mexico  and the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development  to be held inJohannesburg — in which the Swedish Prime Minister Mr. Göran Persson  will participate — could be thestarting points for new partnership arrangementsbetween Government institutions  civil society and theprivate sector — a partnership for global justice.HIV/AIDS is one of the greatest threats tohumanity in our time. In some countries  large parts ofentire generations fall victim to the disease. Millions ofchildren are orphaned. Economic progress is hampered and development opportunities are lost. All MemberStates must show strong political and financialcommitment and solidarity. Sweden welcomes the newglobal fund to fight HIV/AIDS and will contribute $60million over the next three years to the fund.A new round of broad negotiations in the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) can make an importantcontribution to worldwide growth and development.But the interests and concerns of the developingcountries must be properly addressed. Every effortmust be made to liberalize trade. The example set bythe European Union — to open its market to“everything but arms” — should be followed by others.Developing countries should receive support inbuilding their capacity to fully integrate into the worldtrading system and the global economy.The global responsibility in terms of providingmore resources and greater market access todeveloping countries is clear. But the mainresponsibility for development rests with theGovernments and peoples in developing countries.Good governance and sound national policies areprerequisites for sustained development and povertyreduction.We need to join forces in the struggle for humanrights and democracy. When rights are respected  whenvoices are heard  when society is tolerant  society alsobecomes safer for all.Violations of human rights threaten the securityand well-being not only of the individual but also ofsociety  and they cause tensions and conflicts.Sustainable development and political stability can bebuilt only on respect for universal and indivisiblehuman rights and on democratic development.Discrimination in any form is unacceptable andincompatible with these fundamental principles. It isthe responsibility of every Government to safeguardequal rights and opportunities for men and women  aswell as the rights of the child.Those guilty of human rights violations andcrimes against humanity should never find refugebehind national borders. The transfer of Mr. Milosevicto the International Tribunal demonstrates the resolveof the international community to act against impunity.It carries great symbolic value and will contribute tothe process of reconciliation.The establishment of the International CriminalCourt will strengthen our ability to try suspected34violators of international and humanitarian law. It is amatter of the highest priority to have the Courtoperational promptly  and I urge those States whichhave not yet done so to ratify the Rome Statute.Sweden also welcomes the initiative by theSecretary-General to involve global business inpromoting human rights through the Global Compact.We need to join forces to prevent violentconflicts. We need to work against hatred and suspicionbetween peoples and to stimulate a dialogue betweenand within cultures. Preventing violent conflict is aprimary obligation of Member States under the UnitedNations Charter  but it took us half a century to startworking towards this goal systematically. We now havea better understanding of the complex root causes ofconflicts. The responsibility of preventing conflictultimately rests on every Government. Successful long-term prevention cannot be imposed from the outside but the local parties should be encouraged and assistedin containing an emerging conflict.The Secretary-General’s report on conflictprevention is a very valuable contribution to thedevelopment of a global strategy. I urge all MemberStates to take an active part in its follow-up.A core task of the United Nations is to effectivelymanage conflicts where prevention fails. It is theUnited Nations that provides the legal foundation forglobal action. Sweden therefore strongly supports theprocess that the Brahimi report has set in motion. Butwe  the Member States  have yet to provide the UnitedNations with the necessary resources to strengthen itscapacities in the area of peace operations.The Secretary-General’s efforts to strengthen theties between the United Nations and regionalorganizations in the areas of conflict prevention andpeace-building are most welcome.Cooperation with the United Nations is essentialin developing the European Union’s conflict-prevention and crisis-management capabilities. InGöteborg last June the Union adopted a framework forincreased interaction  so that European Unioncapacities can provide real added value for the UnitedNations.We need to join forces for peace in the MiddleEast. Our aim must be two States  Israel and Palestine with secure and recognized borders. The basis isinternational law and the Security Council resolutions.The situation has deteriorated in the past year  despitestrong efforts by the United Nations  the United States the European Union  Russia and others. A furtherescalation must be avoided. Israel must withdraw fromthe occupied territories  cease the settlements policyand put an end to the extrajudicial executions. ThePalestinians must do everything in their power to stopthe attacks against innocent civilians. Sweden stronglysupports the recommendations of the Mitchell report including a monitoring mechanism  for an end toviolence and a revival of the peace process.We must join forces for multilateral disarmament.A world free from weapons of mass destruction wouldbe a much safer world. Multilateral agreementscontribute to security for the individual. They haveproduced impressive results — chemical and biologicalweapons have been totally banned. Still  however many challenges remain.Three years ago  Sweden helped launch the NewAgenda Coalition — a group of States concerned withthe lack of progress in nuclear disarmament andsharing a vision of a nuclear-weapon-free world. In ourcase  the initiative was rooted in the firm belief thatboth global and national security depend onmultilateral frameworks and platforms.Last year  the 187 States parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) adopted by consensus aroad map towards nuclear disarmament. Based on theundertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to fullyeliminate their nuclear arsenals  a 12-step action planwas agreed on. This promising outcome was alsoconfirmed by the General Assembly. All States partieshave pledged to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free worldunder strict and effective international control. Istrongly urge the four States remaining outside theTreaty to sign and ratify it.We have a number of important instruments toprevent testing  to ban production of weapons materialand to improve verification. The ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  a fissile material cut-offtreaty and the Additional Protocol to the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency safeguards agreement pave theway for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.Now it is now time to concentrate on theirimplementation.The United States plans for a strategic missiledefence system risk having a negative impact ondisarmament  non-proliferation and the whole NPT35process. The ongoing consultations are welcome  butthe outcome is still uncertain. We strongly believe thatthe new threats of proliferation require a multilateralresponse built on the already existing safety net.Deep cuts in strategic and tactical nucleararsenals are long overdue and should be accompaniedby effective mechanisms of verification andirreversibility. Such treaty agreements can never bereplaced by unilateral declarations.Weapons of mass destruction remain a threat tomankind. Terrorists must not be given the opportunityto threaten us with these weapons. Now is the time toreinforce efforts to contain proliferation.The United Nations remains a unique globalforum. It is the one organization we can all equallycount on and turn to for security and development — asthe safeguard of our common future. The UnitedNations needs to be strengthened  and it needs reform.We need the United Nations  and the United Nationsneeds us."
"161",6585,"SWZ",56,2001,"﻿It is an honour andprivilege for me to deliver this statement on behalf ofHis Majesty King Mswati III. I wish to convey thegreetings and warm wishes of His Majesty  HerMajesty The Queen Mother  Ndlovukazi  theGovernment and the entire Swazi nation to all ourfriends and fellow Members of the United Nations.The Kingdom of Swaziland offers her warmestcongratulations to the President on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixthsession. We are confident that with his proven abilitiesand leadership  he will guide us to success in ourdeliberations at this time of crisis in global affairs.Allow me to express our appreciation to hispredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Harri Holkeri  ofFinland  who  by his astute and judicious leadership brought to a successful conclusion the work of thefifty-fifth session.The Kingdom of Swaziland would further like tocommend the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  forleading our Organization so effectively through histenure thus far. We will continue to depend on hishighly developed sense of diplomacy and hisundoubted commitment to achieve global peace stability and equitable development. The recent awardof the Nobel Peace Prize to both the Secretary-Generaland the United Nations attests to the aforementionedattributes.We are also grateful for the continuing dedicationand hard work of the staff of the United Nations  whoseefforts are needed all the more in these challengingtimes. In this regard  we call upon all our fellowMembers to demonstrate their support for theSecretary-General and his staff by honouring theirfinancial obligations  so that our Organization can havesufficient resources with which to meet the wideningscope of its activities.We are meeting one year after the historicgathering of world leaders  when the internationalcommunity sought to redefine and articulate a commonvision for the future of all its citizens. The goals to beachieved were clearly set out in the MillenniumDeclaration as an outcome of the Millennium Summit.Today we have the opportunity — indeed  theresponsibility — to evaluate just how far we have comein that mission which we set for ourselves through thisOrganization. We need to address honestly ourshortcomings in commitment and action and to furtherdevise practical and realistic strategies that will resultin measurable progress in areas identified for urgentaction.The Kingdom of Swaziland therefore believesthat the promotion of sustainable international peaceand security must be one of the main priorities of theUnited Nations  because it is clear that our collectiveaim of raising the living standard of our peoples is36possible only in conditions of global stability and withnations living harmoniously alongside one another.The Kingdom of Swaziland joined the rest of theworld in condemnation of the tragic terrorist attacks of11 September  to which the international communitymust respond because such acts are an assault onhuman decency and humanity. These acts cannot bejustified under any circumstances. The Kingdom ofSwaziland repudiates such acts and aligns itself with allpeace-loving people around the world not only incondemning such acts  but also in calling for theircomplete eradication. To that end  the Kingdom ofSwaziland will do all in its power to prevent acts ofterrorism and to ensure that the support and financingof terrorism cannot take root on Swazi soil. We oncemore offer our sympathy and prayers to the familiesand friends of those who lost their lives in the tragedy.Future global stability is threatened by the spreadof weapons of mass destruction  as well as theunabated proliferation of small arms and lightweapons. Vigorous and urgent efforts are needed toeliminate these weapons. In this regard  we welcomethe successful conclusion of the United NationsConference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  as well as ofthe United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade inSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Wedeem their outcomes timely and necessary.While much has been done through the process ofreform effected by the Secretary-General  it is alsorecognized that there has been very little progress madeso far by the Open-ended Working Group to addressthe most important aspect of the reform: therestructuring of the Security Council. More intensifiedefforts should be made to bring to a conclusion thedeliberations on this issue  and we look forward to theleadership of the President of the General Assembly inadvancing negotiations towards a lasting solution. TheKingdom of Swaziland is still committed to the processof the reform for the expansion of the Security Councilin both categories of its membership. In that regard  wecontinue to support the African position in favour oftwo permanent seats and three non-permanent seatsbeing allocated to the African continent.The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that theUnited Nations  in conjunction with regionalorganizations  must take on a more proactive role inpreventive diplomacy to head off potentially explosivesituations. We need an effective early warningcapability to deal with emerging conflicts and muchcloser collaboration between the Security Council andthe Office of the Secretary-General in our efforts tomeet security challenges wherever they may occur.At this time  our Organization is understandablyfocused on global security. The crisis in the peaceprocess between Israel and the Palestinian Authority isa component of the overall challenge and continues topose a significant threat to security in both the MiddleEast and the wider world at large. The Kingdom ofSwaziland believes that the only solution to thecontinuing instability in that region is through peacefuldialogue and a return to the spirit of compromise andunderstanding that has characterized the relationshipbetween the two sides in the past. We commend theefforts of all who are trying to bring lasting sustainable peace to the Middle East  and we offer ourencouragement and support for the achievement of thisgoal.On the African continent  security challengescontinue to cause suffering and restrict thedevelopment of many millions of our people. Whilethis is undeniable  it is also clear that Africa itself istaking on the responsibility to find solutions to thecrises affecting a number of its nations. The peaceprocesses in Burundi  the Democratic Republic of theCongo  Sierra Leone  Ethiopia and Eritrea and Angolaall have benefited from the involvement of our regionaland subregional groupings and from the efforts ofdedicated African men and women. The Kingdom ofSwaziland supports unequivocally these efforts  and wejoin our fellow African Member States in calling forcontinued and enhanced support from the UnitedNations and individual countries and for commitmentsin word to be followed up by action.In developmental terms  there is a new windblowing through all the African countries  bringingfresh hope to our peoples for improved standards ofliving and the removal of the burdens of the past. Aseries of historic agreements by all African countriesindicates a new era of optimism for the continent  aswell as the start of a new relationship with the rest ofthe world. The continent will no longer tolerate thenotion of unconstitutional Governments  and we haveall confirmed our belief that transparency andaccountability are the watchwords of governance thatplaces people at the centre of development.37We also believe that trade with the rest of theworld is the lifeblood of our developing economies encouraging the creation of businesses and inward andlocal investment and increasing employment. Wetherefore commend those countries and trading blocsthat recognize the importance to Africa of freeing uptheir markets for our goods and services and encourageothers to follow suit.The birth of the African Union is a signal to therest of the world that Africa means business and isready to back up its words with action. The NewAfrican Initiative proposes a partnership that is basedon support for an Africa that recognizes and accepts itsresponsibilities from a world that understands ourpriorities for development. We commend the initiativeto those who are in a position to help Africa emergefrom the disappointments of the past into a prosperousand secure future.We are on the edge of a global recession  and itseffects will be felt hardest among those of us in thedeveloping world. After a decade of encouraging talkof the benefits of globalization  we are discovering thehard truth: that we are nowhere near the stage of beingable to gain advantage from a world of liberalizedtrade. This must now surely be plain for anyone to see.Globalization in its unfettered form is likely to domore harm than good to the small  vulnerableeconomies unless measures are put in place to protectthem in the short to medium term. There must beagreed ground rules to regulate the conduct of freetrade in goods and services to ensure an equitableexchange between unequal partners.Considering the intrinsic link between peace security and development  the United Nations has aneven bigger responsibility to increase its efforts tosecure resources to finance development  especially forthose of us most at risk in these times of economicuncertainty. We believe it is the responsibility of thewider international community to continue to provideresources to assist developing countries to fight theirway out of poverty.The Kingdom of Swaziland continues to developconfidently and peacefully  according to the wishes ofits people. Our review of the Constitution wascompleted earlier this year  and the recommendationsof the people will now be drafted into a legal documentfor final approval by the Swazi nation next year. Thisvital nation-building process will result in aConstitution that is based entirely on the wishes of thepeople themselves  and we are confident that it willserve the best interests of the Kingdom for manygenerations to come.Poverty alleviation remains the top priority forthe Kingdom  and we continue to make great efforts toachieve this aim through a series of economicmeasures  such as investment attraction  increasedtrade and the stimulation of local entrepreneurship. Weare embarking on an ambitious programme tomaximize the potential of our tourism and industrysectors  and in this we need the support of theinternational financial institutions  as well as theUnited Nations Development Programme.Despite our best efforts  and in common with alldeveloping countries  the Kingdom is finding progressdifficult to achieve in the face of huge obstacles  withthe greatest undoubtedly being the threat to our futureposed by the HIV/AIDS crisis. During the UnitedNations special session on HIV/AIDS held here inJune  we made clear the scale of the disaster facing ournation. There is no doubt that the spread of HIV amongthe population represents our greatest developmentchallenge  and we are working hard in a combined national effort to overcome the devastating effects ofthe pandemic.However  we cannot do this alone. We needsubstantial support to implement our strategy ofeducation  prevention  care and counselling. Finances drugs  expertise and guidance are all urgently required.The very survival of our nation is at stake  and weappeal once more to the United Nations and to theinternational community at large not to abandon us atthis moment of supreme necessity.It could be said that there has been aninauspicious start to the twenty-first century  with theglobalization of terrorism and the reality of a globaleconomic recession at the forefront of our minds. Thisplaces all the more responsibility on the United Nationsto harness the resources and commitment of thecitizens of the world for the benefit of humankind. Inthis regard  there is a compelling need to include allpeoples of the world  as envisaged by our foundingfathers and as enshrined in the principle of universality.Acknowledging the importance of this principle the Kingdom of Swaziland raises once more thequestion of the inclusion of the Republic of China onTaiwan in the activities of the United Nations and its38associated agencies. We appeal on behalf of the 23million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan fortheir right to representation in the United NationsOrganization. The Government and people of theRepublic of China on Taiwan have shown themselvesto be wholly committed to observing the principles andspirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rightsand of the Charter of the United Nations.In addition to the peaceful democratic transitionthat took place last year  the recent admission of theRepublic of China on Taiwan to the World TradeOrganization attests to the significant contribution theRepublic of China has made and will continue to maketo international trade. The Republic of China onTaiwan has shown time and again its willingness toparticipate in efforts to bring about true global peace development and security  and its commitment toutilize its resources for the benefit of mankind.The Kingdom of Swaziland has been at theforefront of efforts to support the readmittance of theRepublic of China on Taiwan to the United Nations.Our position on this important issue remainsunchanged. We therefore appeal to our fellow Membersto support the establishment of a working group toexamine in detail the exceptional international situationrelating to the Republic of China on Taiwan  with aview to ensuring that its 23 million people cancontribute actively to the international communitythrough participation in the United Nations and itsrelated agencies.At the Millennium Summit  we the MemberStates of the United Nations agreed to seize theopportunity to forge a new era of optimism for theworld  based on equality  peace and prosperity. Thatopportunity is fading fast  and we need to redouble ourefforts and determination to make that vision a reality.The Kingdom of Swaziland renews its commitment tothe Charter and aims of the United Nations and offersto its fellow Members assurances of continued supportfor all activities that will help the world to achieve abetter future for all its peoples."
"162",6616,"SYC",56,2001,"﻿My delegation wouldlike to congratulate Mr. Han on his dynamicstewardship of the deliberations of the GeneralAssembly at this session. Our felicitations also go tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  and the UnitedNations on being honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize.The brutal and tragic events that took place inNew York  Washington  D.C.  and Pennsylvania on 11September were the result of acts against not only theUnited States  but the international community at large.In his message of condolence to President GeorgeW. Bush  the President of the Republic of Seychelles Mr. France Albert René  condemned the terroristattacks in the strongest terms  stating“Our global village cannot tolerate such acts thatdisrespect the value of human life and jeopardizeworld peace and stability.”The subsequent military action in Afghanistanwas understood  in principle  by the SeychellesGovernment as being in accordance with Article 51 ofthe Charter of the United Nations. Our Minister forForeign Affairs  in an interview with the local media referred to this military action as “self-defence”  andexpressed the wish that only the terrorist networks andtheir clearly identified allies would be targeted  as partof a carefully proportioned action plan  sparing civilianpopulations and avoiding any kind of linkage betweenreligious faiths and ideologically based deviation.The Seychelles Government agrees with thefollowing principles. Terrorism is a threat tointernational peace and security. There is no political orreligious justification for such violence. We vigorouslycondemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.Further to the events of 11 September  Seychellesrecognizes the right of the United States Governmentto react under guiding principles of international lawand to bring the perpetrators to justice. But there is alsoa need to acknowledge the root causes of terrorism including extreme poverty  despair and injustice  and tostrongly advocate concerted efforts and collectivecommitment throughout the world to eradicate povertyand underdevelopment. Based on those principles andconcerns  the position of my Government does notdiverge from the views and recommendationsexpressed by the international community.We appreciate the authority of the United Nationsin providing global legitimacy for a universal responseagainst terrorism. The war on terrorism must be foughton many fronts. The elaboration of a broad  long-termstrategy for combating international terrorism including military  political  diplomatic  legal andeconomic means  is of paramount importance.Seychelles welcomes Security Council resolution1373 (2001) of 28 September 2001  which outlinesclear steps and measures that all United NationsMember States must now implement in order toprevent and suppress terrorist activities. My country isfully committed to implementing the provisions of theresolution  despite being handicapped by theconstraints linked to lack of capacities and resources.Seychelles is a party to six of the 12 existingUnited Nations conventions and protocols on terrorism.My Government is taking steps to accede to theremaining six. Furthermore  we have also decided toaccede to the 1999 Organization of African UnityAlgiers Convention on the Prevention and Combatingof Terrorism.Seychelles fully supports the ongoingnegotiations to elaborate a comprehensive conventionon international terrorism. We commend the personalintervention of Secretary-General Annan in trying tobridge differences and achieve consensus. It is ourhope that  despite the complex and sensitive nature ofthe issues being addressed  the internationalcommunity will arrive at an agreement very soon.Bearing in mind the unprecedented internationalmobilization against terrorism and the magnitude of the33present situation  we consider that the larger influential Members of the United Nations  particularlythe permanent members of the Security Council  shouldmanifest their strong political will and backing inresolving regional conflicts in all parts of the globe.Above all  they must intensify their efforts to achieve alasting peace in the Middle East. Let us notunderestimate the fact that regional conflicts are oftenbreeding grounds for terrorism.It was mentioned earlier that terrorism is rootedin poverty. The United Nations must engage its fullpotential to vigorously pursue its development agenda.This should comprise  inter alia  the drive for thealleviation of poverty and achieving sustainabledevelopment  the quest for equitable distribution of thebenefits of globalization  and the achievement of theMillennium Summit goals  as well as the success ofnext year’s International Conference on Financing forDevelopment and World Summit on SustainableDevelopment.As a small island State whose economy dependsmainly on tourism and related industries  Seychelles’vulnerability is obviously at issue should the ongoingmilitary campaign in Afghanistan persist. As a peacefulcommunity enjoying stability and social harmony Seychelles  without questioning its strong moralsupport for the cause of international security  alsoencourages a dialogue giving the voices of reason andcompassion a chance to be heard  especially withregard to the needs of the Afghan people  who havelived three decades of war  resulting in the suffering ofvery large numbers of refugees and displaced persons.Finally  my country would like to lay stress on theurgency for the United Nations to rethink the worldorder  not just in terms of geopolitical balance  but interms of a new ethic. International terrorism cannot befought by way of offensive weapons  either traditionalor sophisticated. To agree on a common value systemis  in the middle and long terms  a more profitableorientation for the whole of humanity.This being said  my country renews its adhesionto the international coalition of nations that are unitedin the war on international terrorism and in the questfor worldwide peace and security."
"163",6660,"SYR",56,2001,"﻿It gives me great pleasure to congratulate you Sir  on your election to the presidency of this session.We are confident that the posts you held in yourcountry and the respect you enjoy will facilitate yourtask in leading the deliberations of this session of theGeneral Assembly to their desired objectives.I would also like to express our appreciation toyour predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri  for the efforts hemade last year to lead the work of the previous sessionto a successful conclusion. Let me also congratulateMr. Kofi Annan on his re-election to a second term asSecretary-General of our international Organizationand on winning the Nobel Peace Prize  together withthe United Nations. I would like to assure him that ourcooperation with him will continue in order toconsolidate the role of the United Nations in variousdomains.The international and regional circumstancesprevailing since the events of last September have casta dark shadow on our work. The new world order whose emergence was announced after thedisintegration of the Soviet Union and the Gulf war soon faltered  due to the failure or lack of desire toadopt the language of dialogue in order to eliminatehostile climates and the refusal to apply equalstandards in international relations to resolve regionalconflicts  and due to the adoption of the method ofdaily crisis management  which consists of addressingonly surface issues  instead of delving deep into theroot causes and addressing them according to the23criteria of justice  international legitimacy and humansolidarity.The world watched in disbelief the horrifyingattacks on Washington  D.C.  and New York. We inSyria and in the Arab world did not hesitate todenounce those attacks and to condemn them in thestrongest possible terms. In the aftermath of thoseattacks  we also called for international cooperationunder the auspices of the United Nations to uprootterrorism in all its forms. Likewise  we called for anagreement on measures to define terrorism in an effortto guarantee effectiveness in combating it and inaddressing its root causes.The phenomenon of terrorism is not confined to aparticular society  culture or religion. It has appeared and is still appearing  in many countries made up ofnumerous groups with different demands  beliefs andobjectives. That is why it is a gross injustice and istotally unrealistic to link terrorism to Arabs andMuslims. Suffice it to mention  for example  a numberof infamous terrorist organizations such as Bader-Meinhoff gang  in Germany  the Red Brigades  in Italyand Japan  and what has been taking place in NorthernIreland and in Spain  not to mention the variousextremist organizations in the United States ofAmerica.Those who link terrorist acts to Islam ignore thefact that Islam respects all monotheistic religions  callsfor tolerance among their followers and prohibits thekilling of innocents or acts of aggression against theirproperties. But the pressing question now is how toeliminate from the minds of American citizens thefeeling of hatred against Arabs and Muslims  feelingspromoted by tens of thousands of publications  articlesand films for the last 50 years.Senior officials at the highest level in theAmerican Administration and in European countrieshave warned against linking terrorism to Arabs andMuslims and have issued positive statements. But regrettably  those statements  though important  cannoterase the long history of defamation in books and filmsthat have distorted the image of Arabs and remain incirculation. Moreover  we have recently heard that newfilms are being made  and books being prepared forpublication  that incite feelings of hatred and linkterrorism to Arabs and Muslims  thereby manipulatingthe tragic events of September.Syria has always stressed the need to work on alllevels to combat international terrorism in all its formsand in a way that is consistent with the principles andpurposes of the Charter of the United Nations. Syriawas the first country to call  in 1985  for the conveningof an international conference under the auspices of theUnited Nations to define terrorism and to differentiateit from the struggle of peoples for national liberation.In response to a request by Syria  an item was listed onthe agenda of the General Assembly  stressing theimportance of determining the root causes of terrorismand taking appropriate measures to prevent it  combatit and address its root causes.Syria has also called upon all countries to take thenecessary measures at the national  regional andinternational levels to combat terrorism and implementthe provisions of international law and relevantinternational resolutions  with the aim of preventingthe perpetration of terrorist acts or their financing andinciting. We would also like to indicate that  since1952  the Syrian Arab Republic has been one of thefirst countries to adopt firm national laws andlegislation to combat terrorism.International terrorism is not a new phenomenon.Syria and other Arab countries have also been victimsof terrorism. For years we have called upon theinternational community to condemn all types ofterrorism  especially the State terrorism practised byIsrael. In this context  I would like to refer to thevalues of tolerance that have distinguished our regionthroughout history. Our region had never known thephenomenon of terrorism until after Israel was createdon the basis of religion  in 1948  supported by theefforts of such well-known terrorist organizations asthe Irgun  Tzioni  the Stern gang  the Lehy and theHaganah  which were responsible for sowing the seedsof terrorism and fear in Palestine and outside it.Israel has invented new types of terroristpractices in order to continue its occupation of Arabterritories. It expelled Palestinians from their homesand lands and perpetrated numerous massacres beginning with the massacre of Deir Yassin in 1948  tothat of Beit Reima just a few weeks ago. But despitethat  it has not been held accountable for these crimes.The Palestinian people have  therefore  had noalternative in their struggle to rid themselves of theirstate of frustration  despair and international disregardfor their plight but to start one uprising after another as24a way to liberate their lands from occupation and torestore their dignity like any other people in the world.What is both odd and surprising is that wheneverPalestinian refugees and their organizations residing inSyria are mentioned  the United States describes themas terrorist organizations and considers the country thathosts them as one that sponsors terrorism. It ignoresthe fact that Israel was completely responsible foruprooting those Palestinians from their homes expelling them from their homeland and denying them up until this very moment  their right of return inaccordance with General Assembly resolution 194(III). Regrettably  there are some countries and certainmedia outlets that believe those claims and describethose Palestinian organizations as terrorist. They do notstop there  but extend that allegation to Syria as well instead of condemning Israel and expressingappreciation to Syria for hosting about 500 000Palestinian refugees and offering them work  securityand a dignified life.But in any case the request on the part of Israeland those who support it to have these Palestinianrefugees and their organizations expelled from Syriaraises the very important question of where thoserefugees should go. The natural and human answersays that they should go back to their country Palestine. They are more entitled to go back to theirhomes than the million Russian Jews who were broughtin by Israel during the last 10 years. They are also moreentitled than another 1 million Jews that the head of theIsraeli Government plans to bring into Israel  althoughthey live well and securely in their countries. Althoughthe rulers of Israel claim that the Palestinians have noplace in their towns and villages and that the return ofPalestinians threatens the existence of Israel  the truthis that the return of Palestinian refugees will alleviateracism in Israel and will not threaten its existence.During its invasion of Lebanon in 1982 Israelperpetrated the ugliest of crimes when it shelled andbesieged Beirut for over 80 days  during which timethousands of innocent Lebanese civilians were killed the infrastructure of Lebanon was destroyed and manyhorrific massacres were perpetrated. Those massacresincluded the atrocities at Sabra and Shatila  which theentire world witnessed and is aware of.Faced with Israeli arrogance  the failure of theinternational community to stop Israel fromperpetrating its crimes  and the provision of Israel withthe latest American warplanes and the most destructiveand sophisticated weapons  the Lebanese people had nochoice but to stand fast and resist occupation. Thisresistance continued until it achieved its mostimportant victory in May 2000  when it forced theIsraeli occupying forces to abandon most Lebaneseterritories. No one in the world should forget that thebattles of the Lebanese resistance were fought on theoccupied territories of Lebanon against occupyingIsraeli soldiers and that this resistance did not actbeyond Lebanese borders and did not hurt Israelicivilians during the 20 years of occupation  whereasthe occupying Israeli forces killed thousands ofLebanese civilians  not to mention their repeateddestruction of hundreds of houses and much of theLebanese infrastructure.After all this  how could anyone fail todistinguish between terrorism and resistance? Anyonewishing to target terrorism in our region must targetIsraeli terrorism first and foremost  because what Israeldoes is the utmost form of terrorism; it is absolutelybereft of human compassion. There is no alternativebut to address the root causes of this terrorism once andfor all and uproot it from our modern life through theimplementation of international legitimacy in order torestore rights  end injustice and occupation and grantthe Palestinian people the right to self-determinationfreely and wholly.These days mark the tenth anniversary of theconvening of the Madrid Peace Conference  for whichwe made sincere efforts so it would create an openingfor a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.The serious and purposeful negotiations that Syria hasengaged in during recent years have shown two thingsto the international community: first  that Israel neitherdesires nor is serious about achieving a just andcomprehensive peace in accordance with UnitedNations resolutions; secondly  that Syria has the rightto recover its territory in the Golan to the border of 4June 1967  without compromise. However  we werealways faced with Israel’s intransigence  denial ofrights  evasion of the real issues and of therequirements of peace. Indeed  Israel has done what itsPrime Minister promised at the time: to makenegotiations go in circles for 10 years  with all thedangerous repercussions and tragic results that wouldproduce.There is talk now about an opportunity for theresumption of the peace process according to the terms25of reference of the Madrid Conference. We believe thatunless the two sponsors of the peace process  theEuropean Union and the United Nations  make aserious effort to implement the relevant United Nationsresolutions  this opportunity will be wasted again  withall the dangerous repercussions that will hold for thisimportant and sensitive region of the world.The dialogue among civilizations has gainedincreasing importance in the aftermath of the escalationof hostile attacks on certain cultures  religions andnationalities. Syria  which is the cradle of earlycivilizations and a source of scientific and intellectualenlightenment  recognizes the importance of thisdialogue and the necessity of pursuing it in the serviceof humanity and future generations. Our region  at itspinnacle  was a lively example of dialogue andinteraction among civilizations. Within its broadhorizons  the civilizations of East and West met.Intellectuals  men of letters  scientists and philosophersfrom different parts of the world contributed to theformation of these civilizations. In this context wehope that the Global Agenda for Dialogue amongCivilizations  recently adopted by the GeneralAssembly  will be implemented. We find in this agendaa horizon that responds to the aspirations of peopletowards enriching the awareness of common humanvalues among all peoples and deepening the spirit ofunderstanding among them.In conclusion  allow me to convey to you thegratitude of my country  Syria  and its President Government and people for the precious trust and thegreat support that so many countries in the worldexpressed when they elected the Syrian Arab Republicto the Security Council. I would like to assure you thatSyria shall remain  as it has always been  in theforefront of those who defend international legitimacyand the Charter of the United Nations and will makeevery possible effort during its membership on theSecurity Council to contribute to preservinginternational peace and security."
"164",6705,"TCD",56,2001,"﻿TheGovernment and the people of Chad were profoundlyshocked and saddened by the horrendous attacks on theUnited States of America that took place on 11September 2001 in New York and Washington. I wouldlike to take this opportunity to convey once again thesincere condolences of the Government of Chad to theleaders of that friendly country and to the families ofthe innocent victims.Those extremely barbaric attacks demonstratehow urgently necessary it is for the internationalcommunity to move beyond the intentions expressed inthe various agreements on terrorism and agree on theimplementation of a genuine common plan of action toeradicate terrorism totally and to free our world fromthe suffering to which it is subjected as a result ofextremism and fanaticism in all their forms. We mustwork together to preserve peace and understandingamong peoples for the sake of mankind’s future and allthose who comprise it — Jews  Muslims  Christiansand others.While vigorously stressing that nothing canjustify terrorism  the Republic of Chad wouldnonetheless like to share with the Assembly somethoughts prompted by the serious situation facing theworld.Terrorist bases are found on every continent  andthe struggle against this scourge involves everyreligious community. It is for this reason that we mustdenounce the equation that is being made betweenterrorism and a given religion. It is unacceptable forcertain media to perpetuate that equation in worldopinion  thereby inciting hatred and exclusion. The waragainst terrorism must therefore be global andmultidimensional in nature. It must be the subject ofgenuine cooperation among all peace- and justice-loving States  and it must take place within the mostappropriate international framework  namely  theUnited Nations.This worldwide struggle need not necessarily bemilitary to be effective. It must go hand in hand witheconomic measures to end the poverty and injusticeevident in our world. We must also act on the politicaland diplomatic level to settle crisis situations and toidentify  try and punish those truly guilty of terroristacts and their accomplices.Not long after the holding of the MillenniumSummit and the Durban Conference against racism and just before the high-level International Conferenceon Financing for Development  scheduled for 2002  wemust unfortunately once again deplore the injustice poverty and suffering endured by the overwhelmingmajority of the world’s peoples. In the course of ourmany international meetings  we have constantly saidthat the world needs more solidarity and that thewealthier countries must expand their financial effortsto contribute to the economic and social developmentof the neediest peoples. In saying that we are notasking for charity  but rather for realizing the legitimateright of those peoples to development. Alas  the realstate of affairs falls far short of our hopes.17Poverty continues to grow in the world  and thefuture of the world’s poor is undermined by the plightof their children. Hundreds of millions of thosechildren work in inhuman conditions in order tosurvive. They are left to their miserable fate in thestreets  subject to violence  drugs and prostitution whose corollary is AIDS. The situation is all the moreappalling given that  despite promises to reduce orcancel the debt of poor countries  that debt continues togrow  its burden hampering economic growth. At thesame time  some financial speculators can make tens ofbillions of dollars in a single financial markettransaction — 10  or even 20  times the amount ofrecent years’ generous debt write-offs.How can our world continue to profess respectfor human rights while allowing those in the North andSouth who benefit from the global system thatgenerates such poverty and all the injusticesexacerbated by globalization? What meaning do humanrights have for people who do not even have access tothe basic right to feed themselves? Can we thereforecontinue to dream of a better world knowing that therich countries are continuing to cut back theirdevelopment assistance?It is therefore inconceivable to us to hope to fightterrorism without the genuine solidarity of the richcountries with the neediest. Yes  in this troubled worldin which the international community is threatened bymajor conflict  it would not be out of place to reaffirmour desire to see the emergence of genuine solidarityamong peoples and nations in the form of sound andmutually advantageous cooperation in order to redressthese injustices  which are  I stress  the main breedinggrounds of terrorism.In order to address all the challenges posed bythis difficult world  my country  Chad  knows that itmust rely above all on its own capacities if it is tooccupy its rightful place in international life and tomake its modest contribution to the building of a betterworld. That is the underlying message of theunrelenting struggle waged by President Idriss Debysince 1 December 1990 to establish a pluralisticdemocracy in Chad  the guarantee of sustainabledevelopment in peace and stability.I wish to state today that my country recentlyreached a decisive stage in the consolidation of thatpluralistic democracy through the presidential electionof 20 May. That election  the second of its kind in thehistory of Chad  involved seven competing candidatesand resulted in the election of Mr. Idriss Deby  theoutgoing President  to a second five-year term. It tookplace in total transparency  as attested by national andinternational observers. Moreover  the ChadianGovernment attaches great importance to thelegislative elections to be held in 2002  with theassistance of the international community.On the economic level  since 1995 Chad hasfollowed a recovery strategy intended to lay the basisfor sustainable economic and social development.Thorough reforms have been undertaken to improveand stabilize public finance  to correct externalimbalances and to launch lasting growth. These actionsrequire an effective anti-poverty policy  with respect towhich Chad  through me  expresses its gratitude to theinternational community for its support  in particular atthe fourth Geneva round table of 1998 on thedevelopment of Chad and at the sectoral meeting andthe mid-term review meeting of 2000.Furthermore  following lengthy and heateddiscussion  the oil project has been finalized and isoperating well. Chad is now vesting great hope in itseffects and looks forward to using its resources tofinance its poverty reduction strategy. In that regard  Iwould recall that  for the first time in the history ofpetroleum exploitation  legislation has been enacted toguarantee transparency in revenue management and toreserve a portion of the profit for local communities inthe producing region and their future generations.Along with these domestic efforts  Chad willcontinue to work tirelessly for subregional and regionalintegration in Africa. The challenges facing the modernworld require all nations to pool their means andefforts in great economic  monetary and culturalgroupings. Even if the international situation shouldbecome favourable and the industrialized countriesshould choose to heed the voice of Africa  we believethat it is up to Africans ourselves  first and foremost  tobuild our continent.The launching in July 2001 in Lusaka of theprocess of establishing the organs of the African Unionopened encouraging prospects for the achievement ofthe legitimate aspirations of the African peoples topeace  security and well-being in a much fairer world.The African peoples are convinced that only a genuineunion will allow Africa to address its challenges and to18extricate itself from the economic stagnation andviolence that plague it.Civil war and violence of all sorts  generated byinjustice and poverty  are found throughout the worldand on every continent. Their proliferation and extentare deeply worrisome  especially since they are fuelledand perpetuated by certain countries that place theirown interests above those of the peace and stability ofnations. What can we say about the hesitation ofcertain countries to participate actively or morally inprevention  management  settlement or peacekeepingoperations? In our opinion  it is equally unthinkable toseek to combat terrorism while allowing crises thatfeed it to persist.With respect to such crises  allow me to refer tocertain conflicts situations that are of particularconcern to my country  Chad.Central Africa  which in recent years has becomea theatre of political and tribal tensions  has ultimatelybecome aware of its situation in the internationallandscape. It has therefore resolutely committed itselfon the path to ensuring the creation of improvedsecurity conditions. In that regard  we must commendthe efforts of the international mediators and thosestatesmen who have personally and effectivelycontributed to defusing a number of hotbeds of tensionin that part of the continent.However  while we may welcome the restorationof peace in Congo Brazzaville  the same is not yet truein the Democratic Republic of the Congo  where regrettably  war continues to claim innocent victims.We hope that the inter-Congolese dialogue begun inAddis Ababa will result in a peaceful settlement to thatfratricidal conflict  which has gone on too long.We also certainly welcome the stabilization of thesituation in the Central African Republic  but recentevents have revealed the precariousness of thesituation. In this regard  Chad reaffirms through methat it will tolerate no destabilization of that fraternalcountry through its borders and will always do itsutmost to promote understanding and concord amongits Central African brothers. It also calls on theinternational community to assist that neighbouringcountry in the restoration of lasting peace.In Burundi  although armed confrontationscontinue to occur  we welcome the establishment of aunion Government and hail the tireless work done byPresident Nelson Mandela as facilitator to ensure thatthe current negotiation process leads to national peaceand concord in the country.As to Angola  the Government of the Republic ofChad reaffirms its support for the legitimateGovernment in its efforts to achieve peace and security.In West Africa  the agreement on voluntarydisarmament signed under the auspices of the UnitedNations Mission in Sierra Leone has yielded tangibleresults and is now the only proper course for resolvingthe crisis in that country. We encourage the EconomicCommunity of West African States to continue to workto restore lasting pace to that subregion.As to the Horn of Africa  Chad encourages anyinitiative on the part of the belligerent parties to bringabout national reconciliation in Somalia on the basis ofthe Arta agreements. Likewise  the ChadianGovernment welcomes the observance of the ceasefirebetween Ethiopia and Eritrea  and exhorts these twofraternal countries to build peace along their commonborder. As to the embargo on Libya  Chad unreservedlysupports its immediate lifting  without conditions andin full  because it unjustly penalizes the fraternalLibyan people.In the Middle East  it is time for the tragedy ofthe Palestinian people  which has lasted for more thanhalf a century  to be brought to a peaceful  fair andlasting conclusion. It is more urgent and necessary thanever for pressure of all kinds to be brought to bear onthe State of Israel to induce it to fulfil the terms of theresolutions adopted by the Security Council on thePalestinian question  in particular resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973). The credibility of theinternational community depends on the ability of thePalestinians to enjoy all their rights  including the rightto an independent and sovereign State.Turning to another injustice in the world  namely the inhuman embargo imposed on Iraq  myGovernment calls for its immediate and unconditionallifting  because it no longer has any justification. As tothe injustice committed by our Organization vis-à-visthe Republic of China on Taiwan  the time has come toset things right  in order to allow that country  whosehuman  economic and political weight is unquestioned to occupy its legitimate place in the family of nations which is to say in the United Nations  following itsrecent admission to the World Trade Organization which we welcome.19On this solemn occasion  we cannot fail to referto another undemocratic and unjust feature of thestructures of our Organization. In this regard  I wouldlike to recall in the strongest terms that Chad stilladheres to the common African position on therestructuring of the United Nations  including theenlargement and reform of the Security Council  so asto ensure fair representation for all regions of theworld.Before I conclude  allow me to extend to you  Sir the warm congratulations of the Chadian delegation onyour well-deserved election to lead the fifty-sixthregular session of the General Assembly. I amconvinced that your personal and professional qualitieswill guarantee the successful conduct of our work.Allow me also to convey the sincere thanks of mydelegation to your predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri  forthe tact and wisdom with which he conducted the workof the previous session.I wish lastly to convey the Republic of Chad’ssincere congratulations to our brother Kofi Annan Secretary-General of this Organization  on the renewedtrust that the international community has just placedin him for a second term  and also on the Nobel PeacePrize that was awarded to him and to the UnitedNations. The dedication of the Secretary-General to thecause of peace  progress and development has beenthoroughly demonstrated. We therefore wish to assurehim of the support and encouragement of theGovernment of the Republic of Chad throughout hisnew term in office."
"165",6751,"TGO",56,2001,"﻿The suddenspeeding up of events that has taken place since thefifty-fifth session of the General Assembly and theirpotential impact on the future of humankind onlyconfirms our impression that our world is experiencingdevelopments that could  one the one hand  open thedoor to hopes for peace  stability and progress  or  onthe other  jeopardize these hopes and imperil prospectsfor a better world.The threat is real. We therefore must mobilize ourefforts to an even greater extent to ensure that theideals of peace  solidarity  justice and tolerance cantriumph throughout the world.Hatred and intolerance took centre stage on 11September  when the United States  our host country was the target of terrorist acts of indescribable andunjustifiable barbarity.In the face of the outrage and horror to whichthose events gave rise  the President of the Republic ofTogo immediately condemned these heinous attacks which he called a veritable declaration of war  andwhich  regrettably  caused the death of nationals ofnearly 80 countries  including mine.Once again  in paying tribute to all of those wholost their lives in the tragedy of 11 September and inconveying once again our deep condolences to theAmerican people  I should like to express the ferventhope that  thanks to our collective efforts and to agreater solidarity in our actions  we will be able todefeat evil.Because we have on several occasions been thevictims of terrorist acts  Togo is aware of thesignificance and seriousness of the consequences ofsuch acts of murderous violence  which are committedwith complete disregard for respect for human life andfor human dignity.The joint combat against international terrorism in all its manifestations and wherever necessary  is atask of great importance for the entire internationalcommunity  because no one is safe from this scourge.This fight should not be understood as a confrontationbetween civilizations  cultures or religions. Identifyingthe true causes of this scourge and finding appropriatesolutions to combat it — this is the true challenge thatwe must meet.In this context  it is important to do everythingwe can to ensure the broadest possible participation ofStates in the strict application of the 12 internationalconventions dealing with specific aspects of terrorismand to step up negotiations on the comprehensiveconvention on international terrorism.Likewise  it is essential for all States to cooperateclosely with the mechanism has been set up by theSecurity Council pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001) inorder to combat this scourge in an efficient andcoordination manner. My country is already complyingwith its responsibilities in the context of this process.12However  cooperation in eradicating this scourgeneeds to be strengthened at the regional level as well.Thus our West African subregion notes withsatisfaction that it has set up functional structures tocombat terrorism  through the quadripartite agreementbetween Ghana  Togo  Benin and Nigeria; and theEconomic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) Protocol on Mutual Assistance  Protocolon Non-Aggression and Protocol relating to theMechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management Resolution  Peacekeeping and Security.Before continuing my statement  I should like tojoin my voice to those of previous speakers inextending to Mr. Han  on behalf of my delegation andon my own behalf  our warmest congratulations on hiselection as President of the fifty-sixth session of theGeneral Assembly. I am convinced that  thanks to hisexperience and diplomatic skills  the work of thissession will definitely be successful.I should like also to extend my warmestcongratulations to his illustrious predecessor  Mr. HarriHolkeri  who so ably guided the work of the fifty-fifthsession.Finally  I should like to take this opportunity topay well-deserved tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan. Thanks tohis skill and his vision  our Organization has regainedits credibility and its primary role in the managementof international affairs. His unanimous re-election to asecond term of office  and the fact that he won theNobel Peace Prize for 2001 together with the UnitedNations  attest clearly to the great confidence that theentire international community places in him.There cannot be economic progress norsustainable development outside an environment ofpeace  security and stability. Togo’s foreign policy hasalways been based on the principle of seeking peace stability and solidarity between nations.Since coming to power  the President of ourRepublic  Mr. Gnassingbé Eyadema  has worked toconsolidate peace. This requires the participation of allcitizens in political life as well as the construction of astate that is truly based on the rule of law  in which allindividuals can make their contribution and use theirskills in the building of a prosperous nation.The President had already begun to democratizepolitical life in Togo by the 1980s. Like any otherhuman endeavour  the promotion of democracy andgood governance and the consolidation of the rule oflaw are part of a process that  by necessity  can beperfected and can evolve and that fits in a given timeand place.With various forms of support and aid from ourforeign partners  this process is taking its course andregistering tangible and real progress. We should likehere to express our profound thanks to all ourinternational partners who have supported us in ourambition to pursue and achieve political reformsnecessary to consolidate democracy and rule of law inTogo.The upcoming legislative elections  in March2002  are organized with the aim of making thisambition more of a reality. In this regard  we aregrateful to the United Nations for having recently sentan assessment mission to Togo to makerecommendations in light of these elections. The long-awaited upcoming legislative elections  as well as theproper conduct of the balloting  will  without a doubt contribute to boosting the economy of our country.For it is true that progress made in pursuing anyprocess of democratization and establishing the rule oflaw can be protected only if accompanied by asignificant improvement in the living conditions of thepopulations concerned. In other words  to be lasting the advances in promoting civil and political rights andfundamental liberties should absolutely be underpinnedby the real enjoyment of economic and social rights.In such a context  we may well be surprised at theunjustified continuation of the economic sanctionsimposed on Togo by our main partners in developmentfor almost 10 years. What has my country done todeserve such a fate? What has the Togolese populationdone to justify its daily suffering? Why apply thispolicy of double standards? Given the way Togo isbeing treated  are we to see this as an concreteillustration of the views of the renowned  classicFrench writer Jean de la Fontaine: “Depending onwhether you are powerful or weak  the judgement ofthe court will make you white or black”?The Togolese people still cannot understand whyTogo — which was one of the first countries in Africato be committed to the path of democratization andpolitical reforms and which  in all objectivity  madeprogress in this area — continues to be subjected tosuch injustice. I would like to make once again anurgent appeal  on behalf of the Togolese Government13and people  for normalization of our cooperativerelations with our development partners.Peace  security and stability in Africa are still atthe heart of our concerns. We note with satisfactionthat significant progress in settling conflicts hasrecently been made on the continent. I would cite byway of example the cessation of conflict betweenEthiopia and Eritrea  or the gradual return to normalconstitutional life in Comores  despite the vicissitudesof the last few days. All this was made possible thanksto the efforts of the Organization of African Unity  theOrganization of la Francophonie and the League ofArab States. These are glimmers of hope and signs ofrelief.Nonetheless  must remains to be done to bringabout lasting peace and security in certain parts of thecontinent  notably in the Mano River region  the Hornof Africa  the Great Lakes Region and Angola.The serious crisis endures in the Middle East.Violence can only beget bitterness and resentment andperpetuate violence. The hellish cycle of violence thatthe region has known for already more than a year —in particular  in the occupied Palestinian territories —has certainly had an impact on the negotiations beingpursued with a view to reaching a just  final andcomprehensive settlement to the question of Palestinethat is at the heart of the conflict.It is therefore important that the parties inconflict show greater proof of the necessary politicalwill in applying the agreements that have been reachedand work to conclude other arrangements on the basisof the relevant Security Council resolutions. In thisrespect  Togo welcomes the positive developments thathave been recently made with respect to the evolutionof the position of certain Member States on thecreation of a Palestinian State.Humanity has fully entered the twenty-firstcentury  but the economic and social position ofdeveloping countries remains of concern. In sub-Saharan Africa and in the least-developed countries inparticular  we are witnessing an ongoing deteriorationof living conditions and the unprecedentedmarginalization of these countries — a situation thatcan only exacerbate misery and extreme poverty.Debt burden  the decline in export earnings andthe lack of sufficient resources for development havegreatly contributed to making social and economicconditions worse. Therefore more resources must beallocated to these areas. In addition to theseinsurmountable difficulties  we now have thepandemics of AIDS and malaria.Africa  which is already organizing itself andtaking matters in hand  expects the internationalcommunity to make good on the commitmentsundertaken at the Millennium Summit. Against thisbackground  we hope that the major encounters thatwill take place in 2002 — the International Conferenceon Financing for Development and the World Summiton Sustainable Development — will be opportunities totake appropriate measures that can genuinelycontribute to economic growth and poverty reduction.We also hope that specific and substantial support willbe given to Africa in implementing its developmentplan  as contained in the New Partnership forDevelopment in Africa.At the start of the millennium  with great changesunderway in the world  the United Nations still is without a doubt  the centre for new hopes andexpectations of humanity. More than ever before  it hasshown itself to be the appropriate framework in which together  we can and must work to meet the numerousand complex challenges that humanity faces in thecontext of an increasingly inexorable process ofglobalization.While continuing to work to maintain peace andsecurity  promote sustainable economic developmentand move towards eradicating the great pandemics  wealso must confront poverty  injustice  selfishness andexclusion  which  it seems to me  still are the source ofmany problems that often lead to acts of violence terrorism and armed conflict. Thus  and only thus  willit be possible for us to establish a new internationalorder of greater justice  solidarity and humanity."
"166",6796,"THA",56,2001,"﻿It is an honour forme to deliver this statement on behalf of Mr. SurakiartSathirathai  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Thailand.Allow me to join all previous speakers in expressingour deepest sympathies to the families and friends ofthose who lost their lives or suffered from the tragicincidents of 11 September 2001. The people andGovernment of Thailand share the feelings of sorrowand outrage caused by those acts of terrorism. Ourcondolences go to the people and Government of theUnited States.I wish to extend my congratulations to thePresident on his election to the presidency for the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly and express myfull confidence that  under his guidance  we shall beable to build upon the United Nations MillenniumDeclaration and accomplish our goals of bringingpeace  prosperity and well-being to this world.I also wish to express our warmestcongratulations to Secretary-General Kofi Annan onhis being conferred the Nobel Peace Prize  togetherwith the United Nations  as well as on his re-election asSecretary-General. This prestigious recognition hasbeen made because of the tireless efforts of theSecretary-General himself and of the dedicated UnitedNations staff. The achievement of the Secretary-General is noted in his Millennium Report  whichencapsulates the United Nations activities ahead outlines the framework for the tasks and focuses onpeople as the centre of development  both at theinternational and national levels.After the events of 11 September 2001  the shareddestiny of the world will depend greatly on how wemanage to cope with these emerging new realities andgrowing complexities. No country is truly safe fromterrorism and no one is capable of fighting it alone.Now is the time for every nation to contribute andparticipate in the joint efforts to combat terrorism.In Thailand  we resolutely condemn all forms ofterrorism and are fully supportive of all theinternational community’s efforts to combat this gravethreat to global peace and security. Thailand supportsall actions against terrorism in the framework of theUnited Nations and in accordance with the relevantresolutions of the United Nations and international law.We have extended cooperation to the international37community through existing laws  such as those onmutual assistance in criminal matters in the form ofinformation exchange and intelligence sharing. TheThai Government is amending existing domesticlegislation and regulations to enable the country to beparty to relevant international conventions  especiallythe International Convention for the Suppression of theFinancing of Terrorism.At the regional level  Thailand has participatedactively in the recent regional gatherings at the highestlevel  where international terrorism received a highpriority  namely the recent Asia-Pacific EconomicCooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders Meeting inShanghai. We joined other APEC leaders in expressinggrave concern over the threat to world peace and thestability of the world economy caused by terrorism andin reaffirming a renewed sense of urgency to restoreconfidence to the global economy.At the 7th Summit of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) on 5 November 2001 inBrunei Darussalam  ASEAN leaders issued adeclaration outlining specific measures to furtherstrengthen cooperation to deal with the threat ofterrorism in the region. Measures proposed include theenhancement of intelligence exchange and thedeepening of cooperation among law enforcementagencies. ASEAN leaders also stressed the need tostrengthen cooperation with ASEAN Dialogue Partnersand within the framework of the ASEAN RegionalForum and affirmed that the United Nations shouldplay a major role in this regard.My country  Thailand  supports a ministerial-levelinternational conference on international terrorism under the auspices of the United Nations  to be held atthe earliest opportunity. This should facilitate thediscussion of problems and cooperation onantiterrorism  leading to possible concrete measures atthe global level. Terrorism should not be identifiedwith any ethnic group  faith  or nationality. Otherwise our efforts could result in greater danger for ourpeoples.International terrorism has also exacerbated theslowdown in the global economy. This carries with itsignificant social ramifications as well. Airlines tourism and related industries worldwide have felt theimpact of international tension. Countries alreadystruggling to recover from the recent economicslowdown are preparing to safeguard their economiesfrom sliding further into sluggishness. Confronted withthe ever widening gap between developed anddeveloping countries  the United Nations and MemberStates must work together to arrest and reverse thistrend.The efforts to bridge the gap must not be confinedto the United Nations framework alone. The WorldTrade Organization meeting in Doha  Qatar  which wasjust concluded  was a timely opportunity in whichnations proved that they could work together andachieve substantial progress in pushing forward theglobal trade agenda for the common good of the world.Since assuming office early this year  the presentThai Government has been pursuing a new approach toeconomic and social policy. The Thai Government hasintroduced a series of economic and social schemesaimed at promoting the capacity-building of the peopleat the grass-roots level. For instance  it has establishedthe People’s Bank and microcredit schemes for both therural and the urban poor. This is to assist eachcommunity by financing small  local projects so as todevelop and market a community’s own products basedon local know-how. In addition  more than 2 millionsmall-scale Thai farmers will benefit from theGovernment’s debt suspension scheme and anationwide health insurance scheme.On the issue of Afghanistan  the United Nationsand the international community  in collaboration withthe Afghans themselves  must move quickly toformulate modalities that would help restore order andstability. We should also render all possible assistanceto Afghanistan  starting with assistance of ahumanitarian nature at this crucial time and assistanceaimed at capacity-building in the near future. Thailand for its part  will provide a fairly large amount of rice —approximately 3 000 metric tons — as food relief forthe Afghans. The Thai Red Cross has also donated10 000 blankets.Within our own region of South-East Asia Thailand has reinvigorated bilateral relations with ourimmediate neighbours and has cooperated closely inpursuing a common vision of opening borders. Wehave also decided to establish joint production basesand transportation linkages. These initiatives carry onthe momentum begun last year when the Economic andSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)adopted a resolution proposed by Thailand on the“Decade of Greater Mekong Subregion Development38Cooperation  2000-2009”. This subregion has beenplaced at the forefront of the Asia-Pacific developmentagenda. In addition  Thailand also has a role in keepingpeace in the region. We take special pride in the factthat two Thai Generals have successively served asForce Commanders of the United Nations TransitionalAdministration in East Timor (UNTAET)  thesuccessor operation to the International Force in EastTimor (INTERFET). This is part and parcel ofThailand’s commitment to shouldering its fair share ofinternational responsibility  particularly in South-EastAsia.We envisage the United Nations playing a majorrole in strengthening the foundation for a future worldthat will be peaceful  tolerant  and sustainable for ourpeoples and future generations. Therefore  Thailand isfully supportive of the United Nations Year ofDialogue among Civilizations and participated activelyin the recently concluded World Conference againstRacism  Racial Discrimination  Xenophobia andRelated Intolerance held in Durban  South Africa.As we celebrate the fifty-sixth anniversary of theUnited Nations  and as we congratulate the Secretary-General and the Organization  we must ask ourselves:what do we expect of the United Nations? I believe weexpect it to work even harder towards cultivating aculture of peace  as well as improving the pace ofinternational social and economic development. Inthese endeavours  we believe that rich and poor nationsalike must contribute in their varied capacities. Thesenational efforts must go hand in hand with those of theUnited Nations.Let us focus on the immediate priorities ofmaintaining peace and harmony in the world. Let uspledge to work together with even greater vigour forthe political  economic  social  and physical well-beingof our peoples. These are  and should be  the enduringpriorities for the United Nations and for all humankind."
"167",6821,"TJK",56,2001,"﻿Thissession of the General Assembly is facing the veryimportant task of comparing and coordinating thepositions of the members of the internationalcommunity on the most urgent issues of our time  thatis  ensuring strategic stability and equal security for allStates  strengthening the coordinating role of theUnited Nations in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security and the settlement of regionalconflict  fighting poverty and disease  and creatingconditions for sustainable development and prosperityof all peoples on our planet. It is clear that the searchfor a collective response to the unprecedentedchallenge thrown down to mankind by internationalterrorism on 11 September has become a key subject ofthis session.The twentieth century proved convincingly thatthe United Nations has indeed become the centre forharmonizing the actions of nations in maintaining36peace  ensuring collective security  developinginternational cooperation  and ensuring respect forhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. Thanks to thejoint efforts of its Member States  the Organization has in 55 years  become a universal forum capable ofdeveloping joint political approaches of the communityof nations towards resolving the most urgent andcomplicated problems of world development. The roleof the United Nations as the most representativeinternational forum for discussing the whole range ofproblems faced by mankind  and developingapproaches for international cooperation in dealingwith such problems  is becoming more significant witheach passing year. In the view of the President ofTajikistan  Emomali Rakhmonov  the task ofstrengthening the central role of the United Nations hasbecome more rather than less urgent.During the fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly the Republic of Tajikistan will be celebratingthe tenth anniversary of its United Nationsmembership. Since the first day of its internationalrecognition  Tajikistan has been working closely withthe United Nations. Cooperation with the UnitedNations in the first years of its independence helpedTajikistan to stop civil strife  to find an effectiveformula for peace and national accord and now to startpost-conflict peace-building.We will never forget that dramatic period and theselfless assistance and support that we were given byMember States  the Security Council  and specializedagencies. Our special gratitude goes to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  whose contribution to thesettlement of the inter-Tajik conflict deserves thegreatest appreciation. We believe that the Nobel PeacePrize awarded to the United Nations also reflects thesuccess achieved under its leadership by theinternational community in the peaceful settlement ofthe internal conflict in Tajikistan and in overcoming itsconsequences. We are convinced that the uniqueexperience of peacemaking in Tajikistan deserves in-depth consideration and study. Practical lessons learnedfrom the settlement of the inter-Tajik conflict and theUnited Nations peacemaking activities will enable theinternational community to find new approachestowards resolving conflicts in other hot spots on theplanet.The variety of problems dealt with by the UnitedNations highlights the unique and universal role playedby the Organization in regulating international affairs.That is particularly important in the field ofinternational security. The Republic of Tajikistan callsfor ensuring strategic stability in the world based onmaintaining the existing system of agreements andtreaties on disarmament and a continuing process ofarms limitation  on both a unilateral and multilateralbasis. Tajikistan  for its part  is prepared to make itscontribution to this process. In cooperation with ourneighbouring States  we are actively working toimplement the initiative of establishing a nuclear-freezone in Central Asia. We hope that a treaty to thiseffect will shortly be ready for signing by the heads ofState in our region  and expect that all nuclear Powerswill become its guarantors.The appalling acts of terror perpetrated in theUnited States on 11 September forced the whole worldto confront the issue of international terrorism and takea fresh look at it. In order to solve this problem  it willbe necessary to analyse the whole set of newchallenges and threats and develop new approachestowards creating a credible and effective system forcountering them. May I remind Member States that  onbehalf of the people of Tajikistan  immediately afterthe terrorist acts  President Emomali Rakhmonovconveyed sincere condolences and sympathy to thefamilies of all those who had died or suffered. Heexpressed full solidarity with the people of the UnitedStates and readiness to cooperate closely with theirGovernment and the Governments of other States ineradicating international terrorism.Tajikistan has always condemned terrorism in allits manifestations and categorically rejects the use ofterrorist acts as a means of achieving political or othergoals. We reject any attempts to justify acts of terror onpolitical  religious  philosophical  ethnic or racialgrounds. International cooperation in combatingterrorism and extremism is not an abstract notion forour country. The Tajik people are very well aware ofthe methods and practices of international terrorism. Inrecent years  Tajikistan has repeatedly been a target ofterrorist activities carried out from outside. In additionto the huge material losses  such actions always entailloss of life and enormous human suffering. What isworse  terrorism attempts not only to derail the peaceprocess in Tajikistan  but also to destabilize thesituation over a vast region of Asia. Acts of37international terrorism constitute a grave threat tointernational peace and security. In combatingterrorism in any part of our planet  the internationalcommunity should be guided by similar criteria and actin a resolute  sincere and  most important  consistentmanner. All States must unconditionally and fullyimplement the provisions of United Nations SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001)  including those whichcall for depriving terrorists and their sponsors offinancial or any other support and haven.We believe that one of the primary objectives ofthis session of the General Assembly is to consolidatethe legal framework  under United Nations auspices for the interaction of States in combating internationalterrorism. In our view  the early adoption of acomprehensive convention on combating internationalterrorism and the convention on combating acts ofnuclear terrorism could be of great significance in thisregard. On various occasions  in particular from thisrostrum  the President of Tajikistan has called foruniting the efforts of the community of nations tocombat the international terrorist underground. Ourcountry has interacted effectively with other States incombating international terrorism on a bilateral andmultilateral basis  in particular within theCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS)  theShanghai Cooperation Organization and otherinternational organizations. The United Nations  withits unprecedented experience and authority incoordinating the efforts of its Member States  is calledupon to play the key role in establishing a globalsystem to counteract a threat of such magnitude asinternational terrorism. It will take much effort andtime. However  the lofty and vitally important goal oferadicating this dreadful phenomenon is worthy of suchendeavour.The five weeks that have elapsed since thebeginning of the military operation in Afghanistan haveproved that the Afghan problem cannot be resolved bymeans of force alone. There is simply no militarysolution to it  and history has provided convincingproof of that. At the high-level meeting yesterday ofthe Six plus Two Group  and today at the meeting ofthe Security Council on Afghanistan  the delegation ofTajikistan emphasized that under current circumstancesthe Afghan people have a unique opportunity to returnto peaceful and stable development. This is anopportunity for Afghanistan to become a full-fledgedmember of the international community and to changeits unfortunate image of an accomplice in internationalterrorism and other criminal  destructive  destabilizingmovements. The Afghan nation is on the threshold offundamental change. The most crucial task  and Iwould say a matter of honour for the internationalcommunity  is to help the Afghan people to takeadvantage of this opportunity. Everything must be doneto make sure that in the future Afghanistan is no longera threat to the Afghans themselves  to neighbouringcountries and to international security overall.Everything must be done in order to ensure respect forhuman rights and fundamental freedoms inAfghanistan  including putting an end to the shamefuldiscrimination against women and girls. Everythingmust be done to restore to the Afghan people hope for apeaceful future and prosperity. Tajikistan is prepared in cooperation with other concerned States  and with acentral coordinating role for the United Nations  toassist Afghanistan  a country with a great history  toregain a worthy future and to restore its formerattractive image in the eyes of the internationalcommunity. We believe that determining the future ofAfghanistan is the exclusive prerogative of the Afghanpeople themselves. One of the indispensable conditionsfor returning Afghanistan to a peaceful life is endingoutside interference and uniting  under United Nationsauspices  the efforts of the international community toaccelerate the process of political settlement of theAfghan problem and the rehabilitation of the country.Furthermore  it is essential that all hotbeds ofterrorism  elements of organized crime and thestructures and — most importantly — the productionpotential of the drug business be eliminated inAfghanistan.It goes without saying that the territorial integrityof Afghanistan must be guaranteed. Only theestablishment of a freely chosen  effective  broad-based  politically balanced and multi-ethnic Afghanadministration can guarantee peace and stability in thecountry. It also goes without saying that the Talibanmovement as a political group has no place in a futureAfghan administration since this could be fraught withthe danger of the recurrence of terrorism and the drugtrade in Afghanistan.We are profoundly concerned about the gravehumanitarian situation in Afghanistan. The refusal ofthe Taliban regime to fulfil the demands of the anti-terrorist coalition to hand over the masterminds andorganizers of the acts of terror in the United States has38resulted in new sufferings for the Afghan people and anincrease in the numbers of refugees and displacedpersons. According to the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees  among the 22million refugees throughout the world  at least one outof six is an Afghan. According to the estimates of thehumanitarian organizations  the drought that hascontinued for three years in Afghanistan has alreadyresulted in the incredible impoverishment of the entirepopulation  and military operations and theapproaching winter have placed millions of Afghanpeople on the edge of extinction. The actual reality issuch that the coming winter threatens millions ofAfghans with death from starvation. Right after thebeginning of the United States anti-terrorist operationin Afghanistan  the Tajikistan Government issued aspecial decision expressing its readiness to open itsairspace and related infrastructure for providinghumanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistanwho have been suffering from the Taliban tyranny for along time. We call upon all Member States andhumanitarian institutions and organizations to give allthe necessary assistance to the people of Afghanistanwithout delay. If that is not done  then Afghanistan willbecome the scene of a horrendous humanitariantragedy. It could cause a wave of instability inneighbouring States and in the region as a whole. Wecannot allow that to happen.The policy of drug production and export pursuedby the Taliban regime can be described as a policyagainst humanity. It is sad that Afghanistan  one of thefounding Members of the United Nations and one ofthe cradles of world civilization and culture  has now through the fault of the Taliban regime  become one ofthe world’s largest producers of lethal drugs.According to the United Nations Office for DrugControl and Crime Prevention  the considerabledecrease in the poppy crop in Afghanistan this year hasnot resulted in a reduction of illicit heroin trafficking either to neighbouring countries or to Europe. Hugeamounts of raw opium stored in the Taliban-controlledterritory were used for heroin trafficking. The quantityof heroin that has been destroyed in Tajikistan this yearalone is three times as much as last year  and thisamounts to tons of this deadly product.As a result of the tragic events of 11 September  anew situation has emerged in Afghanistan. The UnitedNations has been unable to continue assistance to theAfghan farmers and exercise control over drugproduction and trade. The Taliban movement  forwhom  under the current circumstances  drugtrafficking has become one of its major sources ofincome  took advantage of this situation. That has putan additional burden on neighbouring countries  suchas Tajikistan  that are trying to block drug traffickingfrom Afghanistan. We understand that the drug threatemanating from Afghanistan can be eliminated onlythrough a lasting peace settlement in the country andby establishing a new coalition government that wouldensure fulfilment of all its international commitments.However  that will take time. For this reason weexpress our gratitude to the Office for Drug Controland Crime Prevention and to all donor States that arefunding the anti-drug programmes implemented by theOffice  and call upon them to increase their assistanceto Tajikistan in its noble struggle against illicit flows ofdeadly substances from Afghanistan  a struggle thatserves the interests of millions of people in variouscountries. We in Tajikistan attach great importance tothis struggle and view it as an important contribution tocombating international terrorism by depriving it ofone of the main sources of its financial support.The Millennium Summit and MillenniumAssembly  which have become milestones in theinternational dialogue  identified globalization as themain challenge to the international community. Thereis no doubt that globalization  which is an objectiveeconomic process  provides unprecedentedopportunities for accelerated development. At the sametime  it is obvious that the benefits of globalization aredistributed quite unequally  and the balance of benefitsand costs is definitely in favour of the developednations. The conclusion is obvious: for various reasonsmany developing countries and economies in transitionrun the serious risk of finding themselves on thesidelines  away from the mainstream development ofcivilization. Only by applying all available mechanismsof multilateral international institutions can we stop thewidening gap in development and incomes betweenrich and poor countries that was caused byglobalization  and prevent an increase in poverty unequal access to advanced technologies  cross-bordercrime and the spread of hidden forms of discriminationin international trade.As for Tajikistan  it faces the long-term problemof rebuilding a country that has been heavily damagedby civil strife. The Government is undertaking allpossible measures to strengthen civil society  to39encourage economic recovery and to create favourableconditions for healthy and sustainable social andeconomic development. We hope that the participantsin the Consultative Group Meeting for Tajikistan  heldin Tokyo in May 2001  will fulfil their commitments toTajikistan  which would enable us to channel additionalresources to rehabilitation projects. That wouldincrease employment and substantially reduce poverty.The problem of combating poverty will remain  in theshort term  one of the priority tasks for the Governmentof Tajikistan. The targeted comprehensive programmethat is currently being implemented in the countryenvisages  in particular  measures to create new jobs  toimprove primary education  to ease access to loans andmicrocredits  and  what is particularly important  toenhance the development of rural regions. We arecarefully studying the experience of other countries incombating poverty. The progress made by someStates — in particular in China  our neighbour — isquite encouraging. However  the high level of externalindebtedness of Tajikistan is a major obstacle in thisregard. It also impedes post-conflict peace-buildingand poses a serious threat to social and economicstability in our country. We are convinced that in orderto support the developing countries and economies intransition in combating poverty it is important for theinternational community to become more dynamic andflexible in easing the debt burden for our countries.In recent years we have witnessed an increasingnumber of major natural and industrial disasters including hurricanes  earthquakes  floods and forestfires. Human casualties and material losses caused bythem have become a serious destabilizing factor. Fortwo years running  Tajikistan has suffered as a result ofa large-scale drought  unprecedented in the twentiethcentury. One third of our cotton and grain crops wasdestroyed by drought. Cattle farming and animalhusbandry products have sharply declined. Shortagesof water  including fresh water  have increased. Weexpress our gratitude to the Secretary-General  to theUnited Nations specialized agencies and donorcountries for their prompt and generous response to theappeal made by our President in connection with theunprecedented drought in the spring and summer ofthis year. The concerted collective response of theinternational community to natural disasters isevidence of the increasing effectiveness of theavailable international machinery in this regard. TheUnited Nations has played an important role indeveloping them. The outcome of the United NationsInternational Decade for Natural Disaster Reductionhas shown the need to increasingly use nationalopportunities and to enhance international cooperationin this field.In the context of globalization  natural andindustrial disasters demand an appropriate globalresponse. It is essential that the community of nationsunite its efforts to prevent natural disasters and dealwith their consequences by training personnel andexchanging experience and the results of scientific andapplied research. That would also allow coordinatedapproaches to such global challenges as the greenhouseeffect  the depletion of the ozone layer  endangeredbiodiversity and desertification. All these issues aredirectly linked to the problem of protecting theenvironment  a problem that is global by its verynature.Among the environmental challenges of thetwenty-first century  the problem of maintaining waterequilibrium and access to fresh water is one of the mosturgent. The population of earth is increasing  and theneed for fresh water is also increasing  while naturalwater resources are not increasing. One out of sixpeople on earth does not have access to fresh watertoday. The danger of the world’s diminishing freshwater resources is quite evident: it represents a threatto the environment and to all life on earth. Thistendency is not becoming less acute  and thereforeTajikistan  which possesses considerable waterresources in Central Asia  greatly appreciates all effortsto deal with the problem of fresh water resources at alllevels throughout the world. We are pleased that theinitiative of the President of Tajikistan  EmomaliRakhmonov  to proclaim 2003 the international year offresh water has received wide-ranging support in thecommunity of nations. We believe that the preparationand holding of events dedicated to the internationalyear of fresh water  at both international and nationallevels  will help us all to find answers to the globalchallenges faced by mankind and to come closer to asolution to the strategic problem of providing access tofresh water to every person on earth.With the beginning of the new century  thenumber of problems faced by mankind has notdiminished. The entire history of the United Nationshas demonstrated that the best way to deal withproblems is through collective action  based on anagreed platform. We have such a platform: theMillennium Declaration adopted by our heads of State 40on a basis of global consensus  in the autumn of 2000.The task that lies before us  the United Nations  is tomobilize energy and resources to achieve our commongoals in meeting the challenges of globalization. Thepeoples of our planet believe in the effectiveness of ourOrganization. We should not fail to meet their hopesand expectations."
"168",6844,"TKM",56,2001,"﻿First of all  on behalf of the Turkmenistan delegation  Iwould like to express my deep condolences to thefamilies and relatives of the victims of the air crashthat happened yesterday in New York.I have the honour  on behalf of Mr. SaparmuratNiyazov  the President of Turkmenistan  tocongratulate the United Nations and Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan on receiving the prestigious Nobel PeacePrize  and I wish the United Nations every success inits effective and highly competent work aimed atsolving the thorniest problems affecting today’s world.Mr. President  allow me to congratulate you onyour election as President of the fifty-sixth session ofthe General Assembly. We are confident that yourexperience and knowledge will expedite the work ofthe General Assembly most effectively.Turkmenistan is participating in the work of theUnited Nations General Assembly for the tenth time asan independent entity in international relations and forthe sixth time as a State whose status of neutrality hasbeen recognized by the community of nations. Sincethe adoption of the General Assembly resolution 50/80on the Permanent Neutrality of Turkmenistan  which isof historic significance for us  our young State hasconsistently witnessed the support of the UnitedNations in striving for peace and in our foreign policyinitiatives aimed at strengthening peace  security andstability. Taking advantage of this opportunity  I wouldlike to convey to the heads of delegations present hereand to the representatives of the member States of theUnited Nations the words of gratitude from PresidentNiyazov and assure you of Turkmenistan’s unswervingcommitment to its international obligations as apermanently neutral State.Relations with the United Nations  based on closecooperation and strict observance of the fundamentalprinciples of the Organization  have been and remain atthe fore of Turkmenistan’s foreign policy strategy. Forus  the United Nations is the main and universaldecision-making entity for the most crucial problems ofglobal development. We share the view of theOrganization itself that providing it with a new impetusin view of the rapidly changing realities of today’sworld is of the utmost relevance. In our view the mainaspect of this new drive is respect for the overallbalance of interests on the basis of the fundamentalcriteria underpinning the functioning of theOrganization  its ideals  the letter and the spirit of theUnited Nations Charter. It is our firm belief that theUnited Nations has proven over the years of itsexistence that it represents the most effective and justmechanism for resolving international issues. It is themainstay of the whole system of international stabilityand security.Turkmenistan has always stood for  and continuesto stand for  the strengthening and expansion of theUnited Nations role in the world. In this connection we believe that international law and the UnitedNations Charter  which is based on principles of peace equality  respect for nations and for their rights andsovereignty and choosing their own way ofdevelopment  continue to serve as the basis for theworld order in this new century. This belief reflects ourprinciples as a neutral State  the entire philosophy ofour country’s foreign policy and our practice in thisdecade-long participation in regional and internationalaffairs.Turkmenistan attaches the utmost importance toits cooperation with the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies. Our Government and the UnitedNations Development Programme jointly carry out anumber of large-scale projects in the social andeconomic spheres that have yielded good results for theenvironment and many other areas  including health education and ecology. Our cooperation with theUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  the United38Nations Population Fund and other agencies has beenmost effective. Turkmenistan will continue to maintainclose ties with these important agencies of the UnitedNations in the search for new avenues of cooperation.We consider interaction with United Nationsbodies and agencies to be an important and usefulinstrument in our regional  economic  cultural andinformational cooperation  as well as in our jointefforts with the Governments of neighbouring countriesto implement other international programmes ofvarious types. All of this undoubtedly fostersneighbourly relations and partnership ties in the region.Therefore  our country intends to focus in the future onmaintaining the closest possible contact with theoffices of United Nations specialized agencies  whoseimportance continues to grow.Along these lines  I should like to draw particularattention to the situation that has emerged in our regionsince the tragic events of 11 September in the UnitedStates. It was with tremendous grief that the people ofTurkmenistan heard the news from America. ThePresident of Turkmenistan  on behalf of the people ofour country  expressed sincere condolences to thefamilies and relatives of victims  and he addressedwords of consolation and compassion to all Americans.These acts of terror have been unconditionallycondemned in our country. The Government ofTurkmenistan was one of the first to make a statementin support of international efforts to combat terrorismeffectively. Turkmenistan recommended uniting suchefforts under the auspices of the United Nations.Action needs to be closely coordinated by the membersof the international community on the basis ofinternational law  ensuring that no manifestation ofterrorism in this world will go unpunished and makingpossible effective and legitimate measures to combatthis evil.Given what has happened  our country hascooperated actively with the United Nations inproviding transportation through Turkmenistan forhumanitarian supplies being sent to Afghanistan byUnited Nations specialized humanitarian reliefagencies  including UNICEF  the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees and the World FoodProgramme  as well as other governmental and non-governmental organizations. Turkmenistan’sconstructive position has received general support fromthe United Nations and the majority of States in theworld.We are greatly concerned over the situation inAfghanistan and the ongoing armed conflict in thatcountry  which affects stability as well as social andeconomic development in the region. Turkmenistanshares the view that there is no alternative to a peacefulresolution of the Afghanistan question throughnegotiations. That is why we are convinced that theroad to peace in this long-suffering country lies inpolitical negotiations under the auspices of the UnitedNations. In this respect  we greatly appreciate theefforts of the Secretary-General to enhance the role ofthe United Nations in finding a solution to the Afghancrisis  because it is precisely the United Nations thatmust play a role in working out international legalmechanisms to resolve the situation in Afghanistan.As to the implementation of a strategy forpeaceful development and cooperation in the region  Iwould like to stress that the foreign policy of neutralitypursued by Turkmenistan from the beginning followsprecisely this path. This point also touches on thequestion of exploiting the valuable hydrocarbondeposits of the Caspian Sea Basin  which involves notonly regional interests but also the interests of manyother nations of the world as well as those of trans-national companies. It is our policy to take thoseinterests into account.Naturally  the oil and natural gas deposits in theCaspian Sea are extremely important energy resourcesfor the twenty-first century. Their rational and effectiveexploitation  and the construction of an appropriatepipeline infrastructure to deliver these energy suppliesto world markets  will ensure considerable economicgrowth for many States and the welfare of their people.The United Nations can play an important role in thisprocess  as it is capable of creating a mechanism toguarantee the safe and unimpeded transportation ofsuch raw materials along inter-State pipelines. As theAssembly will recall  Turkmenistan put forward thisidea at the Millennium Summit and suggested that aninternational convention should be worked out in thisregard.Effective economic activity in the Caspian isinherently linked to ensuring stability in the Caspianregion. Turkmenistan believes that the Caspian Seaarea should be a zone of peace  stability and sustained39international cooperation based on the principles ofjustice and mutual respect.It is clear that the problems now faced byMember States of the United Nations are complex andmanifold. Their solution is possible not only throughcollective efforts but also through the necessaryrecognition of the individual role and responsibility ofeach nation as a member of the world community. It isthis logic of political behaviour that Turkmenistan hasin mind when it limits itself to the goals ofstrengthening peace and promoting economic  socialand cultural development. Our country is always readyfor constructive partnership  and the United Nationsknows that it can always rely on Turkmenistan."
"169",6872,"TON",56,2001,"﻿In congratulating Mr. HanSeung-soo upon his assumption of high office  I mustalso praise his predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri ofFinland  for an outstanding tenure as the President whoushered in the new millennium. If the MillenniumSummit and its Declaration could be considered thehallmark of Mr. Holkeri’s presidency  then Mr. Han’salready has one of equally impressive terms with theOrganization and its Secretary-General being awardedthe Nobel Peace Prize. Therefore  the re-election ofMr. Kofi Annan for a second term as Secretary-Generalis sure testament not only to his own personaldedication  creative leadership and unwavering senseof spirit  but also to the vision and faith of theOrganization’s Member States.I take this occasion to offer Tonga’s solace to allaffected delegations  and in particular the delegationsof the Dominican Republic and the United States  forwhom the tragedy that befell their communities on 12November has such a profound bearing.Like other Member States  Tonga takes thisoccasion to express our sympathy and condolences tothe President and people of the United States for thesuffering and loss of life incurred during the attacks of11 September. In doing so  Tonga condemns in thestrongest possible terms these acts of terror  whichremain without moral or lawful justification.The events of 11 September have focused ourOrganization’s attention on terrorism in all its formsand manifestations and  more importantly  on the needto address this issue comprehensively. As such  Tongacommends the timely and decisive action taken by theSecurity Council with respect to the events of 11September. In doing so  we fully support the work ofthe Counter-Terrorism Committee and its mandatedefforts to combat terrorism.It has been stated that terrorism offends the corevalues of our Organization  and that is true. The ironyis that  inasmuch as the events of 11 September werean affront to one’s sense of humanity  it is this veryhumanity that has risen to prevail over extremeadversity. If last year’s catchphrase during theMillennium Summit was “We  the peoples”  that call isall the more pertinent this year in our collective effortsto combat terrorism.As part of its contribution to these efforts  Tongais taking steps to carefully study and consider theUnited Nations conventions on terrorism that it is not34party to. However  merely becoming parties toconventions will not be sufficient. Concrete steps willbe needed if small countries like ours are to fully andmeaningfully take part in these efforts.For example  Tonga’s efforts to develop implement and maintain counter-terrorism measureswill require sustained financial and expert technicalassistance on a solid foundation of a network ofinformation exchange between relevant lawenforcement and aviation agencies. In this regard  ourefforts in combating terrorism will be but a microcosmfor addressing a wider plethora of development issues.As much as the Millennium Declarationconcerned new commitments  or renewed commitmentsin some instances  Tonga commends the report of theSecretary-General for its innovation and detaileddescription as to how implementation of theDeclaration might be taken forward.We look towards the International Conference onFinancing for Development as a further opportunity topursue a wide range of crucial thematic issues whichare particularly critical to the development aspirationsof developing countries. The balance required forforging consensus on these thematic issues is asimportant as the balance between official developmentassistance and the mobilization of limited domesticresources.While the Declaration of the recently concludedWorld Trade Organization (WTO) MinisterialConference in Doha might give rise to optimism  Tongaseeks a simplified  streamlined and expeditiousaccession process for small island developing Stateslike ours who wish to join the WTO. In this regard  wecongratulate the People’s Republic of China upon itsentry into the organization. A more flexible approachand time frame within which to meet obligations areneeded to enable countries like Tonga to adoptmeasures so as to fully participate in the WTO systemand to fulfil the obligations of the WTO agreementswhile minimizing any adverse impacts upon ourpopulace. Such an accession process can be achievedonly with continuing technical and financial assistance.We further look towards the World Summit onSustainable Development as a complementary step inthe development path towards the reinvigoration oftargeted commitments to sustainable development —especially those concerning small island developingStates — as contained in Agenda 21. We continue tocall on the international community for refocusedcommitment to and implementation of the BarbadosProgramme of Action. Tonga’s preparations for thisSummit  through its national assessment report  willinclude identifying areas for specific and prioritycapacity-building needs as well as avenues by which totake greater advantage of financial and technologicalsupport.While Tonga recognizes the merit of theeconomic vulnerability index as a measure foreconomic impacts  its application should encompass allsmall island developing States and not serve as a meansto draw superficial differences between them. After all the economic vulnerability index is an accuratereflection of the true realities of small islanddeveloping States  and if those realities are not fullyaddressed  we shall continue to perch precariously onthe edge of the precipice. Therefore  we continue tosupport the development of an appropriateenvironmental vulnerability index  and we commendthe work of the South Pacific Applied GeoscienceCommission in this regard. We believe that such anindex will provide accurate indicators of factors towhich small islands are vulnerable  such as naturaldisasters  sea-level rise and climate change. Tongatherefore welcomes the consensus reached atMarrakech at the seventh session of the Conference ofthe Parties to the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change and the furtheropportunities for progress that it presents.As a developing ocean State  we continue to seekour fair share of the harvest from the ocean whichbounds us on all sides. We welcome in particular thepreparations for making effective the Convention onthe Conservation and Management of Highly MigratoryFish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean.We urge the distant water fishing nations in our regionwith a real interest in fisheries to make every effort tobecome party to a convention that is the hallmark ofour commitment to the conservation and sustainablemanagement of a critically important resource. Tongacontinues to value the work and decisions this year atthe eleventh Meeting of States Parties to the UnitedNations Convention on the Law of the Sea  theInternational Seabed Authority and the United NationsOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceansand the Law of the Sea — UNICPOLOS.We continue to view information andcommunication technologies as the way to go  and we35are making our own efforts to bridge the digital divideto take full advantage of the digital revolution.Maximizing such efforts will require complementaryefforts in tandem with the international community andthe United Nations. We urge continued support for theSmall Islands Developing States Network  SIDSnet and efforts to strengthen its capacity to support andassist small island developing States.Tonga welcomes the adoption of the Declarationof Commitment on HIV/AIDS and the establishment ofthe global fund to combat this scourge. We lookforward to the implementation of the Declaration andcommend those Member States who have pledged theirfinancial support to the fund.We continue to support the effort to reform theSecurity Council. In this regard  as was presented by adelegation during the debate on Security Councilreform  we could support either proposal for anexpansion of the number of permanent seats: by two with an expansion of the number of non-permanentseats by three  or  alternatively  by three  with thenumber of non-permanent seats increased by four.While cognizant that issues pertaining to the veto andits exercise in such an expansion would continue todemand handling with the utmost sensitivity and care we urge that where there are issues of convergence steps should be taken to consolidate such convergence and where unresolved issues remain  that these be thefocus of continuing dialogue and discussion.Finally  with respect to pertinent regional issuesin the Pacific  Tonga endorses the views expressed inthe Nauru communiqué  now contained in documentA/56/388  which was the outcome of the annualmeeting of Pacific Island Forum leaders at Nauru inAugust this year."
"170",6912,"TTO",56,2001,"﻿Trinidad andTobago would like to congratulate the President on hiselection to preside over the fifty-sixth session of theGeneral Assembly. His unanimous endorsement byboth his regional group and all Member States istestimony of the high esteem in which he and hiscountry are held by the Organization. He may restassured of the full cooperation of my delegation as heengages in the task of presiding over the work of theUnited Nations.The Government of Trinidad and Tobago takesthis opportunity to thank Mr. Harri Holkeri  Presidentof the Assembly at its fifty-fifth session  for the skilfulmanner in which he guided the Organization during histenure.My delegation also congratulates the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  on his election to serve thisbody for a second term. Mr. Annan has brought aunique vision and a sense of purpose to the UnitedNations  engendering in the Organization a renewedspirit to address the issues confronting the internationalcommunity at the dawn of this century. In so doing hehas sought to put the basic rights and collectiveaspirations of human beings at the centre of the workof the United Nations. It is not surprising therefore thatboth Mr. Annan and the Organization that he soeffectively heads should this year be recipients of one25of the world’s most coveted and prestigious awards  theNobel Prize for Peace. Trinidad and Tobago extends tothem its most sincere congratulations.It is with an equal sense of pride that I also feelcompelled to mention that the twin island State ofTrinidad and Tobago is the birthplace of another of thisyear’s Nobel laureates  Sir Vidiadhar Naipaul  recipientof the Prize for Literature.It is propitious that 2001 was proclaimed the Yearof Dialogue among Civilizations by the GeneralAssembly. It is a clear acknowledgement by theinternational community that it is only throughdialogue that the voices of diverse peoples  and theirapproaches to the many challenges that face them  findexpression. Indeed  tolerance and respect for diversityremain key components of the strategies that must bedeveloped to address these concerns. Dialogue that isfair and free of fear speaks not merely of a civilizedsociety but of a society that will endure. History willjudge us  not by our so-called progress  but by what weas people  as nation States and as a world communityallow to endure.In this regard  the fundamental values enshrinedin the Millennium Declaration are so integral to thisprocess that they can never be overemphasized. Theyprovide the much needed guidance required inmaintaining focus and commitment as we strive toaddress these global challenges. Indeed  in the contextof unfolding world events  there appears to be a greaterand more urgent need to recommit ourselves to thevalues inherent in dialogue among nations.Two months ago  in our host city of New York  inWashington  D.C.  and in Pennsylvania  the worldwitnessed the most heinous terrorist assault. ManyMember States  including my own  count their citizensamong the victims. We have all been affected by thediverse and widening repercussions of that assault. Itwas a harsh and tragic reminder that we live in a globalenvironment and that events in one country can have animpact on each and every one of us.We must recognize those vicious acts for whatthey are. No country is immune from terrorism. Wehave a collective responsibility to send a strong andclear message that such acts will not go unpunished.Action has been initiated to counter them. MemberStates must therefore pursue with renewed vigour  atthe national and international levels  all appropriatemeasures designed to combat this scourge againstmankind. In keeping with this stance  Trinidad andTobago has already acceded to 11 of the internationalconventions against terrorism. Trinidad and Tobagovehemently condemns terrorism in all itsmanifestations  wherever it occurs.Acts of terrorism have their origin in the heartsand minds of the misguided. There are now loomingthreats of recourse to bioterrorism  chemical warfareand even nuclear weapons. The internationalcommunity should not delude itself that conventionaltactics will return that sense of security that many partsof the world enjoyed prior to 11 September. A worldforum like the United Nations must address thefundamental underlying causes — the social economic  political and psychological conditions thatprovide a fertile breeding ground for terrorism. Wehave a moral responsibility to our citizens  to ourchildren and to coming generations  to make the worlda better place for them by denying the terrorist his useof fear and intimidation.Let me extend  on behalf of the Government andthe people of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago  ourcondolences to those who lost their lives in the recenttragic aeroplane crash.Despite the gravity and topical nature of thephenomenon of terrorism  we cannot allow the spectreof terrorism to deter us in our sense of purpose as wepursue developmental objectives aimed at thebetterment of our peoples. Neither should we allow itto deflect attention from other activities which impactjust as negatively on our societies  such as the illicitdrug trade and the illegal trade in small arms. For itspart  my Government has enacted legislationauthorizing the confiscation of the assets resulting fromdrug trafficking. In like manner  existing legislationwill be strengthened and relevant measures put in placeas part of my country’s contribution to the internationaleffort in the fight against terrorism.It is this very need to preserve democracy  therule of law and respect for human rights  that spurredthe Government of Trinidad and Tobago to propose  in1989  a renewed focus on the establishment of apermanent International Criminal Court. We willcontinue our efforts to have the crimes of illegal drugtrafficking and terrorism included within thejurisdiction of the Court.At the national level  the Government of Trinidadand Tobago recognizes the need also to maintain a26focus on promoting economic growth and creating abetter quality of life for all its citizens as key elementsin preserving democracy. In this context  theGovernment has identified nine key objectives aimed atcreating a healthier  better educated and highly skillednation  capable of fully participating in the life of thenational community and the wider global society. Buteven as we pursue these objectives  we know that  as asmall island developing State  we have special needsand vulnerabilities. Therefore what is required is asupportive  regional and global environment. That iswhy we accord special significance to theachievements of the various development targets setout at last year’s Millennium Summit. As a smallisland developing State  we would like to remind thisAssembly of the Summit’s resolve to implement rapidly and in full  the 1994 Barbados Programme ofAction and the 1999 outcome of the twenty-secondspecial session of the General Assembly pertaining tothe needs of small island developing States.Trinidad and Tobago is also of the view that traderemains one of the essential elements for our economicgrowth. While safety and security concerns havebecome a priority  the onus is still on the internationalcommunity to guarantee the strength and stability ofcommodity prices  on which the majority of developingcountries depend to finance their growth anddevelopment.Consideration must also be given to extendingdebt relief to middle-income countries  as this will freeresources otherwise allocated to debt servicing to assistin the financing of critical sectors  such as health andeducation. Trinidad and Tobago  for example  currentlyutilizes a significant portion of its gross domesticproduct to meet debt servicing requirements —resources which would be better utilized in our fightagainst the AIDS pandemic  which is fast emerging asa major development challenge  not only for Trinidadand Tobago  but for many of our sister islands in theCaribbean and elsewhere in the world.Resource mobilization at the national  regionaland international levels is central to the development ofsmall island States. Trinidad and Tobago hasconsequently given priority to the mobilization ofdomestic resources within an overall macroeconomicpolicy which encourages the creation of a competitivebusiness environment.Success in domestic resource mobilization is however  heavily dependent on the externalenvironment and linked to success in accessing themarkets of developed countries. Many of the factorswhich impinge on the process of attracting foreigncapital lie outside the control of developing countries.Trinidad and Tobago faces the particular problem ofattracting foreign investment in the non-oil sector which affects the overall development of the socialinfrastructure. Foreign direct investment also tends toflow where profits are highest  not necessarily where asound policy for the creation of a hospitable localenvironment has been instituted.Of equal significance for developing States isnext year’s International Conference on Financing forDevelopment  at which the central issue of reformingthe decision-making system will be under review.International financial institutions  for their own part must therefore work to ensure that developingcountries are allowed to participate more fully in allpolicy decisions which directly affect them.Similarly  the special and differential treatmentprovisions of the World Trade Organization (WTO)agreements must be implemented if developingcountries are to maximize their potential gains of trade.Trinidad and Tobago is convinced of the need for theWTO to recognize the differences in the levels ofdevelopment capacity which exist among its members including developing States. Our position on this issuewas clearly enunciated at the just concluded Dohaministerial meeting. Trinidad and Tobago thereforewelcomes the agreement reached at that meeting tomake special and differential treatment operationallyeffective to facilitate development and to ensure thatmodalities for further commitments  includingprovisions for special and differential treatment  areestablished by 31 March 2003. We also welcomeagreement on a work programme to examine issuesrelated to the trade of small economies for the fullerintegration of small and vulnerable economies into themultilateral trading system. We will remain activelyengaged as the process unfolds.To Trinidad and Tobago  as a member of theAfrican-Caribbean-Pacific Group of States (ACP)  ofcritical concern  too  is the inordinate and unjustifiabledelay in granting the waiver request for the ACP/European Commission Partnership Agreement. It is anissue which has serious systemic implications for theOrganization and it is for this reason that Trinidad and27Tobago  like fellow ACP members  considered itimperative that it be addressed at the ministerialconference.In the sphere of health  no one would dispute thata real connection exists between a nation’sdevelopment capacity and the health of its people. Inthis regard  my Government has noted with specialinterest the call to strengthen the resolve adopted at theMillennium Summit to halt and reverse the spread ofHIV/AIDS by 2015. At the heart of our concern is thefact that the Caribbean region ranks second among theregions of the world where AIDS is the leading causeof death in the 15 to 44 age group  a distinction ourregion can ill afford to bear.Trinidad and Tobago again demonstrated its owncommitment to international efforts by hosting lastmonth the Tenth International Conference for PeopleLiving with HIV/AIDS. Further  Trinidad and Tobagowas among those countries specially selected toparticipate in phase II of the HIV/AIDS vaccine trials which aims to develop a safe  affordable and accessiblevaccine. The Government  too  has successfullynegotiated with pharmaceutical companies a 90 percent reduction in the cost of antiretroviral drugs.Trinidad and Tobago also supports the establishment ofthe Global Fund for AIDS and Health. As a member ofthe Transitional Working Group of the Fund  we willseek to ensure that  in the modalities of the Fund accession will not be burdensome and bureaucratic andthat special consideration will be given to the mostseriously affected countries.Another element in the pervading cycle ofunderdevelopment is the presence of persistent poverty.Trinidad and Tobago fully supports the call of heads ofState and Government at the Millennium Summit tostrive to cut in half by 2015 the proportion of peopleliving in extreme poverty. At the State level  Trinidadand Tobago’s progress in the area of povertyeradication is illustrated by the high ranking it hasenjoyed since 1977 in the United Nations HumanDevelopment Index.Likewise  Trinidad and Tobago remainscommitted to the agreement on the economic andenvironmental goals of the United Nations. Wetherefore welcome the agreements reached at the sixthsession of the Conference of the Parties to the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change especially the establishment of a special climate fund  afund for least developed countries and the KyotoProtocol adaptation fund to be established in order tofinance concrete adaptation projects and programmes.We now encourage developed countries to ratify theProtocol so that it can enter into force as quickly aspossible.As a small island State which relies heavily onthe marine environment for our petroleum  natural gas fishing and tourism industries  we are also committedto upholding the principles and fulfilling theobligations of the United Nations Convention on theLaw of the Sea. We support the work of theInternational Seabed Authority in respect of thedevelopment and exploitation of minerals of the deepseabed for the benefit all humankind. In our quest toensure the preservation of the marine environment  wereiterate that the question of the transhipment ofhazardous waste through the Caribbean Sea is a causeof deep concern to the region since  in many instances the marine environment constitutes the onlymeaningful resource on which some States depend fortheir very economic existence.Against a landscape of differing stages ofdevelopment  of differing cultural perspectives and ofdisparate and competing interests  what does emerge isan undeniable strength of purpose within this body thatunites us all in a shared commitment not only toimproving the standard of human life  but to preservingit at all costs. Harnessing this strength of purposeultimately depends on every Member State’sappreciating its inherent value and the value it adds byits participation in the work of forums such as these. Itis for this reason that we must continue the dialogue albeit more vigorously  to ensure that the interests ofpeace and security are better served. Reform of theSecurity Council must therefore be advanced in ameaningful way. Democratization of the SecurityCouncil will require more equitable representation.This goal can be accomplished only through theexpansion of the Council in both the permanent and thenon-permanent categories.The task before us is not insurmountable. Wemust deepen the dialogue to accelerate implementationof the goals defined at the Millennium Summit andspecified in the various global conferences and reviewswhich have taken place to date. We must ensure thatthe process of implementation is conducted within aspirit of equity and justice. Equal attention must begiven to all groups of countries  developed and28developing  large and small  landlocked  transit andsmall island developing States. Trinidad and Tobagoremains fully committed to this process. Let us makethis fifty-sixth session one of defining the process ofimplementation."

I would also like to convey oursincere thanks to his predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri for the skill and efficiency with which he conducted thework of this Assembly during the past session.I am also pleased on behalf of my country torenew our sincere congratulations to Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan on his unanimous re-election to continuehis noble mission. We congratulate him and the UnitedNations on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize.This session is taking place at a time when theworld is anxious about the consequences of theatrocious terrorist acts that struck the United States on11 September. We have strongly condemned these actsand reiterate our condolences to the friendly Americanpeople and the families of the victims at this difficulttime. States were unanimous in the recently adoptedSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions inemphasizing the need to combat terrorism with alldetermination in order to uproot and prevent thisscourge.Since the early 1990s  Tunisia has warned againstthe dangers of terrorism. It has called for adopting thenecessary measures at the national  regional andinternational levels to fight this phenomenon with allavailable means. Today  we reiterate our earlierstatements. It is important to develop cooperationamong States to fight terrorism  by taking all necessaryand strong measures to implement Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001). This should apply to those whoabet directly or indirectly or are involved inperpetrating terrorist acts in their countries of origin orelsewhere. All acts of terrorism must be condemnedwithout double standards  particularly with respect tothe granting of political asylum or residency. Tunisia'sbelief in the necessity of adopting such measures hasspared it the presence of extremist elements andterrorism on its territory.If we are to develop international cooperation inthis field  we will need to enhance approved legal36norms. This can be done through a comprehensiveinternational treaty allowing for a comprehensive planof action. In the same vein  Tunisia supports theconvening of an international conference againstterrorism. The conference would identify the legalframework and machinery needed to protect theinternational community from the dangers of thisscourge.In Tunisia's view  the struggle against andeventual elimination of terrorism requires the adoptionof a comprehensive approach that makes preventionand the identification of the root causes of thisphenomenon the bases of the methodology ofinternational efforts. It is also necessary to consider theinternational circumstances that influence and promotethe increase in terrorism. This will allow us to find theappropriate approach to ending the spread of thisphenomenon and its existence. In this context  it isimperative that we address all aspects that lead tofeelings of injustice  the absence of justice  deprivationand marginalization. This will prevent suspiciousparties from exploiting these feelings to fuel extremismand terrorism. There is no doubt that the UnitedNations and the General Assembly in particular havean effective role to play in clarifying that vision.Any comprehensive approach to fightingterrorism must stress the interdependence andinteraction between stability  security and peace  on theone hand  and development and progress on the other.The Millennium Summit  which brought togetherthe most important assembly of heads of State andGovernment in the history of our Organization andprovided a unique opportunity to discuss the state ofinternational affairs in all its aspects  stressed thatlinkage. It highlighted the need to formulate aninternational strategy and operational plans to achievethe unanimously agreed objectives specified by theleaders for the next millennium.This session is thus especially important in that itprovides an opportunity  a year later  to take stock ofthe principles and objectives approved at theMillennium Summit. It also permits us to developconcerted action based on these principles andobjectives. These include a common  cooperative andconsensual approach to the problems of our world  bethey issues of international peace and security or ofdevelopment and the eradication of poverty.Solidarity  then  is imperative in the light of themany challenges faced by mankind. In this context President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia hasstressed before several regional forums  including theMillennium Summit and the Security Council summit the importance of solidarity in dealing with poverty which is one source of tension and crises in societies.We believe that we cannot guarantee stability andsecurity in the world without eliminating all forms ofpoverty  marginalization and alienation. In this context President Ben Ali launched his appeal to establish aworld fund for solidarity towards the eradication ofpoverty.From this rostrum  I extend my sincere thanks toall parties that responded to this proposal andparticipated in the consultations held by the Secretary-General. In this regard  I cannot fail to commend theefforts of the Secretary-General to prepare a positivereport  which we hope will be the basis for establishingthe fund at this session. We have repeatedly affirmedthat the fund will not duplicate existing United Nationsbodies concerned with fighting poverty; it will  instead complement their efforts and provide a means offinancing through voluntary contributions byindividuals  institutions or societies  in addition toGovernments. These contributions will be deposited inan account to be administered by the United NationsDevelopment Programme.There is no doubt that the strengthening of thefoundations of international peace and security is a taskentrusted primarily to the Security Council  which inrecent weeks has proved particularly effective in itsreaction to current developments. We hope that thatimportant body will maintain the same effectiveness inseeking solutions to all international problems.From this perspective  developments in theMiddle East must take priority among the issues beforethe Council. This is particularly important in view ofthe continuing instability in the region caused byIsrael's intransigence. We call on the Security Council and especially its permanent members  to play aneffective role so as to spare the Middle East from thespectre of an endless conflict  by urging Israel to takeurgent measures to ensure the protection of thePalestinian people. Tunisia reaffirms its initiative calling for the protection of the Palestinian peoplethrough the deployment of international forces in theregion.37We believe that the only viable option in theMiddle East today is a just  lasting and comprehensivepeace that guarantees for the Palestinians the return oftheir land and their legitimate rights  foremost of whichis their right to establish an independent State. In thiscontext  Tunisia welcomes President Bush'saffirmation before the General Assembly of thenecessity of establishing a Palestinian State. We alsoreiterate our position on the need for Israeli forces toleave Syrian and Lebanese territory.The question of sanctions prompts us to examineour consciences in the light of the suffering it causescivilians. We hope that there will be internationalconsensus to remove the sanctions against Iraq and todeal with the humanitarian issue of missing Kuwaitisand persons from third countries. It is also time onceand for all to lift the sanctions imposed against oursister country Libya  which has implemented all itsobligations concerning the Lockerbie incident.As a member of the region  Tunisia is workingtowards more active participation in the MaghrebUnion  which aspires to integrate the States of theregion by enhancing the structure of the Union andguiding its work  given its function as a strategicoption that reflects the will of the people of the region.Tunisia is working to promote consultation andcooperation in the European-Mediterranean space onthe basis of equality  mutual respect  protection of theinterests of all parties and respect for theirparticularities. The aim is to bring about the soliddevelopment of the peoples of the two shores of theMediterranean so as to achieve greater security andstability in the region.Faithful to its commitment to the Africancontinent  Tunisia supports new initiatives for Africaand has joined the newly created African Union andwill support it with all our capabilities and experience.Respect for the purposes and principles of theCharter only strengthens the action of the Organizationin responding to the challenges of development and themaintenance of international peace and security. In thiscontext  we have to strengthen the role of the GeneralAssembly  as an expression of the collective will of itsMembers and as an embodiment of the concept ofdemocracy in international relations.With regard to the activities of the SecurityCouncil  Tunisia  throughout its term of office in theCouncil  has tried to strengthen the role of this organby advocating consensus in dealing with the variousitems on its agenda. This  in our view  will enhance theCouncil's credibility and will reflect positively on itsefficiency.During its presidency of the Council in February2001  Tunisia adopted a new comprehensive approachto dealing with various cases of instability and crises inthe world.Tunisia put forward a proposal for holding adebate on the subject Peace-building: towards acomprehensive approach. The result of this debatewas a unanimous affirmation by members of theCouncil of the close connection between peace anddevelopment  of the preventive dimension of thisapproach and of the importance of solidarity in theinternational community when it comes to takingmeasures that are necessary for helping countries thatare racked by tension and conflict.Within this context  I must stress the need for thereform of the Security Council so as to expand itsmembership of permanent and non-permanent seats onthe basis of equitable geographic distribution that willguarantee the interests of all countries  particularly thedeveloping countries. In contributing operationally tothe establishment of peace and security in the world Tunisia has participated in a number of peacekeepingoperations such as its current participation in theUnited Nations Organization Mission in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) headedby a Tunisian ambassador representing the UnitedNations.The elimination of weapons of mass destructionrepresents one of the major challenges facinghumanity. The importance of the establishment ofzones free of weapons of mass destruction  particularlyin the Middle East  is to be stressed in this context.Technological and scientific advances havedwarfed distances and enabled mankind to score majorachievements in numerous fields  such as spread ofideas and bringing people closer to each other.Development  however  has not benefited all peoples particularly developing countries. The widening of thequantitative gap between industrialized and developingcountries is a matter of concern. Concrete measuresmust be taken to permit all countries to benefit fromthe technological and information revolution. From thisstandpoint  we would express the importance thatTunisia places  since the International38Telecommunication Union (ITU) Conference inMinneapolis  on hosting the second phase of the WorldSummit on the Information Society in Tunisia in 2005.We would like to express our gratitude to all countriesthat have supported us in this. We would also like toexpress our thanks to Mr. Yoshio Utsumi  ITUSecretary-General  for his constructive role.We hope that the General Assembly will adopt atthis session a resolution to begin preparations for thisconference in its two phases. We also hope that thework of this conference will lead to the establishmentof a true and effective world information partnershipbetween developed and developing countries.Our ability to meet challenges  which we are allfacing  including the fight against terrorism  dependson our willingness to channel our efforts towards jointaction  based on cooperation  solidarity  tolerance andpartnership within the framework of our Organization which is the ideal place for the realization of ouraspirations and for the benefit of all mankind."
"172",7006,"TUR",56,2001,"﻿This meeting is being held ata most difficult hour. The terrorist attacks carried out inNew York and Washington  D.C.  cast a long shadowover this session of the General Assembly. But we muststand united  drawing the right conclusions from thiscatastrophe. The date of 11 September has made itclear that terrorism is now humankind’s number-oneenemy  and that it must be addressed with the utmostseriousness and determination.We share the American nation’s grief. Wereiterate our full support to the United StatesAdministration in its efforts to track down thoseresponsible and to bring them to justice. As a countrythat has lost so many of its citizens to terrorism Turkey deeply feels the grief of this tragic event.To combat terrorism efficiently and to develop astrong coalition of United Nations Members againstterrorism  certain principles should guide our collectiveeffort. First  terrorism does not have a religion or ageography  and there can be no justification forterrorist acts under any circumstances. Secondly  theuse of double standards is the main obstacle to the fightagainst terrorism. Thirdly  we have to be conscious ofthe fact that terrorism is a global phenomenon.No ideal  no cause and no end can justifyterrorism. We should avoid spurious justifications fordeliberate killing. To identify terrorism with anyreligion is a sacrilege against all religions. We stronglycondemn those who couple the name of a religion witha definition of terrorism or terrorists. To fight thisdangerous trend  we fully support all initiatives aimedat dispelling these erroneous approaches.We commend the ongoing mutual efforts of theUnited Nations  as well as several other initiatives. Inthis context  Turkey has proposed an informal forumbetween members of  and aspirants to  the EuropeanUnion and the Organization of the Islamic Conference(OIC) to discuss  from a political perspective  issuespertaining to harmony among civilizations. We havethe initial support of the relevant organizations and ofseveral countries. We hope to hold this conference byFebruary 2002.9Terrorism does not have a geography. The sameterrorism manifests itself in different countries all overthe world  both in the West and in the East. To beserious and effective  the anti-terrorist struggle has tobe all-encompassing and deal with all terrorist centres activities and logistics. It should address all countriesthat harbour and tolerate terrorism or that areindifferent to terrorist groups that incite or activelyplan  finance or command terrorist operations executedin another country.Being drawn into the trap of double standards indefining or in dealing with terrorism inherentlyprovides support for terrorism. Unfortunately  we havebeen witnessing several cases of double standards. Iwill try to give some views on this particular subject.There is an unfortunate de facto distinction madein the conceptual approaches of several countriesbetween “bad” terrorists  who work against a particularcountry  and tolerated terrorists  who  while enjoyingsafe haven in the same country  incite  plan  financeand sometimes command terrorist acts in another. Mycountry  as well as several others  has been victim ofthis double-standard approach. Groups implanted inforeign countries openly advocate the use of terroristmeans under all sorts of pretexts. Their activities andmessages — which call for violence  and sometimesfor assassination — are freely propagated and aresometimes transmitted through the authorized media intheir host countries. In short  acts and calls that woulddraw an immediate reaction if they were the acts andcalls of indigenous terrorists targeting their owncountry are ignored and tolerated when they emanatefrom guest terrorists targeting their country of origin.This unfortunate distinction between terrorists that hurtothers but not us and the prevailing double standardshave to be overcome if we are serious about fightingterrorists.Terrorism is a global phenomenon that crossesborders  and the fight against it requires effectiveinternational cooperation. Security Council resolution1373 (2001) in particular provides a clear road mapregarding the steps to be taken. We hope that allMember States will fully comply with thisgroundbreaking resolution. The establishment of theCounter-Terrorism Committee to monitorimplementation of resolution 1373 (2001) is a majordevelopment.We welcome the joint declarations of 14 and 21September 2001 by the European Union. Turkeyaligned itself with both  and we expect their promptand resolute implementation. The European Union is inthe process of identifying terrorist organizations andtheir support networks. The list of terroristorganizations to be drawn up by the European Unionmust not be restricted only to the geographical area ofits members. It should definitely include those groupsthat finance  plan and command terrorist activities inother countries.There is a drastic need for vigilance and furthercooperation between the relevant authorities  namely the justice and interior ministries of all countries. Adrastic change in attitude is imperative.In order for it to be credible and effective  theanti-terror struggle has to be comprehensive and dealwith all terrorist centres. It is also incumbent upon allUnited Nations Member States to adopt the existinginternational legislation and to review national lawsaccordingly. International efforts to combat terrorismcannot be fully effective in the absence of a globalconvention in this field.The draft comprehensive convention oninternational terrorism now under discussion in theworking group established by the Sixth Committeeseems to be our best chance to address thisshortcoming. Although all participants have displayedremarkable flexibility  the working group has failed toresolve two central and interrelated issues: thedefinition of a terrorist offence and exclusions from thescope of the convention. I wish to take this opportunityto call upon all States to make an additional efforttowards finalizing the convention.In combating terrorism  we cannot ignore the factthat this scourge feeds on deteriorating social economic and political conditions. Illiteracy destitution  bigotry  racism  social and politicalinjustice and similar sources of grievance all play arole in creating fertile ground for terrorism. The gapbetween the richest and the least fortunate nations ofthe world keeps widening at an alarming pace. Threatssuch as illegal mass migration  corruption  drugs andarms smuggling  money laundering and other types oforganized crime are on the increase.It is our collective responsibility to find lasting viable solutions to these problems. Developing nationsmust focus on ways of achieving sustainable economic10growth  on improving income distribution  educationand justice and on addressing other social needs.Developed nations must be more forthcoming in debtrelief  must increase development and humanitarian aidand must allow greater access to their markets.Today  the United Nations and its Member Statesface a mutual challenge. The name of this challenge isAfghanistan  and it has two dimensions: to combat theterrorist network  which  by exploiting the Afghanpeople’s plight  has taken root in its geography; and tosupport the revival of Afghanistan  of the Afghanidentity  by ensuring peace  stability and economicdevelopment.Turkey is resolutely committed to meet thischallenge; we fully support the United Nations effortsand those of the Special Representative  Mr. Brahimi.Turkey worked together with the Afghan people fromthe 1920s to the 1960s; and it resumed cooperationagain in the early 1990s. We believe that concertedinternational action  with sound principles andeffective means  is of crucial importance. I will try toelaborate on some suggestions.First  it is the Afghan people themselves who willrebuild their identity and their country. Our task is toassist and support their efforts — not to dictate whowill run their country  and how. In this respect  regionaland tribal affinities should be encouraged to merge intoa single Afghan identity and assume a secondary roleas sub-cultures. This is capital for Afghanistan.Secondly  all countries  either neighbours of orinvolved in Afghanistan  should be discouraged fromrelying on particular Afghan groups as their primaryallies and should refrain from pursuing their specialinterests through those groups.Thirdly  while the fight against terrorism and itssupporters goes on  special care must be taken toensure that innocent civilians are kept out of harm’sway. All humanitarian support should be provided organized and facilitated.Fourthly  in regions and cities of Afghanistanfreed from terrorist oppression  the United Nations andinvolved forces should act immediately to ensuresecurity and relief. The success in providing for basicneeds and displaying the ability to produce a betterfuture will be paramount in expanding positive changesto other parts of the country. Setting a successfulprecedent would serve as the best catalyst.Fifthly  and finally  everyone seems to agree thatthe future administration and Government ofAfghanistan should reflect all ethnicities. It should alsoencompass all political trends that have not resorted toterrorism. In this process  overemphasizing orundermining the role of any group in the country wouldbe counterproductive. It is evident that in the processof rebuilding Afghanistan  the United Nations has toplay a leading role. It is the duty of each and everyMember State of the Organization to contribute to thisgigantic task.I will touch upon one more issue  and the rest willbe distributed in the paper that I have prepared. Thislast issue is: Cyprus. The Cyprus issue has remainedfor 38 years. This subject is one that is known to theUnited Nations. As the dates for some radical changesin Cyprus through the Greek Cypriot side’s unilateralaccession to the European Union seem to be suggested and as Turkey considers these changes potentiallydangerous for the two parties and for the whole region this issue needs further attention. Any artificiallyimposed solution that is not mutually acceptable toboth nations in the island and to the guarantor countriesis bound to create a severe crisis. Turkey  as well as theTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC)  aspireto a mutually acceptable solution  sought through allpossible means.A unilateral act by the Greek Cypriots  inviolation of the 1959-1960 system  and pretending torepresent both nations  contradicts the legal frameworkand the realities of Cyprus. The legal and practicalrealities do not permit any party in the island to decideunilaterally to enter any international body of whichboth Turkey and Greece are not members; and any suchdecision has to be taken mutually by the two co-founders.Through formal decisions of their parliamentsand Governments  both Turkey and the TRNC havedeclared that they will not accept any solution that isnot freely negotiated and mutually accepted. BothTurkey and the TRNC have also made it clear that theyreject any such development  which would make theTurkish Cypriots a minority under Greek Cypriot rule.The Turkish Government will not allow the resurgenceof a situation that in 1964 and 1974 caused massivecrimes to be committed against the Turkish Cypriots.Turkey and the TRNC are for a solution based onthe realities of the island. There are two distinct nations11with different religions  languages and cultures withtwo separate States and democracies in Cyprus. Theconfederation proposal of President Denktaş deservesserious consideration. We also support the Secretary-General’s Mission of Good Offices and his efforts tostart a new phase of talks. In order to succeed  thisinitiative should depart from sufficient commonground.Turkey welcomes the recent proposal of PresidentDenktaş to his Greek Cypriot counterpart that they gettogether informally  without any preconditions  anddiscuss all relevant issues in order to find a wayforward. The refusal of the Greek Cypriot party is in noone’s interest.The tragedy of 11 September can be viewed as anomen of what can happen if the slightest carelessness isshown towards any of the old and new threats theworld faces in the modern age  be they terrorism environment or poverty.All I have said points to the need for the strongcommitment of Member countries to efforts aimed atthe shaping of a better future. I point as well to theneed to strengthen and streamline the United Nations with all its principal organs. This General Assemblysession of 2001 is a meaningful link in the chain whichthe international community has forged to meet thegrowing challenges of the new century. With realismand courage we shall succeed."
"173",7022,"TUV",56,2001,"﻿I am honoured to addressthe General Assembly. Speaking on behalf of thepeople and the Government of Tuvalu  I extendTuvalu’s greetings to the Assembly at its fifty-sixthsession and our congratulations to the President and theVice-Presidents of the Assembly on their election. I22also pledge Tuvalu’s full support and cooperationduring their term of office.As we come to the end of this general debate  weare still overshadowed by the loss of many innocentlives and property as the result of the barbaric terroristattack on America in September. We are furthersaddened by the losses earlier this week resulting fromthe plane accident in our host state  New York  and ourhost country  America. Tuvalu therefore joins others inreiterating to the people and Government of Americaour strong condemnation of the terrorist attacks and ourpledge of strong solidarity with the United States ofAmerica.Let me also convey Tuvalu’s deepest sorrow andsympathy to the families of the victims of the planecrash  and offer our prayers to the people andGovernment of America  and equally to the people andGovernment of the Dominican Republic. We whollyshare their bereavement and grief.As the newest Member of the United Nations having joined on the eve of the historic MillenniumSummit last year  Tuvalu is more than ever aware of itsresponsibilities to the United Nations and what theOrganization stands for. In June this year  Tuvaluestablished its Permanent Mission here in New York.Although this has been costly  Tuvalu believes the costis offset by what the United Nations stands for. Ourpresence in the General Assembly reflects a basicbelief we hold true: that the United Nations  through itsenfranchising activities  can help Tuvalu and othercountries like us by being an advocate with regard tothe issues that concern us most.Tuvalu is proud that the Nobel Peace Prize for2001 was awarded to our Secretary-General and theUnited Nations itself. This award is a tellingrecognition of the vast contributions the UnitedNations has made in so many fields and on so manyfronts: to peace around the world; to the protection ofthe individual  no matter his or her origin orcircumstances; and to the upholding of the basic UnitedNations principle that every human being should haveevery opportunity to lead a better and more fulfillinglife. We congratulate the Secretary-General and theOrganization for this recognition.There is no doubt in Tuvalu that peace andstability are indispensable to the well-being offreedom-loving people everywhere. The world cannotignore threats to peace and stability  no matter whattheir causes may be  be they economic  social orenvironmental. The terrorist attacks in the UnitedStates of America and what has happened around theworld since 11 September have made those of us herein this great Hall today feel very anxious. However  thevery cause of this anxiety points clearly to the properrole of the United Nations. The General Assemblymust be a strong advocate of what the Secretary-General  in his new road map  calls a new “culture ofprevention”.In our view  pursuit of this new culture is worthyand must take advantage of the new spirit ofcooperation that is now emerging to facilitate theelimination of the causes of terrorism and threats topeace and stability. In this regard  it is imperative toaddress problems in an open and representativedialogue based on consensus and mutual respect andunderstanding.The consensus-building approach that we in thePacific region often call the “Pacific way” may wellprove useful in our collective venture for universalcooperation. Tuvalu is committed to its obligation toadhere to the United Nations resolutions to eliminateterrorism  and thus is taking steps to accede to the 12United Nations and international conventions onterrorism. But to honour such obligations in practice iseasier said than done. We need technical and financialsupport from the international community to build upour legislative  surveillance and enforcement tools ifwe are to have any hope of meeting these obligationsbeyond our present capabilities.Also  we must not lose sight of the need forstrong coalitions to deal with other pressing globalissues  including conflicts and wars; the challenges ofglobalization; poverty and underdevelopment; and theeffects of environmental degradation and climatechange.Universal cooperation against threats to peaceand stability cannot  however  be fully achieved as longas the United Nations lacks the will to recognize fairand just representation within it of a democratic andeconomically developed State with a population of 23million. The Republic of China on Taiwan is alsosuffering in the aftermath of the 11 September terroristattacks  having lost innocent lives as well as property.Like us  they suffer from the onslaught of naturaldisasters; epidemics and diseases  including the HIV/AIDS pandemic; and other threats of instability.23Yet in all these crises  and despite their enormouscontribution to the world economy and internationaldevelopment — including technologicaladvancement — as well as their consistentdemonstration of international responsibility  thepeople of the Republic of China on Taiwan have beenleft to fend for themselves  denied the right to properrepresentation and collaboration  not only in the UnitedNations and its specialized agencies  such as the WorldHealth Organization  but in nearly every otherintergovernmental body. The voice with which theycould share their plight and thereby benefit from worldcooperation is silenced. However  the irony is that formore than 50 years  no authority other than theRepublic of China on Taiwan itself has had fullsovereign control over Taiwan  its population and therunning of its affairs. To visit the country  for example one must have immigration papers issued by its ownauthorities.While we welcome the wise decision of theWorld Trade Organization last week to admit theRepublic of China on Taiwan  it is Tuvalu’s strongview that the United Nations must take the lead andseriously reconsider United Nations membership forthe Republic of China on Taiwan  beyond the politicsof exclusion and on the basis of the reality of things.In Tuvalu and many other countries in the Pacific we know that our economic vulnerability is fertileground for forces of terror that can threaten the securityand survival not only of the islands  but also of theregion and the world. We are worried about thegrowing global interdependence and what that maybring to our shores. We need to improve our ability toshare and disseminate information on transnationalcrimes  particularly those involving drug trafficking money laundering  bogus investments  and otherdangerous and dubious schemes that often arrive in thePacific islands under the pretext of being legitimate.We believe that  if we are left on our own  thesethreats will continue to expose Tuvalu and other Pacificisland countries to forces outside our control. It is vital therefore  that individual Pacific island Governmentsbe given the back-up that is needed to boost theirability to tackle security threats and fight crime. Theexisting regional security arrangements under thePacific Islands Forum and its sister regional agenciesin the Pacific can  indeed  play a vital role. However they need to be further strengthened to enable them tocomplement national security efforts more effectively.Further solidifying of cooperation between our regionalorganizations and the United Nations  moreover  isfundamental to the success of national and regionalefforts vital for regional and global security.I should like to add here that Tuvalu highlycommends the role played by the United Nations andother international organizations and major countries inhelping restore peace in the Pacific following therecent turbulence in the region.Tuvalu is not in a good position to take advantageof the opportunities offered by trade liberalization.Like many island countries  Tuvalu currently lacks theknow-how  trained people and adequate infrastructureto reap the benefits that are enjoyed here. If there isbenefit for Tuvalu in a free trade world — and webelieve there is — then surely Tuvalu must have inplace the means that would allow us to reap thatbenefit.In more ways than one  small island developingStates such as Tuvalu are at the sharp end  the cuttingedge  of development. For us  overseas developmentaid is indispensable to the development and sustenanceof basic services necessary for security and survival.Our priorities continue to be education  health servicesand fresh water.While we commend with great appreciation thegenerosity of our development partners  particularlyour traditional partners  it has to be noted that Tuvaluand other small island developing States  like thelandlocked and least developed countries and otherdeveloping countries  will for some time continue torely on external financing through official developmentassistance to address their unique development needs.In our view  the International Conference onFinancing for Development and the World Summit onSustainable Development  both of which will be heldnext year  must also capitalize on the premises laid outunder the reviewed Barbados Programme of Action forthe Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States  the outcome of the United NationsConference on the Least Developed Countries and theSecretary-General’s road map towards theimplementation of the United Nations MillenniumDeclaration as the key tools to address the uniquecircumstances and vulnerabilities of small islanddeveloping States. Ultimately  this must lead to moreeffective delivery of assistance that is flexible andmore responsive to the sustainable development needs24of small island developing States and of developingcountries in general.With limited exploitable resources  Tuvalu  likemany other small island developing States  reliesheavily on the surrounding seas for its food securityand economic development. The proper protection ofthe oceans from hazardous pollution is therefore vital and the sustainable management and exploitation offisheries and other marine resources is extremelyimportant to our sustainable development and survival.Building local capacity to conserve  manage andharvest marine resources in a sustainable manner iscrucial and should therefore be supported.As has already been said in this debate  thebiggest long-term threat to the people of Tuvalu isposed by the effects of climate change  in particularrising sea levels. Recent reports released by theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change haveconfirmed beyond doubt the correlation betweenaccelerated atmospheric warming and sea-level rise. InTuvalu too it is our strong belief that the weather isgrowing more severe  hotter and drier  and that therehave been unusually high seas eroding foreshores andintruding into freshwater lenses. We believe that thecumulative effect of carbon dioxide emissions inindustrial and other countries into the atmosphere has in sum  created a future that is very uncertain inTuvalu.It may not be known in this Hall but uniquewithin the United Nations membership are theMaldives  the Marshall Islands  Kiribati and Tuvalu.Those four countries are the only Member States thatconsist entirely of low-lying coral atolls and reefislands. In the event of further rising sea levels  whereare we to hide? Eventually asking countries to take usin as environmental refugees is not what Tuvalu is afterin the long run. What we prefer is that our great-grandchildren should grow up the way I did and theway my wife and our brothers and sisters did in ourisland communities  learning the traditions  customsand culture of Tuvalu  and living our way of life.Tuvalu is not alone in sharing that view. Tens ofmillions of people who live on islands or in coastalcommunities face the gloomy onslaught of rising sealevels. Such vulnerable geography is everywhere. Howironic it would be if decades from now the last Memberto enter the United Nations  Tuvalu  were the firstMember State to withdraw because it had disappearedwithout a trace.In the shrinking world we live in  environmentalpollution has never known artificial boundaries. Thepresence of higher than normal levels of greenhousegases in the atmosphere is a legacy of development inindustrial countries spanning the past 200 years. I hopethat industrial countries realize that nature is nowimposing a penalty for that development.Unfortunately  it is Tuvalu and others with little ornothing to do with the causes which are now forced topay.While we are heartened by the positive outcomeof the seventh Conference of the Parties to the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change held at Marrakesh  and while we are looking forward tothe full implementation of that Convention and of theKyoto Protocol commitments  we would also hope thatgoodwill will prevail beyond instruments andconventions to assist those most affected to adapt to theimmediate and long-term effects of climate change.This is not the time to shrink from environmentaland survival responsibility. Like the international warbeing waged against terrorism  a global solution to thethreat posed by climate change and sea-level rise willsave Tuvalu and many other small island States fromdisappearing. Our collective resolve to remove causesof terrorism and threats to peace and security  includingpoverty and underdevelopment  HIV/AIDS andenvironmental degradation  will ensure a truly peacefuland secure village for all of humanity.May God bless the United Nations; may Godbless its peoples."
"174",7068,"TZA",56,2001,"﻿Iwould like to take this opportunity to congratulate you Mr. President  on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. Yourelection is a clear manifestation of the entiremembership’s confidence in and high regard for yourable leadership and diplomatic skills. We wish yousuccess in the tasks ahead. I want to assure you of mydelegation’s full cooperation and support.Our salutations are also extended to yourpredecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland  for a jobwell done.Allow me also to sincerely congratulateSecretary-General Kofi Annan on the able anddistinguished manner in which he has continued toadminister and guide the affairs of our Organization.His re-election to a second term attests to theconfidence and trust that we have in him. The award ofthis year’s Nobel Peace Prize to him and the UnitedNations is recognition of his personal attributes andcontributions to strengthening the world body. It is alsorecognition of the glorious performance andachievements of the United Nations in the search ofglobal peace  solidarity and prosperity.As we applaud and pay tribute to the Secretary-General and the United Nations for their remarkableachievements  the horrific terrorist attacks of 11September against the United States are a clearreminder to us all that the fight for lasting world peaceis far from being won. Strangely enough  the fight cantake new dangerous dimensions when aeroplanes which are a magnificent human invention for the fastmovement of people  goods and services betweendistant places  can themselves become weapons interror attacks.Coming from a country that fell victim to aterrorist attack with the bombing of the United StatesEmbassy in Dar es Salaam in 1998  I can clearlyunderstand the pain  anger and quest for revenge on thepart of President George Bush  his Administration andthe people of the United States of America. On thatfateful day  when 11 of our fellow citizen’s perishedand over 70 people were wounded  the Governmentand people of my country felt exactly the same. Wetherefore perceive and share the pain and grief of thepeople of the United States and support their right andthat of their Government to seek redresses and fight theperpetrators of this heinous crime.Terrorism is a horrendous crime in its brutalityand victimization. It is wanton  cruel andindiscriminate. The world must work together to fightand defeat it. Allow me to reiterate Tanzania’s pledges resolve and readiness to continue to participate fully inthe efforts to combat terrorism.The events of 11 September remind us once moreof the need to expedite the process establishing theInternational Criminal Court.Allow me also to convey sincere sympathy to thefamilies of the deceased in yesterday’s tragic planecrash. Our thoughts and prayers are with them in thistime of grief.This is the first session of the General Assemblyafter the Millennium Summit held here last year. Atthat Summit  the world leaders defined the agenda andstrategies of our Organization in the new century.There was common understanding in the new century  aresolve to continue to work together to tackle thenumerous problems bequeathed by the last century. It isthe view of my delegation that this session of theGeneral Assembly and the subsequent ones shouldtranslate that commitment into concrete actions.Permit me at this juncture to share with theAssembly some thoughts about what could be theimportant priorities of the United Nations. Tanzania11would like to see a United Nations that continues to bethe guarantor of world peace and security  a UnitedNations that has the development agenda at the centreof its main objectives and activities and a UnitedNations that continues to fight for justice and equalityamong peoples and nations the world over.Strengthening and revitalizing the United Nationsis an imperative we all agreed to undertake almost adecade ago. We have done a remarkable job as regardsthe restructuring of the Secretariat and the UnitedNations agencies. It is regrettable that reform andrestructuring of the Security Council remain elusive. Aprocess started seven years ago has yet to bear thedesired result. The disturbing thing is the fact that insome quarters it no longer appears to be a prioritysubject.Tanzania believes that expansion of SecurityCouncil membership in both categories is as relevantand desirable today as it was seven years ago. Wewould like to reaffirm our support for the principle ofequitable representation of Member States on the basisof their geographical regions. In particular  we want toreiterate support for Africa’s request for two seats inthe permanent category. As the continent with thelargest portion of the membership of our Organization such a representation is well deserved. We also thinkthat the time has come to have a serious look at thecircumstances and modalities for invoking the use ofveto powers. We are of the view that the veto powershould be used in pursuit of global interests  and notnarrow national interests.At the Millennium Summit  world leadersemphasized that the development agenda shouldcontinue to be at the centre of the objectives andactivities of the United Nations. We know that theUnited Nations is not a major funding institution  butover the years it has been the moral force behind themany difficult decisions taken to address seriouseconomic issues. The United Nations organized severalforums where various development agenda items werediscussed and continue to be discussed  and decisionstaken. We want the United Nations to continue to dothat.In a period of global economic slow-down likethe one we are witnessing today  the task of forgingnew strategies to tackle the intractable problems ofpoverty  hunger  disease  deprivation andenvironmental degradation becomes very challengingindeed. We hope the current economic crisis will notlast long  because if it does its consequences may bebad for us all  especially the developing countries. Iwould also add that Africa  as a continent with 34 ofthe 48 least developed countries  will suffer the most.In view of this situation  this world body  donorcountries and least developed countries must mustercollective efforts to ensure that these problems andmany more are addressed collectively. I know thatthere can never be quick fixes to resolving suchproblems. However  building those kinds ofpartnerships is one thing that the United Nations shouldhelp realize.There is no doubt that for development to makesense in the context of the developing countries likeTanzania  the availability of official developmentassistance (ODA)  plus long-term capital flows andaccess to technology and markets of the developedcountries  are essential. These will have a catalytic rolein building domestic supply capacity.We are particularly concerned that the situationwith regard to availability of ODA is still notencouraging. Most developed countries are far frommeeting the target of contributing 0.7 per cent of theirgross domestic product to ODA  as agreed way back in1970 and reiterated at the 1992 Rio Summit. What ismore disturbing to us is the fact that the declinecontinues unabated despite numerous appeals. Mydelegation would once again like to use thisopportunity to call upon the developed countries tohonour this historic duty to mankind. We hope theUnited Nations will remain seized of the matter andexercise leadership.The flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) which is so essential for inducing growth in ournations  leaves much to be desired. So far  the flow ofFDI is not as we would have wanted or have expectedit to be.The painful part of this problem is the fact thatmany of our countries have done everything that hasbeen demanded of us in order to create a conduciveenvironment for FDI to flow  yet there is not much of itcoming. Take the example of my country  where wehave established  through an Act of Parliament  afinancial  legal and institutional framework asattractive and competitive as one would find anywherein the world. We have a sound macroeconomicenvironment; there is political stability; and good12governance and democracy are vibrant  yet foreigndirect investment flows are minimal.My country’s experience is the experience ofmany countries in the developing world. We are at aloss as to what else we have to do. Maybe someonewill volunteer to tell us. While we continue to appeal tothe developed countries to do more  we request theindulgence of the United Nations. In this regard  wewelcome and support the convening of theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment  to be held next March. We hope that thequestion of ODA and FDI will be given appropriateconsideration. I promise Tanzania’s full participation inthat Conference.Easy access by the developing countries to thetechnology and markets of the developed world couldcontribute immensely towards the alleviation andeventual eradication of poverty in the world. There areencouraging developments in the area of market access with initiatives such as the Africa Growth andOpportunity Act (AGOA)  which allows over 1 800products from countries of sub-Saharan Africa to enterthe United States market duty-free and quota-free  andthe Cotonou Agreement  which allows everything butarms from the countries of Africa  the Caribbean andthe Pacific to enter the European Union duty-free andquota-free.We hope the initiatives taken by Japan under theTokyo International Conference on AfricanDevelopment (TICAD) and by the People’s Republic ofChina under the China-Africa Cooperation Forum willgo a little further and offer opportunities similar tothose offered under AGOA and the CotonouAgreement. It is our sincere hope and expectation thatthe four aforementioned initiatives by the UnitedStates  the European Union  China and Japan will alsoease the difficulties experienced by our countries inaccessing the financial  scientific and technologicalresources available in those nations. While our nationswill continue to engage the developed countriesbilaterally or collectively in various forums  the UnitedNations should never lose sight of the need to help us.The problem of the external debt of developingcountries  and particularly of the least developedcountries  continues to pose a serious challenge to thedevelopment efforts of those countries. External debtservicing has been crowding out priority socialinvestments in our respective countries. In Tanzania for example  debt servicing averaged one-third of theentire Government’s budget. With another one-thirdspent on payment of salaries  the Government is leftwith only a third of the budget to perform its duties which range from maintaining law and order to theprovision of basic social and economic services. Thisclearly underscores the fact that debt relief and debtforgiveness for nations like mine will go a long waytowards enhancing Government capacity to dischargeits duties.In this regard  Tanzania welcomes the variousmeasures undertaken by the international communityaimed at dealing with this chronic debt problem. Ouronly concern is that  despite all these measures  thescope and magnitude of debt is continuing to build upto dangerous proportions. More surgical measuresshould therefore be taken to deal more effectively withthis crippling problem.Let me now turn to issues related to peace andsecurity. At the outset  let me state that it isheartwarming to see the Security Council moreengaged in the process of trying to tackle the crisis inthe Great Lakes region. The Government of Tanzania iscommitted to building a secure and stable Great Lakesregion. In this regard  I want to assure the UnitedNations that we will continue to play a positive role  aswe have been doing  in order to help the people ofBurundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congosecure and enjoy the peace which they so richlydeserve.It is encouraging to note that in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  despite difficulties  theimplementation of the Lusaka Agreement is on track.We are particularly glad that the inter-Congolesedialogue is under way. I would like to use thisopportunity to appeal to the parties to the conflict tostay the course. We also appeal to the Security Councilto remain seized of the matter  and to the internationalcommunity to extend the urgently needed financialresources to the facilitation of the dialogue.We welcome the installation of the TransitionalGovernment in Burundi. We hope that this historicevent  which marks the successful conclusion of longand arduous political negotiations  is also thebeginning of an irreversible process that will put anend to the long years of pain and suffering endured bythe people of Burundi. Indeed  the subregion continuesto work towards the cessation of hostilities and towards13ultimately securing a ceasefire agreement between therebels and the Government. In this respect  I would liketo take this opportunity to say three things.First  let me reiterate Tanzania’s previous callsfor the leaders of the Front for the Defence ofDemocracy (FDD) and the National Liberation Forces(FNL) to see reason and to join the Arusha process. Ibelieve that there is nothing they are fighting for whichhas not been discussed and decided upon in the ArushaAgreement. Even if they feel strongly that somethinghas been excluded  the Arusha Agreement providesopportunities for discussion of the same by the parties.Secondly  Tanzania promises its readiness towork with the new Government and to do all it can tohelp it succeed. We are ready to work with the newAdministration in Bujumbura and with the Front forDemocracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) to engage therebels and encourage them to join the ArushaAgreement.The third issue I would like to address relates tothe repatriation of Burundi refugees living in Tanzania.It need not be emphasized that the return of refugees totheir homeland is a crucial element in the healing andnormalization process in that troubled country. As hostto over 800 000 refugees from Burundi  Tanzaniaexpects repatriation of these refugees to be among thetop priority issues in the implementation of the ArushaAgreement. It is our sincere hope that  in that exercise the Office of the United Nations High Commissionerfor Refugees (UNHCR) will include not only the half amillion people in the camps that they manage inKigoma and Ngara  but also the earlier caseloads ofabout 300 000 they left to Tanzania to manage.It is sad that Savimbi and his renegade UNITAcontinue to be a menace in Angola. The United Nationsand the international community should do more tostop this menace. If action could be taken in Kosovoand Sierra Leone against criminal leaders  why not dothe same against Savimbi and UNITA? I believe it canbe done. Let us muster the political courage.With regard to Western Sahara  Tanzaniareiterates its long-held position that this is a question ofdecolonization and that the Sahrawi people have a rightto decide on their future through a referendum  asstipulated in the relevant Security Council resolutions.We fear that abandoning that path could lead tountoward events.It is regrettable that the situation in the MiddleEast remains volatile and explosive. It is our hope thatthe peace negotiations between Palestine and Israelwill be revived through a resolute commitment by allparties. The United Nations has a major role inensuring that the peace process gets back on track. Thecommitment made by President Bush on the creation ofthe state of Palestine on the basis of Security Councilresolutions is very reassuring. We hope this will befollowed through and that the United StatesGovernment will once again assume its leadership role.As host country to the International CriminalTribunal for Rwanda  we cannot but reiterate our callfor continued support for the Tribunal. It is gratifyingthat the Tribunal’s mission of bringing to justice thoseresponsible for the genocide in Rwanda is well underway. Contrary to previous negative publicity  theTribunal is increasingly obtaining the appreciation andcredit it deserves for its work.I would be remiss if I were to conclude myremarks without saying a word about the debilitatingdisease of HIV/AIDS. The impact of this worldwidescourge is not only a major scientific and medicalchallenge  but a threat to the very existence ofhumanity. Our leaders at the June special sessiondedicated to HIV/AIDS pronounced themselves on thisscourge and on their resolve to fight it. Let me expressour appreciation for the leadership role of the UnitedNations  particularly the Secretary-General’scommitment to combat this global crisis  from whichno corner of this world is safe.I believe that  with resolute political will  the waragainst this world pandemic is not insurmountable."
"175",7111,"UGA",56,2001,"﻿There is a lot of talkfloating around regarding some catchwords: the “newinternational order”  “globalization”  the “globalvillage” and so forth. All of these ebullient  self-gratifying positions are  apparently  due to the end ofthe cold war between the Western countries and theformer Soviet Union. Of course  the end of thedangerous and misguided rivalry between communismand capitalism is welcome and has  indeed  openedsome new opportunities  if fully utilized by allconcerned.However  it must be pointed out unequivocallythat many of the problems in the world today predatethe cold war; they predate the onset of communism inRussia in 1917. The slave trade started in the 1440salong the West African coast. A shift from bleedingAfrica through slavery to resident colonialism wasordained in Berlin in 1884. That was long beforecommunism took over in Russia. Therefore the coldwar could not have been responsible for these mistakesand for the complications they created  many of whichwe are still grappling with today  especially in Africa.Therefore  the euphoria that followed the end ofthe cold war was not wholly justified. The song aboutglobalization  as I have pointed out repeatedly  is not anew tune at all. Africans were globalized as slaves allover all over the world in the 1440s. My Christianname is Joel  actually a Jewish name  so I am alreadyglobalized. Many of my countrymen have got Arabnames like Azizi and Musa because they are Muslims.We were globalized long ago in Africa. Unfortunately though  that globalization movement was parasitic. Itwas a parasitic globalization movement; it was not asymbiotic globalization movement. Therefore the onlynew question we can legitimately and usefully ask is:Will the new phase of globalization be less parasiticand more symbiotic  or not? That is the question. Willthe new globalization be to everybody’s mutual benefit or will it be the old story of parasitism on a globalscale?The parasitism in the world is not the soleresponsibility of those who benefit from inequality.Even the victims have always contributed to theirmarginalization by their own wrong aims andmethods — before colonization  during colonizationand  even  after colonization. Myopic African chiefswere the main facilitators of the slave trade. Until veryrecently the Europeans did not possess thetechnological means to subdue the African continent asfar as means of transport — that is to say  railways —weapons or medicine were concerned. Without thefratricidal  brother-against-brother wars fomented byAfrican chiefs  neither the slave trade nor colonialismwould have been possible. We would have defeated thecolonialists and forced them  right from the beginning to cooperate with us to everybody’s mutual benefit.Weakness on the side of the potential victim alwaystempts the aggressor. The aggressor is alwaysencouraged by the weakness of the potential victim.9Even today  however  the authorship of theinequality among peoples is still a joint responsibilityof the victims — who in this case are Africans  Arabsand other marginalized peoples — of the parasiticglobalization movement that is now 500 years old  onthe one hand  and the beneficiaries of this hithertounequal and  in the past  evil movement  on the otherhand. Both the victims and the beneficiaries of theparasitic globalization movement are responsible forthis situation. The beneficiaries of the hitherto parasiticglobalization movement have been the NorthAmericans  the Europeans and the Japanese.For a variety of reasons  some formerly colonizedpeoples — such as the Indians  Indonesians  Pakistanis South-East Asians and Native Americans — andformerly semi-colonized peoples  such as the Chinese have made significant upward movements that arehelping  slowly but surely  to even out the balance ofpower in the world. Some other peoples  however  onaccount of a number of endogenous and exogenousfactors  are still living as the wretched of the Earth.Many Africans and some Arabs fall into this categoryof the still-unredeemed of the Earth. As I have said  theunredeemed are so categorized partly on account oftheir own internal mistakes — such as sectarianism xenophobia  unprincipled conflicts  the strangulation offree enterprise  the political balkanization of theirregions  the strangulation of political freedoms and soon — and partly on account of still very unfavourableexogenous factors. The most unfavourable such factoris the lack of access by these countries to markets inNorth America  the European Union  Japan  China India and Russia.The song about aid is meaningless without accessto markets. Aid without access to markets ismeaningless. All protectionism must end  especially inthe countries of the Organization for EconomicCooperation in Europe (OECD). Subsidies to thefarmers of Europe must end  if we are talking of aglobal village of symbiosis  and not parasitism. Icommend the American Government and PresidentGeorge Bush for the recent African Growth andOpportunity Act (AGOA) initiative. Although Ugandahas not yet benefited from AGOA on account of ourendogenous weaknesses  which have been accentuatedby the blurred views of our partners in the multilateralinstitutions  other African countries have startedbenefit  such as Kenya  Madagascar  Lesotho  Nigeriaand South Africa. This is good. The African Growthand Opportunity Act enunciated by the AmericanGovernment is the first good news I have heard in along time. The Americans are at last beginning tochange their image of being parasitic global villagers.The Europeans must catch up with the Americansin shedding this uncomplimentary label. Although theyhave talked about “everything but guns” going intoEurope from Africa  they are still giving subsidies toartificial farmers in Europe. As a consequence of the$1.2 trillion value of global trade in agriculturalproducts  Africa gets only about $20 billion — if therecent results of the African Growth and OpportunityAct (AGOA) are included; that is about 2 per cent ofthe total. So of the total value of agricultural trade Africa only gets 2 per cent. At the same time  thecountries of the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD) are spending$361 billion on artificial subsidies for farmers of thosecountries. Yet these are the countries that evangelize inthe name of free trade. The preachers of free trade arepractising incredibly expensive protectionism. What anunfortunate paradox. These double standards must end.Africa has removed some of the old impediments some of the old endogenous factors  to privateinvestment. The sanctity of private property is nowalmost a universal concept in Africa. Nationalization ofprivate enterprises is no more. Some of the Africancountries have a consistently stable macroeconomicframework. Inflation in Uganda is now negative 0.3 percent. The African currencies are now convertible; alarge part of Africa is very peaceful; infrastructure isreasonable; and democracy is widely practised inAfrica today. We are even addressing the issue of theexcessive political Balkanization of the continent which has 53 States  compared to 3 States in the wholeNorth American continent.We are handling this in a variety of ways including through economic blocs like the SouthernAfrica Development Community in southern Africa the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africain East and Central Africa and the EconomicCommunity of West African States in western Africa.The world needs to encourage these positive trends inAfrica by opening up their markets on a quota-free tariff-free basis. This will  ipso facto  forcemultinational investors to rush to Africa and investthere. They are already doing so just by the limitedAGOA measures by the Americans. With morecivilized aims and methods  balanced world10development is possible and desirable for everybody including OECD citizens who are forced to eat inferiorfoods and are taxed to protect those poor-quality foodsagainst better foods from Africa.Whenever I travel abroad  I pack my ownUgandan foods — milk  millet flour  fruits  legumes chicken  honey and plantain bananas  called matooke inour language. The other day  on my way here  mypineapple stocks ran out and my staff boughtpineapples from a supermarket in the United Kingdom.I took just one slice and terminated the whole exerciseat once. First of all  the pineapple was hard. I had neverseen a hard pineapple until I saw that one in London. Itwas less sweet and had an ammonia-like pungent taste.I had had the same experience in Washington once.They brought something they called a pineapple. Icould not believe it. Why must citizens of the worldendure these deprivations on account of policiesdesigned to serve narrow interests? Why must this be?I will not eat pineapple again until I go back toUganda.The oppressors  the colonialists and those whosought to control the destiny of others used barbaricmethods: genocide  forced labour  ethnocide and so on.It is amazing  therefore  that some of those who claimto be fighting for the liberation of oppressed peoplesalso use barbaric means such as terrorism. In theongoing debate on terrorism I have not heard anybodybothering to define the difference between a freedomfighter and a terrorist. What is the difference between afreedom fighter and a terrorist? Mzee NelsonMandela — “Mzee” means someone who is dignifiedand elderly — was a freedom fighter until recently.Was he a terrorist? Not at all. Did anyone hear that Mr.Mandela had hijacked a plane or planted a bomb in arestaurant? But Mr. Mandela was a freedom fighter. Hewas not a terrorist. The difference between a terroristand a freedom fighter lies in the fact that while afreedom fighter sometimes may be forced to useviolence  he cannot use indiscriminate violence. Theperson who uses indiscriminate violence is a terrorist.A freedom fighter may sometimes be forced to useviolence.I was forced to use violence against Idi Amin.But I never hijacked a plane. It was never heard thatMuseveni hijacked a plane or planted a bomb in a bar.People in bars are not politicians. Some of them just gothere to make merry. What kind of revolutionary issomeone who kills such people? The person who usesindiscriminate violence is a terrorist. A terrorist doesnot differentiate between combatants and non-combatants  between civilians and servicemen andbetween armed servicemen and unarmed servicemen.Even if someone is a soldier  if he is off duty  he shouldnot be attacked  if one claims to be a freedom fighter.He should not be attacked. It is against the laws of war.The terrorist fights a war without declaring one. That iswhy terrorists hijack planes  plant bombs in populatedcentres and so forth.We normally get technical advice from other partsof the world. The Europeans always come to give ustechnical advice. I would like to give you technicaladvice about freedom-fighting. We have done very wellin that. In Africa  since 1961  we have fought wars ofliberation in Mozambique against the Portuguese; inAngola against the Portuguese; in Guinea-Bissauagainst the Portuguese; in Zimbabwe against minoritywhites; in South Africa against minority whites; inNamibia against minority whites; and in Ugandaagainst Idi Amin. There was a criminal called Idi Aminwhom we had to fight. However  we never usedterrorism. This is on the record. We always foughtcombatant to combatant. Quite a number of times ourcomrades used mass action: strikes  demonstrations petitions  diplomatic struggle and so on. Not a singleplane was hijacked by African freedom fighters although there were anti-colonial wars in all thesecountries.Terrorist actions are misguided and criminal andmust be opposed by all as a matter of principle. Africawas beginning to benefit from AGOA  the measuretaken by the Americans to open their markets to ourgoods. Business has  however  now somewhat slumpedin America. Therefore  the terrorists  who claim to befighting for the Palestinian cause  are objectivelyhurting the interests of Africans  who have always beenthe allies of the Palestinians. This is counter-productive. The terrorists have also tried to polarize theworld  pitting Moslems against Christians. This iserroneous and unacceptable. Exploitation knows noboundaries and cuts across all races and religions.Exploiters are found in all religions and races. TheArabs had to oppose Turkish imperialism. Yet both theArabs and the Turks were Muslims. Why  then  didthey have to oppose each other? One of the monsters ofthe last century  Idi Amin  of my country  was aMuslim. We had to get rid of him to liberate everybody including the Muslims  in Uganda. War has been going11on in the Sudan for decades. Elements that claim to beacting in the name of Islam have been the ones takingthe wrong position in this conflict  seeking hegemonyover God’s people.I  therefore  support the position of the UnitedStates on this occasion  as we did in the Gulf War  infighting and defeating these reactionaries  who profanethe name of freedom fighters. If necessary  all countriesof the world opposed to terrorism should contributetroops and finish the job quickly. The coalition againstterrorism should be regarded in the same way as thecoalition against fascism in the 1930s and 1940s.Nevertheless  the just aspirations of thePalestinian people and of other oppressed peoples  likethe people of southern Sudan  must be supported sothat we can get peaceful resolutions to these conflicts. Iwelcome freedom and equality for all peoples of theworld. Those who strive to dominate or exploit othershave illegitimate ambitions. We now have a chance tobuild a new  just world. The free will of all peoplesshould be ensured. In addition  the most importantinstrument of emancipation  free trade  should giveAfrican goods quota- and tariff-free access to themarkets of the countries of the Organization forCooperation and Development (OECD) and vice versa.Africa is beginning to tame its conflicts. Theconflict in Lesotho was resolved by an Africanmechanism. Recently  the Arusha Agreement on Peaceand Reconciliation ended the conflict in Burundi. It ispossible to resolve our age-old problems and finallybecome part of the new world order rather than merespectators of the process."
"176",7158,"UKR",56,2001,"﻿Allow me at the outset tocongratulate the President of the General Assembly atits fifty-sixth session  Mr. Han Seung-soo  on hiselection to that important and responsible post. Onbehalf of the Ukrainian delegation  I would like toassure him of our full support and to wish him everysuccess in his work. I take this opportunity also toexpress our appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. HarriHolkeri  whose political wisdom and diplomatic skillenabled the Assembly to achieve important results atits fifty-fifth session.A year ago  at the Millennium Summit  we  therepresentatives of the nations of the world  were seenas heralds of a new age. At that memorable gathering the United Nations heard words that gave humanityhope for a new and just model of international relationsin the new century: freedom  equality  solidarity tolerance and mutual responsibility. Those fundamentalvalues enshrined in the Millennium Declarationoutlined the path that the peoples of the world willfollow in the new era.However  while striving to breathe the fresh air ofthe future  we instead swallowed a mouthful of ashesand dust. On 11 September the modern world wasbrutally wounded. The death of innocent peopleshocked all those who cherish the universal values oflife and freedom.The terrorist acts that took place in the UnitedStates demonstrated that the philosophy of hatred which has no religious  ethnic or linguistic affiliation has become one of the key challenges of thecontemporary world. This threat requires an urgent andclear international reaction.Ukraine shares the pain of the American peopleand fully supports the resolve of the United Stateseffectively to stand against the perpetrators  patronsand instigators of those terrorist acts.We joined the global anti-terrorist coalitionwithout any hesitation because we recognize the needto unite the efforts of the international community tocounter new threats.The military campaign in Afghanistan  whichtargets the core of international terrorism  is the firststage  and a necessary element  of these efforts. It isalso evident  however  that the Afghan people  wholive in a state of permanent humanitarian crisis  havebecome hostages to terrorism. As a result  this crisiscannot be brought to an end without consistent politicaland diplomatic efforts aimed at finding a solution.Ukraine welcomes the activities of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative  LakhdarBrahimi  and supports their constructive contribution tothe stabilization of the situation in Afghanistan.We are convinced that efforts to furtherstrengthen and improve international legal mechanismsfor combating terrorism should also be given apowerful political impetus. In this context  the speedyconclusion of work on the draft comprehensiveconvention on terrorism takes on special importance.I am also pleased to mention that the proposal ofmy country to convene a ministerial meeting of theSecurity Council to discuss further steps in the globalresponse to international terrorism was unanimouslysupported by the members of the Council. There is nodoubt that  in the course of such a meeting  vital steps42will be taken to identify key means and methods ofcombating terrorism.We also maintain that there is a need for properinstitutional arrangements to coordinate andcomplement the individual efforts of Member States incombating international terrorism and to ensure that thelegal instruments we have elaborated are implementedin the most efficient manner possible. Any entity ofthis sort should not become just another bureaucraticbody  but  rather  should be an effective mechanism forcontributing to the consolidation of internationalefforts in this area.To honour the memory of the thousands who haveperished in terrorist attacks and to further unite ourefforts in fighting the scourge of terrorism  I would liketo propose  on behalf of the Government of Ukraine  todeclare 11 September a United Nations day to combatinternational terrorism. I hope that this proposal will besupported by the General Assembly  which would thenestablish this day as a symbol of our remembrance unity and resolve.Ukraine welcomes the decision taken this year bythe Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the PeacePrize to the United Nations and to its Secretary-General  Kofi Annan. He is exactly the kind of leaderthe United Nations needs today as it faces new globalchallenges.Are we ready to stand up to these newchallenges? Have we fully realized that thedeterioration of the situation in the world is due to theexisting  deep-rooted international inequality? And finally  how will the fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly be remembered — as a session that put anend to the age of illusions  or as a forum thatconsolidated the United Nations family?The United Nations is entering a new period of itshistory. Ukraine is deeply convinced that  from astrategic perspective  the strengthening of the status ofthe United Nations as the core of the modern system ofinternational relations should become the primary taskof this Organization.The terrorist acts in the United States have unitedand consolidated the international community. Why hasit taken the tragic loss of thousands of innocent livesfor it to realize that there is a vital need for unity ofaction on its part?We believe that the essence of United Nationsleadership lies in ensuring an effective response to thenew challenges to security at both the global andregional levels. This role  however  cannot be playedeffectively if we do not improve the existing model ofdecision-making and implementation at theinternational level.That is why my country actively supports thereform of the Security Council. We see this reform notas a weakening of the foundations of the Council'swork  but  on the contrary  as a move that willstrengthen them  by ensuring that they better reflect therealities of the modern world.This year  Ukraine is completing its term as amember of the Security Council. I believe that theexperience we have gained will contribute to advancingthe process of change. We will consistently advocatethe need to improve the Security Council's methods ofwork and to enlarge its membership. As a CentralEuropean nation  Ukraine will actively lobby for anadditional seat on the Council for this region.In our view  special attention should also be paidto the philosophy of United Nations peacekeepingactivities and to the problem of sanctions. For manyyears  Ukraine — which today is among the 10 largesttroop contributors to United Nations peacekeepingmissions — has consistently supported thedevelopment of effective United Nations preventivemechanisms.At the Millennium and Security Council summitslast year  the President of Ukraine  Leonid Kuchma emphasized the need for the elaboration of a UnitedNations strategy for comprehensive conflict preventionbased on the wide use of preventive diplomacy.I am pleased to note that the recommendations onconflict prevention put forward by Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan in his June report echo the proposal madeby the President of Ukraine. We believe that the UnitedNations possesses the necessary experience andresources for the enhancement of its role in this field in particular through the establishment of regionalcentres to monitor potential areas of conflict  as well asthrough the more active use of preventive deploymentoperations.Concerning the issue of sanctions  we are infavour of the elaboration of a well-balancedmethodology for their imposition  implementation and43lifting. This critical lever of influence should not beturned into a political boomerang.We are also convinced of the overriding need tofurther consolidate international efforts towards armscontrol  disarmament and the non-proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction. On the basis of a realisticassessment of the potential of the Conference onFacilitating the Entry into Force of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  we hope that it willresult in an increase in the number of parties to thisTreaty  which was ratified by Ukraine last year.I would also like to mention that next monthUkraine will complete the implementation of the third and last  phase of strategic weapons destruction underthe START Treaty. On 30 October  Ukraine destroyedits last intercontinental ballistic missile silo. In thatway we turned one of the important pages in thehistory of nuclear disarmament. We are ready tocontinue to make our contribution to secure theeffectiveness of the system of strategic stability in theworld.Ukraine supports further development by theUnited Nations of a universal approach to the issues ofensuring sustainable development and eradicatingpoverty in the world. We hope that the outcome of theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment will be a practical step in mobilizingnational and international resources to solve theseproblems.We also intend to take practical steps to resolve aset of environmental protection issues. As a countrythat still suffers the pain of the Chernobyl tragedy Ukraine counts on the further active involvement of theUnited Nations Development Programme and otheroperational bodies of the Organization in the process ofeliminating the long-term consequences of this disaster.Ukraine considers that cultural and spiritualdisasters are no less destructive than natural ones. Thecultural mosaic of the world is the most precious anddelicate treasure granted to humanity. Ukraine has thehonour to be one of the sponsors of the GeneralAssembly draft resolution on the proclamation of theyear 2002 as the United Nations year for the protectionof the world’s cultural heritage  and calls on theinternational community to support this initiative.Vigorous work to protect humanity’s historical andcultural heritage is not only a vital necessity  it is alsoour moral responsibility to past and future generations.The year 2001 is an anniversary year for ourcountry. On 24 August Ukraine celebrated the firstdecade of its independence. These have been 10 yearsof complex processes. The main result has beenUkraine’s consolidation as a peaceful and independentEuropean State. We have achieved sustainableeconomic growth as a result of consistent reforms  andmy country is an active participant in Europeanregional processes.Ukraine is contributing to the settlement of theso-called frozen conflicts  specifically in Abkhazia Georgia  and Transdniestria  Moldova. As a member ofGroup of Friends of the Secretary-General for Georgia Ukraine is concerned over the slow pace of theGeorgia-Abkhaz peace process.Ukraine takes an active stand concerning thesettlement of the situation in the Republic ofMacedonia. The resolution of the centuries-old Balkanproblem is an ambitious and urgent task for Europe inthe new century.We also note with concern the escalation oftensions in the Middle East during the past year. Theentire history of the conflict in the Middle East provesthat its vicious circle can be broken only throughrenouncing violence and reviving mutual trust andtolerance between the sides to the conflict.The United Nations is beginning a new andcomplicated period of its activities. It is up to us todetermine how the Untied Nations comes out of itsencounter with the new challenges  united or divided. Ibelieve that the wisdom of this forum  which has beennurtured through decades of hard and responsible work should serve to guarantee an optimistic scenario."
"177",7205,"URY",56,2001,"﻿Iwant first of all to stress that  under the currentcircumstances  our presence — everybody’spresence — at this general debate unquestionably takeson special significance.Every year  the United Nations prepares andsubmits to Member States for their consideration acomprehensive agenda containing many items of variedscope and nature. This session is no exception: theUnited Nations will not stop.Yet  many things now appear completelydifferent. The city of New York  the United States andevery country  and the people of the United States andevery people — all of humankind — have been cruellyattacked by terrorism  and its threat hangs over everyone of us and over natural and peaceful relationsamong the peoples of the world. In short  this is aglobal phenomenon that demands of us a global answerand that has marked the start of the new millennium.The nations of my continent believe that to be so. Thestatements made by the Presidents of Brazil and ofMexico  which I endorse  made that perfectly clear.The Millennium Summit  which brought ustogether here last year  provided an opportunity for usto identify the issues that affect us all and that we mustface as part of a challenge that no one can avoid. It19defined an agenda of peace and hope for a worldaffected by common problems  although  it must besaid  in different ways.Today  we face a new scenario. Perhaps as neverbefore  all of us  and hence the United Nations  have acommon goal: to respond to terrorism  irrespective ofboundaries  ideologies  religions  races and cultures.That commitment  undertaken with responsibility involves taking every possible action without everforgetting the higher goal: peace  whose supremeguarantee must continue to be international law and theconventions and treaties to which we are parties.But there is no doubt that such a commitment isnot enough. We must fight every form of terrorism atevery level  domestic and international  and on everyfront — legal  military  security and intelligence administrative and management. This demands of usstrong conviction  confidence in our shared values faith in humankind and the affirmation of life as thehighest value.Terrorism is blind and wicked by definition.Blind because it does not conceive or communicategoals shared by the rest and so plunges intoirrationality. Wicked because it indiscriminatelydestroys people and property and sows fear  anxietyand sometimes panic.Nevertheless  to fight it it will also be necessaryto move against other enemies of peace  such aspoverty and underdevelopment  to give every persongood reason to live and to make all of us guardians ofhumankind  which is a common good from which noone must feel excluded  and for which we must fightunwaveringly.There is no cause or banner that could justify thisviolence. That is precisely why we must preventmarginalization  helplessness and desperation fromtaking root in people’s souls so that they lookapprovingly and complacently on the criminal actionsof which we are victims.Our task  then  is to galvanize everyone’s spirit inthe struggle against terrorism  because terrorism notonly fails to help solve the problems afflicting societyas a whole but also fills it with fear and plunges it intoparalysis and confusion.We move with ever greater determination towardsa world and  consequently  towards a society that isevidently more and more globalized. The events of 11September demonstrate that very clearly. Every peopleand every Government has been affected by thoseevents.We are all involved in what happens  in a moreprofound way than ever  because what happened notonly affects the security of the people; it raisesquestions that are much simpler  but the answers towhich are complex: what are all of our lives going tobe like from now on? What is the life of my familygoing to be like? Of my children? Of my parents? Andof the others  my neighbours  my friends? How will thesimple acts of my life change? Will I be able to travel receive letters  use transportation and cross bridges —without second thoughts  as was natural to us before?This world and  in particular  the United Nationsface a challenge for which they are not duly prepared.We have created the technological and communicationmeans to unify the planet and globalize it. But weneither know how nor have the proper instruments toproperly manage this process.We are living through an amazing revolution  andit must be guided — driving it forward if it stalls limiting it if it goes too far — in order to achieve thegoals enabling the structuring of a new  balancedinternational system that takes into account the changesthat have occurred for humankind over the last 50years.The United Nations was born as a response to aworld that today no longer exists. The instruments andinstitutions it created in the past were a response topast realities — replaced today by new realities — inthe political  demographic  cultural  religious andecological spheres.All the many countries that make up this globalsociety and that  together  navigate through space  havethe obligation of confronting this new reality  drawingon our diversity.Uruguay  a small country  but one with a longinternational tradition — it was a participant in the1907 Hague Conference to implement arbitration as themethod for resolving conflicts  a member of the Leagueof Nations and a founding Member of the UnitedNations in San Francisco — feels that this is ourcurrent situation  and we are ready to shoulder our dueshare of responsibility.In the past  we created international financial andmonetary institutions  and others for international20trade  such as the World Trade Organization  which ismeeting today in Doha. All these institutions governour activities and determine what we must do. But theynever act in concert. While the world is global  theirdecisions are sectoral or singular.While loans are granted to us or fiscal ormonetary adjustments are required of us  the doors tomarkets do not at the same time open to our productsand our labour. This way  instead of participating in theprocess of globalization  we are closed in nearly sealedcompartments. Those who have attained a certain levelof growth grow even more  while the rest  save a fewexceptions  suffer losses and fall further away from thelevels that would make it possible to enjoy thenecessary prosperity.Today the planet has 6 billion inhabitants. Only1.1 billion of them live in developed areas. In 2050  notlong from now — my grandchildren will not yet havereached my age — the planet will have 9.3 billioninhabitants  but still only 1.1 billion will live indeveloped areas.Poverty not only destroys democracy. What isworse  it destroys societies and paves the way forviolence and  as we have often seen  even in our midst all forms of terrorism.Finally  we consider it appropriate to repeat thatwe are far from holding the answer necessary for theworld we have created.We might not have spoken aloud these thoughtsthat assuredly many of us have always had  had it notbeen for the thousands of innocent women and menthat died on that ill-fated 11 September. We owe tothem — whom Americans will always remember withlove and grief  feelings we also share — our mostimportant responsibility: to see to it that they did notdie in vain.Their tragic fate has shown us our duty. Now it istime to do it."
"178",7252,"USA",56,2001,"﻿We meet in a Hall devoted topeace; in a city scarred by violence; in a nationawakened to danger; in a world uniting for a longstruggle. Every civilized nation here today is resolvedto keep the most basic commitment of civilization. Wewill defend ourselves and our future against terror andlawless violence.The United Nations was founded in this cause. Inthe Second World War  we learned that there is noisolation from evil. We affirmed that some crimes areso terrible they offend humanity itself  and we resolvedthat the aggressions and ambitions of the wicked mustbe opposed early  decisively and collectively  beforethey threaten us all.That evil has returned  and that cause is renewed.A few miles from here  many thousands still lie in atomb of rubble. Tomorrow  the Secretary-General  thePresident of the General Assembly and I will visit thatsite  where the names of every nation and region thatlost citizens will be read aloud. If we were to read outthe names of every person who died  it would takemore than three hours.Those names include a citizen of the Gambia whose wife spent their fourth wedding anniversary  12September  searching in vain for her husband. Thosenames include a man who supported his wife inMexico  sending home money every week. Thosenames include a young Pakistani who prayed towardsMecca five times a day and who died that day trying tosave others.The suffering of 11 September was inflicted onpeople of many faiths and many nations. All of thevictims  including Muslims  were killed with equalindifference and equal satisfaction by the terroristleaders.The terrorists are violating the tenets of everyreligion  including the one they invoke. Last week  thesheikh of Al-Azhar University  the world’s oldestIslamic institution of higher learning  declared thatterrorism is a disease and that Islam prohibits killinginnocent civilians. The terrorists call their cause holy yet they fund it with drug dealing. They encouragemurder and suicide in the name of a great faith thatforbids both. They dare to ask God’s blessing as theyset out to kill innocent men  women and children. But8the God of Isaac and Ishmael would never answer sucha prayer. And a murderer is not a martyr; he is just amurderer.Time is passing. Yet for the United States ofAmerica  there will be no forgetting 11 September. Wewill remember every rescuer who died in honour. Wewill remember every family that lives in grief. We willremember the fire and ash  the last phone calls  thefunerals of the children.And the people of my country will rememberthose who have plotted against us. We are learningtheir names. We are coming to know their faces. Thereis no corner of the Earth distant or dark enough toprotect them. However long it takes  their hour ofjustice will come.Every nation has a stake in this cause. As wemeet  the terrorists are planning more murder —perhaps in my country  or perhaps  fellow members  inyours. They kill because they aspire to dominate. Theyseek to overthrow Governments and to destabilizeentire regions. Last week  anticipating this meeting ofthe General Assembly  they denounced the UnitedNations; they called our Secretary-General a criminaland they condemned all Arab nations here as traitors toIslam. Few countries meet their exacting standards ofbrutality and oppression. Every other country is apotential target.And all the world faces the most horrifyingprospect of all: those same terrorists are searching forweapons of mass destruction  the tools to turn theirhatred into holocaust. They can be expected to usechemical  biological and nuclear weapons the momentthey are capable of doing so. No hint of consciencewould prevent it. That threat cannot be ignored; thatthreat cannot be appeased. Civilization itself — thecivilization we share — is threatened. History willrecord our response and will judge or justify everynation in this Hall.The civilized world is now responding. We act todefend ourselves and to deliver our children from afuture of fear. We choose the dignity of life over aculture of death. We choose lawful change and civildisagreement over coercion  subversion and chaos.Those commitments — hope and order  law and life —unite people across cultures and continents. Upon thosecommitments depend all peace and progress. For thosecommitments  we are determined to fight.The United Nations has risen to thisresponsibility: on 12 September  these buildingsopened for emergency meetings of the GeneralAssembly and of the Security Council. Before the sunhad set  these attacks on the world stood condemned bythe world  and I want to thank you  fellow members for that strong and principled stand.I also thank the Arab and Islamic countries thathave condemned terrorist murder. Many of you haveseen the destruction of terror in your own lands. Theterrorists are increasingly isolated by their own hatredand extremism. They cannot hide behind Islam. Theauthors of mass murder and their allies have no placein any culture  and no home in any faith.The conspiracies of terror are being answered byan expanding global coalition. Not every nation will bepart of every action against the enemy. But everynation in our coalition has duties. Those duties can bedemanding  as we in America are learning. We havealready made adjustments in our laws and in our dailylives. We are taking new measures to investigate terrorand to protect against threats.The leaders of all nations must now carefullyconsider their responsibilities and their future. Terroristgroups such as Al Qaeda depend upon the aid orindifference of Governments. They need the support ofa financial infrastructure and safe havens to train andplan and hide.Some nations want to play their part in the fightagainst terror but tell us they lack the means to enforcetheir laws and control their borders. We stand ready tohelp.Some Governments still turn a blind eye to theterrorists  hoping the threat will pass them by. They aremistaken.And some Governments  while pledging touphold the principles of the United Nations  have casttheir lot with the terrorists. They support them andharbour them. And they will find that their welcomedguests are parasites that will weaken them andeventually consume them. For every regime thatsponsors terror there is a price to be paid  and it will bepaid. The allies of terror are equally guilty of murderand equally accountable to justice.The Taliban are now learning that lesson. Thatregime and the terrorists who support it are nowvirtually indistinguishable. Together they promote9terror abroad and impose a reign of terror on theAfghan people. Women are executed in Kabul’s soccerstadium. They can be beaten for wearing socks that aretoo thin. Men are jailed for missing prayer meetings.The United States  supported by many nations  isbringing justice to the terrorists in Afghanistan. We aremaking progress against military targets — and that isour objective. Unlike the enemy  we seek to minimize not maximize  the loss of innocent life. I am proud ofthe honourable conduct of the American military. Andmy country grieves for all the suffering the Talibanhave brought upon Afghanistan  including the terribleburden of war.The Afghan people do not deserve their presentrulers. Years of Taliban misrule have brought nothingbut misery and starvation. Even before this currentcrisis  4 million Afghans depended on food from theUnited States and other nations  and millions ofAfghans were refugees from Taliban oppression.I make this promise to all the victims of thatregime: the Taliban’s days of harbouring terrorists  anddealing in heroin  and brutalizing women are drawingto a close. When that regime is gone  the people ofAfghanistan will say  with the rest of the world  goodriddance.I can promise  too  that America will join theworld in helping the people of Afghanistan rebuildtheir country.Many nations  including mine  are sending foodand medicine to help Afghans through the winter.America has airdropped over 1.3 million packages ofrations in Afghanistan. Just this week  we airlifted20 000 blankets and over 200 tons of provisions intothe region. We continue to provide humanitarian aid even while the Taliban try to steal the food we send.More help  eventually  will be needed. TheUnited States will work closely with the UnitedNations and development banks to reconstructAfghanistan after hostilities there have ceased and theTaliban are no longer in control. And the United Stateswill work with the United Nations to support a post-Taliban Government that represents all of the Afghanpeople.In this war of terror  each of us must answer forwhat we have done or what we have left undone. Aftertragedy  there is a time for sympathy and condolence.My country has been very grateful for both.The memorials and vigils around the world willnot be forgotten. But the time for sympathy has nowpassed. The time for action has now arrived.The most basic obligations in this new conflicthave already been defined by the United Nations. On28 September  the Security Council adopted resolution1373 (2001). Its requirements are clear: everyUnited Nations Member has a responsibility to crackdown on terrorist financing. We must pass all necessarylaws in our own countries to allow the confiscation ofterrorist assets. We must apply those laws to everyfinancial institution in every nation.We have a responsibility to share intelligence andcoordinate the efforts of law enforcement. If you knowsomething  tell us. If we know something  we will tellyou. And when we find the terrorists  we must worktogether to bring them to justice.We have a responsibility to deny any sanctuary safe haven  or transit to terrorists. Every knownterrorist camp must be shut down  its operatorsapprehended  and evidence of their arrest presented tothe United Nations.We have a responsibility to deny weapons toterrorists — and to actively prevent private citizensfrom providing them.These obligations are urgent  and they are bindingon every nation with a place in this Hall. ManyGovernments are taking these obligations seriously and my country appreciates it. Yet even beyondresolution 1373 (2001)  more is required — and moreis expected — of our coalition against terror. We areasking for a comprehensive commitment to this fight.We must unite in opposing all terrorists  not justsome of them. In this world  there are good causes andbad causes  and we may disagree on where that line isdrawn. Yet there is no such thing as a good terrorist.No national aspiration  no remembered wrong  can everjustify the deliberate murder of the innocent. AnyGovernment that rejects this principle — trying to pickand choose its terrorist friends — will know theconsequences.We must speak the truth about terror. Let us nevertolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning theattacks of 11 September — malicious lies that attemptto shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves away from the guilty. To inflame ethnic hatred is toadvance the cause of terror.10The war against terror must not serve as anexcuse to persecute ethnic and religious minorities inany country. Innocent people must be allowed to livetheir own lives  by their own customs  under their ownreligion. And every nation must have avenues for thepeaceful expression of opinion and dissent. When theseavenues are closed  the temptation to speak throughviolence grows.We must press on with our agenda for peace andprosperity in every land. My country is pledged toencouraging development and expanding trade. Mycountry is pledged to investing in education andcombating AIDS and other infectious diseases aroundthe world. Following 11 September  these pledges areeven more important. In our struggle against hatefulgroups that exploit poverty and despair  we must offeran alternative of opportunity and hope.The American Government also stands by itscommitment to a just peace in the Middle East. We areworking towards a day when two States — Israel andPalestine — live peacefully together  within secure andrecognized borders  as called for by the SecurityCouncil resolutions. We will do all in our power tobring both parties back into negotiations. But peacewill come only when all have sworn off — forever —incitement  violence and terror.Finally  this struggle is a defining moment for theUnited Nations itself — and the world needs itsprincipled leadership. It undermines the credibility ofthis great institution  for example  when theCommission on Human Rights offers seats to some ofthe world’s most persistent violators of human rights.The United Nations depends  above all  on its moralauthority — and that authority must be preserved.The steps I have described will not be easy. Forall nations  they will require effort. For some nations they will require great courage. Yet the cost of inactionis far greater. The only alternative to victory is anightmare world where every city is a potential killingfield.As I told the American people  freedom and fearare at war. We face enemies that hate not our policies but our existence — the tolerance of openness and thecreative culture that define us. But the outcome of thisconflict is certain.There is a current in history  and it runs towardsfreedom. Our enemies resent it and dismiss it  but thedreams of mankind are defined by liberty — the naturalright to create  and build  and worship  and live indignity. When men and women are released fromoppression and isolation  they find fulfilment and hope and they leave poverty by the millions. Theseaspirations are lifting up the peoples of Europe  Asia Africa and the Americas  and they can lift up all of theIslamic world. We stand for the permanent hopes ofhumanity  and those hopes will not be denied.We are confident  too  that history has an author who fills time and eternity with his purpose. We knowthat evil is real  but good will prevail against it. This isthe teaching of many faiths. And in that assurance  wegain strength for a long journey.It is our task — the task of this generation — toprovide the response to aggression and terror. We haveno other choice  because there is no other peace. Wedid not ask for this mission  yet there is honour inhistory’s call. We have a chance to write the story ofour times — a story of courage defeating cruelty  andlight overcoming darkness. This calling is worthy ofany life  and worthy of every nation. So let us goforward — confident  determined and unafraid."
"179",7275,"UZB",56,2001,"﻿Allow me to convey our sincere congratulations toMr. Kofi Annan on the occasion of his re-election tothe post of Secretary-General  as well as on winningthe Nobel Peace Prize for 2001. We also congratulateMr. Han Seung-soo on his election as President of theGeneral Assembly at the current session and we jointhose who have already expressed gratitude toMr. Harri Holkeri for his excellent organization of thefifty-fifth session  which went down in the history ofinternational relations as the Millennium Assembly.This session of the General Assembly is takingplace in special circumstances. There is no doubt thatthe tragic events of 11 September represent anobjective reality that has prompted the internationalcommunity to critically reassess the situation  whichrequires the elaboration of common positions in thecombat against international terrorism  based on theprovisions of the United Nations Charter onsafeguarding comprehensive peace and security.Today  it is evident that terrorism is related toextremism of every stripe — political  religious andethnic — as well as to separatism and drug trafficking.These are the principle threats to the present and futureof humankind  a plague of the twenty-first century thatcan enter any household. No one carries insuranceagainst this evil.The international community is becomingincreasingly aware of the indivisibility of security. Inaccordance with this fundamental principle and in viewof the current international situation  Uzbekistancommits itself to go all the way in its fight againstterrorism as a global phenomenon. Only through joint coordinated efforts of the entire internationalcommunity can we eradicate this evil. No one has theright to stand aloof from this battle.We are acutely aware that  today  it is absolutelyunacceptable to content ourselves with meredeclarations and statements. It is time we supported ourwords with action. Before it is too late  we must takethis opportunity to quit the cautious and defensivestance adopted in the struggle against internationalterrorism and to go on the offensive.Such an approach is also dictated by a simple andobvious truth: it is impossible to come to an agreementwith terrorists. Not only modern experience incombating terrorism but also the experience of historyattest to this fact. The only way to deal with terroristsis to isolate them and stand up to them in the mostuncompromising and resolute way.Given the nature of international terrorism and itsextensive organizational and financial network as wellas its considerable material and technical resources  itis essential to devise a global counter-terrorist strategythat will clearly define the following: first  theparameters of an effective legal framework as well asthe organizational foundations for internationalcooperation in this area; and secondly  forms ofconcrete joint action at both the global and regionallevels as well as on a bilateral basis.Recent events have demonstrated clearly thatterrorism is the most dangerous and treacherous enemy13of the international community. I think it may berelevant to remind Members of the address that thePresident of the Republic of Uzbekistan  Mr. Karimov made to the General Assembly on 8 September 2000from this rostrum. He sounded the alarm  trying todraw the attention of the international community tothe“... war in Afghanistan  which has continued formore than 20 years ... Afghanistan has become atraining ground and hotbed of internationalterrorism and extremism  and the main source andthe warehouse of world drug production  whichearns billions of dollars and fuels internationalterrorism.” (A/55/PV.7  p. 15)He also emphasized that this is “a threat to the securitynot only of the States of Central Asia  but of the wholeworld”. He unambiguously pointed to the particulardanger that the world would face if the terrorists wereto gain access to deadly weapons such as chemical biological and other forms of weapons of massdestruction. Here it is pertinent to ask: Was this not atimely appeal?Uzbekistan has been actively engaged incooperation with the anti-terrorist coalition. Weconsider the anti-terrorist operation in Afghanistan as first and foremost  a means to destroy the terroristbases and camps in that country as well as to eradicateconditions favourable to terrorist activity.The Uzbek people  being heirs to the greatMuslim culture and having made a major contributionto the development and flourishing of Islamiccivilization  realize that this operation is not directedagainst either the people of Afghanistan or the religionof Islam. War has been declared against terrorists andtheir centres and training grounds  not against thepeaceful population.Uzbekistan and Afghanistan have a long historyof neighbourly and mutually beneficial relations goingback to antiquity. The Amu Darya River has alwaysunited us  not separated us. Uzbekistan has never had aconflict either with the Afghan people or withAfghanistan as a State.The civil war in Afghanistan  which hascontinued for three decades and reached its apogeeduring the short period of Taliban rule  has destroyedthe country’s economy and caused the Afghan peoplegreat distress  and it is a threat to the very existence ofAfghanistan as an unified State. We support the effortsof the international community aimed at immediatemeasures to adopt large-scale programmes for the post-conflict rehabilitation of Afghanistan and concretehumanitarian aid for those who urgently need suchassistance in their plight.Uzbekistan  in close collaboration with theUnited Nations  is already actively participating in thedelivery of international humanitarian aid toAfghanistan. For this purpose  we have provided all thenecessary infrastructure  including that in the city ofTermez  in immediate proximity to the border ofAfghanistan.Finally  in light of the latest events  includingboth the acts of terror in the United States and the startof the anti-terrorist operation in Afghanistan  I wouldlike to draw the attention of participants in this sessionto the Uzbek proposal to establish within the UnitedNations system an international centre to combatterrorism as a realistic mechanism for taking acollective stand against terrorist aggression.In discussing the organization of the internationalstruggle against terrorism  we should not forget yetanother equally dangerous threat — drug trafficking the main financial support for terrorist and extremistactivities. In recent years  the States of Central Asiahave found themselves practically face to face withlarge-scale aggression unleashed by the internationalnarcotics syndicates. It is perfectly clear that no singlecountry  no matter how powerful its resources  canhope to confront drug trafficking successfully unless itenjoys the broad support of the internationalcommunity. In our view  international cooperationshould be based on mechanisms that are adapted asmuch as possible to the current situation and arecapable not only of neutralizing existing sources ofnarco-aggression but also  and more important  ofpreventing them from emerging.Recognizing the urgent need to intensify theinternational struggle to face common threats Uzbekistan accords great significance to the issue ofthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction inCentral Asia. Given the unstable military and politicalsituation in the region  this problem is emerging as areal threat of continental and global proportions.In this respect  the functional capabilities of theCentral Asian nuclear-weapon-free zone — aninitiative put forward by Uzbekistan at the forty-eighth14session of the General Assembly in the spirit of theNon-Proliferation Treaty — are of particularimportance. We much appreciate the efforts of theUnited Nations in supporting the activities of theRegional Group of Experts who are working on the textof the nuclear-weapon-free zone treaty  and we callupon the General Assembly  its President and theSecretary-General to lend their support to the processof formalizing and adopting decisions on this issue.Uzbekistan supports the provisions in the reportof the United Nations Secretary-General concerning theprevention of armed conflict. We consider them to befundamental guidelines for consultations on this issue.We also stand for the earliest completion of theUnited Nations reform process. We welcome certainareas of progress in the work of the Security Councilwith regard to ensuring its transparency  theenlargement of its membership and other mattersrelated to enhancing its effectiveness. With a view toincreasing the effectiveness of the United Nations andin the interests of preventing and settling crisissituations  it is extremely important to intensifycollaboration between the United Nations and regionalsecurity institutions  as well as to enhance the work ofits own regional offices.Uzbekistan has an interest in developing andenhancing dialogue and cooperation with all States thatdisplay an interest in strengthening peace and stabilityat the regional and global levels."
"180",7322,"VCT",56,2001,"﻿Mr. President  I bring you greetings from the small andbeautiful country of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.Please accept our congratulations on your election asPresident of the fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly. You are assured of my country’s full supportfor a successful session. We would also like to offerour heartfelt congratulations to Secretary-General KofiAnnan on his election to a second term  and to theUnited Nations Organization and the Secretary-Generalfor the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize received inhonour of their efforts to ensure a better and morepeaceful world. It is impossible to think of moredeserving recipients of this award as this coalition ofnations and our beloved Secretary-General strive toensure that the Organization fulfils its mandateaccording to the Charter.I commend the President of the United States ofAmerica for the statesmanship and resolve with whichhe continues to deal with the difficulties at hand. I alsosalute the civic leaders of this great city of New Yorkfor the institutional leadership during this problematictime. The city has been visited by tragedy once againthis week. On behalf of the Government and people ofSaint Vincent and the Grenadines  I offer sincerecondolences to all those touched by this latest disaster not least our neighbours and friends in the DominicanRepublic.Our Government stands firm with theinternational community on Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001) against terrorism. We areworking closely with the Governments of the region the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  LatinAmerica and the United States in an effort to fight thescourge of terrorism. Our Government has tightenedsecurity and implemented measures intended to closeany possible avenue that criminals and terrorists mayexploit. We will do whatever is necessary to ensure thatbarbarism is defeated. Compliance with resolution1373 (2001) is difficult and expensive for small Stateswith limited means and technical expertise. But we willcomply.The international community has mustered animpressive effort to fight the plague of terrorism. Inthis midst of this  however  we must not lose sight ofthe fact that terrorism will not be eradicated by onevictory in one war. It behooves us as world leaders tolook deeper into the causes of violence and terror. It isthe firm belief of my Government that marginalizationof the poor and underprivileged creates a hotbed forextremism and lawlessness.We in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and thewider Caribbean have triumphed over the evils ofslavery and colonialism to emerge with a truly noblecivilization. We are a people made up of races from thefour corners of the earth who have melded into onebeautiful whole. We are democratic in our governanceand tolerant in our attitudes. We are a hard-working industrious people. We are proud. It is not in our natureto seek alms from the rich. But  Mr. President  it isself-evident that an economy such as ours  which isalmost totally dependent on agriculture and tourism needs help if we are to survive and prosper.The influence of the multinational Chiquita andDole banana companies has been working for years todestroy the industry of our banana farmers. The WorldTrade Organization (WTO)  of which we are a member seems bent on widening the gulf between rich and poor.We are not optimistic about the outcome of this week’seconomic Ministerial Meeting in Doha. A farmerworking one or two acres of mountain land and ekingout a living cannot compete with the giants who controlthousands of acres in the Central American countries.Mr. President  if you take away that which feedsus  you must offer something in return. That is why theupcoming conference in Mexico on financing fordevelopment is of seminal importance to the small anddeveloping countries of this world. It is time for theeconomic giants of the world to stop paying lip serviceto the idea of financing for development and to put intopractice real and workable means for the poor underprivileged and vulnerable nations to join themainstream. We need the commercial barriers erectedby those intent on maintaining their hegemony to beremoved. We adhere to the adage “Trade  not Aid”. Butthis is not yet a realistic option and  in the presentclimate  will not be for the foreseeable future. We hateasking for charity. We merely ask that promises be keptand commitments adhered to. As a small islanddeveloping State  we need relief from the burden of ourforeign debts  high interest rates and other unfairinternational trade constraints. We need the BrettonWoods institutions to perform their function in ademocratic and just manner.HIV/AIDS remains rampant worldwide. Therecent grave disaster in the United States of Americahas pushed other burning issues of the day off the13world agenda  but people have not stopped dying ofAIDS. The 26 million who have been forecast tosuccumb to the scourge in the next 10 years will stillsuccumb. In the same way that the United States andthe European Union were able to persuade drugcompanies to produce drugs to combat anthrax at afraction of their normal cost  the same drug companiesshould be persuaded to produce affordable treatmentfor this plague  which is causing a national securitythreat to many poor countries.The state of affairs of HIV/AIDS has reachedcircumstances of extreme urgency in our country. TheCaribbean is now only second to sub-Saharan Africa inhaving the fastest rise in the incidents of HIV/AIDS.We are not equipped to handle this crisis. We are notable to afford the drugs to treat our people. Therefore our people are dying — dying in their hundreds andthousands. This world crisis  unlike terrorism  is one ofwhich we know exactly what is required. Do we havethe will to provide the necessary means in order toresolve this problem? The special session of theGeneral Assembly last June on HIV/AIDS ended with aglobal commitment to combat this disease. Are weliving up to our commitment?Prior to 11 September  our Governmentimplemented sound fiscal policies that resulted inpositive economic growth for our country. However after that infamous day  the economic outlook turnedextremely bleak. Our burgeoning tourist industry hassuffered tremendously  with employment taking anespecially heavy blow. Hotel occupancy dropped to a15-year low. There seems to be no end to the rippleeffects on the industry. Just as people were beginningto fly again  we had the tragedy in Queens on Monday.This plunges us deeper into economic gloom and thereal and frightening possibility of recession looms evercloser.Following the admission of Tuvalu to the UnitedNations last year  we were very close to realizing theprinciple of universality set forth in the Charter of theUnited Nations. Now  only one remaining countryawaits admission to the United Nations. That country as we all know  is the Republic of China on Taiwan.The Republic of China’s impressive record ofeconomic and political development is one of the mostpersuasive reasons to eliminate the United Nations soleexception to universality. Fifty years ago  Taiwan was apoor and underdeveloped society. Fifty years later  theRepublic of China on Taiwan has become an affluentand prosperous country  with a per capita gross nationalproduct of around $14 000  annual trade of over $300billion and a gross national product of $320 billion.Although the Republic of China is only the onehundred thirty-eighth largest country in the world interms of lands and the forty-sixth largest in terms ofpopulation  it is today the world’s seventeenth largesteconomy  the fifteenth largest trading nation  the eighthlargest investor  the fourth largest holder of foreignexchange and the third largest exporter of informationtechnology products.Under our principle of universality  we cannotcontinue to exclude a country with such an impressiverecord of achievements. The time has come to open ourdoors to the Republic of China on Taiwan.The situation in Afghanistan calls for immediateaction on the part of the United Nations to fill thepower vacuum left by the departure of the rulingTaliban from the capital  Kabul. We must make surethat the new administration is representative of allfactions and we must further ensure that the sufferingand starving people receive immediate humanitarianaid to ensure their survival through the coming wintermonths.Finally  I must reiterate that we are encouragedby the efforts undertaken by the United Nations towork towards a society that ensures security and humandignity for all in the future. The future looks good ifwe all work together for the betterment of mankind. Iassure the Assembly that my Prime Minister  Mr. RalphGonsalves  and the Government and people of SaintVincent and the Grenadines are fully committed tosupporting the United Nations in these endeavours  andmay God direct all of us on this path."
"181",7369,"VEN",56,2001,"﻿Justover a year ago  we were here  attending theMillennium Summit  some 100 days before the dawn ofthe twenty-first century. At that time  I made astatement on behalf of Venezuela and its Bolivarianpeople  referring to the supreme example of Christ andhis struggle for justice  peace and life.In the brief span of time since then  havingembarked on the new century — albeit with verypainful steps  I should say — we have suffered theabominable terrorist attack of 11 September. Inopposition to the culture of peace  to the dialogueamong civilizations declared by the United Nations in2001 and to the good will of the peoples of the world the drums of war are suddenly thundering again and wesay  louder and more passionately than we have in thepast  that this struggle for peace is of fundamentalimportance.From the outset  Venezuela and its people Government and institutions have joined in the chorusof voices that first rose to reject these heinous acts. Atthis meeting in New York  in this incredible city  in thisnation of North America  we take this opportunity toreiterate our grief and sympathy for the people andGovernment of the United States and its institutionsover the attacks and the pain they have caused. We say as we have said from the very day of the tragedy thathas plunged the world into mourning and peril  that thefight against terrorism should become a war againstwar — a fight to achieve peace.At the Millennium Summit  we also said  likeSimón Bolívar  the liberator of South America remembering his dream of the summit of Chimborazo:Let us speak the truth to all men and women. Andprecisely on the basis of the horrible and frightfultruths that we are experiencing today in the world  letus call for a new world pact in the United Nations. Wesaid in that speech just over one year ago that at thepresent time in our world human beings continue to dieeach day  but now the figures have doubled  and notbecause of a world war. No  now the principal causesof the horrible truth affecting the world’s people arepoverty  marginalization and hunger. What is foremostin this dramatic and tragic moment is that we mustrecognize the truth and then build a new global pact inthe United Nations without delay.Now  at the beginning of the twenty-first centuryand the third millennium  we at the United Nationsshould concentrate our greatest possible efforts on themoral  intellectual  scientific  social  cultural  economicand financial order in the fight against the demons ofhunger  poverty and death that afflict the planet. This iswhat we said a year ago in this beautiful setting. Ibelieve we are fulfilling the mandate of Bolívar to statethe truth to all men and women.Venezuela recognized the validity  the necessity the great vision and the truth that our Secretary-General launched as a challenge to all of us in thepreparatory document that subsequently became theMillennium Declaration. Today  our dear friend KofiAnnan reminded us of that challenge in his commentsopening this session of debates  when he recalled  forexample  that last year we committed ourselves toreducing poverty 50 per cent by the year 2015  havingset quantifiable and precise goals  such as reducing byhalf the number of human beings who survive onincomes of less than one dollar per day.At the Millennium Summit  great truths werestated and we heard the appeals of our peoples. We saidthen and continue to say that all of the world’s childrenmust have access to a full education by the year 2015.As the Secretary-General also reminded us  all humanbeings should have access to potable water. We are nottalking about the Internet — we are talking aboutdrinking water  the water basic to life.The goals set last year were discussed over thefollowing weeks in hundreds of marvellous speeches.But today  one year later  we must continue to askourselves how we are going to achieve them. What arethe successful strategies that can be employed toachieve these lofty goals? The answer is justice  theonly path to true peace. We said that we had come touncover truths; that for the honour  dignity and life ofour peoples  we must come here to speak without fear.We said that here  in this setting  we must speakwithout the double standard that sometimes invades ourdiscussions. As I see our brothers from India here  Ithink of the Hindu philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti who spoke of truth as a basic dynamic in understandingthe secrets of life. Truth  truth  truth. We want truths. Ifwe do not recognize truths  it will be difficult for us to24find true solutions to the horrible tragedies that theworld is living through.On behalf of the people of Venezuela  I returnhere today to contribute ideas to the effort to seektruths and to speak true words that spring from acombination of reason and passion. They are not justcold words on paper but come from the heart  and theymust not remain on paper as cold discourse but musttouch the wound of real truth. Today  truth is an openwound and it is our ultimate challenge to heal it. Wecome  then  without fear  in good faith and with muchoptimism about life  brotherhood  unity and thepossibility that we  as the leaders of our countries  canseek  grasp and build together real solutions to realproblems in the quest for justice and peace.We in Venezuela believe that the world must beexamined under a great and powerful magnifying glass because it has gone to bad to worse  stumbling andstruggling from error to error. At the end of the SecondWorld War  the United Nations was born to struggle forpeace and prevent new horrors from happening. Wehave not avoided those horrors. The Berlin Wall andthe Soviet Union fell at the end of the twentiethcentury  and voices were raised saying history hascome to an end: we have arrived at the end of our path the final era  one of technology  of the global village of globalization  of the new world order. This is thetriumph of a model — the triumph of one philosophyas the result of the collapse of another. But that claimwas a lie. Who can claim victory in today’s world which is filled with poverty and tears  pain and death?What model could claim victory?Venezuela would like to make a fervent andpassionate appeal  hopeful that we will be properlyunderstood — indeed  we are sure that we will be because we are speaking with love  faith and hope calling on the Lord God  invoking life and peace andrespect for brotherhood. Let our words be properlyunderstood. We must undertake a thoroughexamination of and review the political models thatexist in our countries today. In America we speak ofdemocracy — yes  democracy. But in Venezuela we askwhat kind of democracy we are talking about. Ademocracy such as Venezuela had for 40 years  from1958 to 1998  which ended up destroying a people taking away their sovereignty and causing them to livein poverty in a fertile land rich with resources such asoil and gold? That was no more than an ornamentalflourish that mimicked democracy  and it ended intyranny. We never again want such a democracy inVenezuela  and we are certain that we will never haveit again. Democracy must be based on popularparticipation  ethics  justice and equality.We in Venezuela have been saying that we mustalso review the economic models that some tried to putin place among our peoples. Is neoliberalism the way?Yes — it is the way to hell. Let us traverse the streetsand cities of Latin America and we will see theconsequences of neoliberal policies run wild  as HisHoliness John Paul II has said. We must review oureconomies  our ethics  our policies — everything mustbe re-examined today if we want the world to be aviable place and if we want peace to reign on earth.Is globalization the path to development? It couldbe  if it were based on justice  equality and respectfulrelations among all. We need to re-examine everything.As Viviane Forrester said  using the phrase “economichorror”  the world is undergoing a process of change and that should also be cause for optimism. The worldis changing; it is moving on. New developments aretaking place; let us move with them  peacefully anddemocratically  while searching for justice. As IgnacioRamonet said in his reflections in Le MondeDiplomatique  alternative paths are appearing all overthe world. Venezuela is making its humble contributionthrough a peaceful and democratic revolution. We arecommitted to the human being  to an internationalpolicy of peace  friendship  respect and multipolarity.And we are here today to reaffirm that commitment.Venezuela is speaking out in condemningterrorism. Venezuela is speaking out — and takingaction — in expressing its solidarity in the struggleagainst terrorism. At the same time  in speaking out weare giving voice to the mandate of the United Nationsto ensure respect for international law and humanrights. Any action taken against any crime must belegitimate. It must be based on respect for human rightsand international law. No one should understandVenezuela’s words to be a condemnation of anything oranyone. We are calling for reflection so as to ensurethat we act within the norms of international law andthe mandates of the United Nations. We cannot throwthat overboard.Venezuela has also shouldered its responsibilityin various forums and international arenas. Within theOrganization of American States  we are proposing thata social charter be adopted  in addition to the25Democratic Charter  to give more weight to ourcontinent’s struggles to place the human being at theforefront of our endeavours. Within the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries  of which we hold thepresidency of the conference of heads of State  weproposed — and achieved consensus among all — toensure balance and dialogue between the producers andconsumers of oil  aware as we are of the need toguarantee supplies and a fair price for all for that vitalresource for development and for life.Within the Group of Fifteen  Venezuela  whichholds the chairmanship  is promoting the North-Southdialogue  in particular the need to revitalize it. Itshould not be a dialogue of the deaf  but a dialogue ofequals who are seeking solutions — dialogue andcooperation of South with South and of Latin Americanand the Caribbean with Africa  Asia and all the peoplesof the world. Within the Group of 77  Venezuela isworking for the same strategic consensus  dialogue andunity. We are very optimistic  as everyone should be.Despite everything  however  we need greatpolitical will — greater political will — to bring aboutall of those changes and transformations. To use thevocabulary of the theory of war  we must put thecavalry on the front line. The cavalry is policy; thecavalry is ethics and the will for change  which wemust promote.Finally  I believe that  over and above the pain the condemnation and the struggle against terrorismand against the savages who perpetrated those horrificattacks  the greatest honour must go to the fallen — theinnocent victims of those acts  and the many othervictims throughout the world  those who have sufferedand for whom we have wept: the innocent children whohave fallen  the men and the women. The British PrimeMinister  Tony Blair  said something that I thought waswonderful in response to a comment that I made duringa conversation we had in Downing Street a few daysago. He said that if anything good can come from thiscrisis and this pain  it is a global alliance to combat thecauses of violence throughout the world.Those who have spoken before me have pointedout many of these causes. The Emir of Qatar andChairman of the Organization of the IslamicConference also made a very important point. He saidthat our words should not once again remain empty. Aswe say in our part of the world  there is a big differencebetween words and action. Now is the time to movetowards concrete action. We want to see a PalestinianState become a reality. Let us not come here day afterday  month after month and year after year just torepeat the same old words. Let us move on towardsreality. We want to see the transformation of theBretton Woods institutions. We want to see thetransformation of the International Monetary Fund andthe World Bank. We want justice for the wretched ofthe Earth  as Frantz Fanon said. But we want it now not tomorrow; tomorrow may be too late.In conclusion  as I said during the debate on 7September last year  quoting from the Bible “To everything there is a season  and a timeto every purpose under the heaven”. (The HolyBible  Ecclesiastes 3:1)Sisters and brothers of this planet in sorrow  of this ourworld  let us do all that we can. Truly  we musttransform this difficult time in which we are living intoa time of the people  a time of justice; that is the onlyway to achieve genuine peace. As I ended by sayinglast year  let us save the world!"
"182",7408,"VNM",56,2001,"﻿I amagain the last speaker of the day  but I am happybecause it gives me a little extra time to congratulatethe President on the effective manner in which he isconducting the work of the session  which gives usevery reason to believe that it will be steered to afruitful conclusion.I wish also to extend our heartfelt condolencesand sympathy to the families of the plane crash victimsof yesterday. Let us pray that it had nothing to do withterrorist acts  as the tragic events of 11 Septemberalone were more than enough to bring to the fore thefight against terrorism as one of the top priorities of theUnited Nations and the international community.Cognizant of the distinction between terrorism and thestruggle to exercise a people’s right to self-determination  Viet Nam persistently condemnsterrorism in all its forms and manifestations  whichtakes a heavy toll of innocent lives. We fully supportthe international endeavour and cooperation to ensureworld peace  stability and security in full conformitywith the United Nations Charter and with fundamentalprinciples of international law  particularly thoserespecting national independence and sovereignty. Noindividual country can go solo or have doublestandards in this fight. While members of theinternational community must act in a responsiblemanner by not tolerating  nurturing and/or supportingterrorists on their soil  they should also bring theterrorists to justice or extradite them to the countrywhere their crimes were committed  so that they can beduly punished.Though combating international terrorism hasbecome the pressing task of the day  it must notovershadow the challenges of the twenty-first century.Poverty  the widened development gap  the HIV/AIDSepidemic  the deteriorating environment  regionaltensions and conflicts  all point to the potentialinstability of the world today  as mentioned by ourleaders a year ago. The Summit Declaration  inreflecting the genuine wishes and resolve of theworld’s peoples  vigorously reconfirmed the values andprinciples of the Charter  defining the priorityobjectives of the United Nations and the internationalcommunity for the years to come  thus becoming ourplatform  our programme of action for the newmillennium. To implement the Declaration at the globallevel  the United Nations last year conducted numerousactivities  including the organization of a series ofspecial sessions in the economic  social and securityfields. The international organizations in the UnitedNations system — such as the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP)  the United NationsChildren’s Fund (UNICEF)  the United NationsPopulation Fund (UNFPA) and the United NationsInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) —are actively coordinating with nations to incorporate intheir national programmes the specific objectives setforth in the Summit Declaration. This is a significantstart which should be further promoted  as the mostpressing challenge to us all is how to eradicate povertyon a global scale. In this spirit we wish to congratulatethe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  who started hissecond term in office with the Nobel Peace Prize. Weare fully convinced that the Secretary-General willcontinue to contribute to the cause of all nations andpeoples.Against the backdrop of globalizationspearheaded by the information technology revolution the other side of international political and economiclife has been further exposed. The gap between richand poor has widened further  and adversecircumstances in international relations have emerged further underscoring the disadvantage and vulnerabilityof the developing countries. The Secretary-Generalonce said words to the effect that poverty and the gapbetween rich and poor are the seeds of instability andprecarious development  and that today’s mainchallenge is how to ensure that globalization becomesthe driving force of development instead of leaving abillion people in abject poverty. A common concern atpresent  however  is the tendency towards decreasingofficial development assistance (ODA)  particularly thedecrease in contributions to the developmentorganizations in the United Nations system  which willsurely hamper their activities. More than ever before the United Nations  the international community  thedeveloped countries in particular  should further assistthe developing countries in the eradication of poverty disease and illiteracy  and facilitate their fuller andequitable participation in international economic life.Development requires an environment of peaceand stability. But complex implications arising fromthe conflicts in some parts of the world and thepossible intensification of an arms race  are notconducive to development at all. Of particular concernis the escalation of violence in the Middle East. Wejoin the community of world peoples calling for an42early end to violence  the resumption of peacefulnegotiations for a just  long-lasting solution in whichthe inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and thelegitimate rights of all parties concerned  would beguaranteed. By the same token  the embargoes imposedupon Cuba  Iraq and Libya  which cause untoldsuffering to these peoples  should be lifted so as toenable them to concentrate their energy and efforts onnational reconstruction and development.This year  South-East Asia has witnessed certaincomplex developments  but peace  stability andcooperation remain the burning aspiration of ourpeoples and continue to be the main tendency. TheAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)countries are determined to build a zone of peace development and prosperity and to coordinate efforts toeffectively cope with regional and global challenges. Inthat context  the success of the 34th MinisterialMeeting  the eighth ASEAN Regional Forum held inHanoi last August and the ASEAN Summit held inBrunei Darussalam in early November  all contributedto establishing priorities and effective measures for thefuture of this region. These meetings reaffirmedASEAN’s determination to further promote solidarity cooperation  dialogue and mutual understanding withinASEAN  and between ASEAN countries and theirdialogue partners  especially China  Japan and theRepublic of Korea  for the peaceful settlement of theirdifferences on the basis of respect for fundamentalprinciples and norms of international law  particularlythose regarding consensus and non-interference in theinternal affairs of others. The Hanoi Declaration onNarrowing the Development Gap for Closer ASEANIntegration and other important documents wereadopted on confidence-building and the promotion ofmutual understanding for peace and stability in South-East Asia  as well as in Asia and the Pacific. Theywelcomed the promising progress in the ASEAN-Chinaconsultation regarding a code of conduct in the EasternSea  reaffirming those principles of the 1992 ASEANManila Declaration on the settlement of conflictingclaims of territorial sovereignty in the Eastern Sea. Wesincerely hope that the United Nations and theinternational community  in line with the MillenniumDeclaration  will deliver active support and assistanceto the implementation of our regional cooperation forpeace  stability and development in the region andthroughout the world.In the course of 15 years of rebuilding  Viet Namhas recorded great achievements in all fields. The ninthParty Congress has drawn necessary lessons from ourown experiences  reaffirmed our resolve to continue thecourse  stepping up industrialization and modernizationprogrammes  and mapping out the socio-economicdevelopment strategy for the years 2001 to 2010. Whiletrying to bring into full play our inner strength  we willcreate more favourable conditions to attract investmentand expand further effective cooperation with foreignpartners and countries. We will continue to pursue ourforeign policy of independence  openness  internationaleconomic integration  friendship and trustedpartnership with all countries in the internationalcommunity in the endeavour for peace  independenceand development.The Millennium Summit and its Declarationprovided us with a momentum in the new millennium which should be maintained through the activeimplementation of the guidelines unanimouslyendorsed by our leaders. The United Nations and eachMember State should make efforts to achieve thoseobjectives.In order to contribute effectively to the commoncause  the United Nations should speed up the processof reform  renovation and democratization. Viet Namfully supports the central role of the General Assembly the highest representative body of the wholemembership  and the reform and expansion of theSecurity Council in both the non-permanent andpermanent categories. The developing countries shouldhave fuller representation and participation in theCouncil’s decision-making. But it is of the utmostimportance that the United Nations should designmeasures to concentrate resources for development andthe eradication of poverty and for the other majorobjectives included in the Millennium Declaration. It isthe expectation of the whole membership that theUnited Nations should become a worthy world body operating in a more effective manner in the interests ofall countries and for a just  humanistic and better worldin the new millennium. We believe that the UnitedNations will surely live up to this expectation and VietNam pledges to contribute actively to this commonendeavour."
"183",7439,"VUT",56,2001,"﻿At the outset  I wish toextend to Mr. Han Seung-soo greetings from theGovernment and the people of the Republic ofVanuatu. I wish to convey to him the apologies of myGovernment for not being able to be represented hereat the ministerial level owing to the fact that ourParliament is currently in session. I should also like totake this opportunity to convey my Government’scongratulations to him on his election as President ofthe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I alsopay tribute to his predecessor  who so ably played adecisive role at the helm of the fifty-fifth session.In addition  allow me to congratulate theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  on his election to asecond term at the head of this esteemed world body.His assured wisdom and compassion are needed nowmore than ever to lead this Organization.I have the great honour  in standing before theAssembly today  to deliver a statement on behalf of myGovernment and the people of the Republic of Vanuatuat a time so sad that words cannot begin to convey thescope of our emotions. Let me express the sinceresympathy and condolences of my Government and thepeople of Vanuatu to the families and friends of thevictims of the tragedy that struck downtown New York Washington  D.C.  and Pennsylvania. In light of theseevents  since the 11 September attacks  the GeneralAssembly has been forced to suspend most of its35agenda  including this general debate among heads ofState and Government.It is ironic that as the world becomes morecivilized  we become more vulnerable to such inhumanacts of terrorism. The impacts of these terroristactivities are being felt around the globe  and smallStates such as mine will suffer along with the rest ofthe international community. If any good has come outof the despicable events of 11 September  it is thatnations the world over are more united than ever incondemning and collaborating to eradicate theseterrible acts of terrorism. My Government has takensteps to tighten security and is working closely withother Pacific island States towards building andstrengthening peace and security in our region.Global peace and security cannot be certain inthis climate of continued difference of views betweenmajor nuclear-weapon States. The lack of progress onthis is reflected by the stalemate prevailing in theConference on Disarmament. The agreements reachedduring the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties tothe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons were not realized; the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has not entered into force; andglobal military expenditures continue to rise. Morecommitted efforts and innovative strategies are neededto meet the goals of the Millennium Declaration.Vanuatu believes that the Conference on Disarmamentshould work towards that end.The Third United Nations Conference on theLeast Developed Countries  held in Brussels in Maythis year  was highly successful and produced theBrussels Declaration and the Programme of Action forLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010.We appreciate the view of the Secretary-General thatthe Declaration reaffirms the collective responsibilityof the international community to uphold the principlesof human dignity  equality and equity and to ensurethat globalization becomes a positive force for all theworld’s people. We believe that without thecoordinated involvement of the whole United Nationssystem  there will be little the United Nations canachieve.The Government of Vanuatu  like otherGovernments around the world  is committed toenhancing the status of women. It is well documentedthat women in Vanuatu are disadvantaged in almost allsectors. In 1995  Vanuatu unanimously ratified theConvention on the Elimination of All Forms ofDiscrimination against Women. Accordingly  theGovernment of Vanuatu is focusing on the Conventionas the basis for programmes on women’s rights anddevelopment in Vanuatu.A lack of resources has hindered Vanuatu’sprogress in submitting its first two reports. TheGovernment  however  recognizes the importance ofthe reports in terms of building up and monitoring itsown human resources development requirements and isthus putting greater effort into the production of thesereports. Indeed  no country can afford to waste half ofits human resources.Vanuatu remains steadfast in its commitments andobligations under the Convention on the Rights of theChild. Since ratifying the Convention in 1992  theGovernment of Vanuatu has implemented decisions andundertaken activities that promote the advancement ofchildren in our society. A National Children’sCommittee  whose membership is made up ofstakeholders  has been revived and is officiallyrecognized as the regulatory body for coordinating andsupervising children’s rights throughout the nation.The electoral assistance provided by the UnitedNations for Fiji’s national election has greatlyfacilitated the democratic transition in that country. Wewelcome the new focus on supporting institutions andstimulating local participation. We also welcome otherefforts to deploy the Electoral Assistance Division tocoordinate the activities of foreign observers inforthcoming elections  particularly in East Timor andhopefully in Solomon Islands. We commend the UnitedNations for its assistance in empowering the citizens ofMember States to enjoy the power of democracy.We recognize the efforts of the United Nations inbridging the gap between human rights norms and theirimplementation. Despite some progress  challengesremain in ensuring universal respect for human rights.The Republic of Vanuatu is a party to nearly all corehuman rights treaties. We feel there is a continuingneed for human and institutional capacity-building indeveloping countries in order to ensure theimplementation of human rights conventions andtreaties they have signed. This is an area where theUnited Nations should follow a needs-based approachand make a realistic assessment of the existingmechanisms.36The East Timorese people  who have alreadyelected their Constituent Assembly  will democraticallyelect their President and soon exercise full sovereigntyover their entire territory; this positive development isa big leap. It affirms the outstanding commitment ofthe Committee of 24 in deliberating on the right ofpeoples to self-determination. However  there are thosewho are still waiting to exercise this right. At thissession’s general debate  I am pleased to note that thereport of the Secretary-General on the work of theOrganization gives special mention to West Papua. TheSecretary-General intends to enhance our efforts toassist Indonesia in seeking to establish a democraticsociety and in addressing the wide range of complexissues facing that country. The Secretary-General alsounderlined the efforts of the Indonesian authorities tofurther the promotion of human rights and findpeaceful resolutions to the problems in West Papua Aceh and Maluku. During the thirty-second PacificIslands Forum in Nauru  Forum leaders expressedcontinuing concern about violence and loss of life inthe Indonesian province of West Papua. The Forumalso called on the Indonesian authorities to ensure tothat the voices of all parties in West Papua be heard inorder to achieve a peaceful resolution. Our leaderswelcomed the recent presentation of special autonomyproposals to Indonesia’s national assembly  whileurging all parties to protect and uphold the humanrights of all residents in West Papua.I am extremely pleased to inform the Assemblythat the Government of Vanuatu has agreed to host theSpecial Committee of 24 on decolonization seminar inPort Vila  Vanuatu  in May of next year. We lookforward to that important meeting.The Republic of Vanuatu wishes to join others inexpressing our appreciation to the Secretary-Generalfor his comprehensive report on the implementation ofthe recommendations of the Special Committee onPeacekeeping Operations and of the Panel on UnitedNations Peace Operations. Vanuatu is a new supporterof the United Nations peacekeeping role in East Timorand Bosnia and has contributed civilian police to theseUnited Nations peacekeeping initiatives. The VanuatuGovernment remains committed to future peacekeepingengagements. Vanuatu has also monitored theBougainville peace process alongside the UnitedNations.One of the more pressing issues before us is thatof climate change and sea-level rise. The UnitedNations has now scheduled a World Summit onSustainable Development  to be held in Johannesburg South Africa  in September of next year.The Pacific Islands Forum communiqué reflectedon climate change in seeking the internationalcommunity’s awareness of our low-lying islands in thePacific and reiterating the priority of the KyotoProtocol as a significant step forward for global actionin combating climate change. Although signed bymany of the industrialized countries  including theUnited States  the Kyoto Protocol has not yet beenratified by many of them. We are very concerned thatthe United States Senate has actually voted againstratification.Our Forum leaders noted the concerns expressedby most members over the United States intention notto ratify the Kyoto Protocol. We urge the United Statesto reconsider its position and to ratify the KyotoProtocol as soon as possible.While the incidence of HIV/AIDS is not as highin the Pacific as in some other regions  it isnevertheless a major issue for both developing anddeveloped countries within our region. Vanuatu’sdelegation is of the firm view that prevention should bethe mainstay of combating HIV/AIDS in our region.The relatively low number of reported HIV/AIDScases in a number of our countries should not give riseto complacency. Once the disease takes hold  care andtreatment can be extremely expensive. In this respect Vanuatu welcomes the establishment of a Global Fundto combat HIV/AIDS  and we wish to express ourappreciation to those Governments  foundations andprivate companies that have already expressed support.Meanwhile  strategies and plans for resourcemobilization must keep in mind the competingpriorities of  and the constraints faced by  smallerStates like Vanuatu.In conclusion  the Vanuatu delegation reaffirmsits support and conviction for the crucial role that theUnited Nations has in ensuring that the world becomesa much safer place in which to live."
"184",7471,"WSM",56,2001,"﻿Samoa is very pleasedthat we are meeting under the presidency of Mr. Han.On behalf of my Government  I extend warmcongratulations to the President of the GeneralAssembly and express to him our full confidence andcooperation.Allow me also a moment to pay tribute to hispredecessor  President Harri Holkeri  for his8outstanding service and leadership during the fifty-fifthsession of the General Assembly  and for thesignificant achievements of that session.We are delighted with the award of the NobelPeace Prize to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan and to our Organization. I want  in particular  tocongratulate the Secretary-General and to wish himevery success in his new term of office. His personalqualities and extraordinary leadership give shape to themodern face of the United Nations in ways that giveforce and credibility to the Organization and itsperformance.The terrorist attacks of 11 September marked aturning point in the history of our era. These terribleevents give special significance to this session of theAssembly. We need to send out from this house anunambiguous message.The clear view of my Government is that there isno room for moral equivocation. The deliberate takingof innocent civilian life  regardless of cause orgrievance  is without justification in law and is morallyunacceptable. My Government has declared its strongcondemnation of the attacks in New York  Washington D.C.  and Pennsylvania  and I want today to underscorethat condemnation in unequivocal terms.On behalf of my country and its citizens  I wantto renew to the Government and the people of theUnited States our profound feelings of sorrow andsympathy and our committed solidarity and support. Ialso want to say that the leadership  magnificentexample and courage shown by the United Statesdemonstrate beyond doubt the extraordinary strengthsof that great democracy and the indomitable spirit of itspeople.This was a most monstrous crime  evil inpremeditation and merciless in execution. Thousandsof innocent lives were taken  thousands of peoplemurdered without warning. To the families and friendsof the victims — which included citizens of many othercountries represented in this Hall — we extend ourwarm and heartfelt condolences.Terrorism is an offence against the core values ofthe United Nations. It is a direct and most seriousthreat to democracy  to the free exercise of humanrights and to economic and social development. It hasno respect for social order  human life and property.This has never been clearer than in the aftermathof these terrible attacks against the United States.Furthermore  these horrific events not only have servedto highlight the need for a concerted and effectiveinternational response but have also drawn attention tothe inadequacy of the traditional forms of judicial andlaw enforcement in combating it.There cannot be any question as to the need foran effective response from the internationalcommunity. Indeed  the Security Council’s unanimousand momentous resolution 1373 (2001)  together withresolution 1368 (2001)  gives the clearest signal of theinternational community’s determination to takeconcrete action against the financing  training andmovement of terrorists and the need for all States tocooperate in any campaign against them. We believethey provide the necessary basis for securing thebroadest possible international support and cooperationfor the global campaign against terrorism  in particularthrough the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee.I am pleased to announce that as part of its ownresponse in this collective effort  Samoa is taking stepsto adhere to additional United Nations conventions oninternational terrorism.We believe  however  that we need to bear inmind that fighting terrorism cannot be separated fromthe task of preventing organized crime and the spreadof small arms and other weapons  and of containingand ending conflict. We also need to ensure that theconditions of poverty and despair  which breedignorance  hatred  violence and extremism  areproperly and effectively addressed.We need  above all  to remain resolute inupholding the rule of law and the principles thatunderpin the rule of law. The clear affirmation of theseprinciples and of the norms of humanitarian andinternational law will help deny to the perpetrators ofthese crimes whatever they seek to gain from violence.We consider it essential to renew efforts topromote the rapid entry into force of the Rome Statuteof the International Criminal Court. A functioninginternational criminal court for the prosecution ofterrorist acts amounting to crimes against humanity —as we consider the attacks on the United States to be —would provide a vital component in the internationalarmoury against terrorism.9This fifty-sixth session of the Assembly is thefirst to follow last year’s Millennium Summit. It willbe the ideal occasion to take up the critical issues andstrategies for implementing the MillenniumDeclaration. May I say in this connection that wewarmly welcome and find most useful the road mapreport of the Secretary-General  setting out in somedetail how the Summit commitments could be fulfilled.We note that most of the targets set by theMillennium Declaration are not really new. They arethe determined results of global conferences of the1990s or are derived from the body of internationalnorms and laws that have been codified over the past50 years. It follows that the plans of action needed forreaching the targets have  for the most part  alreadybeen developed and formally adopted by MemberStates.What is needed  therefore  is not more technicalor feasibility studies. Rather  as the Secretary-General’sreport points out  States need to demonstrate thepolitical will to carry out commitments already madeand to implement strategies already worked out. Inother words  as we move from an era of commitment toan era of implementation  the international communitymust mobilize the will and the resources needed tofulfil the promises made.Samoa was honoured recently to host a Pacificregional meeting as part of the preparatory work for theWorld Summit on Sustainable Development inJohannesburg next September. It is important to seekfurther progress in these preparations  especially in thecompletion of national assessment reports. We believethe Summit will be a unique opportunity to re-establishinternational commitment to sustainable development.Our own view is that there is a need to accelerate thecomprehensive and targeted implementation of Agenda21. Efforts to this end should aim to minimize andremove obstacles that impede the implementation ofthe Rio commitments  especially in capacity-buildingneeds and in the provision of adequate financial andtechnological support.We place particular importance on theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment. The agenda of the Conference allows fora full range of substantive issues to be addressed. Itwould be important to forge broad-based consensus onall these issues  and even more so on the reform of theinternational financial and trade architecture in a waythat would be supportive of the long-term developmentof developing countries. There should be enhancedopportunities for the representation and participation ofdeveloping countries  including small island States  inthe major decision-making institutions on globalfinancing  monetary and trade issues.It is impossible today to visualize progress anddevelopment without access to modern informationsystems. The remarkable growth of information andcommunication technologies (ICT) is opening upboundless new possibilities for accelerated economicand social development. But the ability to translate thefull potential of ICT differs from country to country. Iknow my country needs to develop its own capacity todo so. Yet we know that  for a developing country likemy own  there is no real option but to take fulladvantage of the digital revolution. We will thereforebe supporting every global effort to call attention to theneed for bridging the digital divide.The turn of the millennium has brought newchallenges  and with it changes to the character andcomplexity of the United Nations role in maintaininginternational peace and security. Samoa is proud tohave been able to contribute to the civilian policeoperations in East Timor. From this experience it isclear to us that if the United Nations is to do its job ofmaintaining international peace and security  it needs tobe given the necessary tools and resources.We have learned a great deal from the report ofthe Panel on United Nations Peace Operations  and weknow that the United Nations needs to improve itscapacity to respond to conflicts more effectively. Andwe need to move forward with the peacekeepingreform process.The recognition implicit in the awarding of theNobel Peace Prize to the United Nations means thatmore than ever  we need to modernize and strengthenour Organization. We fully support the current effortsto review and revitalize the working methods of theGeneral Assembly.We commend most highly the work of theGeneral Assembly’s Open-ended Working Group onreform of the Security Council and its Bureau. Difficultand critical issues remain. But we need to maintain thepolitical momentum provided in the MillenniumSummit for comprehensive reform of the SecurityCouncil. Membership of the Council  both permanentand non-permanent  needs to be enlarged to reflect the10realities of the present time and to enhance its role andeffectiveness.Finally  let me refer to the twenty-second specialsession of the General Assembly  in 1999  thatreviewed the Barbados Programme of Action for theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates. Since that time  a number of global events  suchas the tenth session of the United Nations Conferenceon Trade and Development and the Third UnitedNations Conference on the Least Developed Countrieshave recalled the fragility of small island States in theglobalizing economy. We  of course  are grateful forthis acknowledgement. However  I believe I reflect theaspiration of all small island States in saying that weneed to do much more in terms of concrete actions -actions that will only be meaningful if we are assuredof the committed support of the whole internationalcommunity.Overcoming the well-recognized vulnerability ofsmall island States like my own  and the exposure ofisland communities to the effects of global climatechange  natural disasters  environmental damage andglobal economic shocks will be an essential element ofsustainable development in all small island regions.May I say  in this connection  that Samoa verymuch welcomes the successful conclusion yesterday inMarrakech of the seventh session of the Conference ofthe Parties to the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change. The completion of theoperational details of the Kyoto Protocol will  we hope open the way to widespread ratification byGovernments and the Protocol’ s early entry into force perhaps by the time of the Johannesburg World Summitnext year.The struggle against climate change is not just anenvironmental issue. It is also a matter of fundamentaldevelopment. It is so because the adverse impact ofclimate change endangers economic and socialprogress. This is most certainly the case for smallisland States  which are widely acknowledged to beamong the most vulnerable and the least able to adapt.The world community’s response to climate changetherefore requires significant  long-term changes ineconomic and social behaviour. The United Nations hasan urgent and vital responsibility in this task as well."
"185",7517,"YEM",56,2001,"﻿I ampleased  first of all  to convey through you  Sir  oursincere congratulations to President Han Seung-soo on28his election as President of the current session of theGeneral Assembly. I am certain that with his expertiseand skill he will conduct the proceedings of thissession successfully. I should also like to express ourappreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri  forthe distinction with which he conducted theproceedings of the last session.Our current meetings are convened amidextraordinary circumstances arising from the acts ofterrorism committed against the United States ofAmerica on the very day set for the opening of thissession. It is regrettable that the first session of theUnited Nations General Assembly of the twenty-firstcentury should be convened in the aftermath of thosealarming events. These events truly constitute anegative phenomenon that will have majorrepercussions on inter-State relations at the bilateraland multilateral levels alike. Furthermore  these eventshave convinced everyone that there is no alternative tocollective endeavour through legitimate structures toconfront the challenges of the future. We would like tostress the necessity of supporting the United Nations asan ideal framework for international cooperation particularly at this stage when collective endeavour isindispensable for coping with the problems that now  inthe era of globalization  affect us all to a greater orlesser extent. In this connection  we congratulate theUnited Nations and its Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize for 2001 which has come at an appropriate time as anappreciative expression of the role of the Organizationand the effective leadership of its Secretary-General.The perseverance of the host country in ensuringquasi-normal conditions for the work of this sessionreflects a will to transcend the catastrophe and displaysconfidence in the triumph of reason. Permit me  as Istand at the heart of this great and wounded city  toconvey  on behalf of the leadership  Government andpeople of Yemen  our sincere condolences and deepestsympathy to the American President  the Governmentand people of the United States  and to convey thesesentiments in particular to the families of the innocentvictims whose lives were lost in the tragic events of 11September.Although the scourge of terrorism has struck theUnited States this time  claiming thousands of innocentvictims  the phenomenon of terrorism is not new.Indeed  it is directed against the whole world. Theserecent acts of terrorism claimed victims from 70foreign countries  including Yemen. These acts werenot targeted against the United States and Americansalone; rather  the target was international peace andsecurity. Regrettably  the phenomenon of terrorism hasworsened because of negligence in confronting it. Wein the Republic of Yemen have not been spared theperils and threats of terrorism. Our country has beenscorched by its fire and afflicted in many ways  but ourappeals for timely  effective cooperation fell on deafears.Today  in the face of this loathsome act ofterrorism  the Republic of Yemen reiterates its stand condemning terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations  whatever its causes and sources. As weproclaim the readiness of the Government of theRepublic of Yemen to strive  within the framework ofinternational legitimacy  for the elimination ofterrorism  we also affirm our desire that thoseendeavours not lead to the suffering of innocentpersons or to the practice of oppression that will resultin the emergence of a new generation of terrorists.We also affirm the Arab Islamic position thatrejects attempts to link terrorism to Arabs andMuslims. Terrorism  as history teaches us  has noreligion  no homeland and no identity. On the samegrounds  Yemen censures the voices that stir uppropaganda for a clash of civilizations or  to be precise a clash of Islam with Christianity. Instead  we call for ameaningful intercultural dialogue and for the creationof common concepts centred on justice  human andreligious values.The desire to combat and eliminate terrorismmakes it incumbent upon the international communityto launch an unremitting campaign based on uniformand clearly defined criteria identifying terrorists  bethey individuals  or collective or State terrorism. Theinternational community cannot shirk its responsibilityto oppose State terrorism — just as it opposes terrorismby individuals and groups.Logically  it follows that the Security Councilshould put an end to the crimes committed daily byIsrael against the Palestinian people forcing Israel towithdraw from the occupied Arab territories and toimplement the resolutions of international legitimacy first and foremost of which are Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). In this regard the Republic of Yemen proclaims that it welcomesPresident George W. Bush’s statement on the necessity29of establishing a Palestinian State with all the elementsof sovereignty. This declaration has met with ever-increasing international support. Israel must realize thatits security is bound up with its neighbour’s securityand that its secure future lies in the inevitableacceptance of the Palestinian people’s right to establishtheir own independent State and in its respecting thePalestinians’ sovereignty over their territory.Today’s world is characterized by rapidtransformations that  taken as a whole  are the naturallabour pains that precede the birth of a new realityreflecting humankind’s yearning for a more just andprosperous world. The current reality and nature ofinternational relations differ from those of the 1990s;in fact  they differ to some extent from the prevailingsituation only two months ago  to be precise  prior tothe tragic and bloody events of September. Theseevents diverted attention from globalization issues  thefurthering of the democratic process and the diffusionof human rights to an endeavour to confront andeliminate terrorism. Everyone is aware that theexigencies of combating and eradicating terrorismdemand adherence to democratic decision-makingmethods. Decisions must be adopted on the basis ofagreement and participation  exactly as is required atthe national level.The logic of force has unquestionably become anoutdated logic  which can in no way lead to theestablishment of sound international relations or ensurelasting solutions to the problems that inevitably arisefrom time to time in inter-State relations. The Republicof Yemen has striven tirelessly to ensure the bestmeans of achieving peace and stability at the regionaland world levels  and has adhered to the course ofresolving disputes by peaceful means and by acceptingand adhering to the principle of good-neighbourliness.On this basis  our political leadership  representedby President Ali Abdullah Saleh  has made continuousand unremitting efforts to help end the strife betweenthe warring factions in fraternal Somalia. It hastened towelcome the outcome of the Arta Peace Conferenceand was among the first to support the provisionalnational Government  under the leadership of PresidentSalad Hassan  as a legitimate entity representingSomali national consensus.The ordeal that our Somali brothers areexperiencing  both inside and outside the country confronts the international community with itsresponsibility to provide aid and support to theprovisional Government and to increase assistance tothe Somali refugees in neighbouring countries including our own. Our country has opened its arms tosome 150 000 of our Somali brothers  despite thedifficult economic circumstances it is currentlyexperiencing.Recent events have proved beyond doubt thatthere is an urgent need to amend the rules ofinternational relations so as to ensure consensus indecision-making and collective participation in effortsto confront the growing challenges and dangers thatface us all and that are not confined within the bordersof any one State. That naturally makes it imperative toreconsider the policy of imposing internationalembargoes and sanctions that do not represent thecollective will nor the required agreements  while thefacts affirm their harmfulness and futility.The sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people andthe suffering of that people are a burden on the humanconscience  and their continuation raises an increasingnumber of questions about the truth of the aims behindthe insistence on their maintenance  now that thejustifications for the decision to impose those sanctionsno longer exist: Iraq has committed itself toimplementing the United Nations resolutionsguaranteeing Kuwait’s security and sovereignty over itsterritory. My country has used its good offices withfraternal Kuwait and Iraq and continues to do so  witha view to finding a solution to the issue of Kuwaiti andother prisoners and missing persons  and cooperating inthe settlement of this distressing issue. Here  we wouldlike to express our happiness at the decision taken bythe Security Council to lift the sanctions imposed onSudan.At a time when fraternal Libya and certain otherStates are still suffering from unjust embargo policies there is an urgent need to reconsider those embargoresolutions that have become obsolete and have beenovertaken by events.One cause for optimism is the desire shown byboth the United Arab Emirates and Iran  and thecurrent contacts between them  to find a solution to theissue of the three islands of the Emirates in the ArabianGulf. Yemen welcomes this move by the two fraternalStates while wishing to affirm that direct talks orinternational arbitration are the option that will30preserve the security of the region and strengthenrelations between the two countries.Developing countries are still experiencingextremely difficult economic and social conditions  andthe financial sources for national developmentinvestment are almost non-existent  since external debtand debt servicing consume most national developmentearnings. This is evident in the least developedcountries  a group to which the Republic of Yemenbelongs. In this context  we deem it essential to striveto implement the recommendations of the Third UnitedNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries.The Republic of Yemen wishes to participate inthe preparatory meetings for the InternationalConference on Financing for Development  to be heldnext year in Mexico  as it is an international gatheringthat will address  inter alia  issues related to themobilization of the financial resources necessary forcomprehensive development activities. These includecommitment to pay official development assistancepledges  considering the development of ways toincrease the domestic resources necessary fordevelopment activities and increasing donor assistance particularly to national plans aimed at eliminatingpoverty in all its dimensions.The Government of the Republic of Yemen isfollowing a comprehensive development approachunder extremely difficult economic circumstances.Large sums are allocated in the national budget forbuilding the infrastructure  and particular importance isgiven to multidimensional programmes for theelimination of poverty. An effort is being made toensure the participation of the various segments of civilsociety in the process of decision-making fordevelopment activities.Seeking integration into the global economy  thecompetent authorities in Yemen are endeavouring tofulfil the requirements for joining the World TradeOrganization. In this context  the Government hasadopted a number of measures related to economicreforms and to finding new markets. However  in thatregard there are obstacles facing the Republic ofYemen  as is the case with other least developedcountries seeking market integration. An effort must bemade to remove these obstacles by allowing access toworld markets for Yemen’s products and by affording itan opportunity to acquire the technology needed fordevelopment  particularly communications andinformation technology.The process of globalization  which in its currentform has some positive elements  should give dueconsideration to human needs and not be confined tomarket interests. Inter-State relations characterized byjustice and shared responsibility  as envisioned lastyear in the Millennium Declaration  should prevail.With regard to bilateral economic cooperation my country’s delegation would like to express itsthanks and appreciation for the contributions offriendly States — in particular Germany  theNetherlands and Japan - that are providing assistance todevelopment plans and programmes in the Republic ofYemen.The most important trend in the world today isunquestionably the increasing move towardsdemocracy as a necessary requirement for theachievement of equity  justice and social peace. In theRepublic of Yemen  the democratic process has been abasis for guaranteeing the unity achieved on 22 May1990 and has been organically linked to that unity.In spite of the short time since its achievement ofunity and its proclamation of commitment to thedemocratic process  my country has made major stridestowards the achievement of political pluralism  thepeaceful transfer of power and the guaranteeing ofhuman rights  especially with regard to theparticipation of women in the comprehensivedevelopment process. The most recent of theseachievements were the free direct elections for thepresidency of the Republic last year and the localGovernment elections early this year. Our manifestdesire to develop the democratic process led to theconvening of the Emerging Democracies Forum inSana’a last year  which was the first conference of itskind.Lastly  we would like to express our desire to hostthe next International Conference of New or RestoredDemocracies  scheduled to take place in 2003. We hopethat our request will be supported. The Conference willprovide an opportunity for participants to get to knowfirst-hand the country in the land of Sheba — a countrythat has practised consultation and democracy since thedawn of civilization.In conclusion  I hope that our meetings here willresult in the promotion of joint endeavours that fulfil31the aspirations of our peoples for a world in whichjustice triumphs over inequity and poverty and inwhich peace  rather than fear and war  prevails."
"186",7555,"YUG",56,2001,"﻿Let me begin bycongratulating Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election asPresident of the General Assembly. Your sterlingcredentials  Sir  and vast experience are a firmguarantee that our proceedings will run smoothly andbear fruit.I would also like to congratulate the UnitedNations and the Secretary-General on the Nobel PeacePrize. The award is the acknowledgement of theimportant role our Organization has in protecting worldpeace and promoting social progress and human rights as well as an acknowledgement of the successfulleadership of the Secretary-General. This honourshould be strong encouragement for all of us to puteven more effort into achieving the purposes of theUnited Nations.Let me also express our deepest sympathies to thefamilies of the victims of yesterday’s tragic planecrash.The terrorist attacks in New York and Washingtonon 11 September have affected not only the UnitedStates but all of us. Once again  we were painfullyreminded that only together  with joint efforts  can westand up to global challenges such as terrorism.Terrorism is a universal evil  a crime againsthumanity itself. It equally affects people of everyreligion  nationality and walk of life. Therefore we didnot hesitate to support fully all international actionsagainst terrorism. In that context  it is particularlyimportant to ensure the full implementation of SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) and all internationalconventions against terrorism. On behalf of the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia  I have just signed theInternational Convention for the Suppression of theFinancing of Terrorism. Yugoslavia has also taken aseries of domestic measures to combat terrorism andhas coordinated its actions with other States.Having been confronted with terrorism for quitesome time itself  Yugoslavia is well aware of howdifficult it is to fight this evil. It is not enough toprevent terrorist attacks and to capture and punish theperpetrators. It is even more important to deal with thesocial causes of terrorism  in particular  to addressissues of poverty and the lack of opportunity. It is alsovital to strengthen democracy and respect for humanrights everywhere in the world. Poverty breeds anger and if not channelled into democratic politicalprocesses  anger can easily fuel extremism.In this regard  the experience of Yugoslavia indealing with terrorism in southern Serbia has shownthat it is not sufficient to combat terrorism solely withsecurity forces. We have therefore developed acomprehensive plan which  in addition to securitymeasures  also aims at improving the economicsituation in southern Serbia and reintegrating ethnicAlbanians into the political process and Statestructures  especially at the local level. We areimplementing this plan in cooperation with a number ofinternational organizations  and this joint effort hasproven to be successful. At this very moment  we aresuccessfully training a multi-ethnic police force as animportant confidence-building measure.All this would not be possible without the victoryof democratic forces in Yugoslavia last year. Thisdemocratic revolution showed the strong will of theYugoslav people to live in a democratic society basedon the rule of law  with full respect for human andminority rights and a sustainable market economy. Italso showed their desire to live better lives in a moreprosperous society  in peace with their neighbours and36as a part of the European family of nations. In order toachieve these goals  Yugoslavia has started a process ofcomprehensive political and economic reforms over thelast year.At the same time  we have to deal with severalpressing issues which are of crucial importance for thecountry. Foremost among these issues is the situationin Kosovo and Metohija  southern Serbia and theredefinition of the Yugoslav Federation  as well ascooperation with the International Criminal Tribunalestablished by the Security Council for the war crimescommitted in the former Yugoslavia. However  thesequestions do not concern Yugoslavia alone; they arealso of vital political importance for the entire regionof South-East Europe. My Government has approachedall of them in a constructive way and with a desire tofind political solutions through dialogue in ademocratic environment.Today  all countries in South-East Europe havedemocratically elected Governments  and all arestriving to join European and Euro-Atlantic structures.At the same time  our region is still burdened with thelegacy of the past 10 years and a number ofoutstanding issues  the main issue of which is theposition of national minorities. The problems of theregion are interrelated and must therefore be addressedby broad regional action and with the help of theinternational community. The solutions to be achievedshould enjoy region-wide support.I believe that the precondition for dealing withthe problems in the region is to fully respect theterritorial integrity and sovereignty of all countries. Itmust be clearly said that the era of disintegration in theBalkans has come to an end. This will enable us toaddress the main problem of South-Eastern Europe —the status of national minorities — with fewerreservations and much more openness. Solving theminority issues  together with more economiccooperation and new confidence-building measures  isthe way to achieve lasting stability and prosperity inthe region. Such an approach will be fully in concertwith the wishes of all countries in the region  includingYugoslavia  to join the European integration processes.In that context  Yugoslavia supports the process ofstabilization and association  inaugurated by theEuropean Union at the Zagreb Summit last year  aswell as other regional initiatives.Kosovo and Metohija is the most pressing andimmediate preoccupation of my Government. TheGovernment of the Federal Republic of Yugoslaviafully complies with Security Council resolution 1244(1999). This is also what we rightly expect from othersparticipating in its implementation and  in particular neighbouring States.Unfortunately  we are not satisfied with thesituation in the field. There is no security for non-Albanians in Kosovo and Metohija; the return ofexpelled and displaced persons is difficult and slow and there is no progress with respect to the issue ofmissing persons. Nonetheless  we signed the CommonDocument with the United Nations InterimAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)  whichshould provide for comprehensive cooperation in theimplementation of Security Council resolution 1244(1999). This enabled the President of the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia and the Federal and SerbianRepublican Governments to call on the Serbs ofKosovo and Metohija to take part in the elections. Theydid so fully convinced that participation in theelections is in the Serbs’ best interest and thatcooperation with the international community particularly with UNMIK and KFOR  is the key to thesolution of the situation in Kosovo and Metohija.The elections to be held in Kosovo and Metohijaon 17 November are important indeed; yet  it is onlyafter the elections that I expect we will start even moreextensive cooperation. This cooperation should beaimed at implementing Security Council resolution1244 (1999) fully and at establishing democracy andpromoting human rights in Kosovo and Metohija  withfull respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrityof the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In thatconnection  my delegation welcomes the presidentialstatements issued by the Security Council on 5 Octoberand 9 November 2001.I take this opportunity to affirm the support of theFederal Republic of Yugoslavia for the efforts of theUnited Nations  particularly those of the Secretary-General  aimed at strengthening the role and place ofthe world Organization in present-day internationalrelations.Recalling the conclusions of the MillenniumAssembly  we expect that the General Assembly  themain organ of the United Nations  will function moreeffectively. At the same time  the Organization should37be more efficient in order to address the challengesbefore us. The Security Council should adapt itself tothe new relations in the international community.We attach special significance to the internationalrule of law. It is of particular importance that allinternational crimes be punished before national andinternational courts. In that context  we firmly believethat the International Criminal Court should start itswork as soon as possible. This is why my country hasalready ratified the Statute of Rome that establishes theCourt.In conclusion  I would like to stress that gravechallenges are before us. We have to take concertedaction to deal with them. We have to be wise in how weact because that will determine the outlook of theinternational system for many years to come."
"187",7583,"ZAF",56,2001,"﻿Please accept mycongratulations  Mr. President  on your assumption ofthe stewardship of this important Assembly.11We also wish to congratulate your predecessor Mr. Harri Holkeri  for the skilful manner in which heguided the work of the Millennium Assembly of theUnited Nations.Allow me also to salute the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  on being elected to a second term and together with the United Nations  being awarded theNobel Peace Prize for 2001. This is because of thetireless work of both the Secretary-General and theUnited Nations to realize the ideal that we all cherish: aworld in which all people can live in peace  security freedom  equality and justice.As has already been noted and as we all know this general debate has begun later than usual. Thereason for this is that two months ago  the forces ofterror struck at this city  New York — the Headquartersof this Organization — and Washington  D.C.  thecapital city of the United States of America.It is proper that we take advantage of thisoccasion once more to convey our condolences anddeepest sympathy to the people and the Government ofthe United States for the immense loss of life andproperty imposed on them through a callous act ofmurder. We extend the same sympathy to all otherpeoples who lost citizens as a result of the colossaloutrage of 11 September. We speak here about theterrible tragedy of 11 September on behalf of ourGovernment and the people of South Africa. We speakalso on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and theCommonwealth.There can be no doubt but that the peoples of theworld have to unite in action to defeat terrorism. Therecan be no hesitation among any of us in the resolve towork together to ensure that those responsible for theheinous actions of September 11 are brought to justice.This is so not only because many nations losttheir citizens on that terrible day  important as that is. Itis so  because terrorism has demonstrated that it has norespect for borders. It has shown in a very graphic tragic and painful manner  as it did also in Kenya andTanzania  that our very humanity renders all of us without exception  potential targets of cold-bloodedmurder.Where we might have used the concept of aglobal village loosely in the past  on 11 Septemberterrorism taught us the abiding lesson that we doindeed belong to a global village. None within thisvillage will be safe unless all the villagers act togetherto secure and guarantee that safety. All must act topromote the safety and security of one and all  on thebasis of a shared responsibility born of a shared danger.Accordingly  we have no choice but to gettogether in the village square to agree on the threat thatconfronts us. Together  in that village square  we haveto determine what we do about this commonly definedthreat. This is the ineluctable conclusion we must drawfrom the terrorist attacks of 11 September.To guarantee world peace and security in the lightof the threat posed by terrorism requires that thisOrganization  the United Nations  must discharge itsresponsibility to unite the peoples of the world to adoptan international convention against terrorism.Necessarily  all of us must experience a sharedsense of ownership of this convention  preciselybecause it would not be merely a statement ofprinciples  but a set of injunctions and prescriptionsthat will be binding on all of us as States. Thus shouldeach one of us be ready to integrate our respectivesovereignties within a global human sovereignty defined and governed by all of us  with none treated assuperior or inferior.The challenge to unite the peoples of the world tofight the common threat of terrorism brings to the forethe need to speed up the transformation of the UnitedNations so that it is able to respond to the globalchallenges we face together  in an equitable manner.This means that it needs to be efficient  effective andresponsive to the needs of humanity as a whole.11 September emphasized the point that  even asthe democratic system of government is beingconsolidated throughout the world  even as we all workto sustain the possibility of a serious and meaningfulglobal dialogue  there are some who are prepared toresort to force in pursuit of their goals. Clearly  theremust be a response. But what should that response be?Immediately  it is correct that we must achieveglobal security cooperation so that the perpetrators ofthe 11 September acts of terrorism are apprehended andpunished. Correctly  the Government of the UnitedStates has emphasized that all action that is carried outmust be clearly targeted against the terrorists. It hasstated that such actions  including military actions should not degenerate into collective punishmentagainst any people on any grounds whatsoever 12including those of religion  race or ethnicity.Accordingly  it is indeed necessary that humanitarianassistance be extended to the people of Afghanistan.We fully agree with that approach. The United StatesGovernment has also said that these actions should beof the shortest duration possible  consistent with theobjective that must be achieved. Again  we agree withthis without reservation.The call has gone out that all Governments andcountries should contribute whatever they can to ensurethat the common efforts to find and punish theterrorists responsible for 11 September are met withtheir just results. We have responded positively to thiscall because it is timely  correct and just.All these are important elements of what has tobe done to respond to those who committed the massmurders of 11 September. But they also indicate theway forward as we consider the rules that should guideus as we confront the threat of terrorism over thelonger term and beyond the critically importantoperations and activities focused on the events of 11September. They put the matter firmly on our commonagenda: We must also achieve global cooperation forthe speedy resolution of conflict situations everywherein the world.In this regard  it is clear that the situation in theMiddle East cries out for an urgent and lasting solution.In this context  we might recall the words of the Irishpoet  William Butler Yeats  when he said “too long asacrifice can make a stone of the heart”. The sacrificeof the Palestinian people should not be allowed to dragon any longer. Whatever these long-suffering peoplemight themselves think and feel  it is clear that thereare some in the world who will justify their destructiverage by claiming to be front-line fighters for thelegitimate rights of the Palestinian people.Beyond this  we must act together to determinethe issues that drive people to resort to force and agreeon what we should do to eliminate those issues. At thesame time  we must make the point patently clear thatsuch determination does not in any way constitute anattempt to justify terrorism. Together  we must take thefirm position that no circumstances whatsoever canever justify resort to terrorism.The need to realize together the goal ofdetermining the matters that make for peace once againunderlines the need for properly representativeinternational institutions to build the necessary globalconsensus. It would seem obvious that the fundamentalsource of conflict in the world today is the socio-economic deprivation of billions of people across theglobe  coexisting side by side with islands of enormouswealth and prosperity within and among countries. Thisnecessarily breeds a deep sense of injustice  socialalienation and despair and a willingness to sacrificetheir lives among those who feel they have nothing tolose and everything to gain  regardless of the form ofaction to which they resort.As the Durban World Conference concluded racism  racial discrimination  xenophobia and relatedintolerance remain a critical part of the practices thatserve to alienate billions of people and contribute tomutual antagonisms among human beings. Theinternational community should spare no effort toensure that this affront to human dignity is totallyeradicated.Last year  we convened in this very Hall in thehistoric Millennium Summit. Solemnly  and withserious intent  we adopted the Millennium Declaration.The heavy and urgent obligation we now face is toimplement the programme of action spelt out in thatDeclaration. This constitutes and must constitute thedecisive front of struggle against terrorism.Africa  for its part  has developed a NewPartnership for Africa’s Development  which is aproduct of the consciousness among the African peoplethat they themselves hold the key to the continent’sdevelopment  security and stability. Africans across thecontinent have arrived at the correct determination thathuman rights  democracy  peace  stability and justiceare the fundamental building blocks for a prosperouscontinent. Concomitantly  African countries are takingmeasures  jointly and severally  to improve theconditions for much-needed investment  economicrenewal and development. Naturally  the UnitedNations has a pivotal role to play in this regard.As we meet here  members of the World TradeOrganization are engaged in critical negotiations inDoha  Qatar  hopefully to agree to a new equitabletrading relationship that is fair and just. It is imperativethat there be a non-discriminatory and equitable tradingsystem that promotes sustainable development.Soon  ministers of health  the World HealthOrganization and others concerned will be finalizingthe details relating to the global health fund to deal13with the major communicable diseases  includingmalaria  tuberculosis and AIDS.The International Conference on Financing forDevelopment  to be held next March in Mexico  willcover a range of pertinent issues  such as debt relief official development assistance and foreign directinvestment. As we all know  substantial capital flowsinto the developing countries are critical in the struggleto defeat poverty and underdevelopment.All these constitute vital component parts of whatmust inform the outcome of the Johannesburg WorldSummit on Sustainable Development in Septembernext year. We are confident that the Summit will reachpositive conclusions that will include firm global regional and national commitments to the elaboration integration and implementation of economicallyefficient  socially responsible and environmentallysound development policies.There is no doubt that our global village has theresources and capacity to meet the needs of all itscitizens. What is needed is the collective will of theinternational community to act decisively to meet thischallenge  inspired by a sense of human solidarity.Peace and security for all  freedom and democracy forall  prosperity for all and genuine equality in conditionsof diversity must surely be the outcomes towards whichthe United Nations and all of us must strive. Ouractions must affirm the seriousness of our intent."
"188",7625,"ZMB",56,2001,"﻿Let me begin bycongratulating you  Mr. President  on your election asPresident of this fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly. My delegation pledges its support andcooperation to you and your country as you dischargeyour important responsibilities.I also wish to take this opportunity to pay tributeto your predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland President of the fifty-fifth session. We are grateful tohim for the able and successful manner in which hepresided over the session.I wish to salute the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  on his re-election to the helm of the UnitedNations  which is an attestation of the commitment andthe dynamism with which he has guided theOrganization during this period of great challenge.I am addressing this session in my dual capacityas President of the Republic of Zambia and currentChairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).This occasion holds a special significance to me as Imake my last statement to the General Assembly asPresident of the Republic of Zambia  having almostcome to the end of my second and last tenure of officeof my country.This year the general debate of the GeneralAssembly is taking place in November instead of twomonths ago  because of the tragic events of 11September. Those developments united us on the needto postpone this session  just as we were united in ourresolve to fight international terrorism  which knowsno boundaries. Indeed  today more than ever before the entire world seems more conscious of  and grippedby  the evil of international terrorism and theconsequent loss of life and destruction of property.Terrorism is an affront to humanity. It is aheinous and cowardly act that is hated almost as muchas we hated apartheid or any form of racism. It is forthese reasons that Africa has for a long time beenfighting international terrorism. In Algiers  Algeria  in1999  we  as African leaders  took a mammoth decisionby adopting a Convention on the prevention andcombating of all forms of terrorism. Although theConvention has not entered into force  Africa has sincethen been seeking international support in the adoptionof appropriate strategies for the effective eradication ofthe multiple root causes of terrorism. We remainresolute and resolutely committed to  and united in  thepursuit of this goal.However  let me also hasten to add that  in spiteof its gravity and magnitude  the threat of terrorismmust not override or deduct from the appropriate focuson the outstanding matters on the global agenda.Burning issues such as the scourge of conflicts  povertyeradication  the debt problem and the HIV/AIDSpandemic  among other things  should continue to beaccorded the necessary attention they so much deserve.While many good things and positivedevelopments have been taking place on the Africancontinent  these are  nevertheless  largelyovershadowed by the many conflicts that continue torage in a number of our countries. We have witnessedconflict in the Mano River basin involving Sierra15Leone  Liberia and Guinea; the situations in Sudan andSomalia are yet to be settled; disturbances recentlyerupted in the Comoros; and violence continues tothreaten the constitutionally elected Government in theCentral African Republic. The Great Lakes regionremains a tinderbox  while the conflict in Angola hasexperienced no movement towards resolution for quitesome time now. Meanwhile  the ceasefire agreement inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo is yet to be fullyimplemented.Africa does not lack the political will or resolveto find solutions to these conflicts. Neither has Africasat back and waited for the outside world to come andresolve these conflicts. Instead  Africa hasacknowledged responsibility for these conflicts and hasspearheaded efforts to bring peace wherever there havebeen conflicts.It was Africa  through the efforts of PresidentAbdelaziz Bouteflika  that brought about an end to theEthiopia-Eritrea conflict. The guns were silenced inLiberia and Sierra Leone  thanks to the efforts of theleaders of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS)  who are still leading the effort tobring peace to the Mano River basin. The leaders of theIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)have continued to seek peaceful settlements in Sudanand Somalia  while the Lusaka peace processes haveaddressed the conflicts in Angola and the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo. Most recently  a TransitionalGovernment of National Unity was inaugurated inBurundi on 1 November 2001  as a culmination ofefforts started by the late Mwalimu Julius Nyerere andcompleted by Nelson Mandela  two of Africa’s mostdistinguished sons.It is clear from the foregoing that what Africaneeds to successfully resolve the conflicts on thecontinent is the moral  practical and financial supportof the international community. Africa has alwaysbelieved in the dictum that in unity there is strength.We believe that all nations belong to a common globalcommunity with a shared destiny and sharedresponsibilities.To this end  Africa has always been ready andwilling to participate in efforts to restore peace wherepeace has broken down  irrespective of the location ofthe region. Our men and women have served aspeacekeepers in Europe  in Asia and in the Middle Eastbecause we believe that peace is indivisible.Africa therefore expects that  just as we are readyand willing to serve in the promotion and defence ofpeace everywhere  so  too  should the internationalcommunity be willing to be full partners in the searchfor peace in Africa.In this regard  I cannot help but register ourdisappointment that after the painstaking efforts by SirKetumile Masire to organize the inter-Congolesenational dialogue in Addis Ababa on 15 October 2001 and notwithstanding the many pledges made to financeit  the dialogue could not take off due partly toinsufficient funds. I would therefore like to appeal tothe international community  through the Assembly  toprovide the necessary assistance to Sir KetumileMasire  the facilitator of the inter-Congolese dialogue to enable him to proceed with organizing the dialogueand to conclude the peace process in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo. In particular  I wish to make aspecial appeal to all those who have made pledges tothe facilitator to release these pledges urgently.Conflicts do not stand alone or develop in avacuum. Political conflicts and social tension are aresult of imbalances in the dispensation of politicalpower  economic wealth and benefits  as well as ofsocial suppression  segregation and the repression ofone or more groups of people on the basis of race ethnicity or even religion. The African continent  withbarely 40 years of independence  has suffered centuriesof fractured development  deprivation of resources andthe political and social suppression of its people. Theseare the conditions at the centre of Africa’s currentstruggle to redress both the political and economicimbalances.The United Nations World Conference againstRacism  held in South Africa this year  took a majorhistorical step by refocusing on that human injustice ofthe past  whose consequences continue to ravage oursocieties to this day. The Conference condemned theslave trade  slavery  colonialism and apartheid ascrimes against humanity. The condemnation of pastinjustices should be made on the premise that we nowhave the will  the resolve and the commitment toembark upon the process of healing  reconciliation andredress. Our final objective is to bring about justice political liberation  economic development and a fairsocial system that will promote the human rights ofindividuals  the national sovereignty of States andmutually beneficial regional and globalinterdependence and cooperation.16The African economic and social condition hasbeen on the agenda of the United Nations sinceAfrica’s decade of independence. Slavery  colonialismand apartheid  and now pervasive poverty  misery andsqualor for the majority of our people continue toravage the continent with negative consequences forhuman life. The advent of HIV/AIDS  coupled withcenturies-old diseases such as malaria and tuberculosisand with many other communicable yet curablediseases such as cholera  dysentery and diarrhoea  hasreduced African life expectancy from 68 years to 50years  and in some countries to only a pathetic 38years. The mortality rate for children under the age of 5years is 140 per 1 000 births on the average. Suchadverse social conditions cannot be at all conducive toeconomic development and improvement in thestandard of living. These conditions have to be changedfor the better.The development process of post-colonial orindependent Africa has also accumulated debt andsuffered negative terms of trade for its raw materialsand products exported to the developed countries. Onthe one hand  the resulting huge trade deficits ofAfrican nations reduce their purchasing power for thetechnology  equipment and investment capital theyneed for economic growth and development. On theother hand  the deficit increases the foreign debt andshrinks public investment programmes forinfrastructure and education and health deliverysystems  thereby further suppressing the veryconditions necessary for development and theeradication of poverty.Africa is not asking for charity! No. What Africais asking for is more accessible conditions for its rawmaterials and products  and for prices that are fair andconducive to development. We are not asking forcharity. No. We are asking for more African countriesto have access to the enhanced Heavily Indebted PoorCountries Initiative (HIPC)  so that they could use thefreed resources to build infrastructure such as schools combat diseases  provide safe drinking water andinvest in income-generating community activitiesbecause  eventually  these are the measures which willreduce poverty. We further call on the internationalcommunity to intensify and accelerate initiatives thatshould bring debt cancellation to the poor countries.There cannot be a credible solution to the problem ofpoverty in Africa without debt cancellation.The continent of Africa has accepted and fullyshares the responsibilities that come with globalization.As a developing continent  we need to continue toreorganize ourselves to face the challenges of the time.The thirty-seventh session of the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) Assembly of Heads of State andGovernment  held in Lusaka  Zambia  last July  tookAfrica to a new historical stage when it launched theAfrican Union (AU). The AU will elevate Africa’sintegration agenda by forging a more cohesive politicalunion  while also creating an economic community ofnations. The Union also seeks to promote new levels ofpartnerships with the international community particularly in the areas of sustainable economicgrowth and development and of peace and security. Atthe Lusaka Summit  the OAU also adopted a neweconomic-centred recovery programme and povertyreduction strategy called the New African Initiative which is now called the New Partnership for AfricanDevelopment.I wish to take this opportunity to express Africa’sappreciation to the Group of 8 which  at its meeting inGenoa  Italy  in July  endorsed the African initiative. Ialso wish to thank the European Union  which  duringour meeting last month in Brussels  pledged its fullsupport of the initiative. It is important to note also thatAfrica has been an active participant in global tradeliberalization initiatives. We thank the Government ofthe United States for the practical step it has takenthrough the African Growth and Opportunity Act. It isa pioneering example in expanding trade and exportopportunities for Africa and for development.Debt relief  debt cancellation  increasedproduction  accessibility to export markets  betterterms of trade and economic integration — these markthe way forward to African development  sustainablegrowth and poverty reduction. Under economic growthand improved social conditions  democracy and goodgovernance will be sustained and conflicts reduced andmanaged  while peace and security will last.The time has come for me to thank the people ofZambia for having given me the privilege and honourof serving in the distinguished capacity of President ofthe Republic of Zambia  to thank my colleagues inAfrica for entrusting me with the chairmanship of theOAU and for their confidence and support and to thankall of you in the international community. I have triedmy best during my tenure of office and can thereforeonly hope that I have lived and performed up to your17expectations. Soon Zambia will have a new president.It is my hope that he will be accorded the same supportand cooperation you have so kindly given to me in thelast ten years."
"189",7661,"ZWE",56,2001,"﻿My delegationcongratulates Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixthsession. His election to that office is a demonstration ofthe confidence and trust that the internationalcommunity has placed in him to steer it through thechallenges of our time. It is our fervent hope that through his leadership  this Assembly will translate theMillennium Declaration into reality.I would also like to take this opportunity to thankhis predecessor  Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland  for thesterling work accomplished during the past session ofthe Assembly.Today  I am privileged to join others incongratulating Mr. Kofi Annan for his re-election asUnited Nations Secretary-General for a second term.Mr. Annan’s re-election is indeed both a testimony toand recognition of his unique and rare abilities to giveleadership  vision and unity of purpose to theinternational community in meeting the challenges thatface us today. This recognition has been amplydemonstrated by the conferment of the prestigiousNobel Peace Prize on the person of the Secretary-General and on the United Nations. I congratulate bothMr. Annan and the United Nations.The Secretary-General enters the elite corps ofNobel laureates at a time of most serious challenge tointernational solidarity and cooperation  as we reflecton the events of 11 September  when the people of theUnited States of America  and indeed the whole world were plunged into unprecedented sorrow in the wake ofthe heinous terrorist attacks here in New York and inWashington. This is indisputably the most brutal act ofterrorism in this new millennium. Our hearts go out tothe families who lost their loved ones  and indeed allthe people and the Government of the United States. Itis our duty as Members of this world body  whichstands for global harmony  peace and security  to say“Never again” to such vileness. Zimbabwe lost two ofits nationals in those tragic attacks.As the people of the United States grapple withthe threat posed by biological weapons of massdestruction in the form of anthrax  we in Zimbabwe who have hitherto been the greatest victims of thisweapon  know what it means and what they are going35through. For during our own liberation struggle anthrax was used as a weapon of mass destruction bythe racist regime of Ian Smith. The anthrax wasdeveloped by the apartheid regime in South Africaunder the guidance of Dr. Basson  better known as “Dr.Death”  who then supplied it to Ian Smith. ManyZimbabweans perished both before and afterindependence. The anthrax spores that were spread bythe racist regime of Ian Smith during our liberationstruggle more than 20 years ago continue to claimvictims exclusively within the black population of ourcountry to this day. More people and cattle have died ofanthrax this year in Zimbabwe than elsewhere in theworld. Thus not only are we vehemently opposed tothis evil scourge and other forms of terrorism  but wealso know the pain and loss associated with it.In my address to the General Assembly at lastyear’s session  I dwelt at length on the situation in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Since that time some progress has been made in implementing theceasefire agreement in that country. All those involvedin the process — the signatories to the ceasefireagreement and the United Nations Security Council —are agreed that conditions are favourable for thedeployment of United Nations peacekeepers underphase III of the deployment of the United NationsOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo (MONUC). As a matter of fact  justyesterday  the Security Council adopted resolution1376 (2001)  supporting the launching of phase IIIdeployment of MONUC. Nevertheless  the SecurityCouncil  by adopting what it calls a step-by-stepapproach  continues to show excessive caution orhesitancy  almost indistinguishable from lack ofcommitment or confidence  in the peace process in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. This is the majorthreat to that peace process today.I wish to renew our appeal to the SecurityCouncil to more strongly and convincingly demonstrateits support for peace in the Democratic Republic of theCongo by providing adequate human  financial andother resources. In this context  we note that as of 30September 2001  unpaid assessed contributions forMONUC to the Democratic Republic of the Congospecial account amounted to $246.9 million. Inaddition  the trust fund established by the Secretary-General in October 1999 to support the peace processin the Democratic Republic of the Congo had  twoyears later  received only the paltry sum of $1.1million.The serious matter of inadequate resources wasone of the major factors that contributed to thecurtailment  both in number of participants and induration  of the inter-Congolese dialogue in AddisAbaba last month. We welcome and appreciate SouthAfrica’s offer to host the next session of the nationaldialogue and meet some of the related expenses. Wehasten to add  however  that South Africa must not beburdened and abandoned because of this generosity andwillingness to contribute to the peacemaking efforts.We all must play our part in restoring peace andstability to the Democratic Republic of the Congo  andindeed to the Great Lakes region.The continued unnecessary suffering and loss oflife among the civilians in Angola are indefensible.Through the Sanctions Committee and other measures we have determined that UNITA must be denied anddeprived of the resources and means to continue towage war against the Angolan people. It is time that weensure that those sanctions are indeed effective by notonly respecting that sanctions regime ourselves  butalso exposing those who continue to aid and abetUNITA in its deadly activities.The situation in the Middle East demands urgentaction and resolution on the basis of the long-standingSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973). The question of a Palestinian State brooks nodelay. Israel must bite the bullet and accept that until aPalestinian State becomes a reality  there can never belasting peace in the Middle East.I must express our concern over the lack ofprogress in the area of reforming the Security Councilto make it more democratic and fully representative ofthe aspirations of a large section of the internationalcommunity which has had a limited voice for far toolong. It is our considered view that conflict resolutionaround the globe could be enhanced by a reformed andmore representative Security Council.On the eve of the Doha meeting  my delegationwould like to stress that necessary measures must betaken to strengthen the ability of developing countriesto be integrated in a beneficial way into the globalsystem. The human and institutional capacities ofdeveloping countries must be strengthened  and moreemphasis must be placed on enhancing the role of tradeand development  with better access provided for goods36and services from developing countries. Currently  weare experiencing a situation in which developingcountries in general  and African  Caribbean andPacific countries in particular  seem to lose through theWorld Trade Organization arrangement the little thatthey had gained  even from previous protocols.One of the most enduring features of the presentand of the latter part of the last century has been thepersistence of the colonial legacy in many developingcountries. That legacy has been evident in relationsbetween and within States. We need not recall muchmore evidence of the persistence of this phenomenonthan the proceedings of the World Conference againstRacism  Racial Discrimination  Xenophobia andRelated Intolerance  held in Durban  South Africa barely two months ago.The continued refusal on the part of some formercolonial Powers to acknowledge the devastating effectsthat colonialism has had  and continues to have  on theeconomic development of most of the former colonieshas also been much in evidence. It is no accident that itis those former colonies that today occupy the lowerrungs of the development totem pole.In Zimbabwe  the colonial legacy is poignantlyevident in the racially skewed land-ownershipstructure  which is a direct result of racist policies andthe laws of successive colonial regimes between 1890and 1980. Over 70 per cent of the arable land — thebest of that land — is owned and utilized by less than 1per cent of the population  represented byapproximately 4 100 white farmers  most of them ofBritish descent  while nearly 13 million blackZimbabweans eke out a living from the remaining 30per cent — the worst of the arable land. Such asituation has to be corrected in the interests of equity justice  social harmony and political stability in thecountry and  indeed  in our region of southern Africa.My Government has begun a land reform andredistribution programme  which  while ensuring thatmore people are settled on acquired land  will leave thecurrent owners with only one farm each. At present some of them own 18 farms each — and an averagefarm in Zimbabwe is 2 000 hectares. Some  like theOpenheimer family  own land that is nearly the size ofBelgium — one man owns property the size ofBelgium in Zimbabwe. My Government’s land reformprogramme guarantees that none of the white farmerswill be left landless. Every existing white farmer whowants to farm is assured of getting one farm. Theprogramme is not about total alienation ordispossession  but about equitable redistribution. Whatis more generous or equitable than that?As to who should pay for compensation  wereached understandings and agreements with theformer colonial master when we negotiated ourindependence at Lancaster House in 1979. Obligationsto pay compensation were assumed by the formercolonial Power. Provided that all parties honour theirobligations  the so-called land crisis in Zimbabwe willevaporate overnight. That is the crisis in my country  towhich the spokesman of the European Union referredfrom this rostrum. Zimbabwe has policemen inKosovo  policemen in Sierra Leone and policemen inEast Timor. We are trying to bring peace to the Congo.We do not have a crisis; we have a land dispute.The lofty objectives of the United NationsCharter in the economic arena will remain unfulfilledunless all Member States join in efforts  genuinely andseriously  to redress inherited colonial imbalances thatpersist in developing countries. Social justice  politicalstability and sustainable development in Zimbabwe canbe better achieved through genuine and committedsupport for land redistribution programmes thanthrough the vilification or demonization of itsleadership and policies.It is most unfortunate that our efforts at rectifyingunsustainable colonial imbalances are seen by some asa crisis; the real crisis lies in the persistence of thatlegacy. Zimbabweans are resolved to correct thatcolonial injustice  in spite of the outcry from somequarters by people who regard the defence of thepresent injustice as their historic responsibility. It isunacceptable that a minority  whether black or white should own over 70 per cent of the best arable land inany country. That may be acceptable in some countries;in Zimbabwe  we have decided to say “No”.The HIV/AIDS pandemic has become a seriousdevelopmental issue. As the Secretary-General’s reporton the work of the Organization (A56/1) indicates  thepandemic is destroying the economic and social fabricin our countries. Zimbabwe’s infection rate among theadult population is estimated to be 30 per cent  whilehundreds of thousands of children have already beenorphaned as a result of this dreaded disease. In the lightof this  my Government and  indeed  those of otherdeveloping countries  will need all the assistance we37can get to complement our own efforts. We lookforward to having this issue be seriously addressed bythe international community.The international community should developstrategies to ensure that AIDS drugs developed bypharmaceutical companies become more affordable fordeveloping countries. Let me extend my sincere thanksto the Secretary-General for convening the specialsession on HIV/AIDS in June this year. We hope thatthe implementation of the resolutions of thatconference will go some way towards checking thespread of the disease.In conclusion  let me assure one and all thatZimbabwe will partner all international efforts towardsthe eradication of terrorism in all its forms  as well asexert all its energy in combating the pestilences thatafflict humanity  especially poverty andunderdevelopment."
